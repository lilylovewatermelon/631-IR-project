theres a boy fifteen with a gun in his hand
and the people with no audience say he should be hanged
and they ask him for his motive but they dont understand
why they love like they do like they do
theres a girl fifteen with her head in a noose
because shes damned to live well shes damned to choose
and the animals walked in twos by twos
showing love like they do like they do
theres a girl fifteen although she isnt sure
well how the hell could you want anything more
you beautiful perfect immaculate whore
im in love love with you love with you
ooh ooh

chorus
oh wont you let me finish
you drive me insane
the world will keep on turning
even if were not the same
dont come on to me come on to me

verse 2
theres a boy fifteen turning into a man
well tell me one other thing that he can
while you forced a smile through a jealous hand
showing love like you do like you do
theres a boy fifteen and hes attempted to sue
cause hes definitely sure that its true
well what kind of man kind of man are you
showing love like you do like you do

oh wont you let me finish
you drive me insane
the world will keep on turning

so tell me whats on your mind so tell me whats on your mind
and dont forget your paracetamol smile
so tell me whats on your mind so tell me whats on your mind
and dont forget your paracetamol smile
so tell me whats on your mind so tell me whats on your mind
and dont forget your paracetamol smile
so tell me whats on your mind so tell me whats on your mind
youre emotionally challenged
why do you waste your talent
the world around yous manic
do you have no shame
come on to me come on to me
