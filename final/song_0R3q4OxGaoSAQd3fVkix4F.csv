                                          grief and oblivion

    “mademoiselle albertine has gone” how much farther does anguish penetrate in psychology than psychology itself a moment ago as i lay analysing my feelings i had supposed that this separation without a final meeting was precisely what i wished and as i compared the mediocrity of the pleasures that albertine afforded me with the richness of the desires which she prevented me from realising had felt that i was being subtle had concluded that i did not wish to see her again that i no longer loved her but now these words “mademoiselle albertine has gone” had expressed themselves in my heart in the form of an anguish so keen that i would not be able to endure it for any length of time and so what i had supposed to mean nothing to me was the only thing in my whole life how ignorant we are of ourselves the first thing to be done was to make my anguish cease at once tender towards myself as my mother had been towards my dying grandmother i said to myself with that anxiety which we feel to prevent a person whom we love from suffering “be patient for just a moment we shall find something to take the pain away don’t fret we are not going to allow you to suffer like this” it was among ideas of this sort that my instinct of selfpreservation sought for the first sedatives to lay upon my open wound “all this is not of the slightest importance for i am going to make her return here at once i must think first how i am to do it but in any case she will be here this evening therefore it is useless to worry myself” “all this is not of the slightest importance” i had not been content with giving myself this assurance i had tried to convey the same impression to françoise by not allowing her to see what i was suffering because even at the moment when i was feeling so keen an anguish my love did not forget how important it was that it should appear a happy love a mutual love especially in the eyes of françoise who as she disliked albertine had always doubted her sincerity yes a moment ago before françoise came into the room i had supposed that i was no longer in love with albertine i had supposed that i was leaving nothing out of account a careful analyst i had supposed that i knew the state of my own heart but our intelligence however great it may be cannot perceive the elements that compose it and remain unsuspected so long as from the volatile state in which they generally exist a phenomenon capable of isolating them has not subjected them to the first stages of solidification i had been mistaken in thinking that i could see clearly into my own heart but this knowledge which had not been given me by the finest mental perceptions had now been brought to me hard glittering strange like a crystallised salt by the abrupt reaction of grief i was so much in the habit of seeing albertine in the room and i saw all of a sudden a fresh aspect of habit hitherto i had regarded it chiefly as an annihilating force which suppresses the originality and even our consciousness of our perceptions now i beheld it as a dread deity so riveted to ourselves its meaningless aspect so incrusted in our heart that if it detaches itself if it turns away from us this deity which we can barely distinguish inflicts upon us sufferings more terrible than any other and is then as cruel as death itself

    the first thing to be done was to read albertine’s letter since i was anxious to think of some way of making her return i felt that this lay in my power because as the future is what exists only in our mind it seems to us to be still alterable by the intervention in extremis of our will but at the same time i remembered that i had seen act upon it forces other than my own against which however long an interval had been allowed me i could never have prevailed of what use is it that the hour has not yet struck if we can do nothing to influence what is bound to happen when albertine was living in the house i had been quite determined to retain the initiative in our parting and now she had gone i opened her letter it ran as follows

   “my dear friend

    “forgive me for not having dared to say to you in so many words what i am now writing but i am such a coward i have always been so afraid in your presence that i have never been able to force myself to speak this is what i should have said to you our life together has become impossible you must for that matter have seen when you turned upon me the other evening that there had been a change in our relations what we were able to straighten out that night would become irreparable in a few days’ time it is better for us therefore since we have had the good fortune to be reconciled to part as friends that is why my darling i am sending you this line and beg you to be so kind as to forgive me if i am causing you a little grief when you think of the immensity of mine my dear old boy i do not wish to become your enemy it will be bad enough to become by degrees and very soon a stranger to you and so as i have absolutely made up my mind before sending you this letter by françoise i shall have asked her to let me have my boxes goodbye i leave with you the best part of myself

   “albertine”

    “all this means nothing” i told myself “it is even better than i thought for as she doesn’t mean a word of what she says she has obviously written her letter only to give me a severe shock so that i shall take fright and not be horrid to her again i must make some arrangement at once albertine must be brought back this evening it is sad to think that the bontemps are no better than blackmailers who make use of their niece to extort money from me but what does that matter even if to bring albertine back here this evening i have to give half my fortune to mme bontemps we shall still have enough left albertine and i to live in comfort” and at the same time i calculated whether i had time to go out that morning and order the yacht and the rollsroyce which she coveted quite forgetting now that all my hesitation had vanished that i had decided that it would be unwise to give her them “even if mme bontemps’ support is not sufficient if albertine refuses to obey her aunt and makes it a condition of her returning to me that she shall enjoy complete independence well however much it may distress me i shall leave her to herself she shall go out by herself whenever she chooses one must be prepared to make sacrifices however painful they may be for the thing to which one attaches most importance which is in spite of everything that i decided this morning on the strength of my scrupulous and absurd arguments that albertine shall continue to live here” can i say for that matter that to leave her free to go where she chose would have been altogether painful to me i should be lying often already i had felt that the anguish of leaving her free to behave improperly out of my sight was perhaps even less than that sort of misery which i used to feel when i guessed that she was bored in my company under my roof no doubt at the actual moment of her asking me to let her go somewhere the act of allowing her to go with the idea of an organised orgy would have been an appalling torment but to say to her “take our yacht or the train go away for a month to some place which i have never seen where i shall know nothing of what you are doing”— this had often appealed to me owing to the thought that by force of contrast when she was away from me she would prefer my society and would be glad to return “this return is certainly what she herself desires she does not in the least insist upon that freedom upon which moreover by offering her every day some fresh pleasure i should easily succeed in imposing day by day a further restriction no what albertine has wanted is that i shall no longer make myself unpleasant to her and most of all — like odette with swann — that i shall make up my mind to marry her once she is married her independence will cease to matter we shall stay here together in perfect happiness” no doubt this meant giving up any thought of venice but the places for which we have most longed such as venice all the more so the most agreeable hostesses such as the duchesse de guermantes amusements such as the theatre how pale insignificant dead they become when we are tied to the heart of another person by a bond so painful that it prevents us from tearing ourselves away “albertine is perfectly right for that matter about our marriage mamma herself was saying that all these postponements were ridiculous marrying her is what i ought to have done long ago it is what i shall have to do it is what has made her write her letter without meaning a word of it it is only to bring about our marriage that she has postponed for a few hours what she must desire as keenly as i desire it her return to this house yes that is what she meant that is the purpose of her action” my compassionate judgment assured me but i felt that in telling me this my judgment was still maintaining the same hypothesis which it had adopted from the start whereas i felt that it was the other hypothesis which had invariably proved correct no doubt this second hypothesis would never have been so bold as to formulate in so many words that albertine could have had intimate relations with mile vinteuil and her friend and yet when i was overwhelmed by the invasion of those terrible tidings as the train slowed down before stopping at parville station it was the second hypothesis that had already been proved correct this hypothesis had never in the interval conceived the idea that albertine might leave me of her own accord in this fashion and without warning me and giving me time to prevent her departure but all the same if after the immense leap forwards which life had just made me take the reality that confronted me was as novel as that which is presented by the discovery of a scientist the inquiries of an examining magistrate or the researches of a historian into the mystery of a crime or a revolution this reality while exceeding the meagre previsions of my second hypothesis nevertheless fulfilled them this second hypothesis was not an intellectual feat and the panic fear that i had felt on the evening when albertine had refused to kiss me the night when i had heard the sound of her window being opened that fear was not based upon reason but — and the sequel will shew this more clearly as several episodes must have indicated it already — the fact that our intellect is not the most subtle the most powerful the most appropriate instrument for grasping the truth is only a reason the more for beginning with the intellect and not with a subconscious intuition a readymade faith in presentiments it is life that little by little case by case enables us to observe that what is most important to our heart or to our mind is learned not by reasoning but by other powers and then it is the intellect itself which taking note of their superiority abdicates its sway to them upon reasoned grounds and consents to become their collaborator and their servant it is faith confirmed by experiment the unforeseen calamity with which i found myself engaged it seemed to me that i had already known it also as i had known of albertine’s friendship with a pair of lesbians from having read it in so many signs in which notwithstanding the contrary affirmations of my reason based upon albertine’s own statements i had discerned the weariness the horror that she felt at having to live in that state of slavery signs traced as though in invisible ink behind her sad submissive eyes upon her cheeks suddenly inflamed with an unaccountable blush in the sound of the window that had suddenly been flung open no doubt i had not ventured to interpret them in their full significance or to form a definite idea of her immediate departure i had thought with a mind kept in equilibrium by albertine’s presence only of a departure arranged by myself at an undetermined date that is to say a date situated in a nonexistent time consequently i had had merely the illusion of thinking of a departure just as people imagine that they are not afraid of death when they think of it while they are in good health and actually do no more than introduce a purely negative idea into a healthy state which the approach of death would automatically destroy besides the idea of albertine’s departure on her own initiative might have occurred to my mind a thousand times over in the clearest the most sharply defined form and i should no more have suspected what in relation to myself that is to say in reality that departure would be what an unprecedented appalling unknown thing how entirely novel a calamity of her departure had i foreseen it i might have gone on thinking incessantly for years on end and yet all my thoughts of it placed end to end would not have been comparable for an instant not merely in intensity but in kind with the unimaginable hell the curtain of which françoise had raised for me when she said “mademoiselle albertine has gone” in order to form an idea of an unknown situation our imagination borrows elements that are already familiar and for that reason does not form any idea of it but our sensibility even in its most physical form receives as it were the brand of the lightning the original and for long indelible imprint of the novel event and i scarcely ventured to say to myself that if i had foreseen this departure i would perhaps have been incapable of picturing it to myself in all its horror or indeed with albertine informing me of it and myself threatening imploring her of preventing it how far was any longing for venice removed from me now as far as in the old days at combray was the longing to know mme de guermantes when the time came at which i longed for one thing only to have mamma in my room and it was indeed all these anxieties that i had felt ever since my childhood which at the bidding of this new anguish had come hastening to reinforce it to amalgamate themselves with it in a homogeneous mass that was stifling me to be sure the physical blow which such a parting strikes at the heart and which because of that terrible capacity for registering things with which the body is endowed makes our suffering somehow contemporaneous with all the epochs in our life in which we have suffered to be sure this blow at the heart upon which the woman speculates a little perhaps — so little compunction do we shew for the sufferings of other people — who is anxious to give the maximum intensity to regret whether it be that merely hinting at an imaginary departure she is seeking only to demand better terms or that leaving us for ever — for ever — she desires to wound us or in order to avenge herself or to continue to be loved or to enhance the memory that she will leave behind her to rend asunder the net of weariness of indifference which she has felt being woven about her — to be sure this blow at our heart we had vowed that we would avoid it had assured ourselves that we would make a good finish but it is rarely indeed that we do finish well for if all was well we would never finish and besides the woman to whom we shew the utmost indifference feels nevertheless in an obscure fashion that while we have been growing tired of her by virtue of an identical force of habit we have grown more and more attached to her and she reflects that one of the essential elements in a good finish is to warn the other person before one goes but she is afraid if she warns us of preventing her own departure every woman feels that if her power over a man is great the only way to leave him is sudden flight a fugitive because a queen precisely to be sure there is an unspeakable interval between the boredom which she inspired a moment ago and because she has gone this furious desire to have her back again but for this apart from those which have been furnished in the course of this work and others which will be furnished later on there are reasons for one thing her departure occurs as often as not at the moment when our indifference — real or imagined — is greatest at the extreme point of the oscillation of the pendulum the woman says to herself “no this sort of thing cannot go on any longer” simply because the man speaks of nothing but leaving her or thinks of nothing else and it is she who leaves him then the pendulum swinging back to its other extreme the interval is all the greater in an instant it returns to this point once more apart from all the reasons that have been given it is so natural our heart still beats and besides the woman who has gone is no longer the same as the woman who was with us her life under our roof all too well known is suddenly enlarged by the addition of the lives with which she is inevitably to be associated and it is perhaps to associate herself with them that she has left us so that this novel richness of the life of the woman who has gone reacts upon the woman who was with us and was perhaps planning her departure to the series of psychological facts which we are able to deduce and which form part of her life with us our too evident boredom in her company our jealousy also the effect of which is that the men who have been left by a number of women have been left almost always in the same manner because of their character and of certain always identical reactions which can be calculated each man has his own way of being betrayed as he has his own way of catching cold to this series not too mysterious for us there corresponds doubtless a series of facts of which we were unaware she must for some tune past have been keeping up relations written or verbal or through messengers with some man or some woman have been awaiting some signal which we may perhaps have given her ourselves unconsciously when we said “x called yesterday to see me” if she had arranged with x that on the eve of the day when she was to join him he was to call upon me how many possible hypotheses possible only i constructed the truth so well but in the realm of possibility only that having one day opened and then by mistake a letter addressed to my mistress from this letter which was written in a code and said “go on waiting for a signal to go to the marquis de saintloup let me know tomorrow by telephone” i reconstructed a sort of projected flight the name of the marquis de saintloup was there only as a substitute for some other name for my mistress did not know saintloup well enough but had heard me speak of him and moreover the signature was some sort of nickname without any intelligible form as it happened the letter was addressed not to my mistress but to another person in the building who bore a different name which had been misread the letter was written not in code but in bad french because it was written by an american woman who was indeed a friend of saintloup as he himself told me and the odd way in which this american woman wrote certain letters had given the appearance of a nickname to a name which was quite genuine only foreign and so i had on that occasion been entirely at fault in my suspicions but the intellectual structure which had in my mind combined these facts all of them false was itself so accurate so inflexible form of the truth that when three months later my mistress who had at that time been meaning to spend the rest of her life with me left me it was in a fashion absolutely identical with that which i had imagined on the former occasion a letter arrived containing the same peculiarities which i had wrongly attributed to the former letter but this time it was indeed meant as a signal

    this calamity was the greatest that i had experienced in my life and when all was said the suffering that it caused me was perhaps even exceeded by my curiosity to learn the causes of this calamity which albertine had deliberately brought about but the sources of great events are like those of rivers in vain do we explore the earth’s surface we can never find them so albertine had for a long time past been planning lier flight i have said and at the time it had seemed to me simply a sign of affectation and ill humour what françoise called ‘lifting her head’ that from the day upon which she had ceased to kiss me she had gone about as though tormented by a devil stiffly erect unbending saying the simplest things in a sorrowful tone slow in her movements never once smiling i cannot say that there was any concrete proof of conspiracy with the outer world françoise told me long afterwards that having gone into albertine’s room two days before her departure she had found it empty the curtains drawn but had detected from the atmosphere of the room and the sounds that came in that the window was open and indeed she had found albertine on the balcony but it is hard to say with whom she could have been communicating from there and moreover the drawn curtains screening the open window could doubtless be explained by her knowing that i was afraid of draughts and by the fact that even if the curtains afforded me little protection they would prevent françoise from seeing from the passage that the shutters had been opened so early no i can see nothing save one trifling incident which proves merely that on the day before her departure she knew that she was going for during the day she took from my room without my noticing it a large quantity of wrapping paper and cloth which i kept there and in which she spent the whole night packing her innumerable wrappers and dressinggowns so that she might leave the house in the morning this was the only incident it was more than enough i cannot attach any importance to her having almost forced upon me that evening a thousand francs which she owed me there is nothing peculiar in that for she was extremely scrupulous about money yes she took the wrapping paper overnight but it was not only then that she knew that she was going to leave me for it was not resentment that made her leave me but her determination already formed to leave me to abandon the life of which she had dreamed that gave her that air of resentment a resentful air almost solemnly cold toward myself except on the last evening when after staying in my room longer than she had intended she said — a remark which surprised me coming from her who had always sought to postpone the moment of parting — she said to me from the door “goodbye my dear goodbye my dear” but i did not take any notice of this at the moment françoise told me that next morning when albertine informed her that she was going but this for that matter may be explained also by exhaustion for she had spent the whole night in packing all her clothes except the things for which she had to ask françoise as they were not in her bedroom or her dressingroom she was still so sad so much more erect so much stiffer than during the previous days that françoise when albertine said to her “goodbye françoise” almost expected to see her fall to the ground when we are told anything like this we realise that the woman who appealed to us so much less than any of the women whom we meet so easily in the course of the briefest outing the woman who makes us resent our having to sacrifice them to herself is on the contrary she whom now we would a thousand times rather possess for the choice lies no longer between a certain pleasure — which has become by force of habit and perhaps by the insignificance of its object almost nothing — and other pleasures which tempt and thrill us but between these latter pleasures and something that is far stronger than they compassion for suffering

    when i vowed to myself that albertine would be back in the house before night i had proceeded in hot haste to cover with a fresh belief the open wound from which i had torn the belief that had been my mainstay until then but however rapidly my instinct of selfpreservation might have acted i had when françoise spoke to me been left for an instant without relief and it was useless my knowing now that albertine would return that same evening the pain that i had felt in the instant in which i had not yet assured myself of her return the instant that had followed the words “mademoiselle albertine has asked for her boxes mademoiselle albertine has gone” this revived in me of its own accord as keen as it had been before that is to say as if i had still been unaware of albertine’s immediate return however it was essential that she should return but of her own accord upon every hypothesis to appear to be taking the first step to be begging her to return would be to defeat my own object to be sure i had not the strength to give her up as i had given up gilberte even more than to see albertine again what i wished was to put an end to the physical anguish which my heart less stout than of old could endure no longer then by dint of accustoming myself to not wishing anything whether it was a question of work or of anything else i had become more cowardly but above all this anguish was incomparably keener for several reasons the most important of which was perhaps not that i had never tasted any sensual pleasure with mme de guermantes or with gilberte but that not seeing them every day and at every hour of the day having no opportunity and consequently no need to see them there had been less prominent in my love for them the immense force of habit perhaps now that my heart incapable of wishing and of enduring of its own free will what i was suffering found only one possible solution that albertine should return at all costs perhaps the opposite solution a deliberate renunciation gradual resignation would have seemed to me a novelist’s solution improbable in real life had i not myself decided upon it in the past when gilberte was concerned i knew therefore that this other solution might be accepted also and by the same man for i had remained more or less the same only time had played its part time which had made me older time which moreover had kept albertine perpetually in my company while we were living together but i must add that without my giving up the idea of that life there survived in me of all that i had felt about gilberte the pride which made me refuse to be to albertine a repellent plaything by insisting upon her return i wished her to come back without my appearing to attach any importance to her return i got out of bed so as to lose no more time but was arrested by my anguish this was the first time that i had got out of bed since albertine had left me yet i must dress myself at once in order to go and make inquiries of her porter

    suffering the prolongation of a spiritual shock that has come from without keeps on endeavouring to change its form we hope to be able to dispel it by making plans by seeking information we wish it to pass through its countless metamorphoses this requires less courage than retaining our suffering intact the bed appears so narrow hard and cold on which we lie down with our grief i put my feet to the ground i stepped across the room with endless precautions took up a position from which i could not see albertine’s chair the pianola upon the pedals of which she used to press her golden slippers nor a single one of the things which she had used and all of which in the secret language that my memory had imparted to them seemed to be seeking to give me a fresh translation a different version to announce to me for the second time the news of her departure but even without looking at them i could see them my strength left me i sank down upon one of those blue satin armchairs the glossy surface of which an hour earlier in the dimness of my bedroom anaesthetised by a ray of morning light had made me dream dreams which then i had passionately caressed which were so far from me now alas i had never sat down upon any of them until this minute save when albertine was still with me and so i could not remain sitting there i rose and thus at every moment there was one more of those innumerable and humble ‘selves’ that compose our personality which was still unaware of albertine’s departure and must be informed of it i was obliged — and this was more cruel than if they had been strangers and had not borrowed my sensibility to pain — to describe to all these ‘selves’ who did not yet know of it the calamity that had just occurred it was necessary that each of them in turn should hear for the first time the words “albertine has asked for her boxes”— those coffinshaped boxes which i had seen put on the train at balbec with my mother’s —“albertine has gone” to each of them i had to relate my grief the grief which is in no way a pessimistic conclusion freely drawn from a number of lamentable circumstances but is the intermittent and involuntary revival of a specific impression come to us from without and not chosen by us there were some of these ‘selves’ which i had not encountered for a long time past for instance i had not remembered that it was the day on which the barber called the ‘self that i was when i was having my hair cut i had forgotten this ‘self’ the barber’s arrival made me burst into tears as at a funeral does the appearance of an old pensioned servant who has not forgotten the deceased then all of a sudden i recalled that during the last week i had from time to time been seized by panic fears which i had not confessed to myself at such moments however i had debated the question saying to myself “useless of course to consider the hypothesis of her suddenly leaving me it is absurd if i were to confess it to a sober intelligent man” and i should have done so to secure peace of mind had not jealousy prevented me from making confidences “he would be sure to say to me ‘why you are mad it is impossible’ and as a matter of fact during these jjast days we have not quarrelled once people separate for a reason they tell you their reason they give you a chance to reply they do not run away like that no it is perfectly childish it is the only hypothesis that is absurd” and yet every day when i found that she was still there in the morning when i fang my bell i had heaved a vast sigh of relief and when françoise handed me albertine’s letter i had at once been certain that it referred to the one thing that could not happen to this departure which i had in a sense perceived many days in advance in spite of the logical reasons for my feeling reassured i had said this to myself almost with satisfaction at my own perspicacity in my despair like a murderer who knows that his guilt cannot be detected but is nevertheless afraid and all of a sudden sees his victim’s name written at the head of a document on the table of the police official who has sent for him my only hope was that albertine had gone to touraine to her aunt’s house where after all she would be fairly well guarded and could not do anything very serious in the interval before i brought her back my worst fear was that she might be remaining in paris or have gone to amsterdam or to montjouvain in other words that she had escaped in order to involve herself in some intrigue the preliminaries of which i had failed to observe but in reality when i said to myself paris amsterdam montjouvain that is to say various names of places i was thinking of places which were merely potential and so when albertine’s hall porter informed me that she had gone to touraine this place of residence which i supposed myself to desire seemed to me the most terrible of them all because it was real and because tormented for the first time by the certainty of the present and the uncertainty of the future i pictured to myself albertine starting upon a life which she had deliberately chosen to lead apart from myself perhaps for a long time perhaps for ever and in which she would realise that unknown element which in the past had so often distressed me when nevertheless i had enjoyed the happiness of possessing of caressing what was its outer shell that charming face impenetrable and captive it was this unknown element that formed the core of my love outside the door of albertine’s house i found a poor little girl who gazed at me openeyed and looked so honest that i asked her whether she would care to come home with me as i might have taken home a dog with faithful eyes she seemed pleased by my suggestion when i got home i held her for some time on my knee but very soon her presence by making me feel too keenly albertine’s absence became intolerable and i asked her to go away giving her first a fivehundred franc note and yet a moment later the thought of having some other little girl in the house with me of never being alone without the comfort of an innocent presence was the only thing that enabled me to endure the idea that albertine might perhaps remain away for some time before returning as for albertine herself she barely existed in me save under the form of her name which but for certain rare moments of respite when i awoke came and engraved itself upon my brain and continued incessantly to do so if i had thought aloud i should have kept on repeating it and my speech would have been as monotonous as limited as if i had been transformed into a bird a bird like that in the fable whose song repeated incessantly the name of her whom when a man it had loved we say the name to ourselves and as we remain silent it seems as though we inscribed it on ourselves as though it left its trace on our brain which must end by being like a wall upon which somebody has amused himself by scribbling entirely covered with the name written a thousand times over of her whom we love we repeat it all the time in our mind even when we are happy all the more when we are unhappy and to repeat this name which gives us nothing in addition to what we already know we feel an incessantly renewed desire but in the course of time it wearies us to carnal pleasure i did not even give a thought at this moment i did not even see with my mind’s eye the image of that albertine albeit she had been the cause of such an upheaval of my existence i did not perceive her body and if i had wished to isolate the idea that was bound up — for there is always some idea bound up — with my suffering it would have been alternately on the one hand my doubt as to the intention with which she had left me with or without any thought of returning and on the other hand the means of bringing her back perhaps there is something symbolical and true in the minute place occupied in our anxiety by the person who is its cause the fact is that the person counts for little or nothing what is almost everything is the series of emotions of agonies which similar mishaps have made us feel in the past in connexion with her and which habit has attached to her what proves this clearly is even more than the boredom which we feel in moments of happiness that the fact of seeing or not seeing the person in question of being or not being admired by her of having or not having her at our disposal will seem to us utterly trivial when we shall no longer have to set ourselves the problem so superfluous that we shall no longer take the trouble to consider it save in relation to the person herself — the series of emotions and agonies being forgotten at least in so far as she is concerned for it may have developed afresh but in connexion with another person before this when it was still attached to her we supposed that our happiness was dependent upon her presence it depended merely upon the cessation of our anxiety our subconscious was therefore more clairvoyant than ourselves at that moment when it made the form of the beloved woman so minute a form which we had indeed perhaps forgotten which we might have failed to remember clearly and thought unattractive in the terrible drama in which finding her again in order to cease from expecting her becomes an absolutely vital matter minute proportions of the woman’s form a logical and necessary effect of the fashion in which love develops a clear allegory of the subjective nature of that love

    the spirit in which albertine had left me was similar no doubt to that of the nations who pave the way by a demonstration of their armed force for the exercise of their diplomacy she could not have left me save in the hope of obtaining from me better terms greater freedom more comfort in that case the one of us who would have conquered would have been myself had i had the strength to await the moment when seeing that she could gam nothing she would return of her own accord but if at cards or in war where victory alone matters we can hold out against bluff the conditions are not the same that are created by love and jealousy not to mention suffering if in order to wait to ‘hold out’ i allowed albertine to remain away from me for several days for several weeks perhaps i was ruining what had been my sole purpose for more than a year never to leave her by herself for a single hour all my precautions were rendered fruitless if i allowed her the time the opportunity to betray me as often as she might choose and if in the end she did return to me i should never again be able to forget the time when she had been alone and even if i won in the end nevertheless in the past that is to say irreparably i should be the vanquished party

    as for the means of bringing albertine back they had all the more chance of success the more plausible the hypothesis appeared that she had left me only in the hope of being summoned back upon more favourable terms and no doubt to the people who did not believe in albertine’s sincerity certainly to françoise for instance this was the more plausible hypothesis but my reason to which the only explanation of certain bouts of ill humour of certain attitudes had appeared before i knew anything to be that she had planned a final departure found it difficult to believe that now that her departure had occurred it was a mere feint i say my reason not myself the hypothesis of a feint became all the more necessary to me the more improbable it was and gained in strength what it lost in probability when we find ourselves on the brink of the abyss and it seems as though god has forsaken us we no longer hesitate to expect a miracle of him
    i realise that in all this i was the most apathetic albeit the most anxious of detectives but albertine’s flight had not restored to myself the faculties of which the habit of having her watched by other people had deprived me i could think of one thing only how to employ some one else upon the search for her this other person was saintloup who agreed the transference of the anxiety of so many days to another person filled me with joy and i quivered with the certainty of success my hands becoming suddenly dry again as in the past and no longer moist with that sweat in which françoise had bathed me when she said “mademoiselle albertine has gone”

    the reader may remember that when i decided to live with albertine and even to marry her it was in order to guard her to know what she was doing to prevent her from returning to her old habits with mlle vinteuil it had been in the appalling anguish caused by her revelation at balbec when she had told me as a thing that was quite natural and i succeeded albeit it was the greatest grief that i had ever yet felt in my life in seeming to find quite natural the thing which in my worst suppositions i had never had the audacity to imagine it is astonishing what a want of imagination jealousy which spends its time in weaving little suppositions of what is untrue shews when it is a question of discovering the truth now this love born first and foremost of a need to prevent albertine from doing wrong this love had preserved in the sequel the marks of its origin being with her mattered little to me so long as i could prevent her from “being on the run” from going to this place or to that in order to prevent her i had had recourse to the vigilance to the company of the people who went about with her and they had only to give me at the end of the day a report that was fairly reassuring for my anxieties to vanish in good humour

    having given myself the assurance that whatever steps i might have to take albertine would be back in the house that same evening i had granted a respite to the grief which françoise had caused me when she told me that albertine had gone because at that moment my mind taken by surprise had believed for an instant that her departure was final but after an interruption when with an impulse of its own independent life the initial suffering revived spontaneously in me it was just as keen as before because it was anterior to the consoling promise that i had given myself to bring albertine back that evening this utterance which would have calmed it my suffering had not heard to set in motion the means of bringing about her return once again not that such an attitude on my part would ever have proved very successful but because i had always adopted it since i had been in love with albertine i was condemned to behave as though i did not love her was not pained by her departure i was condemned to continue to lie to her i might be all the more energetic in my efforts to bring her back in that personally i should appear to have given her up for good i decided to write albertine a farewell letter in which i would regard her departure as final while i would send saintloup down to put upon mme bontemps as though without my knowledge the most brutal pressure to make albertine return as soon as possible no doubt i had had experience with gilberte of the danger of letters expressing an indifference which feigned at first ends by becoming genuine and this experience ought to have restrained me from writing to albertine letters of the same sort as those that i had written to gilberte but what we call experience is merely the revelation to our own eyes of a trait in our character which naturally reappears and reappears all the more markedly because we have already brought it into prominence once of our own accord so that the spontaneous impulse which guided us on the first occasion finds itself reinforced by all the suggestions of memory the human plagiarism which it is most difficult to avoid for individuals and even for nations which persevere in their faults and continue to aggravate them is the plagiarism of ourselves

    knowing that saintloup was in paris i had sent for him immediately he came in haste to my rescue swift and efficient as he had been long ago at doncières and agreed to set off at once for touraine i suggested to him the following arrangement he was to take the train to chatellerault find out where mme bontemps lived and wait until albertine should have left the house since there was a risk of her recognising him “but does the girl you are speaking of know me then” he asked i told him that i did not think so this plan of action filled me with indescribable joy it was nevertheless diametrically opposed to my original intention to arrange things so that i should not appear to be seeking albertine’s return whereas by so acting i must inevitably appear to be seeking it but this plan had inestimable advantage over ‘the proper thing to do’ that it enabled me to say to myself that some one sent by me was going to see albertine and would doubtless bring her back with him and if i had been able to read my own heart clearly at the start i might have foreseen that it was this solution hidden in the darkness which i felt to be deplorable that would ultimately prevail over the alternative course of patience which i had decided to choose from want of willpower as saintloup already appeared slightly surprised to learn that a girl had been living with me through the whole winter without my having said a word to him about her as moreover he had often spoken to me of the girl who had been at balbec and i had never said in reply “but she is living here” he might be annoyed by my want of confidence there was always the risk of mme bontemps’s mentioning balbec to him but i was too impatient for his departure for his arrival at the other end to wish to be able to think of the possible consequences of his journey as for the risk of his recognising albertine at whom he had resolutely refrained from looking when he had met her at doncières she had as everyone admitted so altered and had grown so much stouter that it was hardly likely he asked me whether i had not a picture of albertine i replied at first that i had not so that he might not have a chance from her photograph taken about the time of our stay at balbec of recognising albertine though he had had no more than a glimpse of her in the railway carriage but then i remembered that in the photograph she would be already as different from the albertine of balbec as the living albertine now was and that he would recognise her no better from her photograph than in the flesh while i was looking for it he laid his hand gently upon my brow by way of consoling me i was touched by the distress which the grief that he guessed me to be feeling was causing him for one thing however final his rupture with rachel what he had felt at that time was not yet so remote that he had not a special sympathy a special pity for this sort of suffering as we feel ourselves more closely akin to a person who is afflicted with the same malady as ourselves besides he had so strong an affection for myself that the thought of my suffering was intolerable to him and so he conceived towards her who was the cause of my suffering a rancour mingled with admiration he regarded me as so superior a being that he supposed that if i were to subject myself to another person she must be indeed extraordinary i quite expected that he would think albertine in her photograph pretty but as at the same time i did not imagine that it would produce upon him the impression that helen made upon the trojan elders as i continued to look for it i said modestly “oh you know you mustn’t imagine things for one thing it is a bad photograph and besides there’s nothing startling about her she is not a beauty she is merely very nice” “oh yes she must be wonderful” he said with a simple sincere enthusiasm as he sought to form a mental picture of the person who was capable of plunging me in such despair and agitation “i am angry with her because she has hurt you but at the same time one can’t help seeing that a man who is an artist to his fingertips like you that you who love beauty in everything and with so passionate a love were predestined to suffer more than the ordinary person when you found it in a woman” at last i managed to find her photograph “she is bound to be wonderful” still came from robert who had not seen that i was holding out the protograph to him all at once he caught sight of it he held it for a moment between his hands his face expressed a stupefaction which amounted to stupidity “is this the girl you are in love with” he said at length in a tone from which astonishment was banished by his fear of making me angry he made no remark upon it he had assumed the reasonable prudent inevitably somewhat disdainful air which we assume before a sick person — even if he has been in the past a man of outstanding gifts and our friend — who is now nothing of the sort for raving mad he speaks to us of a celestial being who has appeared to him and continues to behold this being where we the sane man can see nothing but a quilt on the bed i at once understood robert’s astonishment and that it was the same in which the sight of his mistress had plunged me with this difference only that i had recognised in her a woman whom i already knew whereas he supposed that he had never seen albertine but no doubt the difference between our respective impressions of the same person was equally great the time was past when i had timidly begun at balbec by adding to my visual sensations when i gazed at albertine sensations of taste of smell of touch since then other more profound more pleasant more indefinable sensations had been added to them and afterwards painful sensations in short albertine was merely like a stone round which snow has gathered the generating centre of an immense structure which rose above the plane of my heart robert to whom all this stratification of sensations was invisible grasped only a residue of it which it prevented me on the contrary from perceiving what had disconcerted robert when his eyes fell upon albertine’s photograph was not the consternation of the trojan elders when they saw helen go by and said “all our misfortunes are not worth a single glance from her eyes” but the exactly opposite impression which may be expressed by “what it is for this that he has worked himself into such a state has grieved himself so has done so many idiotic things” it must indeed be admitted that this sort of reaction at the sight of the person who has caused the suffering upset the life sometimes brought about the death of some one whom we love is infinitely more frequent than that felt by the trojan elders and is in short habitual this is not merely because love is individual nor because when we do not feel it finding it avoidable and philosophising upon the folly of other people come naturally to us no it is because when it has reached the stage at which it causes such misery the structure composed of the sensations interposed between the face of the woman and the eyes of her lover — the huge egg of pain which encases it and conceals it as a mantle of snow conceals a fountain — is already raised so high that the point at which the lover’s gaze comes to rest the point at which he finds his pleasure and his sufferings is as far from the point which other people see as is the real sun from the place in which its condensed light enables us to see it in the sky and what is more during this time beneath the chrysalis of griefs and affections which render invisible to the lover the worst metamorphoses of the beloved object her face has had time to grow old and to change with the result that if the face which the lover saw on the first occasion is very far removed from that which he has seen since he has been in love and has been made to suffer it is in the opposite direction equally far from the face which may now be seen by the indifferent onlooker what would have happened if instead of the photograph of one who was still a girl robert had seen the photograph of an elderly mistress and indeed we have no need to see for the first time the woman who has caused such an upheaval in order to feel this astonishment often we know her already as my greatuncle knew odette then the optical difference extends not merely to the bodily aspect but to the character to the individual importance it is more likely than not that the woman who is causing the man who is in love with her to suffer has already behaved perfectly towards some one who was not interested in her just as odette who was so cruel to swann had been the sedulous ‘lady in pink’ to my greatuncle or indeed that the person whose every decision is calculated in advance with as much dread as that of a deity by the man who is in love with her appears as a person of no importance only too glad to do anything that he may require of her in the eyes of the man who is not in love with her as saintloup’s mistress appeared to me who saw in her nothing more than that ‘rachel when from the lord’ who had so repeatedly been offered me i recalled my own stupefaction that first time that i met her with saintloup at the thought that anybody could be tormented by not knowing what such a woman had been doing by the itch to know what she might have said in a whisper to some other man why she had desired a rupture and i felt that all this past existence — but in this case albertine’s — toward which every fibre of my heart of my life was directed with a throbbing clumsy pain must appear just as insignificant to saintloup as it would one day perhaps appear to myself i felt that i would pass perhaps gradually so far as the insignificance or gravity of albertine’s past was concerned from the state of mind in which i was at the moment to that of saintloup for i was under no illusion as to what saintloup might be thinking as to what anyone else than the lover himself might think and i was not unduly distressed let us leave pretty women to men devoid of imagination i recalled that tragic explanation of so many of us which is furnished by an inspired but not lifelike portrait such as elstir’s portrait of odette which is a portrait not so much of a mistress as of our degrading love for her there was lacking only what we find in so many portraits — that the painter should have been at once a great artist and a lover and even then it was said that elstir had been in love with odette this disparity the whole life of a lover — of a lover whose acts of folly nobody understands — the whole life of a swann goes to prove but let the lover be embodied in a painter like elstir and then we have the clue to the enigma we have at length before our eyes those lips which the common herd have never perceived that nose which nobody has ever seen that unsuspected carriage the portrait says “what i have loved what has made me suffer what i have never ceased to behold is this” by an inverse gymnastic i who had made a mental effort to add to rachel all that saintloup had added to her of himself i attempted to subtract the support of my heart and mind from the composition of albertine and to picture her to myself as she must appear to saintloup as rachel had appeared to me those differences even though we were to observe them ourselves what importance would we attach to them when in the summer at balbec albertine used to wait for me beneath the arcades of incarville and spring into my carriage not only had she not yet put on weight she had as a result of too much exercise begun to waste thin made plainer by an ugly hat which left visible only the tip of an ugly nose and a sideview pale cheeks like white slugs i recognised very little of her enough however to know when she sprang into the carriage that it was she that she had been punctual in keeping our appointment and had not gone somewhere else and this was enough what we love is too much in the past consists too much in the time that we have spent together for us to require the whole woman we wish only to be sure that it is she not to be mistaken as to her identity a thing far more important than beauty to those who are in love her cheeks may grow hollow her body thin even to those who were originally most proud in the eyes of the world of their domination over beauty that little tip of a nose that sign in which is summed up the permanent personality of a woman that algebraical formula that constant is sufficient to prevent a man who is courted in the highest society and is in love with her from being free upon a single evening because he is spending his evenings in brushing and entangling until it is time to go to bed the hair of the woman whom he loves or simply in staying by her side so that he may be with her or she with him or merely that she may not be with other people

    “you are sure” robert asked me “that i can begin straight away by offering this woman thirty thousand francs for her husband’s constituency she is as dishonest as all that you’re sure you aren’t exaggerating and that three thousand francs wouldn’t be enough” “no i beg of you don’t try to be economical about a thing that matters so much to me this is what you are to say to her and it is to some extent true ‘my friend borrowed these thirty thousand francs from a relative for the election expenses of the uncle of the girl he was engaged to marry it was because of this engagement that the money was given him and he asked me to bring it to you so that albertine should know nothing about it and now albertine goes and leaves him he doesn’t know what to do he is obliged to pay back the thirty thousand francs if he does not marry albertine and if he is going to marry her then if only to keep up appearances she ought to return immediately because it will look so bad if she stays away for long’ you think i’ve made all this up” “not at all” saintloup assured me out of consideration for myself out of discretion and also because he knew that truth is often stranger than fiction after all it was by no means impossible that in this tale of the thirty thousand francs there might be as i had told him a large element of truth it was possible but it was not true and this element of truth was in fact a lie but we lied to each other robert and i as in every conversation when one friend is genuinely anxious to help another who is desperately in love the friend who is being counsellor prop comforter may pity the other’s distress but cannot share it and the kinder he is to him the more he has to lie and the other confesses to him as much as is necessary in order to secure his help but simply perhaps in order to secure that help conceals many things from him and the happy one of the two is when all is said he who takes trouble goes on a journey executes a mission but feels no anguish in his heart i was at this moment the person that robert had been at doncières when he thought that rachel had abandoned him “very well just as you like if i get my head bitten off i accept the snub in advance for your sake and even if it does seem a bit queer to make such an open bargain i know that in our own set there are plenty of duchesses even the most stuffy of them who if you offered them thirty thousand francs would do things far more difficult than telling their nieces not to stay in touraine anyhow i am doubly glad to be doing you a service since that is the only reason that will make you consent to see me if i marry” he went on “don’t you think we might see more of one another won’t you look upon my house as your own    ” he stopped short the thought having suddenly occurred to him as i supposed at the time that if i too were to marry his wife would not be able to make an intimate friend of albertine and i remembered what the cambremers had said to me as to the probability of his marrying a niece of the prince de guermantes he consulted the timetable and found that he could not leave paris until the evening françoise inquired “am i to take mlle albertine’s bed out of the study” “not at all” i said “you must leave everything ready for her” i hoped that she would return any day and did not wish françoise to suppose that there could be any doubt of her return albertine’s departure must appear to have been arranged between ourselves and not in any way to imply that she loved me less than before but françoise looked at me with an air if not of incredulity at any rate of doubt she too had her alternative hypotheses her nostrils expanded she could scent the quarrel she must have felt it in the air for a long time past and if she was not absolutely sure of it this was perhaps because like myself she would hesitate to believe unconditionally what would have given her too much pleasure now the burden of the affair rested no longer upon my overwrought mind but upon saintloup i became quite lighthearted because i had made a decision because i could say to myself “i haven’t lost any time i have acted” saintloup can barely have been in the train when in the hall i ran into bloch whose ring i had not heard and so was obliged to let him stay with me for a minute he had met me recently with albertine whom he had known at balbec on a day when she was in bad humour “i met m bontemps at dinner” he told me “and as i have a certain influence over him i told him that i was grieved that his niece was not nicer to you that he must make entreaties to her in that connexion” i boiled with rage these entreaties this compassion destroyed the whole effect of saintloup’s intervention and brought me into direct contact with albertine herself whom i now seemed to be imploring to return to make matters worse françoise who was lingering in the hall could hear every word i heaped every imaginable reproach upon bloch telling him that i had never authorised him to do anything of the sort and that besides the whole thing was nonsense bloch from that moment continued to smile less i imagine from joy than from selfconsciousness at having made me angry he laughingly expressed his surprise at having provoked such anger perhaps he said this hoping to minimise in my mind the importance of his indiscreet intervention perhaps it was because he was of a cowardly nature and lived gaily and idly in an atmosphere of falsehood as jellyfish float upon the surface of the sea perhaps because even if he had not been of a different race as other people can never place themselves at our point of view they do not realise the magnitude of the injury that words uttered at random can do us i had barely shewn him out unable to think of any remedy for the mischief that he had done when the bell rang again and françoise brought me a summons from the head of the sûreté the parents of the little girl whom i had brought into the house for an hour had decided to lodge a complaint against me for corruption of a child under the age of consent there are moments in life when a sort of beauty is created by the multiplicity of the troubles that assail us intertwined like wagnerian leitmotiv from the idea also which then emerges that events are not situated in the content of the reflexions portrayed in the wretched little mirror which the mind holds in front of it and which is called the future that they are somewhere outside and spring up as suddenly as a person who comes to accuse us of a crime even when left to itself an event becomes modified whether frustration amplifies it for us or satisfaction reduces it but it is rarely unaccompanied the feelings aroused by each event contradict one another and there comes to a certain extent as i felt when on my way to the head of the sûreté an at least momentary revulsion which is as provocative of sentimental misery as fear i found at the sûreté the girl’s parents who insulted me by saying “we don’t eat this sort of bread” and handed me back the five hundred francs which i declined to take and the head of the sûreté who setting himself the inimitable example of the judicial facility in repartee took hold of a word from each sentence that i uttered a word which enabled him to make a witty and crushing retort my innocence of the alleged crime was never taken into consideration for that was the sole hypothesis which nobody was willing to accept for an instant nevertheless the difficulty of a conviction enabled me to escape with an extremely violent reprimand while the parents were in the room but as soon as they had gone the head of the sûreté who had a weakness for little girls changed his tone and admonished me as one man to another “next time you must be more careful gad you can’t pick them up as easily as that or you’ll get into trouble anyhow you can find dozens of girls better than that one and far cheaper it was a perfectly ridiculous amount to pay” i felt him to be so incapable of understanding me if i attempted to tell him the truth that without saying a word i took advantage of his permission to withdraw every passerby until i was safely at home seemed to me an inspector appointed to spy upon my behaviour but this leitmotiv like that of my anger with bloch died away leaving the field clear for that of albertine’s departure and this took its place once more but in an almost joyous tone now that saintloup had started now that he had undertaken to go and see mme bontemps my sufferings had been dispelled i believed that this was because i had taken action i believed it sincerely for we never know what we conceal in our heart of hearts what really made me happy was not as i supposed that i had transferred my load of indecisions to saintloup i was not for that matter entirely wrong the specific remedy for an unfortunate event and three events out of four are unfortunate is a decision for its effect is that by a sudden reversal of our thoughts it interrupts the flow of those that come from the past event and prolong its vibration and breaks that flow with a contrary flow of contrary thoughts come from without from the future but these new thoughts are most of all beneficial to us when and this was the case with the thoughts that assailed me at this moment from the heart of that future it is a hope that they bring us what really made me so happy was the secret certainty that saintloup’s mission could not fail albertine was bound to return i realised this for not having received on the following day any answer from saintloup i began to suffer afresh my decision my transference to him of full power of action were not therefore the cause of my joy which in that case would have persisted but rather the ‘success is certain’ which had been in my mind when i said “come what may” and the thought aroused by his delay that after all his mission might not prove successful was so hateful to me that i had lost my gaiety it is in reality our anticipation our hope of happy events that fills us with a joy which we ascribe to other causes and which ceases letting us relapse into misery if we are no longer so assured that what we desire will come to pass it is always this invisible belief that sustains the edifice of our world of sensation deprived of which it rocks from its foundations we have seen that it created for us the merit or unimportance of other people our excitement or boredom at seeing them it creates similarly the possibility of enduring a grief which seems to us trivial simply because we are convinced that it will presently be brought to an end or its sudden enlargement until the presence of a certain person matters as much as possibly more than our life itself one thing however succeeded in making my heartache as keen as it had been at the first moment and i am bound to admit no longer was this was when i read over again a passage in albertine’s letter it is all very well our loving people the pain of losing them when in our isolation we are confronted with it alone to which our mind gives to a certain extent whatever form it chooses this pain is endurable and different from that other pain less human less our own as unforeseen and unusual as an accident in the moral world and in the region of our heart which is caused not so much by the people themselves as by the manner in which we have learned that we are not to see them again albertine i might think of her with gentle tears accepting the fact that i should not be able to see her again this evening as i had seen her last night but when i read over again “my decision is irrevocable” that was another matter it was like taking a dangerous drug which might give me a heart attack which i could not survive there is in inanimate objects in events in farewell letters a special danger which amplifies and even alters the nature of the grief that people are capable of causing us but this pain did not last long i was when all was said so sure of saintloup’s skill of his eventual success albertine’s return seemed to me so certain that i asked myself whether i had had any reason to hope for it nevertheless i rejoiced at the thought unfortunately for myself who supposed the business with the sûreté to be over and done with françoise came in to tell me that an inspector had called to inquire whether i was in the habit of having girls in the house that the porter supposing him to refer to albertine had replied in the affirmative and that from that moment it had seemed that the house was being watched in future it would be impossible for me ever to bring a little girl into the house to console me in my grief without the risk of being put to shame in her eyes by the sudden intrusion of an inspector and of her regarding me as a criminal and at the same instant i realised how far more we live for certain ideas than we suppose for this impossibility of my ever taking a little girl on my knee again seemed to me to destroy all the value of my life but what was more i understood how comprehensible it is that people will readily refuse wealth and risk their lives whereas we imagine that pecuniary interest and the fear of death rule the world for if i had thought that even a little girl who was a complete stranger might by the arrival of a policeman be given a bad impression of myself how much more readily would i have committed suicide and yet there was no possible comparison between the two degrees of suffering now in everyday life we never bear in mind that the people to whom we offer money whom we threaten to kill may have mistresses or merely friends to whose esteem they attach importance not to mention their own selfrespect but all of a sudden by a confusion of which i was not aware i did not in fact remember that albertine being of full age was free to live under my roof and even to be my mistress it seemed to me that the charge of corrupting minors might include albertine also thereupon my life appeared to me to be hedged in on every side and when i thought that i had not lived chastely with her i found in the punishment that had been inflicted upon me for having forced an unknown little girl to accept money that relation which almost always exists in human sanctions the effect of which is that there is hardly ever either a fair sentence or a judicial error but a sort of compromise between the false idea that the judge forms of an innocent action and the culpable deeds of which he is unaware but then when i thought that albertine’s return might involve me in the scandal of a sentence which would degrade me in her eyes and would perhaps do her too an injury which she would not forgive me i ceased to look forward to her return it terrified me i would have liked to telegraph to her not to come back and immediately drowning everything else the passionate desire for her return overwhelmed me the fact was that having for an instant considered the possibility of telling her not to return and of living without her all of a sudden i felt myself on the contrary ready to abandon all travel all pleasure all work if only albertine might return ah how my love for albertine the course of which i had supposed that i could foretell on the analogy of my previous love for gilberte had developed in an entirely opposite direction how impossible it was for me to live without seeing her and with each of my actions even the most trivial since they had all been steeped before in the blissful atmosphere which was albertine’s presence i was obliged in turn with a fresh expenditure of energy with the same grief to begin again the apprenticeship of separation then the competition of other forms of life thrust this latest grief into the background and during those days which were the first days of spring i even found as i waited until saintloup should have seen mme bontemps in imagining venice and beautiful unknown women a few moments of pleasing calm as soon as i was conscious of this i felt in myself a panic terror this calm which i had just enjoyed was the first apparition of that great occasional force which was to wage war in me against grief against love and would in the end prove victorious this state of which i had just had a foretaste and had received the warning was for a moment only what would in time to come be my permanent state a life in which i should no longer be able to suffer on account of albertine in which i should no longer be in love with her and my love which had just seen and recognised the one enemy by whom it could be conquered forgetfulness began to tremble like a lion which in the cage in which it has been confined has suddenly caught sight of the python that is about to devour it

    i thought of albertine all the time and never was françoise when she came into my room quick enough in saying “there are no letters” to curtail my anguish from time to time i succeeded by letting some current or other of ideas flow through my grief in refreshing in aerating to some slight extent the vitiated atmosphere of my heart but at night if i succeeded in going to sleep then it was as though the memory of albertine had been the drug that had procured my sleep whereas the cessation of its influence would awaken me i thought all the time of albertine while i was asleep it was a special sleep of her own that she gave me and one in which moreover i should no longer have been at liberty as when awake to think of other things sleep and the memory of her were the two substances which i must mix together and take at one draught in order to put myself to sleep when i was awake moreover my suffering went on increasing day by day instead of diminishing not that oblivion was not performing its task but because by the very fact of its doing so it favoured the idealisation of the regretted image and thereby the assimilation of my initial suffering to other analogous sufferings which intensified it still this image was endurable but if all of a sudden i thought of her room of her room in which the bed stood empty of her piano her motorcar i lost all my strength i shut my eyes let my head droop upon my shoulder like a person who is about to faint the sound of doors being opened hurt me almost as much because it was not she that was opening them

    when it was possible that a telegram might have come from saintloup idared not ask “is there a telegram” at length one did come but brought with it only a postponement of any result with the message “the ladies have gone away for three days” no doubt if i had endured the four days that had already elapsed since her departure it was because i said to myself “it is only a matter of time by the end of the week she will be here” but this argument did not alter the fact that for my heart for my body the action to be performed was the same living without her returning home and not finding her in the house passing the door of her room — as for opening it i had not yet the courage to do that — knowing that she was not inside going to bed without having said good night to her such were the tasks that my heart had been obliged to accomplish in their terrible entirety and for all the world as though i had not been going to see albertine but the fact that my heart had already performed this daily task four times proved that it was now capable of continuing to perform it and soon perhaps the consideration which helped me to go on living in this fashion — the prospect of albertine’s return — i should cease to feel any need of it i should be able to say to myself “she is never coming back” and remain alive all the same as i had already been living for the last four days like a cripple who has recovered the use of his feet and can dispense with his crutches no doubt when i came home at night i still found taking my breath away stifling me in the vacuum of solitude the memories placed end to end in an interminable series of all the evenings upon which albertine had been waiting for me but already i found in this series my memory of last night of the night before and of the two previous evenings that is to say the memory of the four nights that had passed since albertine’s departure during which i had remained without her alone through which nevertheless i had lived four nights already forming a string of memories that was very slender compared with the other but to which every new day would perhaps add substance i shall say nothing of the letter conveying a declaration of affection which i received at this time from a niece of mme de guermantes considered the prettiest girl in paris nor of the overtures made to me by the duc de guermantes on behalf of her parents resigned in their anxiety to secure their daughter’s happiness to the inequality of the match to an apparent misalliance such incidents which might prove gratifying to our selfesteem are too painful when we are in love we feel a desire but shrink from the indelicacy of communicating them to her who has a less flattering opinion of us nor would that opinion be altered by the knowledge that we are able to inspire one that is very different what the duke’s niece wrote to me could only have made albertine angry from the moment of waking when i picked my grief up again at the point which i had reached when i fell asleep like a book which had been shut for a while but which i would keep before my eyes until night it could be only with some thought relating to albertine that all my sensation would be brought into harmony whether it came to me from without or from within the bell rang it is a letter from her it is she herself perhaps if i felt myself in better health not too miserable i was no longer jealous i no longer had any grievance against her i would have liked to see her at once to kiss her to live happily with her ever after the act of telegraphing to her “come at once” seemed to me to have become a perfectly simple thing as though my fresh mood had changed not merely my inclinations but things external to myself had made them more easy if i was in a sombre mood all my anger with her revived i no longer felt any desire to kiss her i felt how impossible it was that she could ever make me happy i sought only to do her harm and to prevent her from belonging to other people but these two opposite moods had an identical result it was essential that she should return as soon as possible and yet however keen my joy at the moment of her return i felt that very soon the same difficulties would crop up again and that to seek happiness in the satisfaction of a moral desire was as fatuous as to attempt to reach the horizon by walking straight ahead the farther the desire advances the farther does true possession withdraw so that if happiness or at least freedom from suffering can be found it is not the satisfaction but the gradual reduction the eventual extinction of our desire that we must seek we attempt to see the person whom we love we ought to attempt not to see her oblivion alone brings about an ultimate extinction of desire and i imagine that if an author were to publish truths of this sort he would dedicate the book that contained them to a woman to whom he would thus take pleasure in returning saying to her “this book is yours” and thus while telling the truth in his book he would be lying in his dedication for he will attach to the book’s being hers only the importance that he attaches to the stone that came to him from her which will remain precious to him only so long as he is in love with her the bonds that unite another person to ourselves exist only in our mind memory as it grows fainter relaxes them and notwithstanding the illusion by which we would fain be cheated and with which out of love friendship politeness deference duty we cheat other people we exist alone man is the creature that cannot emerge from himself that knows his fellows only in himself when he asserts the contrary he is lying and i should have been in such terror had there been anyone capable of taking it of somebody’s robbing me of this need of her this love for her that i convinced myself that it had a value in my life to be able to hear uttered without being either fascinated or pained by them the names of the stations through which the train passed on its way to touraine would have seemed to me a diminution of myself for no other reason really than that it would have proved that albertine was ceasing to interest me it was just as well i told myself that by incessantly asking myself what she could be doing thinking longing at every moment whether she intended whether she was going to return i should be keeping open that communicating door which love had installed in me and feeling another person’s mind flood through open sluices the reservoir which must not again become stagnant presently as saintloup remained silent a subordinate anxiety — my expectation of a further telegram of a telephone call from him — masked the other my uncertainty as to the result whether albertine was going to return listening for every sound in expectation of the telegram became so intolerable that i felt that whatever might be its contents the arrival of the telegram which was the only thing of which i could think at the moment would put an end to my sufferings but when at length i had received a telegram from robert in which he informed me that he had seen mme bontemps but that notwithstanding all his precautions albertine had seen him and that this had upset everything i burst out in a torrent of fury and despair for this was what i would have done anything in the world to prevent once it came to albertine’s knowledge saintloup’s mission gave me an appearance of being dependent upon her which could only dissuade her from returning my horror of which was as it happened all that i had retained of the pride that my love had boasted in gilberte’s day and had since lost i cursed robert then i told myself that if this attempt had failed i would try another since man is able to influence the outer world how if i brought into play cunning intelligence pecuniary advantage affection should i fail to succeed in destroying this appalling fact albertine’s absence we believe that according to our desire we are able to change the things around about us we believe this because otherwise we can see no favourable solution we forget the solution that generally comes to pass and is also favourable we do not succeed in changing things according to our desire but gradually our desire changes the situation that we hoped to change because it was intolerable becomes unimportant we have not managed to surmount the obstacle as we were absolutely determined to do but life has taken us round it led us past it and then if we turn round to gaze at the remote past we can barely catch sight of it so imperceptible has it become in the flat above ours one of the neighbours was strumming songs i applied their words which i knew to albertine and myself and was stirred by so profound a sentiment that i began to cry the words were

   “hélas l’oiseau qui fuit ce qu’il croit l’esclavage
   d’un vol désespéré revient battre au vitrage”

and the death of manon

   “manon répondsmoi donc
   seul amour de mon âme je n’ai su qu’aujourd’hui
   la bonté de ton coeur”

since manon returned to des grieux it seemed to me that i was to albertine the one and only love of her life alas it is probable that if she had been listening at that moment to the same air it would not have been myself that she would have cherished under the name of des grieux and even if the idea had occurred to her the memory of myself would have checked her emotion on hearing this music albeit it was although better and more distinguished just the sort of music that she admired as for myself i had not the courage to abandon myself to so pleasant a train of thought to imagine albertine calling me her ‘heart’s only love’ and realising that she had been mistaken over what she ‘had thought to be bondage’ i knew that we can never read a novel without giving its heroine the form and features of the woman with whom we are in love but be the ending as happy as it may our love has not advanced an inch and when we have shut the book she whom we love and who has come to us at last in its pages loves us no better in real life in a fit of fury i telegraphed to saintloup to return as quickly as possible to paris so as to avoid at least the appearance of an aggravating insistence upon a mission which i had been so anxious to keep secret but even before he had returned in obedience to my instructions it was from albertine herself that i received the following letter

    “my dear you have sent your friend saintloup to my aunt which was foolish my dear boy if you needed me why did you not write to me myself i should have been only too delighted to come back do not let us have any more of these absurd complications” “i should have been only too delighted to come back” if she said this it must mean that she regretted her departure and was only seeking an excuse to return so that i had merely to do what she said to write to her that i needed her and she would return
    i was going then to see her again her the albertine of balbec for since her departure this was what she had once more become to me like a seashell to which we cease to pay any attention while we have it on the chest of drawers in our room once we have parted with it either by giving it away or by losing it and begin to think about it a thing which we had ceased to do she recalled to me all the joyous beauty of the blue mountains of the sea and it was not only she that had become a creature of the imagination that is to say desirable life with her had become an imaginary life that is to a life set free from all difficulties so that i said to myself “how happy we are going to be” but now that i was assured of her return i must not appear to be seeking to hasten it but must on the contrary efface the bad impression left by saintloup’s intervention which i could always disavow later on by saying that he had acted upon his own initiative because he had always been in favour of our marriage meanwhile i read her letter again and was nevertheless disappointed when i saw how little there is of a person in a letter doubtless the characters traced on the paper express our thoughts as do also our features it is still a thought of some kind that we see before us but all the same in the person the thought is not apparent to us until it has been diffused through the expanded waterlily of her face this modifies it considerably and it is perhaps one of the causes of our perpetual disappointments in love this perpetual deviation which brings it about that in response to our expectation of the ideal person with whom we are in love each meeting provides us with a person in flesh and blood in whom there is already so little trace of our dream and then when we demand something of this person we receive from her a letter in which even of the person very little remains as in the letters of an algebraical formula there no longer remains the precise value of the arithmetical ciphers which themselves do not contain the qualities of the fruit or flowers that they enumerate and yet love the beloved object her letters are perhaps nevertheless translations unsatisfying as it may be to pass from one to the other of the same reality since the letter seems to us inadequate only while we are reading it but we have been sweating blood until its arrival and it is sufficient to calm our anguish if not to appease with its tiny black symbols our desire which knows that it contains after all only the equivalent of a word a smile a kiss not the things themselves

    i wrote to albertine

    “my dear i was just about to write to you and i thank you for telling me that if i had been in need of you you would have come at once it is like you to have so exalted a sense of devotion to an old friend which can only increase my regard for you but no i did not ask and i shall not ask you to return our meeting — for a long time to come — might not be painful perhaps to you a heartless girl to me whom at times you have thought so cold it would be most painful life has driven us apart you have made a decision which i consider very wise and which you have made at the right moment with a marvellous presentiment for you left me on the day on which i had just received my mother’s consent to my asking you to marry me i would have told you this when i awoke when i received her letter at the same moment as yours perhaps you would have been afraid of distressing me by leaving immediately after that and we should perhaps have united our lives in what would have been for us who knows misery if this is what was in store for us then i bless you for your wisdom we should lose all the fruit of it were we to meet again this is not to say that i should not find it a temptation but i claim no great credit for resisting it you know what an inconstant person i am and how quickly i forget you have told me often i am first and foremost a man of habit the habits which i am beginning to form in your absence are not as yet very strong naturally at this moment the habits that i had when you were with me habits which your departure has upset are still the stronger they will not remain so for very long for that reason indeed i had thought of taking advantage of these last few days in which our meeting would not yet be for me what it will be in a fortnight’s time perhaps even sooner forgive my frankness a disturbance — i had thought of taking advantage of them before the final oblivion in order to settle certain little material questions with you in which you might as a good and charming friend have rendered a service to him who for five minutes imagined himself your future husband as i never expected that my mother would approve as on the other hand i desired that we should each of us enjoy all that liberty of which you had too generously and abundantly made a sacrifice which might be admissible had we been living together for a few weeks but would have become as hateful to you as to myself now that we were to spend the rest of our lives together it almost hurts me to think as i write to you that this nearly happened that the news came only a moment too late i had thought of organising our existence in the most independent manner possible and to begin with i wished you to have that yacht in which you could go cruising while i not being well enough to accompany you would wait for you at the port i had written to elstir to ask for his advice since you admire his taste and on land i wished you to have a motorcar to yourself for your very own in which you could go out could travel wherever you chose the yacht was almost ready it is named after a wish that you expressed at balbec le cygne and remembering that your favourite make of car was the rolls i had ordered one but now that we are never to meet again as i have no hope of persuading you to accept either the vessel or the car to me they would be quite useless i had thought — as i had ordered them through an agent but in your name — that you might perhaps by countermanding them yourself save me the expense of the yacht and the car which are no longer required but this and many other matters would need to be discussed well i find that so long as i am capable of falling in love with you again which will not be for long it would be madness for the sake of a sailingvessel and a rollsroyce to meet again and to risk the happiness of your life since you have decided that it lies in your living apart from myself no i prefer to keep the rolls and even the yacht and as i shall make no use of them and they are likely to remain for ever one in its dock dismantled the other in its garage i shall have engraved upon the yacht heavens i am afraid of misquoting the title and committing a heresy which would shock you those lines of mallarmé which you used to like

   un cygne d’autrefois se souvient que c’est lui
   magnifique mais qui sans espoir se délivre
   pour n’avoir pas chanté la région où vivre
   quand du stérile hiver a resplendi l’ennui

you remember — it is the poem that begins

   le vierge le vivace et le bel aujourd’hui

alas today is no longer either virginal or fair but the men who know as i know that they will very soon make of it an endurable ‘tomorrow’ are seldom endurable themselves as for the rolls it would deserve rather those other lines of the same poet which you said you could not understand

   dis si je ne suis pas joyeux
   tonnerre et rubis aux moyeux
   de voir en l’air que ce feu troue

   avec des royaumes épars
   comme mourir pourpre la roue
   du seul vespéral de mes chars

“farewell for ever my little albertine and thanks once again for the charming drive which we took on the eve of our parting i retain a very pleasant memory of it
    “ps i make no reference to what you tell me of the alleged suggestions which saintloup whom i do not for a moment believe to be in touraine may have made to your aunt it is just like a sherlock holmes story for what do you take me”

    no doubt just as i had said in the past to albertine “i am not in love with you” in order that she might love me “i forget people when i do not see them” in order that she might come often to see me “i have decided to leave you” in order to forestall any idea of a parting now it was because i was absolutely determined that she must return within a week that’i said to her “farewell for ever” it was because i wished to see her again that i said to her “i think it would be dangerous to see you” it was because living apart from her seemed to me worse than death that i wrote to her “you were right we should be wretched together” alas this false letter when i wrote it in order to appear not to be dependent upon her and also to enjoy the pleasure of saying certain things which could arouse emotion only in myself and not in her i ought to have foreseen from the start that it was possible that it would result in a negative response that is to say one which confirmed what i had said that this was indeed probable for even had albertine been less intelligent than she was she would never have doubted for an instant that what i said to her was untrue indeed without pausing to consider the intentions that i expressed in this letter the mere fact of my writing it even if it had not been preceded by saintloup’s intervention was enough to prove to her that i desired her return and to prompt her to let me become more and more inextricably ensnared then having foreseen the possibility of a reply in the negative i ought also to have foreseen that this reply would at once revive in its fullest intensity my love for albertine and i ought still before posting my letter to have asked myself whether in the event of albertine’s replying in the same tone and refusing to return i should have sufficient control over my grief to force myself to remain silent not to telegraph to her “come back” not to send her some other messenger which after i had written to her that we would not meet again would make it perfectly obvious that i could not get on without her and would lead to her refusing more emphatically than ever whereupon i unable to endure my anguish for another moment would go down to visit her and might for all i knew be refused admission and no doubt this would have been after three enormous blunders the worst of all after which there would be nothing left but to take my life in front of her house but the disastrous manner in which the psychopathic universe is constructed has decreed that the clumsy action the action which we ought most carefully to have avoided should be precisely the action that will calm us the action that opening before us until we learn its result fresh avenues of hope relieves us for the moment of the intolerable pain which a refusal has aroused in us with the result that when the pain is too keen we dash headlong into the blunder that consists in writing sending somebody to intercede going in person proving that we cannot get on without the woman we love but i foresaw nothing of all this the probable result of my letter seemed to me on the contrary to be that of making albertine return to me at once and so as i thought of this result i greatly enjoyed writing the letter but at the same time i had not ceased while writing it from shedding tears partly at first in the same way as upon the day when i had acted a pretence of separation because as the words represented for me the idea which they expressed to me albeit they were aimed in the opposite direction uttered mendaciously because my pride forbade me to admit that i was in love they carried their own load of sorrow but also because i felt that the idea contained a grain of truth

    as this letter seemed to me to be certain of its effect i began to regret that i had sent it for as i pictured to myself the return so natural after all of albertine immediately all the reasons which made our marriage a thing disastrous to myself returned in their fullest force i hoped that she would refuse to come back i was engaged in calculating that my liberty my whole future depended upon her refusal that i had been mad to write to her that i ought to have retrieved my letter which alas had gone when françoise with the newspaper which she had just brought upstairs handed it back to me she was not certain how many stamps it required but immediately i changed my mind i hoped that albertine would not return but i wished the decision to come from her so as to put an end to my anxiety and i handed the letter back to françoise i opened the newspaper it announced a performance by berma then i remembered the two different attitudes in which i had listened to phèdre and it was now in a third attitude that i thought of the declaration scene it seemed to me that what i had so often repeated to myself and had heard recited in the theatre was the statement of the laws of which i must make experience in my life there are in our soul things to which we do not realise how strongly we are attached or else if we live without them it is because we put off from day to day from fear of failure or of being made to suffer entering into possession of them this was what had happened to me in the case of gilberte when i thought that i had given her up if before the moment in which we are entirely detached from these things — a moment long subsequent to that in which we suppose ourselves to have been detached from them — the girl with whom we are in love becomes for instance engaged to some one else we are mad we can no longer endure the life which appeared to us to be so sorrowfully calm or else if we are in control of the situation we feel that she is a burden we would gladly be rid of her which was what had happened to me in the case of albertine but let a sudden departure remove the unloved creature from us we are unable to survive but did not the plot of phèdre combine these two cases hippolyte is about to leave phèdre who until then has taken care to court his hostility from a scruple of conscience she says or rather the poet makes her say because she is unable to foresee the consequences and feels that she is not loved phèdre can endure the situation no longer she comes to him to confess her love and this was the scene which i had so often repeated to myself

   on dit qu’un prompt départ vous éloigne de nous

doubtless this reason for the departure of hippolyte is less decisive we may suppose than the death of thésée and similarly when a few lines farther on phèdre pretends for a moment that she has been misunderstood

   auraisje perdu tout le soin de ma gloire

we may suppose that it is because hippolyte has repulsed her declaration

   madame oubliezvous
   que thésée est mon père et qu’il est votre époux

but there would not have been this indignation unless in the moment of a consummated bliss phèdre could have had the same feeling that it amounted to little or nothing whereas as soon as she sees that it is not to be consummated that hippolyte thinks that he has misunderstood her and makes apologies then like myself when i decided to give my letter back to françoise she decides that the refusal must come from him decides to stake everything upon his answer

   ah cruel tu m’as trop entendue

and there is nothing not even the harshness with which as i had been told swann had treated odette or i myself had treated albertine a harshness which substituted for the original love a new love composed of pity emotion of the need of effusion which is only a variant of the former love that is not to be found also in this scene

   tu me haïssais plus je ne t’aimais pas moins
   tes malheurs te prêtaient encor de nouveaux charmes

what proves that it is not to the ‘thought of her own fame’ that phèdre attaches most importance is that she would forgive hippolyte and turn a deaf ear to the advice of oenone had she not learned at the same instant that hippolyte was in love with aricie so it is that jealousy which in love is equivalent to the loss of all happiness outweighs any loss of reputation it is then that she allows oenone which is merely a name for the baser part of herself to slander hippolyte without taking upon herself the ‘burden of his defence’ and thus sends the man who will have none of her to a fate the calamities of which are no consolation however to herself since her own suicide follows immediately upon the death of hippolyte thus at least it was with a diminution of the part played by all the ‘jansenist scruples’ as bergotte would have said which racine ascribed to phèdre to make her less guilty that this scene appeared to me a sort of prophecy of the amorous episodes in my own life these reflexions had however altered nothing of my determination and i handed my letter to françoise so that she might post it after all in order to carry into effect that appeal to albertine which seemed to me to be indispensable now that i had learned that my former attempt had failed and no doubt we are wrong when we suppose that the accomplishment of our desire is a small matter since as soon as we believe that it cannot be realised we become intent upon it once again and decide that it was not worth our while to pursue it only when we are quite certain that our attempt will not fail and yet we are right also for if this accomplishment if our happiness appear of small account only in the light of certainty nevertheless they are an unstable element from which only trouble can arise and our trouble will be all the greater the more completely our desire will have been accomplished all the more impossible to endure when our happiness has been in defiance of the law of nature prolonged for a certain period when it has received the consecration of habit in another sense as well these two tendencies by which i mean that which made me anxious that my letter should be posted and when i thought that it had gone my regret that i had written it have each of them a certain element of truth in the case of the first it is easily comprehensible that we should go in pursuit of our happiness — or misery — and that at the same time we should hope to keep before us by this latest action which is about to involve us in its consequences a state of expectancy which does not leave us in absolute despair in a word that we should seek to convert into other forms which we imagine must be less painful to us the malady from which we are suffering but the other tendency is no less important for born of our belief in the success of our enterprise it is simply an anticipation of the disappointment which we should very soon feel in the presence of a satisfied desire our regret at having fixed for ourselves at the expense of other forms which are necessarily excluded this form of happiness i had given my letter to françoise and had asked her to go out at once and post it as soon as the letter had gone i began once more to think of albertine’s return as imminent it did not fail to introduce into my mind certain pleasing images which neutralised somewhat by their attractions the dangers that i foresaw in her return the pleasure so long lost of having her with me was intoxicating

    time passes and gradually everything that we have said in falsehood becomes true i had learned this only too well with gilberte the indifference that i had feigned when i could never restrain my tears had ended by becoming real gradually life as i told gilberte in a lying formula which retrospectively had become true life had driven us apart i recalled this i said to myself “if albertine allows an interval to elapse my lies will become the truth and now that the worst moments are over ought i not to hope that she will allow this month to pass without returning if she returns i shall have to renounce the true life which certainly i am not in a fit state to enjoy as yet but which as time goes on may begin to offer me attractions while my memory of albertine grows fainter”

    i have said that oblivion was beginning to perform its task but one of the effects of oblivion was precisely — since it meant that many of albertine’s less pleasing aspects of the boring hours that i had spent with her no longer figured in my memory ceased therefore to be reasons for my desiring that she should not be with me as i used to wish when she was still in the house — that it gave me a curtailed impression of her enhanced by all the love that i had ever felt for other women in this novel aspect of her oblivion which nevertheless was engaged upon making me accustomed to our separation made me by shewing me a more attractive albertine long all the more for her return

    since her departure very often when i was confident that i shewed no trace of tears i would ring for françoise and say to her “we must make sure that mademoiselle albertine hasn’t left anything behind her don’t forget to do her room it must be ready for her when she comes” or merely “only the other day mademoiselle albertine said to me let me think now it was the day before she left    ” i was anxious to diminish françoise’s abominable pleasure at albertine’s departure by letting her see that it was not to be prolonged i was anxious also to let françoise see that i was not afraid to speak of this departure to proclaim it — like certain generals who describe a forced retreat as a strategic withdrawal in conformity with a prearranged plan — as intended by myself as constituting an episode the true meaning of which i concealed for the moment but in no way implying the end of my friendship with albertine by repeating her name incessantly i sought in short to introduce like a breath of air something of herself into that room in which her departure had left a vacuum in which i could no longer breathe then moreover we seek to reduce the dimensions of our grief by making it enter into our everyday speech between ordering a suit of clothes and ordering dinner

    while she was doing albertine’s room françoise out of curiosity opened the drawer of a little rosewood table in which my mistress used to put away the ornaments which she discarded when she went to bed “oh monsieur mademoiselle albertine has forgotten to take her rings she has left them in the drawer” my first impulse was to say “we must send them after her” but this would make me appear uncertain of her return “very well” i replied after a moment of silence “it is hardly worth while sending them to her as she is coming back so soon give them to me i shall think about it” françoise handed me the rings with a distinct misgiving she loathed albertine but regarding me in her own image supposed that one could not hand me a letter in the handwriting of my mistress without the risk of my opening it i took the rings “monsieur must take care not to lose them” said françoise “such beauties as they are i don’t know who gave them to her if it was monsieur or some one else but i can see that it was some one rich who had good taste” “it was not i” i assured her “besides they don’t both come from the same person one was given her by her aunt and the other she bought for herself” “not from the same person” françoise exclaimed “monsieur must be joking they are just alike except that one of them has had a ruby added to it there’s the same eagle on both the same initials inside    ” i do not know whether françoise was conscious of the pain that she was causing me but she began at this point to curve her lips in a smile which never left them “what the same eagle you are talking nonsense it is true that the one without the ruby has an eagle upon it but on the other it is a sort of man’s head” “a man’s head where did monsieur discover that i had only to put on my spectacles to see at once that it was one of the eagle’s wings if monsieur will take his magnifying glass he will see the other wing on the other side the head and the beak in the middle you can count the feathers oh it’s a fine piece of work” my intense anxiety to know whether albertine had lied to me made me forget that i ought to maintain a certain dignity in françoise’s presence and deny her the wicked pleasure that she felt if not in torturing me at least in disparaging my mistress i remained breathless while françoise went to fetch my magnifying glass i took it from her asked her to shew me the eagle upon the ring with the ruby she had no difficulty in making me see the wings conventionalised in the same way as upon the other ring the feathers cut separately in relief the head she pointed out to me also the similar inscriptions to which it is true others were added upon the ring with the ruby and on the inside of both was albertine’s monogram “but i’m surprised that it should need all this to make monsieur see that the rings are the same” said françoise “even without examining them you can see that it is the same style the same way of turning the gold the same form as soon as i looked at them i could have sworn that they came from the same place you can tell it as you can tell the dishes of a good cook” and indeed to the curiosity of a servant whetted by hatred and trained to observe details with a startling precision there had been added to assist her in this expert criticism the taste that she had that same taste in fact which she shewed in her cookery and which was intensified perhaps as i had noticed when we left paris for balbec in her attire by the coquetry of a woman who was once goodlooking who has studied the jewels and dresses of other women i might have taken the wrong box of medicine and instead of swallowing a few capsules of veronal on a day when i felt that i had drunk too many cups of tea might have swallowed as many capsules of caffeine my heart would not have throbbed more violently i asked françoise to leave the room i would have liked to see albertine immediately to my horror at her falsehood to my jealousy of the unknown donor was added grief that she should have allowed herself to accept such presents i made her even more presents it is true but a woman whom we are keeping does not seem to us to be a kept woman so long as we do not know that she is being kept by other men and yet since i had continued to spend so much money upon her i had taken her notwithstanding this moral baseness this baseness i had maintained in her i had perhaps increased perhaps created it then just as we have the faculty of inventing fairy tales to soothe our grief just as we manage when we are dying of hunger to persuade ourselves that a stranger is going to leave us a fortune of a hundred millions i imagined albertine in my arms explaining to me in a few words that it was because of the similarity of its workmanship that she had bought the second ring that it was she who had had her initials engraved on it but this explanation was still feeble it had not yet had time to thrust into my mind its beneficent roots and my grief could not be so quickly soothed and i reflected that many men who tell their friends that their mistresses are very kind to them must suffer similar torments thus it is that they lie to others and to themselves they do not altogether lie they do spend in the woman’s company hours that are really pleasant but think of all that the kindness which their mistresses shew them before their friends and which enables them to boast and of all that the kindness which their mistresses shew when they are alone with them and which enables their lovers to bless them conceal of unrecorded hours in which the lover has suffered doubted sought everywhere in vain to discover the truth it is to such sufferings that we attach the pleasure of loving of delighting in the most insignificant remarks of a woman which we know to be insignificant but which we perfume with her scent at this moment i could no longer find any delight in inhaling by an act of memory the scent of albertine thunderstruck holding the two rings in my hand i stared at that pitiless eagle whose beak was rending my heart whose wings chiselled in high relief had borne away the confidence that i retained in my mistress in whose claws my tortured mind was unable to escape for an instant from the incessantly recurring questions as to the stranger whose name the eagle doubtless symbolised without however allowing me to decipher it whom she had doubtless loved in the past and whom she had doubtless seen again not so long ago since it was upon that day so pleasant so intimate of our drive together through the bois that i had seen for the first time the second ring that upon which the eagle appeared to be dipping his beak in the bright blood of the ruby

    if however morning noon and night i never ceased to grieve over albertine’s departure this did not mean that i was thinking only of her for one thing her charm having acquired a gradual ascendancy over things which in course of time were entirely detached from her but were nevertheless electrified by the same emotion that she used to give me if something made me think of incarville or of the verdurins or of some new part that léa was playing a flood of suffering would overwhelm me for another thing what i myself called thinking of albertine was thinking of how i might bring her back of how i might join her might know what she was doing with the result that if during those hours of incessant martyrdom there had been an illustrator present to represent the images which accompanied my sufferings you would have seen pictures of the gare d’orsay of the bank notes offered to mme bontemps of saintloup stooping over the sloping desk of a telegraph office at which he was writing out a telegram for myself never the picture of albertine just as throughout the whole course of our life our egoism sees before it all the time the objects that are of interest to ourselves but never takes in that ego itself which is incessantly observing them so the desire which directs our actions descends towards them but does not reascend to itself whether because being unduly utilitarian it plunges into the action and disdains all knowledge of it or because we have been looking to the future to compensate for the disappointments of the past or because the inertia of our mind urges it down the easy slope of imagination rather than make it reascend the steep slope of introspection as a matter of fact in those hours of crisis in which we would stake our whole life in proportion as the person upon whom it depends reveals more clearly the immensity of the place that she occupies in our life leaving nothing in the world which is not overthrown by her so the image of that person diminishes until it is not longer perceptible in everything we find the effect of her presence in the emotion that we feel herself the cause we do not find anywhere i was during these days so incapable of forming any picture of albertine that i could almost have believed that i was not in love with her just as my mother in the moments of desperation in which she was incapable of ever forming any picture of my grandmother save once in the chance encounter of a dream the importance of which she felt so intensely that she employed all the strength that remained to her in her sleep to make it last might have accused and did in fact accuse herself of not regretting her mother whose death had been a mortal blow to her but whose features escaped her memory

    why should i have supposed that albertine did not care for women because she had said especially of late that she did not care for them but did not our life rest upon a perpetual lie never once had she said to me “why is it that i cannot go out when and where i choose why do you always ask other people what i have been doing” and yet after all the conditions of her life were so unusual that she must have asked me this had she not herself guessed the reason and to my silence as to the causes of her claustration was it not comprehensible that she should correspond with a similar and constant silence as to her perpetual desires her innumerable memories and hopes françoise looked as though she knew that i was lying when i made an allusion to the imminence of albertine’s return and her belief seemed to be founded upon something more than that truth which generally guided our old housekeeper that masters do not like to be humiliated in front of their servants and allow them to know only so much of the truth as does not depart too far from a flattering fiction calculated to maintain respect for themselves this time françoise’s belief seemed to be founded upon something else as though she had herself aroused kept alive the distrust in albertine’s mind stimulated her anger driven her in short to the point at which she could predict her departure as inevitable if this was true my version of a temporary absence of which i had known and approved could be received with nothing but incredulity by françoise but the idea that she had formed of albertine’s venal nature the exasperation with which in her hatred she multiplied the ‘profit’ that albertine was supposed to be making out of myself might to some extent give a check to that certainty and so when in her hearing i made an allusion as if to something that was altogether natural to albertine’s immediate return françoise would look me in the face to see whether i was not inventing in the same way in which when the butler to make her angry read out to her changing the words some political news which she hesitated to believe as for instance the report of the closing of the churches and expulsion of the clergy even from the other end of the kitchen and without being able to read it she would fix her gaze instinctively and greedily upon the paper as though she had been able to see whether the report was really there

    when françoise saw that after writing a long letter i put on the envelope the address of mme bontemps this alarm hitherto quite vague that albertine might return increased in her it grew to a regular consternation when one morning she had to bring me with the rest of my mail a letter upon the envelope of which she had recognised albertine’s handwriting she asked herself whether albertine’s departure had not been a mere makebelieve a supposition which distressed her twice over as making definitely certain for the future albertine’s presence in the house and as bringing upon myself and thereby in so far as i was françoise’s master upon herself the humiliation of having been tricked by albertine however great my impatience to read her letter i could not refrain from studying for a moment françoise’s eyes from which all hope had fled inducing from this presage the imminence of albertine’s return as a lover of winter sports concludes with joy that the cold weather is at hand when he sees the swallows fly south at length françoise left me and when i had made sure that she had shut the door behind her i opened noiselessly so as not to appear anxious the letter which ran as follows

    “my dear thank you for all the nice things that you say to me i am at your orders to countermand the rolls if you think that i can help in any way as i am sure i can you have only to let me know the name of your agent you would let yourself be taken in by these people whose only thought is of selling things and what would you do with a motorcar you who never stir out of the house i am deeply touched that you have kept a happy memory of our last drive together you may be sure that for my part i shall never forget that drive in a twofold twilight since night was falling and we were about to part and that it will be effaced from my memory only when the darkness is complete”

    i felt that this final phrase was merely a phrase and that albertine could not possibly retain until her death any such pleasant memory of this drive from which she had certainly derived no pleasure since she had been impatient to leave me but i was impressed also when i thought of the bicyclist the golfer of balbec who had read nothing but esther before she made my acquaintance to find how richly endowed she was and how right i had been in thinking that she had in my house enriched herself with fresh qualities which made her different and more complete and thus the words that i had said to her at balbec “i feel that my friendship would be of value to you that i am just the person who could give you what you lack”— i had written this upon a photograph which i gave her —“with the certainty that i was being providential”— these words which i uttered without believing them and simply that she might find some advantage in my society which would outweigh any possible boredom these words turned out to have been true as well similarly for that matter when i said to her that i did not wish to see her for fear of falling in love with her i had said this because on the contrary i knew that in frequent intercourse my love grew cold and that separation kindled it but in reality our frequent intercourse had given rise to a need of her that was infinitely stronger than my love in the first weeks at balbec

    albertine’s letter did not help matters in any way she spoke to me only of writing to my agent it was necessary to escape from this situation to cut matters short and i had the following idea i sent a letter at once to andrée in which i told her that albertine was at her aunt’s that i felt very lonely that she would be giving me an immense pleasure if she came and stayed with me for a few days and that as i did not wish to make any mystery i begged her to inform albertine of this and at the same time i wrote to albertine as though i had not yet received her letter “my dear forgive me for doing something which you will understand so well i have such a hatred of secrecy that i have chosen that you should be informed by her and by myself i have acquired from having you staying so charmingly in the house with me the bad habit of not being able to live alone since we have decided that you are not to come back it has occurred to me that the person who would best fill your place because she would make least change in my life would remind me most strongly of yourself is andrée and i have invited her here so that all this may not appear too sudden i have spoken to her only of a short visit but between ourselves i am pretty certain that this time it will be permanent don’t you agree that i am right you know that your little group of girls at balbec has always been the social unit that has exerted the greatest influence upon me in which i have been most happy to be eventually included no doubt it is this influence which still makes itself felt since the fatal incompatibility of our natures and the mischances of life have decreed that my little albertine can never be my wife i believe that i shall nevertheless find a wife — less charming than herself but one whom greater conformities of nature will enable perhaps to be happier with me — in andrée” but after i had sent this letter to the post the suspicion occurred to me suddenly that when albertine wrote to me “i should have been only too delighted to come back if you had written to me myself” she had said this only because i had not written to her and that had i done so it would not have made any difference that she would be glad to know that andrée was staying with me to think of her as my wife provided that she herself remained free because she could now as for a week past stultifying the hourly precautions which i had adopted during more than six months in paris abandon herself to her vices and do what minute by minute i had prevented her from doing i told myself that probably she was making an improper use down there of her freedom and no doubt this idea which i formed seemed to me sad but remained general shewing me no special details and by the indefinite number of possible mistresses which it allowed me to imagine prevented me from stopping to consider any one of them drew my mind on in a sort of perpetual motion not free from pain but tinged with a pain which the absence of any concrete image rendered endurable it ceased however to be endurable and became atrocious when saintloup arrived before i explain why the information that he gave me made me so unhappy i ought to relate an incident which i place immediately before his visit and the memory of which so distressed me afterwards that it weakened if not the painful impression that was made on me by my conversation with saintloup at any rate the practical effect of this conversation this incident was as follows burning with impatience to see saintloup i was waiting for him upon the staircase a thing which i could not have done had my mother been at home for it was what she most abominated next to ‘talking from the window’ when i heard the following speech “do you mean to say you don’t know how to get a fellow sacked whom you don’t like it’s not difficult you need only hide the things that he has to take in then when they’re in a hurry and ring for him he can’t find anything he loses his head my aunt will be furious with him and will say to you ‘why what is the man doing’ when he does shew his face everybody will be raging and he won’t have what is wanted after this has happened four or five times you may be sure that they’ll sack him especially if you take care to dirty the things that he has to bring in clean and all that sort of thing” i remained speechless with astonishment for these cruel machiavellian words were uttered by the voice of saintloup now i had always regarded him as so good so tenderhearted a person that this speech had the same effect upon me as if he had been acting the part of satan in a play it could not be in his own name that he was speaking “but after all a man has got to earn his living” said the other person of whom i then caught sight and who was one of the duchesse de guermantes’s footmen “what the hell does that matter to you so long as you’re all right” saintloup replied callously “it will be all the more fun for you having a scapegoat you can easily spill ink over his livery just when he has to go and wait at a big dinnerparty and never leave him in peace for a moment until he’s only too glad to give notice anyhow i can put a spoke in his wheel i shall tell my aunt that i admire your patience in working with a great lout like that and so dirty too” i shewed myself saintloup came to greet me but my confidence in him was shaken since i had heard him speak in a manner so different from anything that i knew and i asked myself whether a person who was capable of acting so cruelly towards a poor and defenceless man had not played the part of a traitor towards myself on his mission to mme bontemps this reflexion was of most service in helping me not to regard his failure as a proof that i myself might not succeed after he had left me but so long as he was with me it was nevertheless of the saintloup of long ago and especially of the friend who had just come from mme bontemps that i thought he began by saying “you feel that i ought to have telephoned to you more often but i was always told that you were engaged” but the point at which my pain became unendurable was when he said “to begin where my last telegram left you after passing by a sort of shed i entered the house and at the end of a long passage was shewn into a drawingroom” at these words shed passage drawingroom and before he had even finished uttering them my heart was shattered more swiftly than by an electric current for the force which girdles the earth many times in a second is not electricity but pain how i repeated them to myself renewing the shock as i chose these words shed passage drawingroom after saintloup had left me in a shed one girl can lie down with another and in that drawingroom who could tell what albertine used to do when her aunt was not there what was this had i then imagined the house in which she was living as incapable of possessing either a shed or a drawingroom no i had not imagined it at all except as a vague place i had suffered originally at the geographical identification of the place in which albertine was when i had learned that instead of being in two or three possible places she was in touraine those words uttered by her porter had marked in my heart as upon a map the place in which i must at length suffer but once i had grown accustomed to the idea that she was in a house in touraine i had not seen the house never had there occurred to my imagination this appalling idea of a drawingroom a shed a passage which seemed to be facing me in the retina of saintloup’s eyes who had seen them these rooms in which albertine came and went was living her life these rooms in particular and not an infinity of possible rooms which had cancelled one another with the words shed passage drawingroom i became aware of my folly in having left albertine for a week in this cursed place the existence instead of the mere possibility of which had just been revealed to me alas when saintloup told me also that in this drawingroom he had heard some one singing at the top of her voice in an adjoining room and that it was albertine who was singing i realised with despair that rid of me at last she was happy she had regained her freedom and i who had been thinking that she would come to take the place of andrée my grief turned to anger with saintloup “that is the one thing in the world that i asked you to avoid that she should know of your coming” “if you imagine it was easy they had assured me that she was not in the house oh i know very well that you aren’t pleased with me i could tell that from your telegrams but you are not being fair to me i did all that i could” set free once more having left the cage from which here at home i used to remain for days on end without making her come to my room albertine had regained all her value in my eyes she had become once more the person whom everyone pursued the marvellous bird of the earliest days “however let us get back to business as for the question of the money i don’t know what to say to you i found myself addressing a woman who seemed to me to be so scrupulous that i was afraid of shocking her however she didn’t say no when i mentioned the money to her in fact a little later she told me that she was touched to find that we understood one another so well and yet everything that she said after that was so delicate so refined that it seemed to me impossible that she could have been referring to my offer of money when she said ‘we understand one another so well’ for after all i was behaving like a cad” “but perhaps she did not realise what you meant she cannot have heard you you ought to have repeated the offer for then you would certainly have won the battle” “but what do you mean by saying that she cannot have heard me i spoke to her as i am speaking to you she is neither deaf nor mad” “and she made no comment” “none” “you ought to have repeated the offer” “how do you mean repeat it as soon as we met i saw what sort of person she was i said to myself that you had made a mistake that you were letting me in for the most awful blunder and that it would be terribly difficult to offer her the money like that i did it however to oblige you feeling certain that she would turn me out of the house” “but she did not therefore either she had not heard you and you should have started afresh or you could have developed the topic” “you say ‘she had not heard’ because you were here in paris but i repeat if you had been present at our conversation there was not a sound to interrupt us i said it quite bluntly it is not possible that she failed to understand” “but anyhow is she quite convinced that i have always wished to marry her niece” “no as to that if you want my opinion she did not believe that you had any intention of marrying the girl she told me that you yourself had informed her niece that you wished to leave her i don’t really know whether now she is convinced that you wish to marry” this reassured me slightly by shewing me that i was less humiliated and therefore more capable of being still loved more free to take some decisive action nevertheless i was in torments “i am sorry because i can see that you are not pleased” “yes i am touched by your kindness i am grateful to you but it seems to me that you might    ” “i did my best no one else could have done more or even as much try sending some one else” “no as a matter of fact if i had known i should not have sent you but the failure of your attempt prevents me from making another” i heaped reproaches upon him he had tried to do me a service and had not succeeded saintloup as he left the house had met some girls coming in i had already and often supposed that albertine knew other girls in the country but this was the first time that i felt the torture of that supposition we are really led to believe that nature has allowed our mind to secrete a natural antidote which destroys the suppositions that we form at once without intermission and without danger but there was nothing to render me immune from these girls whom saintloup had met all these details were they not precisely what i had sought to learn from everyone with regard to albertine was it not i who in order to learn them more fully had begged saintloup summoned back to paris by his colonel to come and see me at all costs was it not therefore i who had desired them or rather my famished grief longing to feed and to wax fat upon them finally saintloup told me that he had had the pleasant surprise of meeting quite near the house the only familiar face that had reminded him of the past a former friend of rachel a pretty actress who was taking a holiday in the neighbourhood and the name of this actress was enough to make me say to myself “perhaps it is with her” was enough to make me behold in the arms even of a woman whom i did not know albertine smiling and flushed with pleasure and after all why should not this have been true had i found fault with myself for thinking of other women since i had known albertine on the evening of my first visit to the princesse de guermantes when i returned home had i not been thinking far less of her than of the girl of whom saintloup had told me who frequented disorderly houses and of mme putbus’s maid was it not in the hope of meeting the latter of these that i had returned to balbec and more recently had been planning to go to venice why should not albertine have been planning to go to touraine only when it came to the point as i now realised i would not have left her i would not have gone to venice even in my own heart of hearts when i said to myself “i shall leave her presently” i knew that i would never leave her just as i knew that i would never settle down again to work or make myself live upon hygienic principles or do any of the things which day by day i vowed that i would do upon the morrow only whatever i might feel in my heart i had thought it more adroit to let her live under the perpetual menace of a separation and no doubt thanks to my detestable adroitness i had convinced her only too well in any case now things could not go on like this i could not leave her in touraine with those girls with that actress i could not endure the thought of that life which was escaping my control i would await her reply to my letter if she was doing wrong alas a day more or less made no difference and perhaps i said this to myself because being no longer in the habit of taking note of every minute of her life whereas a single minute in which she was unobserved would formerly have driven me out of my mind my jealousy no longer observed the same division of time but as soon as i should have received her answer if she was not coming back i would go to fetch her willynilly i would tear her away from her women friends besides was it not better for me to go down in person now that i had discovered the duplicity hitherto unsuspected by me of saintloup he might for all i knew have organised a plot to separate me from albertine

    and at the same time how i should have been lying now had i written to her as i used to say to her in paris that i hoped that no accident might befall her ah if some accident had occurred my life instead of being poisoned for ever by this incessant jealousy would at once regain if not happiness at least a state of calm through the suppression of suffering

    the suppression of suffering can i really have believed it have believed that death merely eliminates what exists and leaves everything else in its place that it removes the grief from the heart of him for whom the other person’s existence has ceased to be anything but a source of grief that it removes the grief and substitutes nothing in its place the suppression of grief as i glanced at the paragraphs in the newspapers i regretted that i had not had the courage to form the same wish as swann if albertine could have been the victim of an accident were she alive i should have had a pretext for hastening to her bedside were she dead i should have recovered as swann said my freedom to live as i chose did i believe this he had believed it that subtlest of men who thought that he knew himself well how little do we know what we have in our heart how clearly a little later had he been still alive i could have proved to him that his wish was not only criminal but absurd that the death of her whom he loved would have set him free from nothing

    i forsook all pride with regard to albertine i sent her a despairing telegram begging her to return upon any conditions telling her that she might do anything she liked that i asked only to be allowed to take her in my arms for a minute three times a week before she went to bed and had she confined me to once a week i would have accepted the restriction she did not ever return my telegram had just gone to her when i myself received one it was from mme bontemps the world is not created once and for all time for each of us individually there are added to it in the course of our life things of which we have never had any suspicion alas it was not a suppression of suffering that was wrought in me by the first two lines of the telegram “my poor friend our little albertine is no more forgive me for breaking this terrible news to you who were so fond of her she was thrown by her horse against a tree while she was out riding all our efforts to restore her to life were unavailing if only i were dead in her place” no not the suppression of suffering but a suffering until then unimagined that of learning that she would not come back and yet had i not told myself many times that quite possibly she would not come back i had indeed told myself so but now i saw that never for a moment had i believed it as i needed her presence her kisses to enable me to endure the pain that my suspicions wrought in me i had formed since our balbec days the habit of being always with her even when she had gone out when i was left alone i was kissing her still i had continued to do so since her departure for touraine i had less need of her fidelity than of her return and if my reason might with impunity cast a doubt upon her now and again my imagination never ceased for an instant to bring her before me instinctively i passed my hand over my throat over my lips which felt themselves kissed by her lips still after she had gone away and would never be kissed by them again i passed my hands over them as mamma had caressed me at the time of grandmother’s death when she said “my poor boy your grandmother who was so fond of you will never kiss you again” all my life to come seemed to have been wrenched from my heart my life to come i had not then thought at times of living it without albertine why no all this time had i then been vowing to her service every minute of my life until my death why of course this future indissolubly blended with hers i had never had the vision to perceive but now that it had just been shattered i could feel the place that it occupied in my gaping heart françoise who still knew nothing came into my room in a sudden fury i shouted at her “what do you want” then there are sometimes words which set a different reality in the same place as that which confronts us they stun us as does a sudden fit of giddiness she said to me “monsieur has no need to look cross i’ve got something here that will make him very happy here are two letters from mademoiselle albertine” i felt afterwards that i must have stared at her with the eyes of a man whose mind has become unbalanced i was not even glad nor was i incredulous i was like a person who sees the same place in his room occupied by a sofa and by a grotto nothing seeming to him more real he collapses on the floor albertine’s two letters must have been written at an interval of a few hours possibly at the same moment and anyhow only a short while before the fatal ride the first said “my dear i must thank you for the proof of your confidence which you give me when you tell me of your plan to get andrée to stay with you i am sure that she will be delighted to accept and i think that it will be a very good thing for her with her talents she will know how to make the most of the companionship of a man like yourself and of the admirable influence which you manage to secure over other people i feel that you have had an idea from which as much good may spring for her as for yourself and so if she should make the least shadow of difficulty which i don’t suppose telegraph to me i undertake to bring pressure to bear upon her” the second was dated on the following day as a matter of fact she must have written her two letters at an interval of a few minutes possibly without any interval and must have antedated the first for all the time i had been forming an absurd idea of her intentions which had been only this to return to me and which anyone with no direct interest in the matter a man lacking in imagination the plenipotentiary in a peace treaty the merchant who has to examine a deal would have judged more accurately than myself it contained only these words “is it too late for me to return to you if you have not yet written to andrée would you be prepared to take me back i shall abide by your decision but i beg you not to be long in letting me know it you can imagine how impatiently i shall be waiting if it is telling me to return i shall take the train at once with my whole heart yours albertine”

    for the death of albertine to be able to suppress my suffering the shock of the fall would have had to kill her not only in touraine but in myself there never had she been more alive in order to enter into us another person must first have assumed the form have entered into the surroundings of the moment appearing to us only in a succession of momentary flashes he has never been able to furnish us with more than one aspect of himself at a time to present us with more than a single photograph of himself a great weakness no doubt for a person to consist merely in a collection of moments a great strength also it is dependent upon memory and our memory of a moment is not informed of everything that has happened since this moment which it has registered endures still lives still and with it the person whose form is outlined in it and moreover this disintegration does not only make the dead man live it multiplies him to find consolation it was not one it was innumerable albertines that i must first forget when i had reached the stage of enduring the grief of losing this albertine i must begin afresh with another with a hundred others

    so then my life was entirely altered what had made it — and not owing to albertine concurrently with her when i was alone — attractive was precisely the perpetual resurgence at the bidding of identical moments of moments from the past from the sound of the rain i recaptured the scent of the lilacs at combray from the shifting of the sun’s rays on the balcony the pigeons in the champselysées from the muffling of all noise in the heat of the morning hours the cool taste of cherries the longing for brittany or venice from the sound of the wind and the return of easter summer was at hand the days were long the weather warm it was the season when early in the morning pupils and teachers resort to the public gardens to prepare for the final examinations under the trees seeking to extract the sole drop of coolness that is let fall by a sky less ardent than in the midday heat but already as sterilely pure from my darkened room with a power of evocation equal to that of former days but capable now of evoking only pain i felt that outside in the heaviness of the atmosphere the setting sun was plastering the vertical fronts of houses and churches with a tawny distemper and if françoise when she came in parted by accident the inner curtains i stifled a cry of pain at the gash that was cut in my heart by that ray of longago sunlight which had made beautiful in my eyes the modern front of marcouville l’orgueilleuse when albertine said to me “it is restored” not knowing how to account to françoise for my groan i said to her “oh i am so thirsty” she left the room returned but i turned sharply away smarting under the painful discharge of one of the thousand invisible memories which at every moment burst into view in the surrounding darkness i had noticed that she had brought in a jug of cider and a dish of cherries things which a farmlad had brought out to us in the carriage at balbec ‘kinds’ in which i should have made the most perfect communion in those days with the prismatic gleam in shuttered diningrooms on days of scorching heat then i thought for the first time of the farm called les ecorres and said to myself that on certain days when albertine had told me at balbec that she would not be free that she was obliged to go somewhere with her aunt she had perhaps been with one or another of her girl friends at some farm to which she knew that i was not in the habit of going and while i waited desperately for her at marieantoinette where they told me “no we have not seen her today” had been using to her friend the same words that she used to say to myself when we went out together “he will never think of looking for us here so that there’s no fear of our being disturbed” i told françoise to draw the curtains together so that i should not see that ray of sunlight but it continued to filter through just as corrosive into my memory “it doesn’t appeal to me it has been restored but we shall go tomorrow to saintmars le vêtu and the day after to    ” tomorrow the day after it was a prospect of life shared in common perhaps for all time that was opening my heart leaped towards it but it was no longer there albertine was dead

    i asked françoise the time six o’clock at last thank god that oppressive heat would be lifted of which in the past i used to complain to albertine and which we so enjoyed the day was drawing to its close but what did that profit me the cool evening air came in it was the sun setting in my memory at the end of a road which we had taken she and i on our way home that i saw now more remote than the farthest village like some distant town not to be reached that evening which we would spend at balbec still together together then now i must stop short on the brink of that same abyss she was dead it was not enough now to draw the curtains i tried to stop the eyes and ears of my memory so as not to see that band of orange in the western sky so as not to hear those invisible birds responding from one tree to the next on either side of me who was then so tenderly embraced by her that now was dead i tried to avoid those sensations that are given us by the dampness of leaves in the evening air the steep rise and fall of muletracks but already those sensations had gripped me afresh carried far enough back from the present moment so that it should have gathered all the recoil all the resilience necessary to strike me afresh this idea that albertine was dead ah never again would i enter a forest i would stroll no more beneath the spreading trees but would the broad plains be less cruel to me how many times had i crossed going in search of albertine how many times had i entered on my return with her the great plain of cricqueville now in foggy weather when the flooding mist gave us the illusion of being surrounded by a vast lake now on limpid evenings when the moonlight dematerialising the earth making it appear a yard away celestial as it is in the daytime on far horizons only enshrined the fields the woods with the firmament to which it had assimilated them in the mossagate of a universal blue

    françoise was bound to rejoice at albertine’s death and it should in justice to her be said that by a sort of tactful convention she made no pretence of sorrow but the unwritten laws of her immemorial code and the tradition of the mediaeval peasant woman who weeps as in the romances of chivalry were older than her hatred of albertine and even of eulalie and so on one of these late afternoons as i was not quick enough in concealing my distress she caught sight of my tears served by the instinct of a little old peasant woman which at one time had led her to catch and torture animals to feel only amusement in wringing the necks of chickens and in boiling lobsters alive and when i was ill in observing as it might be the wounds that she had inflicted upon an owl my suffering expression which she afterwards proclaimed in a sepulchral tone and as a presage of coming disaster but her combray ‘customary’ did not permit her to treat lightly tears grief things which in her judgment were as fatal as shedding one’s flannels in spring or eating when one had no ‘stomach’ “oh no monsieur it doesn’t do to cry like that it isn’t good for you” and in her attempt to stem my tears she shewed as much uneasiness as though they had been torrents of blood unfortunately i adopted a chilly air that cut short the effusions in which she was hoping to indulge and which might quite well for that matter have been sincere her attitude towards albertine had been perhaps akin to her attitude towards eulalie and now that my mistress could no longer derive any profit from me françoise had ceased to hate her she felt bound however to let me see that she was perfectly well aware that i was crying and that following the deplorable example set by my family i did not wish to ‘let it be seen’ “you mustn’t cry monsieur” she adjured me in a calmer tone this time and intending to prove her own perspicacity rather than to shew me any compassion and she went on “it was bound to happen she was too happy poor creature she never knew how happy she was”

    how slow the day is in dying on these interminable summer evenings a pallid ghost of the house opposite continued indefinitely to sketch upon the sky its persistent whiteness at last it was dark indoors i stumbled against the furniture in the hall but in the door that opened upon the staircase in the midst of the darkness which i had supposed to be complete the glazed panel was translucent and blue with the blue of a flower the blue of an insect’s wing a blue that would have seemed to me beautiful if i had not felt it to be a last reflexion trenchant as a blade of steel a supreme blow which in its indefatigable cruelty the day was still dealing me in the end however the darkness became complete but then a glimpse of a star behind one of the trees in the courtyard was enough to remind me of how we used to set out in a carriage after dinner for the woods of chantepie carpeted with moonlight and even in the streets it would so happen that i could isolate upon the back of a seat could gather there the natural purity of a moonbeam in the midst of the artificial lights of paris of that paris over which it enthroned by making the town return for a moment in my imagination to a state of nature with the infinite silence of the suggested fields the heartrending memory of the walks that i had taken in them with albertine ah when would the night end but at the first cool breath of dawn i shuddered for it had revived in me the delight of that summer when from balbec to incarville from incarville to balbec we had so many times escorted each other home until the break of day i had now only one hope left for the future — a hope far more heartrending than any dread — which was that i might forget albertine i knew that i should one day forget her i had quite forgotten gilberte mme de guermantes i had quite forgotten my grandmother and it is our most fitting and most cruel punishment for that so complete oblivion as tranquil as the oblivion of the graveyard by which we have detached ourself from those whom we no longer love that we can see this same oblivion to be inevitable in the case of those whom we love still to tell the truth we know it to be a state not painful a state of indifference but not being able to think at the same time of what i was and of what i should one day be i thought with despair of all that covering mantle of caresses of kisses of friendly slumber of which i must presently let myself be divested for all time the rush of these tender memories sweeping on to break against the knowledge that albertine was dead oppressed me by the incessant conflict of their baffled waves so that i could not keep still i rose but all of a sudden i stopped in consternation the same faint daybreak that i used to see at the moment when i had just left albertine still radiant and warm with her kisses had come into the room and bared above the curtains its blade now a sinister portent whose whiteness cold implacable and compact entered the room like a dagger thrust into my heart

    presently the sounds from the streets would begin enabling me to tell from the qualitative scale of their resonance the degree of the steadily increasing heat in which they were sounding but in this heat which a few hours later would have saturated itself in the fragrance of cherries what i found as in a medicine which the substitution of one ingredient for another is sufficient to transform from the stimulant and tonic that it was into a debilitating drug was no longer the desire for women but the anguish of albertine’s departure besides the memory of all my desires was as much impregnated with her and with suffering as the memory of my pleasures that venice where i had thought that her company would be a nuisance doubtless because i had felt in a confused way that it would be necessary to me now that albertine was no more i preferred not to go there albertine had seemed to me to be an obstacle interposed between me and everything else because she was for me what contained everything and it was from her as from an urn that i might receive things now that this urn was shattered i no longer felt that i had the courage to grasp things there was nothing now from which i did not turn away spiritless preferring not to taste it so that my separation from her did not in the least throw open to me the field of possible pleasures which i had imagined to be closed to me by her presence besides the obstacle which her presence had perhaps indeed been in the way of my traveling of my enjoying life had only as always happens been a mask for other obstacles which reappeared intact now that this first obstacle had been removed it had been in the same way that in the past when some friend had called to see me and had prevented me from working if on the following day i was left undisturbed i did not work any better let an illness a duel a runaway horse make us see death face to face how richly we should have enjoyed the life of pleasure the travels in unknown lands which are about to be snatched from us and no sooner is the danger past than what we find once again before us is the same dull life in which none of those delights had any existence for us

    no doubt these nights that are so short continue for but a brief season winter would at length return when i should no longer have to dread the memory of drives with her protracted until the too early dawn but would not the first frosts bring back to me preserved in their cold storage the germ of my first desires when at midnight i used to send for her when the time seemed so long until i heard her ring the bell a sound for which i might now wait everlastingly in vain would they not bring back to me the germ of my first uneasiness when upon two occasions i thought that she was not coming at that time i saw her but rarely but even those intervals that there were between her visits which made her emerge after many weeks from the heart of an unknown life which i made no effort to possess ensured my peace of mind by preventing the first inklings constantly interrupted of my jealousy from coagulating from forming a solid mass in my heart so far as they had contrived to be soothing at that earlier time so far in retrospect were they stamped with the mark of suffering since all the unaccountable things that she might while those intervals lasted have been doing had ceased to be immaterial to me and especially now that no visit from her would ever fall to my lot again so that those january evenings on which she used to come and which for that reason had been so dear to me would blow into me now with their biting winds an uneasiness which then i did not know and would bring back to me but now grown pernicious the first germ of my love and when i considered that i would see again presently that cold season which since the time of gilberte and my playhours in the champselysées had always seemed to me so depressing when i thought that there would be returning again evenings like that evening of snow when i had vainly far into the night waited for albertine to come then as a consumptive chooses the best place from the physical point of view for his lungs but in my case making a moral choice what at such moments i still dreaded most for my grief for my heart was the return of the intense cold and i said to myself that what it would be hardest to live through was perhaps the winter bound up as it was with each of the seasons in order for me to discard the memory of albertine i should have had first to forget them all prepared to begin again to learn to know them as an old man after a stroke of paralysis learns again to read i should have had first to forego the entire universe nothing i told myself but an actual extinction of myself would be capable but that was impossible of consoling me for hers i did not realise that the death of oneself is neither impossible nor extraordinary it is effected without our knowledge it may be against our will every day of our life and i should have to suffer from the recurrence of all sorts of days which not only nature but adventitious circumstances a purely conventional order introduce into a season presently would return the day on which i had gone to balbec in that earlier summer when my love which was not yet inseparable from jealousy and did not perplex itself with the problem of what albertine would be doing all day had still to pass through so many evolutions before becoming that so specialised love of the latest period that this final year in which albertine’s destiny had begun to change and had received its quietus appeared to me full multiform vast like a whole century then it would be the memory of days more slow in reviving but dating from still earlier years on the rainy sundays on which nevertheless everyone else had gone out in the void of the afternoon when the sound of wind and rain would in the past have bidden me stay at home to ‘philosophise in my garret’ with what anxiety would i see the hour approach at which albertine so little expected had come to visit me had fondled me for the first time breaking off because françoise had brought in the lamp in that time now doubly dead when it had been albertine who was interested in me when my affection for her might legitimately nourish so strong a hope even later in the season those glorious evenings when the windows of kitchens of girls’ schools standing open to the view like wayside shrines allow the street to crown itself with a diadem of those demigoddesses who conversing ever so close to us with their peers fill us with a feverish longing to penetrate into their mythological existence recalled to me nothing now but the affection of albertine whose company was an obstacle in the way of my approaching them

    moreover to the memory even of hours that were purely natural would inevitably be added the moral background that makes each of them a thing apart when later on i should hear the goatherd’s horn on a first fine almost italian morning the day that followed would blend successively with its sunshine the anxiety of knowing that albertine was at the trocadéro possibly with léa and the two girls then her kindly domestic gentleness almost that of a wife who seemed to me then an embarrassment and whom françoise was bringing home to me that telephone message from françoise which had conveyed to me the dutiful homage of an albertine who was returning with her i had thought at the time that it made me swell with pride i was mistaken if it had exhilarated me that was because it had made me feel that she whom i loved was really mine lived only for me and even at a distance without my needing to occupy my mind with her regarded me as her lord and master returning home upon a sign from myself and so that telephone message had been a particle of sweetness coming to me from afar sent out from that region of the trocadéro where there were proved to be for me sources of happiness directing towards me molecules of comfort healing balms restoring to me at length so precious a liberty of spirit that i need do no more surrendering myself without the restriction of a single care to wagner’s music than await the certain arrival of albertine without fever with an entire absence of impatience in which i had not had the perspicacity to recognise true happiness and this happiness that she should return that she should obey me and be mine the cause of it lay in love and not in pride it would have been quite immaterial to me now to have at my behest fifty women returning at a sign from myself not from the trocadéro but from the indies but that day conscious of albertine who while i sat alone in my room playing music was coming dutifully to join me i had breathed in where it lay scattered like motes in a sunbeam one of those substances which just as others are salutary to the body do good to the soul then there had been half an hour later albertine’s return then the drive with albertine returned a drive which i had thought tedious because it was accompanied for me by certainty but which on account of that very certainty had from the moment of francoise’s telephoning to me that she was bringing albertine home let flow a golden calm over the hours that followed had made of them as it were a second day wholly unlike the first because it had a completely different moral basis a moral basis which made it an original day which came and added itself to the variety of the days that i had previously known a day which i should never have been able to imagine — any more than we could imagine the delicious idleness of a day in summer if such days did not exist in the calendar of those through which we had lived — a day of which i could not say absolutely that i recalled it for to this calm i added now an anguish which i had not felt at the time but at a much later date when i went over gradually in a reversed order the times through which i had passed before i was so much in love with albertine when my scarred heart could detach itself without suffering from albertine dead then i was able to recall at length without suffering that day on which albertine had gone shopping with françoise instead of remaining at the trocadéro i recalled it with pleasure as belonging to a moral season which i had not known until then i recalled it at length exactly without adding to it now any suffering rather on the contrary as we recall certain days in summer which we found too hot while they lasted and from which only after they have passed do we extract their unalloyed standard of fine gold and imperishable azure

    with the result that these several years imposed upon my memory of albertine which made them so painful the successive colouring the different modulations not only of their seasons or of their hours from late afternoons in june to winter evenings from seas by moonlight to dawn that broke as i was on my way home from snow in paris to fallen leaves at saintcloud but also of each of the particular ideas of albertine that i successively formed of the physical aspect in which i pictured her at each of those moments the degree of frequency with which i had seen her during that season which itself appeared consequently more or less dispersed or compact the anxieties which she might have caused me by keeping me waiting the desire which i had felt at a given moment for her the hopes formed and then blasted all of these modified the character of my retrospective sorrow fully as much as the impressions of light or of scents which were associated with it and completed each of the solar years through which i had lived — years which simply with their springs their trees their breezes were already so sad because of the indissociable memory of her — complementing each of them with a sort of sentimental year in which the hours were defined not by the sun’s position but by the strain of waiting for a tryst in which the length of the days in which the changes of temperature were determined not by the seasons but by the soaring flight of my hopes the progress of our intimacy the gradual transformation of her face the expeditions on which she had gone the frequency and style of the letters that she had written me during her absence her more or less eager anxiety to see me on her return and lastly if these changes of season if these different days furnished me each with a fresh albertine it was not only by recalling to me similar moments the reader will remember that always even before i began to be in love each day had made me a different person swayed by other desires because he had other perceptions a person who whereas he had dreamed only of cliffs and tempests overnight if the indiscreet spring dawn had distilled a scent of roses through the gaping portals of his house of sleep would awake alert to set off for italy even in my love had not the changing state of my moral atmosphere the varying pressure of my beliefs had they not one day diminished the visibility of the love that i was feeling had they not another day extended it beyond all bounds one day softened it to a smile another day condensed it to a storm we exist only by virtue of what we possess we possess only what is really present to us and so many of our memories our humours our ideas set out to voyage far away from us until they are lost to sight then we can no longer make them enter into our reckoning of the total which is our personality but they know of secret paths by which to return to us and on certain nights having gone to sleep almost without regretting albertine any more — we can regret only what we remember — on awakening i found a whole fleet of memories which had come to cruise upon the surface of my clearest consciousness and seemed marvellously distinct then i wept over what i could see so plainly what overnight had been to me nonexistent in an instant albertine’s name her death had changed their meaning her betrayals had suddenly resumed their old importance

    how could she have seemed dead to me when now in order to think of her i had at my disposal only those same images one or other of which i used to recall when she was alive each one being associated with a particular moment rapid and bowed above the mystic wheel of her bicycle tightly strapped upon rainy days in the amazonian corslet of her waterproof which made her breasts protrude while serpents writhed in her turbaned hair she scattered terror in the streets of balbec on the evenings on which we had taken champagne with us to the woods of chantepie her voice provoking altered she shewed on her face that pallid warmth colouring only over her cheekbones so that barely able to make her out in the darkness of the carriage i drew her face into the moonlight in order to see her better and which i tried now in vain to recapture to see again in a darkness that would never end a little statuette as we drove to the island a large calm coarsely grained face above the pianola she was thus by turns rainsoaked and swift provoking and diaphanous motionless and smiling an angel of music so that what would have to be obliterated in me was not one only but countless albertines each of these was thus attached to a moment to the date of which i found myself carried back when i saw again that particular albertine and the moments of the past do not remain still they retain in our memory the motion which drew them towards the future towards a future which has itself become the past and draw us on in their train never had i caressed the waterproofed albertine of the rainy days i wanted to ask her to divest herself of that armour that would be to know with her the love of the tented field the brotherhood of travel but this was no longer possible she was dead never either for fear of corrupting her had i shewn any sign of comprehension on the evenings when she seemed to be offering me pleasures which but for my selfrestraint she would not perhaps have sought from others and which aroused in me now a frantic desire i should not have found them the same in any other woman but she who would fain have offered me them i might scour the whole world now without encountering for albertine was dead it seemed that i had to choose between two sets of facts to decide which was the truth so far was the fact of albertine’s death — arising for me from a reality which i had not known her life in touraine — a contradiction of all my thoughts of her my desires my regrets my tenderness my rage my jealousy so great a wealth of memories borrowed from the treasury of her life such a profusion of sentiments evoking implicating her life seemed to make it incredible that albertine should be dead such a profusion of sentiments for my memory while preserving my affection left to it all its variety it was not albertine alone that was simply a series of moments it was also myself my love for her had not been simple to a curious interest in the unknown had been added a sensual desire and to a sentiment of an almost conjugal mildness at one moment indifference at another a jealous fury i was not one man only but the steady advance hour after hour of an army in close formation in which there appeared according to the moment impassioned men indifferent men jealous men — jealous men no two of whom were jealous of the same woman and no doubt it would be from this that one day would come the healing which i should not expect in a composite mass these elements may one by one without our noticing it be replaced by others which others again eliminate or reinforce until in the end a change has been brought about which it would be impossible to conceive if we were a single person the complexity of my love of my person multiplied diversified my sufferings and yet they could always be ranged in the two categories the option between which had made up the whole life of my love for albertine swayed alternately by trust and by a jealous suspicion

    if i had found it difficult to imagine that albertine so vitally alive in me wearing as i did the double harness of the present and the past was dead perhaps it was equally paradoxical in me that albertine whom i knew to be dead could still excite my jealousy and that this suspicion of the misdeeds of which albertine stripped now of the flesh that had rejoiced in them of the heart that had been able to desire them was no longer capable nor responsible for them should excite in me so keen a suffering that i should only have blessed them could i have seen in those misdeeds the pledge of the moral reality of a person materially nonexistent in place of the reflexion destined itself too to fade of impressions that she had made on me in the past a woman who could no longer taste any pleasure with other people ought not any longer to have excited my jealousy if only my affection had been able to come to the surface but this was just what was impossible since it could not find its object albertine save among memories in which she was still alive since merely by thinking of her i brought her back to life her infidelities could never be those of a dead woman the moments at which she had been guilty of them became the present moment not only for albertine but for that one of my various selves who was thinking of her so that no anachronism could ever separate the indissoluble couple in which to each fresh culprit was immediately mated a jealous lover pitiable and always contemporaneous i had during the last months kept her shut up in my own house but in my imagination now albertine was free she was abusing her freedom was prostituting herself to this friend or to that formerly i used constantly to dream of the uncertain future that was unfolding itself before us i endeavoured to read its message and now what lay before me like a counterpart of the future — as absorbing as the future because it was equally uncertain as difficult to decipher as mysterious more cruel still because i had not as with the future the possibility or the illusion of influencing it and also because it unrolled itself to the full extent of my own life without my companion’s being present to soothe the anguish that it caused me — was no longer albertine’s future it was her past her past that is the wrong word since for jealousy there can be neither past nor future and what it imagines is invariably the present

    atmospheric changes provoking other changes in the inner man awaken forgotten variants of himself upset the somnolent course of habit restore their old force to certain memories to certain sufferings how much the more so with me if this change of weather recalled to me the weather in which albertine at balbec under the threat of rain it might be used to set out heaven knows why upon long rides in the clinging mailarmour of her waterproof if she had lived no doubt today in this so similar weather she would be setting out in touraine upon a corresponding expedition since she could do so no longer i ought not to have been pained by the thought but as with amputated cripples the slightest change in the weather revived my pains in the member that had ceased now to belong to me

    all of a sudden it was an impression which i had not felt for a long time — for it had remained dissolved in the fluid and invisible expanse of my memory — that became crystallised many years ago when somebody mentioned her bathwrap albertine had blushed at that time i was not jealous of her but since then i had intended to ask her if she could remember that conversation and why she had blushed this had worried me all the more because i had been told that the two girls léa’s friends frequented the bathing establishment of the hotel and it was said not merely for the purpose of taking baths but for fear of annoying albertine or else deciding to await some more opportune moment i had always refrained from mentioning it to her and in time had ceased to think about it and all of a sudden some time after albertine’s death i recalled this memory stamped with the mark at once irritating and solemn of riddles left for ever insoluble by the death of the one person who could have interpreted them might i not at least try to make certain that albertine had never done anything wrong in that bathing establishment by sending some one to balbec i might perhaps succeed while she was alive i should doubtless have been unable to learn anything but people’s tongues become strangely loosened and they are ready to report a misdeed when they need no longer fear the culprit’s resentment as the constitution of our imagination which has remained rudimentary simplified not having passed through the countless transformations which improve upon the primitive models of human inventions barely recognisable whether it be the barometer the balloon the telephone or anything else in their ultimate perfection allows us to see only a very few things at one time the memory of the bathing establishment occupied the whole field of my inward vision

    sometimes i came in collision in the dark lanes of sleep with one of those bad dreams which are not very serious for several reasons one of these being that the sadness which they engender lasts for barely an hour after we awake like the weakness that is caused by an artificial soporific for another reason also namely that we encounter them but very rarely no more than once in two or three years and moreover it remains uncertain whether we have encountered them before whether they have not rather that aspect of not being seen for the first time which is projected over them by an illusion a subdivision for duplication would not be a strong enough term

    of course since i entertained doubts as to the life the death of albertine i ought long since to have begun to make inquiries but the same weariness the same cowardice which had made me give way to albertine when she was with me prevented me from undertaking anything since i had ceased to see her and yet from a weakness that had dragged on for years on end a flash of energy sometimes emerged i decided to make this investigation which after all was perfectly natural one would have said that nothing else had occurred in albertine’s whole life i asked myself whom i could best send down to make inquiries on the spot at balbec aimé seemed to me to be a suitable person apart from his thorough knowledge of the place he belonged to that category of plebeian folk who have a keen eye to their own advantage are loyal to those whom they serve indifferent to any thought of morality and of whom — because if we pay them well in their obedience to our will they suppress everything that might in one way or another go against it shewing themselves as incapable of indiscretion weakness or dishonesty as they are devoid of scruples — we say “they are good fellows” in such we can repose an absolute confidence when aimé had gone i thought how much more to the point it would have been if instead of sending him down to try to discover something there i had now been able to question albertine herself and at once the thought of this question which i would have liked which it seemed to me that i was about to put to her having brought albertine into my presence — not thanks to an effort of resurrection but as though by one of those chance encounters which as is the case with photographs that are not posed with snapshots always make the person appear more alive — at the same time in which i imagined our conversation i felt how impossible it was i had just approached a fresh aspect of the idea that albertine was dead albertine who inspired in me that affection which we have for the absent the sight of whom does not come to correct the embellished image inspiring also sorrow that this absence must be eternal and that the poor child should be deprived for ever of the joys of life and immediately by an abrupt change of mood from the torments of jealousy i passed to the despair of separation

    what filled my heart now was in the place of odious suspicions the affectionate memory of hours of confiding tenderness spent with the sister whom death had really made me lose since my grief was related not to what albertine had been to me but to what my heart anxious to participate in the most general emotions of love had gradually persuaded me that she was then i became aware that the life which had bored me so — so at least i thought — had been on the contrary delicious to the briefest moments spent in talking to her of things that were quite insignificant i felt now that there was added amalgamated a pleasure which at the time had not — it is true — been perceived by me but which was already responsible for making me turn so perseveringly to those moments to the exclusion of any others the most trivial incidents which i recalled a movement that she had made in the carriage by my side or to sit down facing me in my room dispersed through my spirit an eddy of sweetness and sorrow which little by little overwhelmed it altogether

    this room in which we used to dine had never seemed to me attractive i had told albertine that it was attractive merely in order that my mistress might be content to live in it now the curtains the chairs the books had ceased to be unimportant art is not alone in imparting charm and mystery to the most insignificant things the same power of bringing them into intimate relation with ourselves is committed also to grief at the moment i had paid no attention to the dinner which we had eaten together after our return from the bois before i went to the verdurins’ and towards the beauty the solemn sweetness of which i now turned my eyes filled with tears an impression of love is out of proportion to the other impressions of life but it is not when it is lost in their midst that we can take account of it it is not from its foot in the tumult of the street and amid the thronging houses it is when we are far away that from the slope of a neighbouring hill at a distance from which the whole town has disappeared or appears only as a confused mass upon the ground we can in the calm detachment of solitude and dusk appreciate unique persistent and pure the height of a cathedral i tried to embrace the image of albertine through my tears as i thought of all the serious and sensible things that she had said that evening

    one morning i thought that i could see the oblong shape of a hill swathed in mist that i could taste the warmth of a cup of chocolate while my heart was horribly wrung by the memory of that afternoon on which albertine had come to see me and i had kissed her for the first time the fact was that i had just heard the hiccough of the hotwater pipes the furnace having just been started and i flung angrily away an invitation which françoise brought me from mme verdurin how the impression that i had felt when i went to dine for the first time at la raspelière that death does not strike us all at the same age overcame me with increased force now that albertine was dead so young while brichot continued to dine with mme verdurin who was still entertaining and would perhaps continue to entertain for many years to come at once the name of brichot recalled to me the end of that evening party when he had accompanied me home when i had seen from the street the light of albertine’s lamp i had already thought of it upon many occasions but i had not approached this memory from the same angle then when i thought of the void which i should now find upon returning home that i should never again see from the street albertine’s room the light in which was extinguished for ever i realised how that evening in parting from brichot i had thought that i was bored that i regretted my inability to stroll about the streets and make love elsewhere i realised how greatly i had been mistaken that it was only because the treasure whose reflexions came down to me in the street had seemed to be entirely in my possession that i had failed to calculate its value which meant that it seemed to me of necessity inferior to pleasures however slight of which however in seeking to imagine them i enhanced the value i realised how much that light which had seemed to me to issue from a prison contained for me of fulness of life and sweetness all of which was but the realisation of what had for a moment intoxicated me and had then seemed for ever impossible i began to understand that this life which i had led in paris in a home which was also her home was precisely the realisation of that profound peace of which i had dreamed on the night when albertine had slept under the same roof as myself at balbec the conversation which i had had with albertine after our return from the bois before that party at the verdurins’ i should not have been consoled had it never occurred that conversation which had to some extent introduced albertine into my intellectual life and in certain respects had made us one for no doubt if i returned with melting affection to her intelligence to her kindness to myself it was not because they were any greater than those of other persons whom i had known had not mme de cambremer said to me at balbec “what you might be spending your days with elstir who is a genius and you spend them with your cousin” albertine’s intelligence pleased me because by association it revived in me what i called its sweetness as we call the sweetness of a fruit a certain sensation which exists only in our palate and in fact when i thought of albertine’s intelligence my lips instinctively protruded and tasted a memory of which i preferred that the reality should remain external to me and should consist in the objective superiority of another person there could be no denying that i had known people whose intelligence was greater but the infinitude of love or its egoism has the result that the people whom we love are those whose intellectual and moral physiognomy is least defined objectively in our eyes we alter them incessantly to suit our desires and fears we do not separate them from ourselves they are only a vast and vague place in which our affections take root we have not of our own body into which flow perpetually so many discomforts and pleasures as clear an outline as we have of a tree or house or of a passerby and where i had gone wrong was perhaps in not making more effort to know albertine in herself just as from the point of view of her charm i had long considered only the different positions that she occupied in my memory in the procession of years and had been surprised to see that she had been spontaneously enriched with modifications which were due merely to the difference of perspective so i ought to have sought to understand her character as that of an ordinary person and thus perhaps finding an explanation of her persistence in keeping her secret from me might have averted the continuance between us with that strange desperation of the conflict which had led to the death of albertine and i then felt with an intense pity for her shame at having survived her it seemed to me indeed in the hours when i suffered least that i had derived a certain benefit from her death for a woman is of greater service to our life if she is in it instead of being an element of happiness an instrument of sorrow and there is not a woman in the world the possession of whom is as precious as that of the truths which she reveals to us by causing us to suffer in these moments thinking at once of my grandmother’s death and of albertine’s it seemed to me that my life was stained with a double murder from which only the cowardice of the world could absolve me i had dreamed of being understood by albertine of not being scorned by her thinking that it was for the great happiness of being understood of not being scorned when so many other people might have served me better we wish to be understood because we wish to be loved and we wish to be loved because we are in love the understanding of other people is immaterial and their love importunate my joy at having possessed a little of albertine’s intelligence and of her heart arose not from their intrinsic worth but from the fact that this possession was a stage farther towards the complete possession of albertine a possession which had been my goal and my chimera since the day on which i first set eyes on her when we speak of the ‘kindness’ of a woman we do no more perhaps than project outside ourselves the pleasure that we feel in seeing her like children when they say “my dear little bed my dear little pillow my dear little hawthorns” which explains incidentally why men never say of a woman who is not unfaithful to them “she is so kind” and say it so often of a woman by whom they are betrayed mme de cambremer was right in thinking that elstir’s intellectual charm was greater but we cannot judge in the same way the charm of a person who is like everyone else exterior to ourselves painted upon the horizon of our mind and that of a person who in consequence of an error in localisation which has been due to certain accidents but is irreparable has lodged herself in our own body so effectively that the act of asking ourselves in retrospect whether she did not look at a woman on a particular day in the corridor of a little seaside railwaytram makes us feel the same anguish as would a surgeon probing for a bullet in our heart a simple crescent of bread but one which we are eating gives us more pleasure than all the ortolans young rabbits and barbavelles that were set before louis xv and the blade of grass which a few inches away quivers before our eye while we are lying upon the mountainside may conceal from us the sheer summit of another peak if it is several miles away

    furthermore our mistake is our failure to value the intelligence the kindness of a woman whom we love however slight they may be our mistake is our remaining indifferent to the kindness the intelligence of others falsehood begins to cause us the indignation and kindness the gratitude which they ought always to arouse in us only if they proceed from a woman with whom we are in love and bodily desire has the marvellous faculty of restoring its value to intelligence and a solid base to the moral life never should i find again that divine thing a person with whom i might talk freely of everything in whom i might confide confide but did not other people offer me greater confidence than albertine had i not had with others more unrestricted conversations the fact is that confidence conversation trivial things in themselves what does it matter whether they are more or less imperfect if only there enters into them love which alone is divine i could see albertine now seated at her pianola rosy beneath her dark hair i could feel against my lips which she was trying to part her tongue her motherly inedible nourishing and holy tongue whose secret flame and dew meant that even when albertine let it glide over the surface of my throat or stomach those caresses superficial but in a sense offered by her inmost flesh turned outward like a cloth that is turned to shew its lining assumed even in the most external touches as it were the mysterious delight of a penetration

    all these so pleasant moments which nothing would ever restore to me again i cannot indeed say that what made me feel the loss of them was despair to feel despair we must still be attached to that life which could end only in disaster i had been in despair at balbec when i saw the day break and realised that none of the days to come could ever be a happy day for me i had remained fairly selfish since then but the self to which i was now attached the self which constituted those vital reserves that were set in action by the instinct of selfpreservation this self was no longer alive when i thought of my strength of my vital force of the best elements in myself i thought of a certain treasure which i had possessed which i had been alone in possessing since other people could not know exactly the sentiment concealed in myself which it had inspired in me and which no one could ever again take from me since i possessed it no longer

    and to tell the truth when i had ever possessed it it had been only because i had liked to think of myself as possessing it i had not merely committed the imprudence when i cast my eyes upon albertine and lodged her in my heart of making her live within me nor that other imprudence of combining a domestic affection with sensual pleasure i had sought also to persuade myself that our relations were love that we were mutually practising the relations that are called love because she obediently returned the kisses that i gave her and having come in time to believe this i had lost not merely a woman whom i loved but a woman who loved me my sister my child my tender mistress and in short i had received a blessing and a curse which swann had not known for after all during the whole of the time in which he had been in love with odette and had been so jealous of her he had barely seen her having found it so difficult on certain days when she put him off at the last moment to gain admission to her but afterwards he had had her to himself as his wife and until the day of his death i on the contrary while i was so jealous of albertine more fortunate than swann had had her with me in my own house i had realised as a fact the state of which swann had so often dreamed and which he did not realise materially until it had ceased to interest him but after all i had not managed to keep albertine as he had kept odette she had fled from me she was dead for nothing is ever repeated exactly and the most analogous lives which thanks to the kinship of the persons and the similarity of the circumstances we may select in order to represent them as symmetrical remain in many respects opposite

    by losing my life i should not have lost very much i should have lost now only an empty form the empty frame of a work of art indifferent as to what i might in the future put in it but glad and proud to think of what it had contained i dwelt upon the memory of those so pleasant hours and this moral support gave me a feeling of comfort which the approach of death itself would not have disturbed

    how she used to hasten to see me at balbec when i sent for her lingering only to sprinkle scent on her hair to please me these images of balbec and paris which i loved to see again were the pages still so recent and so quickly turned of her short life all this which for me was only memory had been for her action action as precipitate as that of a tragedy towards a sudden death people develop in one way inside us but in another way outside us i had indeed felt this on those evenings when i remarked in albertine an enrichment of qualities which was due not only to my memory and these two ways do not fail to react upon each other albeit i had in seeking to know albertine then to possess her altogether obeyed merely the need to reduce by experiment to elements meanly similar to those of our own self the mystery of every other person i had been unable to do so without exercising an influence in my turn over albertine’s life perhaps my wealth the prospect of a brilliant marriage had attracted her my jealousy had kept her her goodness or her intelligence or her sense of guilt or her cunning had made her accept and had led me on to make harsher and harsher a captivity in chains forged simply by the internal process of my mental toil which had nevertheless had upon albertine’s life reactions destined themselves to set by the natural swing of the pendulum fresh and ever more painful problems to my psychology since from my prison she had escaped to go and kill herself upon a horse which but for me she would not have owned leaving me even after she was dead with suspicions the verification of which if it was to come would perhaps be more painful to me than the discovery at balbec that albertine had known mlle vinteuil since albertine would no longer be present to soothe me so that the long plaint of the soul which thinks that it is living shut up within itself is a monologue in appearance only since the echoes of reality alter its course and such a life is like an essay in subjective psychology spontaneously pursued but furnishing from a distance its ‘action’ to the purely realistic novel of another reality another existence the vicissitudes of which come in their turn to inflect the curve and change the direction of the psychological essay how highly geared had been the mechanism how rapid had been the evolution of our love and notwithstanding the sundry delays interruptions and hesitations of the start as in certain of balzac’s tales or schumann’s ballads how sudden the catastrophe it was in the course of this last year long as a century to me so many times had albertine changed her appearance in my mind between balbec and her departure from paris and also independently of me and often without my knowledge changed in herself that i must place the whole of that happy life of affection which had lasted so short a while which yet appeared to me with an amplitude almost an immensity which now was for ever impossible and yet was indispensable to me indispensable without perhaps having been in itself and at the outset a thing that was necessary since i should not have known albertine had i not read in an archaeological treatise a description of the church at balbec had not swann by telling me that this church was almost persian directed my taste to the byzantine norman had not a financial syndicate by erecting at balbec a hygienic and comfortable hotel made my parents decide to hear my supplication and send me to balbec to be sure in that balbec so long desired i had not found the persian church of my dreams nor the eternal mists even the famous train at one twentytwo had not corresponded to my mental picture of it but in compensation for what our imagination leaves us wanting and we give ourselves so much unnecessary trouble in trying to find life does give us something which we were very far from imagining who would have told me at combray when i lay waiting for my mother’s goodnight with so heavy a heart that those anxieties would be healed and would then break out again one day not for my mother but for a girl who would at first be no more against the horizon of the sea than a flower upon which my eyes would daily be invited to gaze but a flower that could think and in whose mind i should be so childishly anxious to occupy a prominent place that i should be distressed by her not being aware that i knew mme de villeparisis yes it was the goodnight the kiss of a stranger like this that in years to come was to make me suffer as keenly as i had suffered as a child when my mother was not coming up to my room well this albertine so necessary of love for whom my soul was now almost entirely composed if swann had not spoken to me of balbec i should never have known her her life would perhaps have been longer mine would have been unprovided with what was now making it a martyrdom and also it seemed to me that by my entirely selfish affection i had allowed albertine to die just as i had murdered my grandmother even later on even after i had already known her at balbec i should have been able not to love her as i was to love her in the sequel when i gave up gilberte and knew that i would be able one day to love another woman i scarcely ventured to entertain a doubt whether considering simply the past gilberte was the only woman whom i had been capable of loving well in the case of albertine i had no longer any doubt at all i was sure that it need not have been herself that i loved that it might have been some one else to prove this it would have been sufficient that mlle de stermaria on the evening when i was going to take her to dine on the island in the bois should not have put me off it was still not too late and it would have been upon mlle de stermaria that i would have trained that activity of the imagination which makes us extract from a woman so special a notion of the individual that she appears to us unique in herself and predestined and necessary for us at the most adopting an almost physiological point of view i could say that i might have been able to feel this same exclusive love for another woman but not for any other woman for albertine plump and dark did not resemble gilberte tall and ruddy and yet they were fashioned of the same healthy stuff and over the same sensual cheeks shone a look in the eyes of both which it was difficult to interpret they were women of a sort that would never attract the attention of men who for their part would do the most extravagant things for other women who made no appeal to me a man has almost always the same way of catching cold and so forth that is to say he requires to bring about the event a certain combination of circumstances it is natural that when he falls in love he should love a certain class of woman a class which for that matter is very numerous the two first glances from albertine which had set me dreaming were not absolutely different from gilberte’s first glances i could almost believe that the obscure personality the sensuality the forward cunning nature of gilberte had returned to tempt me incarnate this time in albertine’s body a body quite different and yet not without analogies in albertine’s case thanks to a wholly different life shared with me into which had been unable to penetrate — in a block of thoughts among which a painful preoccupation maintained a permanent cohesion — any fissure of distraction and oblivion her living body had indeed not like gilberte’s ceased one day to be the body in which i found what i subsequently recognised as being to me what they would not have been to other men feminine charms but she was dead i should in time forget her who could tell whether then the same qualities of rich blood of uneasy brooding would return one day to spread havoc in my life but incarnate this time in what feminine form i could not foresee the example of gilberte would as little have enabled me to form an idea of albertine and guess that i should fall in love with her as the memory of vinteuil’s sonata would have enabled me to imagine his septet indeed what was more on the first occasions of my meeting albertine i might have supposed that it was with other girls that i should fall in love besides she might indeed quite well have appeared to me had i met her a year earlier as dull as a grey sky in which dawn has not yet broken if i had changed in relation to her she herself had changed also and the girl who had come and sat upon my bed on the day of my letter to mlle de stermaria was no longer the same girl that i had known at balbec whether by a mere explosion of the woman which occurs at the age of puberty or because of some incident which i have never been able to discover in any case if she whom i was one day to love must to a certain extent resemble this other that is to say if my choice of a woman was not entirely free this meant nevertheless that trained in a manner that was perhaps inevitable it was trained upon something more considerable than a person upon a type of womankind and this removed all inevitability from my love for albertine the woman whose face we have before our eyes more constantly than light itself since even when our eyes are shut we never cease for an instant to adore her beautiful eyes her beautiful nose to arrange opportunities of seeing them again this unique woman — we know quite well that it would have been another woman that would now be unique to us if we had been in another town than that in which we made her acquaintance if we had explored other quarters of the town if we had frequented the house of a different hostess unique we suppose she is innumerable and yet she is compact indestructible in our loving eyes irreplaceable for a long time to come by any other the truth is that the woman has only raised to life by a sort of magic spell a thousand elements of affection existing in us already in a fragmentary state which she has assembled joined together bridging every gap between them it is ourselves who by giving her her features have supplied all the solid matter of the beloved object whence it comes about that even if we are only one man among a thousand to her and perhaps the last man of them all to us she is the only woman the woman towards whom our whole life tends it was indeed true that i had been quite well aware that this love was not inevitable since it might have occurred with mlle de stermaria but even without that from my knowledge of the love itself when i found it to be too similar to what i had known with other women and also when i felt it to be vaster than albertine enveloping her unconscious of her like a tide swirling round a tiny rock but gradually by dint of living with albertine the chains which i myself had forged i was unable to fling off the habit of associating albertine’s person with the sentiment which she had not inspired made me nevertheless believe that ft was peculiar to her as habit gives to the mere association of ideas between two phenomena according to a certain school of philosophy an illusion of the force the necessity of a law of causation i had thought that my social relations my wealth would dispense me from suffering and too effectively perhaps since this seemed to dispense me from feeling loving imagining i envied a poor country girl whom her absence of social relations even by telegraph allows to ponder for months on end upon a grief which she cannot artificially put to sleep and now i began to realise that if in the case of mme de guermantes endowed with everything that could make the gulf infinite between her and myself i had seen that gulf suddenly bridged by the opinion that social advantages are nothing more than inert and transmutable matter so in a similar albeit converse fashion my social relations my wealth all the material means by which not only my own position but the civilisation of my age enabled me to profit had done no more than postpone the conclusion of my struggle against the contrary inflexible will of albertine upon which no pressure had had any effect true i had been able to exchange telegrams telephone messages with saintloup to remain in constant communication with the office at tours but had not the delay in waiting for them proved useless the result nil and country girls without social advantages or relations or human beings enjoying the perfections of civilisation do they not suffer less because all of us desire less because we regret less what we have always known to be inaccessible what for that reason has continued to seem unreal we desire more keenly the person who is about to give herself to us hope anticipates possession but regret also is an amplifier of desire mme de stermaria’s refusal to come and dine with me on the island in the bois was what had prevented her from becoming the object of my love this might have sufficed also to make me fall in love with her if afterwards i had seen her again before it was too late as soon as i had known that she was not coming entertaining the improbable hypothesis — which had been proved correct — that perhaps she had a jealous lover who prevented her from seeing other men that i should never see her again i had suffered so intensely that i would have given anything in the world to see her and it was one of the keenest anguishes that i had ever felt that saintloup’s arrival had soothed after we have reached a certain age our loves our mistresses are begotten of our anguish our past and the physical lesions in which it is recorded determine our future in albertine’s case the fact that it would not necessarily be she that i must love was even without the example of those previous loves inscribed in the history of my love for her that is to say for herself and her friends for it was not a single love like my love for gilberte but was created by division among a number of girls that it was on her account and because they appeared to me more or less similar to her that i had amused myself with her friends was quite possible the fact remains that for a long time hesitation among them all was possible my choice strayed from one to another and when i thought that i preferred one it was enough that another should keep me waiting should refuse to see me to make me feel the first premonitions of love for her often at that time when andrée was coming to see me at balbec if shortly before andrée was expected albertine failed to keep an appointment my heart throbbed without ceasing i felt that i would never see her again and that it was she whom i loved and when andrée came it was in all seriousness that i said to her as i said it to her in paris after i had learned that albertine had known mlle vinteuil what she supposed me to be saying with a purpose without sincerity what i would indeed have said and in the same words had i been enjoying myself the day before with albertine “alas if you had only come sooner now i am in love with some one else” again in this case of andrée replaced by albertine after i learned that the latter had known mlle vinteuil my love had alternated between them so that after all there had been only one love at a time but a case had occurred earlier in which i had more or less quarrelled with two of the girls the one who took the first step towards a reconciliation would restore my peace of mind it was the other that i would love if she remained cross with me which does not mean that it was not with the former that i would form a definite tie for she would console me — albeit ineffectively — for the harshness of the other whom i would end by forgetting if she did not return to me again now it so happened that while i was convinced that one or the other at least would come back to me for some time neither of them did so my anguish was therefore twofold and twofold my love while i reserved to myself the right to cease to love the one who came back but until that happened continued to suffer on account of them both it is the lot of a certain period in life which may come to us quite early that we are made less amorous by a person than by a desertion in which we end by knowing one thing and one thing only about that person her face having grown dim her heart having ceased to exist our preference of her being quite recent and inexplicable namely that what we need to make our suffering cease is a message from her “may i come and see you” my separation from albertine on the day when françoise informed me “mademoiselle albertine has gone” was like an allegory of countless other separations for very often in order that we may discover that we are in love perhaps indeed in order that we may fall in love the day of separation must first have come in the case when it is an unkept appointment a written refusal that dictates our choice our imagination lashed by suffering sets about its work so swiftly fashions with so frenzied a rapidity a love that had scarcely begun and had been quite featureless destined for months past to remain a rough sketch that now and again our intelligence which has not been able to keep pace with our heart cries out in astonishment “but you must be mad what are these strange thoughts that are making you so miserable that is not real life” and indeed at that moment had we not been roused to action by the betrayer a few healthy distractions that would calm our heart physically would be sufficient to bring our love to an end in any case if this life with albertine was not in its essence necessary it had become indispensable to me i had trembled when i was in love with mme de guermantes because i used to say to myself that with her too abundant means of attraction not only beauty but position wealth she would be too much at liberty to give herself to all and sundry that i should have too little hold over her albertine had been penniless obscure she must have been anxious to marry me and yet i had not been able to possess her exclusively whatever be our social position however wise our precautions when the truth is confessed we have no hold over the life of another person why had she not said to me “i have those tastes” i would have yielded would have allowed her to gratify them in a novel that i had been reading there was a woman whom no objurgation from the man who was in love with her could induce to speak when i read the book i had thought this situation absurd had i been the hero i assured myself i would first of all have forced the woman to speak then we could have come to an understanding what was the good of all this unnecessary misery but i saw now that we are not free to abstain from forging the chains of our own misery and that however well we may know our own will other people do not obey it

    and yet those painful those ineluctable truths which dominated us and to which we were blind the truth of our sentiments the truth of our destiny how often without knowing it without meaning it we have expressed them in words in which we ourselves doubtless thought that we were lying but the prophetic value of which has been established by subsequent events i could recall many words that each of us had uttered without knowing at the time the truth that they contained which indeed we had said thinking that each was deceiving the other words the falsehood of which was very slight quite uninteresting wholly confined within our pitiable insincerity compared with what they contained that was unknown to us lies mistakes falling short of the reality which neither of us perceived truth extending beyond it the truth of our natures the essential laws of which escape us and require time before they reveal themselves the truth of our destinies also i had supposed that i was lying when i said to her at balbec “the more i see you the more i shall love you” and yet it was that intimacy at every moment that had through the channel of jealousy attached me so strongly to her “i know that i could be of use to you intellectually” and in paris “do be careful remember that if you met with an accident it would break my heart” and she “but i may meet with an accident” and i in paris on the evening when i pretended that i wished to part from her “let me look at you once again since presently i shall not be seeing you again and it will be for ever” and when that same evening she looked round the room “to think that i shall never see this room again those books that pianola the whole house i cannot believe it and yet it is true” in her last letters again when she wrote — probably saying to herself “this is the stuff to tell him”—“i leave with you the best part of myself” and was it not now indeed to the fidelity to the strength which too was alas frail of my memory that were entrusted her intelligence her goodness her beauty and “that twofold twilight since night was falling and we were about to part will be effaced from my thoughts only when the darkness is complete” that phrase written on the eve of the day when her mind had indeed been plunged in complete darkness and when it may well have been in the last glimmer so brief but stretched out to infinity by the anxiety of the moment she had indeed perhaps seen again our last drive together and in that instant when everything forsakes us and we create a faith for ourselves as atheists turn christian upon the battlefield she had perhaps summoned to her aid the friend whom she had so often cursed but had so deeply respected who himself — for all religions are alike — was so cruel as to hope that she had also had time to see herself as she was to give her last thought to him to confess her sins at length to him to die in him but to what purpose since even if at that moment she had had time to see herself as she was we had neither of us understood where our happiness lay what we ought to do until that happiness because that happiness was no longer possible until and because we could no longer realise it so long as things are possible we postpone them and they cannot assume that force of attraction that apparent ease of realisation save when projected upon the ideal void of the imagination they are removed from their burdensome degrading submersion in the vital medium the thought that we must die is more painful than the act of dying but less painful than the thought that another person is dead which becoming once more a plane surface after having engulfed a person extends without even an eddy at the point of disappearance a reality from which that person is excluded in which there exists no longer any will any knowledge and from which it is as difficult to reascend to the thought that the person has lived as it is difficult with the still recent memory of her life to think that she is now comparable with the unsubstantial images with the memories left us by the characters in a novel which we have been reading

    at any rate i was glad that before she died she had written me that letter and above all had sent me that final message which proved to me that she would have returned had she lived it seemed to me that it was not merely more soothing but more beautiful also that the event would have been incomplete without this note would not have had so markedly the form of art and destiny in reality it would have been just as markedly so had it been different for every event is like a mould of a particular shape and whatever it be it imposes upon the series of incidents which it has interrupted and seems to have concluded a pattern which we believe to be the only one possible because we do not know the other which might have been substituted for it i repeated to myself “why had she not said to me ‘i have those tastes’ i would have yielded would have allowed her to gratify them at this moment i should be kissing her still” what a sorrow to have to remind myself that she had lied to me thus when she swore to me three days before she left me that she had never had with mlle vinteuil’s friend those relations which at the moment when albertine swore it her blush had confessed poor child she had at least had the honesty to refuse to swear that the pleasure of seeing mlle vinteuil again had no part in her desire to go that day to the verdurins’ why had she not made her admission complete why had she then invented that inconceivable tale perhaps however it was partly my fault that she had never despite all my entreaties which were powerless against her denial been willing to say to me “i have those tastes” it was perhaps partly my fault because at balbec on the day when after mme de cambremer’s call i had had my first explanation with albertine and when i was so far from imagining that she could have had in any case anything more than an unduly passionate friendship with andrée i had expressed with undue violence my disgust at that kind of moral lapse had condemned it in too categorical a fashion i could not recall whether albertine had blushed when i had innocently expressed my horror of that sort of thing i could not recall it for it is often only long afterwards that we would give anything to know what attitude a person adopted at a moment when we were paying no attention to it an attitude which later on when we think again of our conversation would elucidate a poignant difficulty but in our memory there is a blank there is no trace of it and very often we have not paid sufficient attention at the actual moment to the things which might even then have seemed to us important we have not properly heard a sentence have not noticed a gesture or else we have forgotten them and when later on eager to discover a truth we reascend from deduction to deduction turning over our memory like a sheaf of written evidence when we arrive at that sentence at that gesture which it is impossible to recall we begin again a score of times the same process but in vain the road goes no farther had she blushed i did not know whether she had blushed but she could not have failed to hear and the memory of my speech had brought her to a halt later on when perhaps she had been on the point of making her confession to me and now she no longer existed anywhere i might scour the earth from pole to pole without finding albertine the reality which had closed over her was once more unbroken had obliterated every trace of the creature who had sunk into its depths she was no more now than a name like that mme de charlus of whom the people who had known her said with indifference “she was charming” but i was unable to conceive for more than an instant the existence of this reality of which albertine had no knowledge for in myself my mistress existed too vividly in myself in whom every sentiment every thought bore some reference to her life perhaps if she had known she would have been touched to see that her lover had not forgotten her now that her own life was finished and would have been moved by things which in the past had left her indifferent but as we would choose to refrain from infidelities however secret they might be so fearful are we that she whom we love is not refraining from them i was alarmed by the thought that if the dead do exist anywhere my grandmother was as well aware of my oblivion as albertine of my remembrance and when all is said even in the case of a single dead person can we be sure that the joy which we should feel in learning that she knows certain things would compensate for our alarm at the thought that she knows all and however agonising the sacrifice would we not sometimes abstain from keeping after their death as friends those whom we have loved from the fear of having them also as judges

    my jealous curiosity as to what albertine might have done was unbounded i suborned any number of women from whom i learned nothing if this curiosity was so keen it was because people do not die at once for us they remain bathed in a sort of aura of life in which there is no true immortality but which means that they continue to occupy our thoughts in the same way as when they were alive it is as though they were travelling abroad this is a thoroughly pagan survival conversely when we have ceased to love her the curiosity which the person arouses dies before she herself is dead thus i would no longer have taken any step to find out with whom gilberte had been strolling on a certain evening in the champselysées now i felt that these curiosities were absolutely alike had no value in themselves were incapable of lasting but i continued to sacrifice everything to the cruel satisfaction of this transient curiosity albeit i knew in advance that my enforced separation from albertine by the fact of her death would lead me to the same indifference as had resulted from my deliberate separation from gilberte

    if she could have known what was about to happen she would have stayed with me but this meant no more than that once she saw herself dead she would have preferred in my company to remain alive simply in view of the contradiction that it implied such a supposition was absurd but it was not innocuous for in imagining how glad albertine would be if she could know if she could retrospectively understand to come back to me i saw her before me i wanted to kiss her and alas it was impossible she would never come back she was dead my imagination sought for her in the sky through the nights on which we had gazed at it when still together beyond that moonlight which she loved i tried to raise up to her my affection so that it might be a consolation to her for being no longer alive and this love for a being so remote was like a religion my thoughts rose towards her like prayers desire is very powerful it engenders belief i had believed that albertine would not leave me because i desired that she might not because i desired it i began to believe that she was not dead i took to reading books upon tableturning i began to believe in the possibility of the immortality of the soul but that did not suffice me i required that after my own death i should find her again in her body as though eternity were like life life did i say i was more exacting still i would have wished not to be deprived for ever by death of the pleasures of which however it is not alone in robbing us for without her death they would eventually have grown faint they had begun already to do so by the action of longestablished habit of fresh curiosities besides had she been alive albertine even physically would gradually have changed day by day i should have adapted myself to that change but my memory calling up only detached moments of her life asked to see her again as she would already have ceased to be had she lived what it required was a miracle which would satisfy the natural and arbitrary limitations of memory which cannot emerge from the past with the simplicity of the old theologians i imagined her furnishing me not indeed with the explanations which she might possibly have given me but by a final contradiction with those that she had always refused me during her life and thus her death being a sort of dream my love would seem to her an unlookedfor happiness i saw in death only the convenience and optimism of a solution which simplifies which arranges everything sometimes it was not so far off it was not in another world that i imagined our reunion just as in the past when i knew gilberte only from playing with her in the champselysées at home in the evening i used to imagine that i was going to receive a letter from her in which she would confess her love for me that she was coming into the room so a similar force of desire no more embarrassed by the laws of nature which ran counter to it than on the former occasion in the case of gilberte when after all it had not been mistaken since it had had the last word made me think now that i was going to receive a message from albertine informing me that she had indeed met with an accident while riding but that for romantic reasons and as after all has sometimes happened with people whom we have long believed to be dead she had not wished me to hear of her recovery and now repentant asked to be allowed to come and live with me for ever and making quite clear to myself the nature of certain harmless manias in people who otherwise appear sane i felt coexisting in myself the certainty that she was dead and the incessant hope that i might see her come into the room

    i had not yet received any news from aimé albeit he must by now have reached balbec no doubt my inquiry turned upon a secondary point and one quite arbitrarily selected if albertine’s life had been really culpable it must have contained many other things of far greater importance which chance had not allowed me to touch as it had allowed me that conversation about the wrapper thanks to albertine’s blushes it was quite arbitrarily that i had been presented with that particular day which many years later i was seeking to reconstruct if albertine had been a lover of women there were thousands of other days in her life her employment of which i did not know and about which it might be as interesting for me to learn i might have sent aimé to many other places in balbec to many other towns than balbec but these other days precisely because i did not know how she had spent them did not represent themselves to my imagination they had no existence things people did not begin to exist for me until they assumed in my imagination an individual existence if there were thousands of others like them they became for me representative of all the rest if i had long felt a desire to know in the matter of my suspicions with regard to albertine what exactly had happened in the baths it was in the same manner in which in the matter of my desires for women and although i knew that there were any number of girls and lady’smaids who could satisfy them and whom chance might just as easily have led me to hear mentioned i wished to know — since it was of them that saintloup had spoken to me — the girl who frequented houses of ill fame and mme putbus’s maid the difficulties which my health my indecision my ‘procrastination’ as m de charlus called it placed in the way of my carrying out any project had made me put off from day to day from month to month from year to year the elucidation of certain suspicions as also the accomplishment of certain desires but i kept them in my memory promising myself that i would not forget to learn the truth of them because they alone obsessed me since the others had no form in my eyes did not exist and also because the very accident that had chosen them out of the surrounding reality gave me a guarantee that it was indeed in them that i should come in contact with a trace of reality of the true and coveted life

    besides from a single fact if it is certain can we not like a scientist making experiments extract the truth as to all the orders of similar facts is not a single little fact if it is well chosen sufficient to enable the experimenter to deduce a general law which will make him know the truth as to thousands of analogous facts

    albertine might indeed exist in my memory only in the state in which she had successively appeared to me in the course of her life that is to say subdivided according to a series of fractions of time my mind reestablishing unity in her made her a single person and it was upon this person that i sought to bring a general judgment to bear to know whether she had lied to me whether she loved women whether it was in order to be free to associate with them that she had left me what the woman in the baths would have to say might perhaps put an end for ever to my doubts as to albertine’s morals

    my doubts alas i had supposed that it would be immaterial to me even pleasant not to see albertine again until her departure revealed to me my error similarly her death had shewn me how greatly i had been mistaken when i believed that i hoped at times for her death and supposed that it would be my deliverance so it was that when i received aimé‘s letter i realised that if i had not until then suffered too painfully from my doubts as to albertine’s virtue it was because in reality they were not doubts at all my happiness my life required that albertine should be virtuous they had laid it down once and for all time that she was furnished with this preservative belief i could without danger allow my mind to play sadly with suppositions to which it gave a form but added no faith i said to myself “she is perhaps a womanlover” as we say “i may die tonight” we say it but we do not believe it we make plans for the morrow this explains why believing mistakenly that i was uncertain whether albertine did or did not love women and believing in consequence that a proof of albertine’s guilt would not give me anything that i had not already taken into account i was able to feel before the pictures insignificant to anyone else which aimé‘s letter called up to me an unexpected anguish the most painful that i had ever yet felt and one that formed with those pictures with the picture alas of albertine herself a sort of precipitate as chemists say in which the whole was invisible and of which the text of aimé‘s letter which i isolate in a purely conventional fashion can give no idea whatsoever since each of the words that compose it was immediately transformed coloured for ever by the suffering that it had aroused

   “monsieur

    “monsieur will kindly forgive me for not having written sooner to monsieur the person whom monsieur instructed me to see had gone away for a few days and anxious to justify the confidence which monsieur had placed in me i did not wish to return emptyhanded i have just spoken to this person who remembers mlle a quite well” aimé who possessed certain rudiments of culture meant to italicise mlle a between inverted commas but when he meant to write inverted commas he wrote brackets and when he meant to write something in brackets he put it between inverted commas thus it was that françoise would say that some one stayed in my street meaning that he abode there and that one could abide for a few minutes meaning stay the mistakes of popular speech consisting merely as often as not in interchanging — as for that matter the french language has done — terms which in the course of centuries have replaced one another “according to her the thing that monsieur supposed is absolutely certain for one thing it was she who looked after mlle a whenever she came to the baths mlle a came very often to take her bath with a tall woman older than herself always dressed in grey whom the bathwoman without knowing her name recognised from having often seen her going after girls but she took no notice of any of them after she met mlle a she and mlle a always shut themselves up in the dressingbox remained there a very long time and the lady in grey used to give at least 10 francs as a tip to the person to whom i spoke as this person said to me you can imagine that if they were just stringing beads they wouldn’t have given a tip of ten francs mlle a used to come also sometimes with a woman with a very dark skin and longhandled glasses but mlle a came most often with girls younger than herself especially one with a high complexion apart from the lady in grey the people whom mlle a was in the habit of bringing were not from balbec and must indeed often have come from quite a distance they never came in together but mlle a would come in and ask for the door of her box to be left unlocked — as she was expecting a friend and the person to whom i spoke knew what that meant this person could not give me any other details as she does not remember very well which is easily understood after so long an interval’ besides this person did not try to find out because she is very discreet and it was to her advantage for mlle a brought her in a lot of money she was quite sincerely touched to hear that she was dead it is true that so young it is a great calamity for her and for her friends i await monsieur’s orders to know whether i may leave balbec where i do not think that i can learn anything more i thank monsieur again for the little holiday that he has procured me and which has been very pleasant especially as the weather is as fine as could be the season promises well for this year we hope that monsieur will come and put in a little appearance

    “i can think of nothing else to say that will interest monsieur”

    to understand how deeply these words penetrated my being the reader must bear in mind that the questions which i had been asking myself with regard to albertine were not subordinate immaterial questions questions of detail the only questions as a matter of fact which we ask ourselves about anyone who is not ourselves whereby we are enabled to proceed wrapped in an impenetrable thought through the midst of suffering falsehood vice or death no in albertine’s case they were essential questions “in her heart of hearts what was she what were her thoughts what were her loves did she lie to me had my life with her been as lamentable as swann’s life with odette” and so the point reached by aimé‘s reply even although it was not a general reply — and precisely for that reason — was indeed in albertine in myself the uttermost depths

    at last i saw before my eyes in that arrival of albertine at the baths along the narrow lane with the lady in grey a fragment of that past which seemed to me no less mysterious no less alarming than i had feared when i imagined it as enclosed in the memory in the facial expression of albertine no doubt anyone but myself might have dismissed as insignificant these details upon which my inability now that albertine was dead to secure a denial of them from herself conferred the equivalent of a sort of likelihood it is indeed probable that for albertine even if they had been true her own misdeeds if she had admitted them whether her conscience thought them innocent or reprehensible whether her sensuality had found them exquisite or distinctly dull would not have been accompanied by that inexpressible sense of horror from which i was unable to detach them i myself with the help of my own love of women albeit they could not have been the same thing to albertine could more or less imagine what she felt and indeed it was already a first degree of anguish merely to picture her to myself desiring as i had so often desired lying to me as i had so often lied to her preoccupied with one girl or another putting herself out for her as i had done for mlle de stermaria and ever so many others not to mention the peasant girls whom i met on country roads yes all my own desires helped me to understand to a certain degree what hers had been it was by this time an intense anguish in which all my desires the keener they had been had changed into torments that were all the more cruel as though in this algebra of sensibility they reappeared with the same coefficient but with a minus instead of a plus sign to albertine so far as i was capable of judging her by my own standard her misdeeds however anxious she might have been to conceal them from me — which made me suppose that she was conscious of her guilt or was afraid of grieving me — her misdeeds because she had planned them to suit her own taste in the clear light of imagination in which desire plays appeared to her nevertheless as things of the same nature as the rest of life pleasures for herself which she had not had the courage to deny herself griefs for me which she had sought to avoid causing me by concealing them but pleasures and griefs which might be numbered among the other pleasures and griefs of life but for me it was from without without my having been forewarned without my having been able myself to elaborate them it was from aimé‘s letter that there had come to me the visions of albertine arriving at the baths and preparing her gratuity

    no doubt it was because in that silent and deliberate arrival of albertine with the woman in grey i read the assignation that they had made that convention of going to make love in a dressingbox which implied an experience of corruption the wellconcealed organisation of  double life it was because these images brought me the terrible tidings of albertine’s guilt that they had immediately caused me a physical grief from which they would never in time to come be detached but at once my grief had reacted upon them an objective fact such as an image differs according to the internal state in which we approach it and grief is as potent in altering reality as is drunkenness combined with these images suffering had at once made of them something absolutely different from what might be for anyone else a lady in grey a gratuity a bath the street which had witnessed the deliberate arrival of albertine with the lady in grey all these images — escaping from a life of falsehood and misconduct such as i had never conceived — my suffering had immediately altered in their very substance i did not behold them in the light that illuminates earthly spectacles they were a fragment of another world of an unknown and accursed planet a glimpse of hell my hell was all that balbec all those neighbouring villages from which according to aimé‘s letter she frequently collected girls younger than herself whom she took to the baths that mystery which i had long ago imagined in the country round balbec and which had been dispelled after i had stayed there which i had then hoped to grasp again when i knew albertine because when i saw her pass me on the beach when i was mad enough to desire that she might not be virtuous i thought that she must be its incarnation how fearfully now everything that related to balbec was impregnated with it the names of those stations toutainville epreville parville grown so familiar so soothing when i heard them shouted at night as i returned from the verdurins’ now that i thought how albertine had been staying at the last had gone from there to the second must often have ridden on her bicycle to the first they aroused in me an anxiety more cruel than on the first occasion when i beheld the places with such misgivings before arriving at a balbec which i did not yet know it is one of the faculties of jealousy to reveal to us the extent to which the reality of external facts and the sentiments of the heart are an unknown element which lends itself to endless suppositions we suppose that we know exactly what things are and what people think for the simple reason that we do not care about them but as soon as we feel the desire to know which the jealous man feels then it becomes a dizzy kaleidoscope in which we can no longer make out anything had albertine been unfaithful to me with whom in what house upon what day the day on which she had said this or that to me when i remembered that i had in the course of it said this or that i could not tell nor did i know what were her sentiments towards myself whether they were inspired by financial interest by affection and all of a sudden i remembered some trivial incident for instance that albertine had wished to go to saintmars le vêtu saying that the name interested her and perhaps simply because she had made the acquaintance of some peasant girl who lived there but it was nothing that aimé should have found out all this for me from the woman at the baths since albertine must remain eternally unaware that he had informed me the need to know having always been exceeded in my love for albertine by the need to shew her that i knew for this abolished between us the partition of different illusions without having ever had the result of making her love me more far from it and now after she was dead the second of these needs had been amalgamated with the effect of the first i tried to picture to myself the conversation in which i would have informed her of what i had learned as vividly as the conversation in which i would have asked her to tell me what i did not know that is to say to see her by my side to hear her answering me kindly to see her cheeks become plump again her eyes shed their malice and assume an air of melancholy that is to say to love her still and to forget the fury of my jealousy in the despair of my loneliness the painful mystery of this impossibility of ever making her know what i had learned and of establishing our relations upon the truth of what i had only just discovered and would not have been able perhaps to discover but for the fact of her death substituted its sadness for the more painful mystery of her conduct what to have so keenly desired that albertine should know that i had heard the story of the baths albertine who no longer existed this again was one of the consequences of our utter inability when we have to consider the matter of death to picture to ourselves anything but life albertine no longer existed but to me she was the person who had concealed from me that she had assignations with women at balbec who imagined that she had succeeded in keeping me in ignorance of them when we try to consider what happens to us after our own death is it not still our living self which by mistake we project before us and is it much more absurd when all is said to regret that a woman who no longer exists is unaware that we have learned what she was doing six years ago than to desire that of ourselves who will be dead the public shall still speak with approval a century hence if there is more real foundation in the latter than in the former case the regrets of my retrospective jealousy proceeded none the less from the same optical error as in other men the desire for posthumous fame and yet this impression of all the solemn finality that there was in my separation from albertine if it had been substituted for a moment for my idea of her misdeeds only aggravated them by bestowing upon them an irremediable character

    i saw myself astray in life as upon an endless beach where i was alone and in whatever direction i might turn would never meet her fortunately i found most appropriately in my memory — as there are always all sorts of things some noxious others salutary in that heap from which individual impressions come to light only one by one — i discovered as a craftsman discovers the material that can serve for what he wishes to make a speech of my grandmother’s she had said to me with reference to an improbable story which the bathwoman had told mme de villeparisis “she is a woman who must suffer from a disease of mendacity” this memory was a great comfort to me what importance could the story have that the woman had told aimé especially as after all she had seen nothing a girl can come and take baths with her friends without having any evil intention perhaps for her own glorification the woman had exaggerated the amount of the gratuity i had indeed heard françoise maintain once that my aunt léonie had said in her hearing that she had ‘a million a month to spend’ which was utter nonsense another time that she had seen my aunt léonie give eulalie four thousandfranc notes whereas a fiftyfranc note folded in four seemed to me scarcely probable and so i sought — and in course of time managed — to rid myself of the painful certainty which i had taken such trouble to acquire tossed to and fro as i still was between the desire to know and the fear of suffering then my affection might revive afresh but simultaneously with it a sorrow at being parted from albertine during the course of which i was perhaps even more wretched than in the recent hours when it had been jealousy that tormented me but my jealousy was suddenly revived when i thought of balbec because of the vision which at once reappeared and which until then had never made me suffer and indeed appeared one of the most innocuous in my memory of the diningroom at balbec in the evening with on the other side of the windows all that populace crowded together in the dusk as before the luminous glass of an aquarium producing a contact of which i had never thought in their conglomeration between the fishermen and girls of the lower orders and the young ladies jealous of that splendour new to balbec that splendour from which if not their means at any rate avarice and tradition debarred their parents young ladies among whom there had certainly been almost every evening albertine whom i did not then know and who doubtless used to accost some little girl whom she would meet a few minutes later in the dark upon the sands or else in a deserted bathing hut at the foot of the cliff then it was my sorrow that revived i had just heard like a sentence of banishment the sound of the lift which instead of stopping at my floor went on higher and yet the only person from whom i could have hoped for a visit would never come again she was dead and in spite of this when the lift did stop at my floor my heart throbbed for an instant i said to myself “if after all it was only a dream it is perhaps she she is going to ring the bell she has come back françoise will come in and say with more alarm than anger — for she is even more superstitious than vindictive and would be less afraid of the living girl than of what she will perhaps take for a ghost —‘monsieur will never guess who is here’” i tried not to think of anything to take up a newspaper but i found it impossible to read the articles written by men who felt no real grief of a trivial song one of them said “it moves one to tears” whereas i myself would have listened to it with joy had albertine been alive another albeit a great writer because he had been greeted with cheers when he alighted from a train said that he had received ‘an unforgettable welcome’ whereas i if it had been i who received that welcome would not have given it even a moment’s thought and a third assured his readers that but for its tiresome politics life in paris would be ‘altogether delightful’ whereas i knew well that even without politics that life could be nothing but atrocious to me and would have seemed to me delightful even with its politics could i have found albertine again the sporting correspondent said we were in the month of may “this season of the year is positively painful let us say rather disastrous to the true sportsman for there is nothing absolutely nothing in the way of game” and the art critic said of the salon “in the face of this method of arranging an exhibition we are overwhelmed by an immense discouragement by an infinite regret    ” if the force of the regret that i was feeling made me regard as untruthful and colourless the expressions of men who had no true happiness or sorrow in their lives on the other hand the most insignificant lines which could however remotely attach themselves either to normandy or to touraine or to hydropathic establishments or to léa or to the princesse de guermantes or to love or to absence or to infidelity at once set before my eyes without my having the time to turn them away from it the image of albertine and my tears started afresh besides in the ordinary course i could never read these newspapers for the mere act of opening one of them reminded me at once that i used to open them when albertine was alive and that she was alive no longer i let them drop without having the strength to unfold their pages each impression called up an impression that was identical but marred because there had been cut out of it albertine’s existence so that i had never the courage to live to the end these mutilated minutes indeed when little by little albertine ceased to be present in my thoughts and allpowerful over my heart i was stabbed at once if i had occasion as in the time when she was there to go into her room to grope for the light to sit down by the pianola divided among a number of little household gods she dwelt for a long time in the flame of the candle the doorbell the back of a chair and other domains more immaterial such as a night of insomnia or the emotion that was caused me by the first visit of a woman who had attracted me in spite of this the few sentences which i read in the course of a day or which my mind recalled that i had read often aroused in me a cruel jealousy to do this they required not so much to supply me with a valid argument in favour of the immorality of women as to revive an old impression connected with the life of albertine transported then to a forgotten moment the force of which my habit of thinking of it had not dulled and in which albertine was still alive her misdeeds became more immediate more painful more agonising then i asked myself whether i could be certain that the bathwoman’s revelations were false a good way of finding out the truth would be to send aimé to touraine to spend a few days in the neighbourhood of mme bontemps’s villa if albertine enjoyed the pleasures which one woman takes with others if it was in order not to be deprived of them any longer that she had left me she must as soon as she was free have sought to indulge in them and have succeeded in a district which she knew and to which she would not have chosen to retire had she not expected to find greater facilities there than in my house no doubt there was nothing extraordinary in the fact that albertine’s death had so little altered my preoccupations when our mistress is alive a great part of the thoughts which form what we call our loves come to us during the hours when she is not by our side thus we acquire the habit of having as the object of our meditation an absent person and one who even if she remains absent for a few hours only during those hours is no more than a memory and so death does not make any great difference when aimé returned i asked him to go down to châtellerault and thus not only by my thoughts my sorrows the emotion caused me by a name connected however remotely with a certain person but even more by all my actions by the inquiries that i undertook by the use that i made of my money all of which was devoted to the discovery of albertine’s actions i may say that throughout this year my life remained filled with love with a true bond of affection and she who was its object was a corpse we say at times that something may survive of a man after his death if the man was an artist and took a certain amount of pains with his work it is perhaps in the same way that a sort of cutting taken from one person and grafted on the heart of another continues to carry on its existence even when the person from whom it had been detached has perished aimé established himself in quarters close to mme bontemps’s villa he made the acquaintance of a maidservant of a jobmaster from whom albertine had often hired a carriage by the day these people had noticed nothing in a second letter aimé informed me that he had learned from a young laundress in the town that albertine had a peculiar way of gripping her arm when she brought back the clean linen “but” she said “the young lady never did anything more” i sent aimé the money that paid for his journey that paid for the harm which he had done me by his letter and at the same time i was making an effort to discount it by telling myself that this was a familiarity which gave no proof of any vicious desire when i received a telegram from aimé “have learned most interesting things have abundant proofs letter follows” on the following day came a letter the envelope of which was enough to make me tremble i had guessed that it came from aimé for everyone even the humblest of us has under his control those little familiar spirits at once living and couched in a sort of trance upon the paper the characters of his handwriting which he alone possesses “at first the young laundress refused to tell me anything she assured me that mlle albertine had never done anything more than pinch her arm but to get her to talk i took her out to dinner i made her drink then she told me that mlle albertine used often to meet her on the bank of the loire when she went to bathe that mlle albertine who was in the habit of getting up very early to go and bathe was in the habit of meeting her by the water’s edge at a spot where the trees are so thick that nobody can see you and besides there is nobody who can see you at that hour in the morning then the young laundress brought her friends and they bathed and afterwards as it was already very hot down here and the sun scorched you even through the trees they used to lie about on the grass getting dry and playing and caressing each other the young laundress confessed to me that she loved to amuse herself with her young friends and that seeing mlle albertine was always wriggling against her in her wrapper she made her take it off and used to caress her with her tongue along the throat and arms even on the soles of her feet which mlle albertine stretched out to her the laundress undressed too and they played at pushing each other into the water after that she told me nothing more but being entirely at your orders and ready to do anything in the world to please you i took the young laundress to bed with me she asked me if i would like her to do to me what she used to do to mlle albertine when she took off her bathingdress and she said to me ‘if you could have seen how she used to quiver that young lady she said to me oh it’s just heavenly and she got so excited that she could not keep from biting me’ i could still see the marks on the girl’s arms and i can understand mlle albertine’s pleasure for the girl is really a very good performer”

    i had indeed suffered at balbec when albertine told me of her friendship with mlle vinteuil but albertine was there to comfort me afterwards when by my excessive curiosity as to her actions i had succeeded in making albertine leave me when françoise informed me that she was no longer in the house and i found myself alone i had suffered more keenly still but at least the albertine whom i had loved remained in my heart now in her place — to punish me for having pushed farther a curiosity to which contrary to what i had supposed death had not put an end — what i found was a different girl heaping up lies and deceits one upon another in the place where the former had so sweetly reassured me by swearing that she had never tasted those pleasures which in the intoxication of her recaptured liberty she had gone down to enjoy to the point of swooning of biting that young laundress whom she used to meet at sunrise on the bank of the loire and to whom she used to say “oh it’s just heavenly” a different albertine not only in the sense in which we understand the word different when it is used of other people if people are different from what we have supposed as this difference cannot affect us profoundly as the pendulum of intuition cannot move outward with a greater oscillation than that of its inward movement it is only in the superficial regions of the people themselves that we place these differences formerly when i learned that a woman loved other women she did not for that reason seem to me a different woman of a peculiar essence but when it is a question of a woman with whom we are in love in order to rid ourselves of the grief that we feel at the thought that such a thing is possible we seek to find out not only what she has done but what she felt while she was doing it what idea she had in her mind of the thing that she was doing then descending and advancing farther and farther by the profundity of our grief we attain to the mystery to the essence i was pained internally in my body in my heart — far more than i should have been pained by the fear of losing my life — by this curiosity with which all the force of my intellect and of my subconscious self collaborated and similarly it was into the core of albertine’s own being that i now projected everything that i learned about her and the grief that had thus caused to penetrate to so great a depth in my own being the fact of albertine’s vice was to render me later on a final service like the harm that i had done my grandmother the harm that albertine had done me was a last bond between her and myself which outlived memory even for with the conservation of energy which belongs to everything that is physical suffering has no need of the lessons of memory thus a man who has forgotten the charming night spent by moonlight in the woods suffers still from the rheumatism which he then contracted those tastes which she had denied but which were hers those tastes the discovery of which had come to me not by a cold process of reasoning but in the burning anguish that i had felt on reading the words “oh it’s just heavenly” a suffering which gave them a special quality of their own those tastes were not merely added to the image of albertine as is added to the hermitcrab the new shell which it drags after it but rather like a salt which comes in contact with another salt alters its colour and what is more its nature when the young laundress must have said to her young friends “just fancy i would never have believed it well the young lady is one too” to me it was not merely a vice hitherto unsuspected by them that they added to albertine’s person but the discovery that she was another person a person like themselves speaking the same language which by making her the compatriot of other women made her even more alien to myself proved that what i had possessed of her what i carried in my heart was only quite a small part of her and that the rest which was made so extensive by not being merely that thing so mysteriously important an individual desire but being shared with others she had always concealed from me she had kept me aloof from it as a woman might have concealed from me that she was a native of an enemy country and a spy and would indeed have been acting even more treacherously than a spy for a spy deceives us only as to her nationality whereas albertine had deceived me as to her profoundest humanity the fact that she did not belong to the ordinary human race but to an alien race which moves among it conceals itself among it and never blends with it i had as it happened seen two paintings by elstir shewing against a leafy background nude women in one of them one of the girls is raising her foot as albertine must have raised hers when she offered it to the laundress with her other foot she is pushing into the water the other girl who gaily resists her hip bent her foot barely submerged in the blue water i remembered now that the raising of the thigh made the same swan’sneck curve with the angle of the knee that was made by the droop of albertine’s thigh when she was lying by my side on the bed and i had often meant to tell her that she reminded me of those paintings but i had refrained from doing so in order not to awaken in her mind the image of nude female bodies now i saw her side by side with the laundress and her friends recomposing the group which i had so admired when i was seated among albertine’s friends at balbec and if i had been an enthusiast sensitive to absolute beauty i should have recognised that albertine recomposed it with a thousand times more beauty now that its elements were the nude statues of goddesses like those which consummate sculptors scattered about the groves of versailles or plunged in the fountains to be washed and polished by the caresses of their eddies now i saw her by the side of the laundress girls by the water’s edge in their twofold nudity of marble maidens in the midst of a grove of vegetation and dipping into the water like basreliefs of naiads remembering how albertine looked as she lay upon my bed i thought i could see her bent hip i saw it it was a swan’s neck it was seeking the lips of the other girl then i beheld no longer a leg but the bold neck of a swan like that which in a frenzied sketch seeks the lips of a leda whom we see in all the palpitation peculiar to feminine pleasure because there is nothing else but a swan and she seems more alone just as we discover upon the telephone the inflexions of a voice which we do not distinguish so long as it is not dissociated from a face in which we materialise its expression in this sketch the pleasure instead of going to seek the face which inspires it and which is absent replaced by a motionless swan is concentrated in her who feels it at certain moments the communication was cut between my heart and my memory what albertine had done with the laundress was indicated to me now only by almost algebraical abbreviations which no longer meant anything to me but a hundred times in an hour the interrupted current was restored and my heart was pitilessly scorched by a fire from hell while i saw albertine raised to life by my jealousy really alive stiffen beneath the caresses of the young laundress to whom she was saying “oh it’s just heavenly” as she was alive at the moment when she committed her misdeeds that is to say at the moment at which i myself found myself placed it was not sufficient to know of the misdeed i wished her to know that i knew and so if at those moments i thought with regret that i should never see her again this regret bore the stamp of my jealousy and very different from the lacerating regret of the moments in which i loved her was only regret at not being able to say to her “you thought that i should never know what you did after you left me well i know everything the laundress on the bank of the loire you said to her ‘oh it’s just heavenly’ i have seen the bite” no doubt i said to myself “why torment myself she who took her pleasure with the laundress no longer exists and consequently was not a person whose actions retain any importance she is not telling herself that i know but no more is she telling herself that i do not know since she tells herself nothing” but this line of reasoning convinced me less than the visual image of her pleasure which brought me back to the moment in which she had tasted it what we feel is the only thing that exists for us and we project it into the past into the future without letting ourselves be stopped by the fictitious barriers of death if my regret that she was dead was subjected at such moments to the influence of my jealousy and assumed this so peculiar form that influence extended over my dreams of occultism of immortality which were no more than an effort to realise what i desired and so at those moments if i could have succeeded in evoking her by turning a table as bergotte had at one time thought possible or in meeting her in the other life as the abbé x thought i would have wished to do so only in order to repeat to her “i know about the laundress you said to her ‘oh it’s just heavenly’ i have seen the bite” what came to my rescue against this image of the laundress was — certainly when it had endured for any while — the image itself because we really know only what is novel what suddenly introduces into our sensibility a change of tone which strikes us the things for which habit has not yet substituted its colourless facsimiles but it was above all this subdivision of albertine in many fragments in many albertines which was her sole mode of existence in me moments recurred in which she had merely been good or intelligent or serious or even addicted to nothing but sport and this subdivision was it not after all proper that it should soothe me for if it was not in itself anything real if it depended upon the successive form of the hours in which it had appeared to me a form which remained that of my memory as the curve of the projections of my magic lantern depended upon the curve of the coloured slides did it not represent in its own manner a truth a thoroughly objective truth too to wit that each one of us is not a single person but contains many persons who have not all the same moral value and that if a vicious albertine had existed it did not mean that there had not been others she who enjoyed talking to me about saintsimon in her room she who on the night when i had told her that we must part had said so sadly “that pianola this room to think that i shall never see any of these things again” and when she saw the emotion which my lie had finally communicated to myself had exclaimed with a sincere pity “oh no anything rather than make you unhappy i promise that i will never try to see you again” then i was no longer alone i felt the wall that separated us vanish at the moment in which the good albertine had returned i had found again the one person from whom i could demand the antidote to the sufferings which albertine was causing me true i still wanted to speak to her about the story of the laundress but it was no longer by way of a cruel triumph and to shew her maliciously how much i knew as i should have done had albertine been alive i asked her tenderly whether the tale about the laundress was true she swore to me that it was not that aimé was not truthful and that wishing to appear to have earned the money which i had given him he had not liked to return with nothing to shew and had made the laundress tell him what he wished to hear no doubt albertine had been lying to me throughout and yet in the flux and reflux of her contradictions i felt that there had been a certain progression due to myself that she had not indeed made me at the outset admissions perhaps it is true involuntary in a phrase that escaped her lips i would not have sworn i no longer remembered and besides she had such odd ways of naming certain things that they might be interpreted in one sense or the other but the feeling that she had had of my jealousy had led her afterwards to retract with horror what at first she had complacently admitted anyhow albertine had no need to tell me this to be convinced of her innocence it was enough for me to embrace her and i could do so now that the wall was down which parted us like that impalpable and resisting wall which after a quarrel rises between two lovers and against which kisses would be shattered no she had no need to tell me anything whatever she might have done whatever she might have wished to do the poor child there were sentiments in which over the barrier that divided us we could be united if the story was true and if albertine had concealed her tastes from me it was in order not to make me unhappy i had the pleasure of hearing this albertine say so besides had i ever known any other the two chief causes of error in our relations with another person are having ourselves a good heart or else being in love with the other person we fall in love for a smile a glance a bare shoulder that is enough then in the long hours of hope or sorrow we fabricate a person we compose a character and when later on we see much of the beloved person we can no longer whatever the cruel reality that confronts us strip off that good character that nature of a woman who loves us from the person who bestows that glance bares that shoulder than we can when she has grown old eliminate her youthful face from a person whom we have known since her girlhood i called to mind the noble glance kind and compassionate of that albertine her plump cheeks the coarse grain of her throat it was the image of a dead woman but as this dead woman was alive it was easy for me to do immediately what i should inevitably have done if she had been by my side in her living body what i should do were i ever to meet her again in another life i forgave her

    the moments which i had spent with this albertine were so precious to me that i would not have let any of them escape me now at times as we recover the remnants of a squandered fortune i recaptured some of these which i had thought to be lost as i tied a scarf behind my neck instead of in front i remembered a drive of which i had never thought again before which in order that the cold air might not reach my throat albertine had arranged my scarf for me in this way after first kissing me this simple drive restored to my memory by so humble a gesture gave me the same pleasure as the intimate objects once the property of a dead woman who was dear to us which her old servant brings to us and which are so precious to us my grief found itself enriched by it all the more so as i had never given another thought to the scarf in question

    and now albertine liberated once more had resumed her flight men women followed her she was alive in me i became aware that this prolonged adoration of albertine was like the ghost of the sentiment that i had felt for her reproduced its various elements and obeyed the same laws as the sentimental reality which it reflected on the farther side of death for i felt quite sure that if i could place some interval between my thoughts of albertine or if on the other hand i had allowed too long an interval to elapse i should cease to love her a clean cut would have made me unconcerned about her as i was now about my grandmother a period of any length spent without thinking of her would have broken in my memory the continuity which is the very principle of life which however may be resumed after a certain interval of time had not this been the case with my love for albertine when she was alive a love which had been able to revive after a quite long interval during which i had never given her a thought well my memory must have been obedient to the same laws have been unable to endure longer intervals for all that it did was like an aurora borealis to reflect after albertine’s death the sentiment that i had felt for her it was like the phantom of my love

    at other times my grief assumed so many forms that occasionally i no longer recognised it i longed to be loved in earnest decided to seek for a person who would live with me this seemed to me to be the sign that i no longer loved albertine whereas it meant that i loved her still for the need to be loved in earnest was just as much as the desire to kiss albertine’s plump cheeks merely a part of my regret it was when i had forgotten her that i might feel it to be wiser happier to live without love and so my regret for albertine because it was it that aroused in me the need of a sister made that need insatiable and in proportion as my regret for albertine grew fainter the need of a sister which was only an unconscious form of that regret would become less imperious and yet these two residues of my love did not proceed to shrink at an equal rate there were hours in which i had made up my mind to marry so completely had the former been eclipsed the latter on the contrary retaining its full strength and then later on my jealous memories having died away suddenly at times a feeling welled up into my heart of affection for albertine and then thinking of my own love affairs with other women i told myself that she would have understood would have shared them — and her vice became almost a reason for loving her at times my jealousy revived in moments when i no longer remembered albertine albeit it was of her that i was jealous i thought that i was jealous of andrée of one of whose recent adventures i had just been informed but andrée was to me merely a substitute a bypath a conduit which brought me indirectly to albertine so it is that in our dreams we give a different face a different name to a person as to whose underlying identity we are not mistaken when all was said notwithstanding the flux and reflux which upset in these particular instances the general law the sentiments that albertine had left with me were more difficult to extinguish than the memory of their original cause not only the sentiments but the sensations different in this respect from swann who when he had begun to cease to love odette had not even been able to recreate in himself the sensation of his love i felt myself still reliving a past which was no longer anything more than the history of another person my ego in a sense cloven in twain while its upper extremity was already hard and frigid burned still at its base whenever a spark made the old current pass through it even after my mind had long ceased to conceive albertine and as no image of her accompanied the cruel palpitations the tears that were brought to my eyes by a cold wind blowing as at balbec upon the apple trees that were already pink with blossom i was led to ask myself whether the renewal of my grief was not due to entirely pathological causes and whether what i took to be the revival of a memory and the final period of a state of love was not rather the first stage of heartdisease

    there are in certain affections secondary accidents which the sufferer is too apt to confuse with the malady itself when they cease he is surprised to find himself nearer to recovery than he has supposed of this sort had been the suffering caused me — the complication brought about — by aimé‘s letters with regard to the bathing establishment and the young laundress but a healer of broken hearts had such a person visited me would have found that in other respects my grief itself was on the way to recovery no doubt in myself since i was a man one of those amphibious creatures who are plunged simultaneously in the past and in the reality of the moment there still existed a contradiction between the living memory of albertine and my consciousness of her death but this contradiction was so to speak the opposite of what it had been before the idea that albertine was dead this idea which at first used to contest so furiously with the idea that she was alive that i was obliged to run away from it as children run away from a breaking wave this idea of her death by the very force of its incessant onslaught had ended by capturing the place in my mind that a short while ago was still occupied by the idea of her life without my being precisely aware of it it was now this idea of albertine’s death — no longer the present memory of her life — that formed the chief subject of my unconscious musings with the result that if i interrupted them suddenly to reflect upon myself what surprised me was not as in earlier days that albertine so living in myself could be no longer existent upon the earth could be dead but that albertine who no longer existed upon the earth who was dead should have remained so living in myself built up by the contiguity of the memories that followed one another the black tunnel in which my thoughts had been straying so long that they had even ceased to be aware of it was suddenly broken by an interval of sunlight allowing me to see in the distance a blue and smiling universe in which albertine was no more than a memory unimportant and full of charm is it this i asked myself that is the true albertine or is it indeed the person who in the darkness through which i have so long been rolling seemed to me the sole reality the person that i had been so short a time ago who lived only in the perpetual expectation of the moment when albertine would come in to bid him good night and to kiss him a sort of multiplication of myself made this person appear to me as no longer anything more than a feeble part already halfdetached from myself and like a fading flower i felt the rejuvenating refreshment of an exfoliation however these brief illuminations succeeded perhaps only in making me more conscious of my love for albertine as happens with every idea that is too constant and has need of opposition to make it affirm itself people who were alive during the war of 1870 for instance say that the idea of war ended by seeming to them natural not because they were not thinking sufficiently of the war but because they could think of nothing else and in order to understand how strange and important a fact war is it was necessary that some other thing tearing them from their permanent obsession they should forget for a moment that war was being waged should find themselves once again as they had been in a state of peace until all of a sudden upon the momentary blank there stood out at length distinct the monstrous reality which they had long ceased to see since there had been nothing else visible

    if again this withdrawal of my different impressions of albertine had at least been carried out not in echelon but simultaneously equally by a general retirement along the whole line of my memory my impressions of her infidelities retiring at the same time as those of her kindness oblivion would have brought me solace it was not so as upon a beach where the tide recedes unevenly i would be assailed by the rush of one of my suspicions when the image of her tender presence had already withdrawn too far from me to be able to bring me its remedy as for the infidelities they had made me suffer because however remote the year in which they had occurred to me they were not remote but i suffered from them less when they became remote that is to say when i pictured them to myself less vividly for the remoteness of a thing is in proportion rather to the visual power of the memory that is looking at it than to the real interval of the intervening days like the memory of last night’s dream which may seem to us more distant in its vagueness and obliteration than an event which is many years old but albeit the idea of albertine’s death made headway in me the reflux of the sensation that she was alive if it did not arrest that progress obstructed it nevertheless and prevented its being regular and i realise now that during this period doubtless because of my having forgotten the hours in which she had been cloistered in my house hours which by dint of relieving me from any pain at misdeeds which seemed to me almost unimportant because i knew that she was not committing them had become almost tantamount to so many proofs of her innocence i underwent the martyrdom of living in the constant company of an idea quite as novel as the idea that albertine was dead previously i had always started from the idea that she was alive with an idea which i should have supposed it to be equally impossible to endure and which without my noticing it was gradually forming the basis of my consciousness was substituting itself for the idea that albertine was innocent the idea that she was guilty when i believed that i was doubting her i was on the contrary believing in her similarly i took as the starting point of my other ideas the certainty — often proved false as the contrary idea had been — the certainty of her guilt while i continued to imagine that i still felt doubts i must have suffered intensely during this period but i realise that it was inevitable we are healed of a suffering only by experiencing it to the full by protecting albertine from any contact with the outer world by forging the illusion that she was innocent just as later on when i adopted as the basis of my reasoning the thought that she was alive i was merely postponing the hour of my recovery because i was postponing the long hours that must elapse as a preliminary to the end of the necessary sufferings now with regard to these ideas of albertine’s guilt habit were it to come into play would do so according to the same laws that i had already experienced in the course of my life just as the name guermantes had lost the significance and the charm of a road bordered with flowers in purple and ruddy clusters and of the window of gilbert the bad albertine’s presence that of the blue undulations of the sea the names of swann of the liftboy of the princesse de guermantes and ever so many others had lost all that they had signified for me — that charm and that significance leaving in me a mere word which they considered important enough to live by itself as a man who has come to set a subordinate to work gives him his instructions and after a few weeks withdraws — similarly the painful knowledge of albertine’s guilt would be expelled from me by habit moreover between now and then as in the course of an attack launched from both flanks at once in this action by habit two allies would mutually lend a hand it was because this idea of albertine’s guilt would become for me an idea more probable more habitual that it would become less painful but on the other hand because it would be less painful the objections raised to my certainty of her guilt which were inspired in my mind only by my desire not to suffer too acutely would collapse one by one and as each action precipitates the next i should pass quickly enough from the certainty of albertine’s innocence to the certainty of her guilt it was essential that i should live with the idea of albertine’s death with the idea of her misdeeds in order that these ideas might become habitual that is to say that i might be able to forget these ideas and in the end to forget albertine herself

    i had not yet reached this stage at one time it was my memory made more clear by some intellectual excitement — such as reading a book — which revived my grief at other times it was on the contrary my grief — when it was aroused for instance by the anguish of a spell of stormy weather — which raised higher brought nearer to the light some memory of our love

    moreover these revivals of my love for albertine might occur after an interval of indifference interspersed with other curiosities as after the long interval that had dated from her refusal to let me kiss her at balbec during which i had thought far more about mme de guermantes about andrée about mme de stermaria it had revived when i had begun again to see her frequently but even now various preoccupations were able to bring about a separation — from a dead woman this time — in which she left me more indifferent and even later on when i loved her less this remained nevertheless for me one of those desires of which we soon grow tired but which resume their hold when we have allowed them to lie quiet for some time i pursued one living woman then another then i returned to my dead often it was in the most obscure recesses of myself when i could no longer form any clear idea of albertine that a name came by chance to stimulate painful reactions which i supposed to be no longer possible like those dying people whose brain is no longer capable of thought and who are made to contract their muscles by the prick of a needle and during long periods these stimulations occurred to me so rarely that i was driven to seek for myself the occasions of a grief of a crisis of jealousy in an attempt to reattach myself to the past to remember her better since regret for a woman is only a recrudescence of love and remains subject to the same laws the keenness of my regret was enhanced by the same causes which in albertine’s lifetime had increased my love for her and in the front rank of which had always appeared jealousy and grief but as a rule these occasions — for an illness a war can always last far longer than the most prophetic wisdom has calculated — took me unawares and caused me such violent shocks that i thought far more of protecting myself against suffering than of appealing to them for a memory

    moreover a word did not even need to be connected like ‘chaumont’ with some suspicion even a syllable common to different names was sufficient for my memory — as for an electrician who is prepared to use any substance that is a good conductor — to restore the contact between albertine and my heart in order to reawaken that suspicion to be the password the triumphant ‘open sesame’ unlocking the door of a past which one had ceased to take into account because having seen more than enough of it strictly speaking one no longer possessed it one had been shorn of it had supposed that by this subtraction one’s own personality had changed its form like a geometrical figure which by the removal of an angle would lose one of its sides certain phrases for instance in which there occurred the name of a street of a road where albertine might have been were sufficient to incarnate a potential nonexistent jealousy in the quest of a body a dwelling some material location some particular realisation often it was simply during my sleep that these ‘repetitions’ these ‘da capo’ of our dreams which turn back in an instant many pages of our memory many leaves of the calendar brought me back made me return to a painful but remote impression which had long since yielded its place to others but which now became present once more as a rule it was accompanied by a whole stagesetting clumsy but appealing which giving me the illusion of reality brought before my eyes sounded in my ears what thenceforward dated from that night besides in the history of a loveaffair and of its struggles against oblivion do not our dreams occupy an even larger place than our waking state our dreams which take no account of the infinitesimal divisions of time suppress transitions oppose sharp contrasts undo in an instant the web of consolation so slowly woven during the day and contrive for us by night a meeting with her whom we would eventually have forgotten provided always that we did not see her again for whatever anyone may say we can perfectly well have in a dream the impression that what is happening is real this could be impossible only for reasons drawn from our experience which at that moment is hidden from us with the result that this improbable life seems to us true sometimes by a defect in the internal lighting which spoiled the success of the play the appearance of my memories on the stage giving me the illusion of real life i really believed that i had arranged to meet albertine that i was seeing her again but then i found myself incapable of advancing to meet her of uttering the words which i meant to say to her to rekindle in order to see her the torch that had been quenched impossibilities which were simply in my dream the immobility the dumbness the blindness of the sleeper — as suddenly one sees in the faulty projection of a magic lantern a huge shadow which ought not to be visible obliterate the figures on the slide which is the shadow of the lantern itself or that of the operator at other times albertine appeared in my dream and proposed to leave me once again without my being moved by her determination this was because from my memory there had been able to filter into the darkness of my dream a warning ray of light which lodged in albertine deprived her future actions the departure of which she informed me of any importance this was the knowledge that she was dead often this memory that albertine was dead was combined without destroying it with the sensation that she was alive i conversed with her while i was speaking my grandmother came and went at the other end of the room part of her chin had crumbled away like a corroded marble but i found nothing unusual in that i told albertine that i had various questions to ask her with regard to the bathing establishment at balbec and to a certain laundress in touraine but i postponed them to another occasion since we had plenty of time and there was no longer any urgency she assured me that she was not doing anything wrong and that she had merely the day before kissed mlle vinteuil on the lips “what is she here” “yes in fact it is time for me to leave you for i have to go and see her presently” and since now that albertine was dead i no longer kept her a prisoner in my house as in the last months of her life her visit to mlle vinteuil disturbed me i sought to prevent albertine from seeing her albertine told me that she had done no more than kiss her but she was evidently beginning to lie again as in the days when she used to deny everything presently she would not be content probably with kissing mlle vinteuil no doubt from a certain point of view i was wrong to let myself be disturbed like this since according to what we are told the dead can feel can do nothing people say so but this did not explain the fact that my grandmother who was dead had continued nevertheless to live for many years and at that moment was passing to and fro in my room and no doubt once i was awake this idea of a dead woman who continued to live ought to have become as impossible for me to understand as it is to explain but i had already formed it so many times in the course of those transient periods of insanity which are our dreams that i had become in time familiar with it our memory of dreams may become lasting if they repeat themselves sufficiently often and long after my dream had ended i remained tormented by that kiss which albertine had told me that she had bestowed in words which i thought that i could still hear and indeed they must have passed very close to my ear since it was i myself that had uttered them

    all day long i continued to converse with albertine i questioned her i forgave her i made up for my forgetfulness of the things which i had always meant to say to her during her life and all of a sudden i was startled by the thought that to the creature invoked by memory to whom all these remarks were addressed no reality any longer corresponded that death had destroyed the various parts of the face to which the continual urge of the will to live now abolished had alone given the unity of a person at other times without my having dreamed as soon as i awoke i felt that the wind had changed in me it was blowing coldly and steadily from another direction issuing from the remotest past bringing back to me the sound of a clock striking faroff hours of the whistle of departing trains which i did not ordinarily hear one day i tried to interest myself in a book a novel by bergotte of which i had been especially fond its congenial characters appealed to me strongly and very soon reconquered by the charm of the book i began to hope as for a personal pleasure that the wicked woman might be punished my eyes grew moist when the happiness of the young lovers was assured “but then” i exclaimed in despair “from my attaching so much importance to what albertine may have done i must conclude that her personality is something real which cannot be destroyed that i shall find her one day in her own likeness in heaven if i invoke with so many prayers await with such impatience learn with such floods of tears the success of a person who has never existed save in bergotte’s imagination whom i have never seen whose appearance i am at liberty to imagine as i please” besides in this novel there were seductive girls amorous correspondences deserted paths in which lovers meet this reminded me that one may love clandestinely it revived my jealousy as though albertine had still been able to stroll along deserted paths and there was also the incident of a man who meets after fifty years a woman whom he loved in her youth does not recognise her is bored in her company and this reminded me that love does not last for ever and crushed me as though i were destined to be parted from albertine and to meet her again with indifference in my old age if i caught sight of a map of france my timorous eyes took care not to come upon touraine so that i might not be jealous nor so that i might not be miserable upon normandy where the map marked at least balbec and doncières between which i placed all those roads that we had traversed so many times together in the midst of other names of towns or villages of france names which were merely visible or audible the name of tours for instance seemed to be differently composed no longer of immaterial images but of venomous substances which acted in an immediate fashion upon my heart whose beatings they quickened and made painful and if this force extended to certain names which it had made so different from the rest how when i remained more shut up in myself when i confined myself to albertine herself could i be astonished that emanating from a girl who was probably just like any other girl this force which i found irresistible and to produce which any other woman might have served had been the result of a confusion and of the bringing in contact of dreams desires habits affections with the requisite interference of alternate pains and pleasures and this continued after her death memory being sufficient to carry on the real life which is mental i recalled albertine alighting from a railwaycarriage and telling me that she wanted to go to saintmars le vêtu and i saw her again also with her ‘polo’ pulled down over her cheeks i found once more possibilities of pleasure towards which i sprang saying to myself “we might have gone on together to incarville to doncières” there was no wateringplace in the neighbourhood of balbec in which i did not see her with the result that that country like a mythological land which had been preserved restored to me living and cruel the most ancient the most charming legends those that had been most obliterated by the sequel of my love oh what anguish were i ever to have to lie down again upon that bed at balbec around whose brass frame as around an immovable pivot a fixed bar my life had moved had evolved bringing successively into its compass gay conversations with my grandmother the nightmare of her death albertine’s soothing caresses the discovery of her vice and now a new life in which looking at the glazed bookcases upon which the sea was reflected i knew that albertine would never come into the room again was it not that balbec hotel like the sole indoor set of a provincial theatre in which for years past the most diverse plays have been performed which has served for a comedy for one tragedy for another for a purely poetical drama that hotel which already receded quite far into my past the fact that this part alone remained always the same with its walls its bookcases its glass panes through the course of fresh epochs in my life made me more conscious that in the total it was the rest it was myself that had changed and gave me thus that impression that the mysteries of life of love of death in which children imagine in their optimism that they have no share are not set apart but that we perceive with a dolorous pride that they have embodied themselves in the course of years in our own life

    i tried at times to take an interest in the newspapers but i found the act of reading them repellent and moreover it was not without danger to myself the fact is that from each of our ideas as from a clearing in a forest so many roads branch in different directions that at the moment when i least expected it i found myself faced by a fresh memory the title of fauré‘s melody le secret had led me to the duc de broglie’s secret du roi the name broglie to that of chaumont or else the words ‘good friday’ had made me think of golgotha golgotha of the etymology of the word which is it seems the equivalent of calvus mons chaumont but whatever the path by which i might have arrived at chaumont at that moment i received so violent a shock that i could think only of how to guard myself against pain some moments after the shock my intelligence which like the sound of thunder travels less rapidly taught me the reason chaumont had made me think of the butteschaumont to which mme bontemps had told me that andrée used often to go with albertine whereas albertine had told me that she had never seen the butteschaumont after a certain age our memories are so intertwined with one another that the thing of which we are thinking the book that we are reading are of scarcely any importance we have put something of ourself everywhere everything is fertile everything is dangerous and we can make discoveries no less precious than in pascal’s pensées in an advertisement of soap

    no doubt an incident such as this of the butteschaumont which at the time had appeared to me futile was in itself far less serious far less decisive evidence against albertine than the story of the bathwoman or the laundress but for one thing a memory which comes to us by chance finds in is an intact capacity for imagining that is to say in this case for suffering which we have partly exhausted when it is on the contrary ourselves that deliberately applied our mind to recreating a memory and to these latter memories those that concerned the bathwoman and the laundress ever present albeit obscured in my consciousness like the furniture placed in the semidarkness of a gallery which without being able to see them we avoid as we pass i had grown accustomed it was on the contrary a long time since i had given a thought to the butteschaumont or to take another instance to albertine’s scrutiny of the mirror in the casino at balbec or to her unexplained delay on the evening when i had waited so long for her after the guermantes party to any of those parts of her life which remained outside my heart and which i would have liked to know in order that they might become assimilated annexed to it become joined with the more pleasant memories which formed in it an albertine internal and genuinely possessed when i raised a corner of the heavy curtain of habit the stupefying habit which during the whole course of our life conceals from us almost the whole universe and in the dead of night without changing the label substitutes for the most dangerous or intoxicating poisons of life some kind of anodyne which does not procure any delight such a memory would come back to me as on the day of the incident itself with that fresh and piercing novelty of a recurring season of a change in the routine of our hours which in the realm of pleasures also if we get into a carriage on the first fine day in spring or leave the house at sunrise makes us observe our own insignificant actions with a lucid exaltation which makes that intense minute worth more than the sumtotal of the preceding days i found myself once more coming away from the party at the princesse de guermantes’s and awaiting the coming of albertine days in the past cover up little by little those that preceded them and are themselves buried beneath those that follow them but each past day has remained deposited in us as in a vast library in which there are older books a volume which doubtless nobody will ever ask to see and yet should this day from the past traversing the lucidity of the subsequent epochs rise to the surface and spread itself over us whom it entirely covers then for a moment the names resume their former meaning people their former aspect we ourselves our state of mind at the time and we feel with a vague suffering which however is endurable and will not last for long the problems which have long ago become insoluble and which caused us such anguish at the time our ego is composed of the superimposition of our successive states but this superimposition is not unalterable like the stratification of a mountain incessant upheavals raise to the surface ancient deposits i found myself as i had been after the party at the princesse de guermantes’s awaiting the coming of albertine what had she been doing that evening had she been unfaithful to me with whom aimé‘s revelations even if i accepted them in no way diminished for me the anxious despairing interest of this unexpected question as though each different albertine each fresh memory set a special problem of jealousy to which the solutions of the other problems could not apply but i would have liked to know not only with what woman she had spent that evening but what special pleasure the action represented to her what was occurring in that moment in herself sometimes at balbec françoise had gone to fetch her had told me that she had found her leaning out of her window with an uneasy questing air as though she were expecting somebody supposing that i learned that the girl whom she was awaiting was andrée what was the state of mind in which albertine awaited her that state of mind concealed behind the uneasy questing gaze that tendency what importance did it have for albertine how large a place did it occupy in her thoughts alas when i recalled my own agitation whenever i had caught sight of a girl who attracted me sometimes when i had merely heard her mentioned without having seen her my anxiety to look my best to enjoy every advantage my cold sweats i had only in order to torture myself to imagine the same voluptuous emotion in albertine and already it was sufficient to torture me if i said to myself that compared with this other thing her serious conversations with me about stendhal and victor hugo must have had very little weight with her if i felt her heart attracted towards other people detach itself from mine incarnate itself elsewhere but even the importance which this desire must have had for her and the reserve with which she surrounded it could not reveal to me what qualitatively it had been still less how she qualified it when she spoke of it to herself in bodily suffering at least we do not have ourselves to choose our pain the malady decides it and imposes it on us but in jealousy we have to some extent to make trial of sufferings of every sort and degree before we arrive at the one which seems appropriate and what could be more difficult when it is a question of a suffering such as that of feeling that she whom we loved is finding pleasure with persons different from ourselves who give her sensations which we are not capable of giving her or who at least by their configuration their aspect their ways represent to her anything but ourselves ah if only albertine had fallen in love with saintloup how much less it seemed to me i should have suffered it is true that we are unaware of the peculiar sensibility of each of our fellowcreatures but as a rule we do not even know that we are unaware of it for this sensibility of other people leaves us cold so far as albertine was concerned my misery or happiness would have depended upon the nature of this sensibility i knew well enough that it was unknown to me and the fact that it was unknown to me was already a grief — the unknown desires and pleasures that albertine felt once i was under the illusion that i beheld them when some time after albertine’s death andrée came to see me

    for the first time she seemed to me beautiful i said to myself that her almost woolly hair her dark shadowed eyes were doubtless what albertine had so dearly loved the materialisation before my eyes of what she used to take with her in her amorous dreams of what she beheld with the prophetic eyes of desire on the day when she had so suddenly decided to leave balbec

    like a strange dark flower that was brought to me from beyond the grave from the innermost being of a person in whom i had been unable to discover it i seemed to see before me the unlookedfor exhumation of a priceless relic the incarnate desire of albertine which andrée was to me as venus was the desire of jove andrée regretted albertine but i felt at once that she did not miss her forcibly removed from her friend by death she seemed to have easily taken her part in a final separation which i would not have dared to ask of her while albertine was alive so afraid would i have been of not succeeding in obtaining andrée’s consent she seemed on the contrary to accept without difficulty this renunciation but precisely at the moment when it could no longer be of any advantage to me andrée abandoned albertine to me but dead and when she had lost for me not only her life but retrospectively a little of her reality since i saw that she was not indispensable unique to andrée who had been able to replace her with other girls

    while albertine was alive i would not have dared to ask andrée to take me into her confidence as to the nature of their friendship both mutually and with mlle vinteuil’s friend since i was never absolutely certain that andrée did not repeat to albertine everything that i said to her but now such an inquiry even if it must prove fruitless would at least be unattended by danger i spoke to andrée not in a questioning tone but as though i had known all the time perhaps from albertine of the fondness that andrée herself had for women and of her own relations with mlle vinteuil’s friend she admitted everything without the slightest reluctance smiling as she spoke from this avowal i might derive the most painful consequences first of all because andrée so affectionate and coquettish with many of the young men at balbec would never have been suspected by anyone of practices which she made no attempt to deny so that by analogy when i discovered this novel andrée i might think that albertine would have confessed them with the same ease to anyone other than myself whom she felt to be jealous but on the other hand andrée having been albertine’s dearest friend and the friend for whose sake she had probably returned in haste from balbec now that andrée was proved to have these tastes the conclusion that was forced upon my mind was that albertine and andrée had always indulged them together certainly just as in a stranger’s presence we do not always dare to examine the gift that he has brought us the wrapper of which we shall not unfasten until the donor has gone so long as andrée was with me i did not retire into myself to examine the grief that she had brought me which i could feel was already causing my bodily servants my nerves my heart a keen disturbance which out of good breeding i pretended not to notice speaking on the contrary with the utmost affability to the girl who was my guest without diverting my gaze to these internal incidents it was especially painful to me to hear andrée say speaking of albertine “oh yes she always loved going to the chevreuse valley” to the vague and nonexistent universe in which albertine’s excursions with andrée occurred it seemed to me that the latter had by a posterior and diabolical creation added an accursed valley i felt that andrée was going to tell me everything that she was in the habit of doing with albertine and while i endeavoured from politeness from force of habit from selfesteem perhaps from gratitude to appear more and more affectionate while the space that i had still been able to concede to albertine’s innocence became smaller and smaller i seemed to perceive that despite my efforts i presented the paralysed aspect of an animal round which a steadily narrowing circle is slowly traced by the hypnotising bird of prey which makes no haste because it is sure of reaching when it chooses the victim that can no longer escape i gazed at her nevertheless and with such liveliness naturalness and assurance as a person can muster who is trying to make it appear that he is not afraid of being hypnotised by the other’s stare i said casually to andrée “i have never mentioned the subject to you for fear of offending you but now that we both find a pleasure in talking about her i may as well tell you that i found out long ago all about the things of that sort that you used to do with albertine and i can tell you something that you will be glad to hear although you know it already albertine adored you” i told andrée that it would be of great interest to me if she would allow me to see her even if she simply confined herself to caresses which would not embarrass her unduly in my presence performing such actions with those of albertine’s friends who shared her tastes and i mentioned rosemonde berthe each of albertine’s friends in the hope of finding out something “apart from the fact that not for anything in the world would i do the things you mention in your presence” andrée replied “i do not believe that any of the girls whom you have named have those tastes” drawing closer in spite of myself to the monster that was attracting me i answered “what you are not going to expect me to believe that of all your band albertine was the only one with whom you did that sort of thing” “but i have never done anything of the sort with albertine” “come now my dear andrée why deny things which i have known for at least three years i see no harm in them far from it talking of such things that evening when she was so anxious to go with you the next day to mme verdurin’s you may remember perhaps    ” before i had completed my sentence i saw in andrée’s eyes which it sharpened to a pinpoint like those stones which for that reason jewellers find it difficult to use a fleeting worried stare like the heads of persons privileged to go behind the scenes who draw back the edge of the curtain before the play has begun and at once retire in order not to be seen this uneasy stare vanished everything had become quite normal but i felt that anything which i might see hereafter would have been specially arranged for my benefit at that moment i caught sight of myself in the mirror i was struck by a certain resemblance between myself and andrée if i had not long since ceased to shave my upper lip and had had but the faintest shadow of a moustache this resemblance would have been almost complete it was perhaps when she saw at balbec my moustache which had scarcely begun to grow that albertine had suddenly felt that impatient furious desire to return to paris “but i cannot all the same say things that are not true for the simple reason that you see no harm in them i swear to you that i never did anything with albertine and i am convinced that she detested that sort of thing the people who told you were lying to you probably with some ulterior motive” she said with a questioning defiant air “oh very well then since you won’t tell me” i replied i preferred to appear to be unwilling to furnish a proof which i did not possess and yet i uttered vaguely and at random the name of the butteschaumont “i may have gone to the butteschaumont with albertine but is it a place that has a particularly evil reputation” i asked her whether she could not mention the subject to gisèle who had at one time been on intimate terms with albertine but andrée assured me that after the outrageous way in which gisèle had behaved to her recently asking a favour of her was the one thing that she must absolutely decline to do for me “if you see her” she went on “do not tell her what i have said to you about her there is no use in making an enemy of her she knows what i think of her but i have always preferred to avoid having violent quarrels with her which only have to be patched up afterwards and besides she is a dangerous person but you can understand that when one has read the letter which i had in my hands a week ago and in which she lied with such absolute treachery nothing not even the noblest actions in the world can wipe out the memory of such a thing” in short if albeit andrée had those tastes to such an extent that she made no pretence of concealing them and albertine had felt for her that strong affection which she had undoubtedly felt notwithstanding this andrée had never had any carnal relations with albertine and had never been aware that albertine had those tastes this meant that albertine did not have them and had never enjoyed with anyone those relations which rather than with anyone else she would have enjoyed with andrée and so when andrée had left me i realised that so definite a statement had brought me peace of mind but perhaps it had been dictated by a sense of the obligation which andrée felt that she owed to the dead girl whose memory still survived in her not to let me believe what albertine had doubtless while she was alive begged her to deny

    novelists sometimes pretend in an introduction that while travelling in a foreign country they have met somebody who has told them the story of a person’s life they then withdraw in favour of this casual acquaintance and the story that he tells them is nothing more or less than their novel thus the life of fabrice del dongo was related to stendhal by a canon of padua how gladly would we when we are in love that is to say when another person’s existence seems to us mysterious find some such wellinformed narrator and undoubtedly he exists do we not ourselves frequently relate without any trace of passion the story of some woman or other to one of our friends or to a stranger who has known nothing of her loveaffairs and listens to us with keen interest the person that i was when i spoke to bloch of the duchesse de guermantes of mme swann that person still existed who could have spoken to me of albertine that person exists always    but we never come across him it seemed to me that if i had been able to find women who had known her i should have learned everything of which i was unaware and yet to strangers it must have seemed that nobody could have known so much of her life as myself did i even know her dearest friend andrée thus it is that we suppose that the friend of a minister must know the truth about some political affair or cannot be implicated in a scandal having tried and failed the friend has found that whenever he discussed politics with the minister the latter confined himself to generalisations and told him nothing more than what had already appeared in the newspapers or that if he was in any trouble his repeated attempts to secure the minister’s help have ended invariably in an “it is not in my power” against which the friend is himself powerless i said to myself “if i could have known such and such witnesses” from whom if i had known them i should probably have been unable to extract anything more than from andrée herself the custodian of a secret which she refused to surrender differing in this respect also from swann who when he was no longer jealous ceased to feel any curiosity as to what odette might have done with forcheville even after my jealousy had subsided the thought of making the acquaintance of albertine’s laundress of the people in her neighbourhood of reconstructing her life in it her intrigues this alone had any charm for me and as desire always springs from a preliminary sense of value as had happened to me in the past with gilberte with the duchesse de guermantes it was in the districts in which albertine had lived in the past the women of her class that i sought to know and whose presence alone i could have desired even without my being able to learn anything from them they were the only women towards whom i felt myself attracted as being those whom albertine had known or whom she might have known women of her class or of the classes with which she liked to associate in a word those women who had in my eyes the distinction of resembling her or of being of the type that had appealed to her as i recalled thus either albertine herself or the type for which she had doubtless felt a preference these women aroused in me an agonising feeling of jealousy or regret which afterwards when my grief had been dulled changed into a curiosity not devoid of charm and among them especially the women of the working class on account of that life so different from the life that i knew which is theirs no doubt it is only in our mind that we possess things and we do not possess a picture because it hangs in our diningroom if we are incapable of understanding it or a landscape because we live in front of it without even glancing at it but still i had had in the past the illusion of recapturing balbec when in paris albertine came to see me and i held her in my arms similarly i obtained a contact restricted and furtive as it might be with albertine’s life the atmosphere of workrooms a conversation across a counter the spirit of the slums when i kissed a seamstress andrée these other women all of them in relation to albertine — as albertine herself had been in relation to balbec — were to be numbered among those substitutes for pleasures replacing one another in a gradual degradation which enable us to dispense with the pleasure to which we can no longer attain a holiday at balbec or the love of albertine as the act of going to the louvre to look at a titian which was originally in venice consoles us for not being able to go there for those pleasures which separated one from another by indistinguishable gradations convert our life into a series of concentric contiguous harmonic and graduated zones encircling an initial desire which has set the tone eliminated everything that does not combine with it and spread the dominant colour as had for instance occurred to me also in the cases of the duchesse de guermantes and of gilberte andrée these women were to the desire for the gratification of which i knew that it was hopeless now to pray to have albertine by my side what one evening before i knew albertine save by sight had been the manyfaceted and refreshing lustre of a bunch of grapes

    associated now with the memory of my love albertine’s physical and social attributes in spite of which i had loved her attracted my desire on the contrary towards what at one time it would least readily have chosen dark girls of the lower middle class indeed what was beginning to a certain extent to revive in me was that immense desire which my love for albertine had not been able to assuage that immense desire to know life which i used to feel on the roads round balbec in the streets of paris that desire which had caused me so much suffering when supposing it to exist in albertine’s heart also i had sought to deprive her of the means of satisfying it with anyone but myself now that i was able to endure the thought of her desire as that thought was at once aroused by my own desire these two immense appetites coincided i would have liked us to be able to indulge them together i said to myself “that girl would have appealed to her” and led by this sudden digression to think of her and of her death i felt too unhappy to be able to pursue my own desire any further as long ago the méséglise and guermantes ways had established the conditions of my liking for the country and had prevented me from finding any real charm in a village where there was no old church nor cornflowers nor buttercups so it was by attaching them in myself to a past full of charm that my love for albertine made me seek out exclusively a certain type of woman i began again as before i was in love with her to feel the need of things in harmony with her which would be interchangeable with a memory that had become gradually less exclusive i could not have found any pleasure now in the company of a goldenhaired and haughty duchess because she would not have aroused in me any of the emotions that sprang from albertine from my desire for her from the jealousy that i had felt of her loveaffairs from my sufferings from her death for our sensations in order to be strong need to release in us something different from themselves a sentiment which will not find any satisfaction in pleasure but which adds itself to desire enlarges it makes it cling desperately to pleasure in proportion as the love that albertine had felt for certain women ceased to cause me pain it attached those women to my past gave them something that was more real as to buttercups to hawthornblossom the memory of combray gave a greater reality than to unfamiliar flowers even of andrée i no longer said to myself with rage “albertine loved her” but on the contrary so as to explain my desire to myself in a tone of affection “albertine loved her dearly” i could now understand the widowers whom we suppose to have found consolation and who prove on the contrary that they are inconsolable because they marry their deceased wife’s sister thus the decline of my love seemed to make fresh loves possible for me and albertine like those women long loved for themselves who later feeling their lover’s desire grow feeble maintain their power by confining themselves to the office of panders provided me as the pompadour provided louis xv with fresh damsels even in the past my time had been divided into periods in which i desired this woman or that when the violent pleasures afforded by one had grown dull i longed for the other who would give me an almost pure affection until the need of more sophisticated caresses brought back my desire for the first now these alternations had come to an end or at least one of the periods was being indefinitely prolonged what i would have liked was that the newcomer should take up her abode in my house and should give me at night before leaving me a friendly sisterly kiss in order that i might have believed — had i not had experience of the intolerable presence of another person — that i regretted a kiss more than a certain pair of lips a pleasure more than a love a habit more than a person i would have liked also that the newcomers should be able to play vinteuil’s music to me like albertine to talk to me as she had talked about elstir ah this was impossible their love would not be equivalent to hers i thought whether because a love to which were annexed all those episodes visits to picture galleries evenings spent at concerts the whole of a complicated existence which allows correspondences conversations a flirtation preliminary to the more intimate relations a serious friendship afterwards possesses more resources than love for a woman who can only offer herself as an orchestra possesses more resources than a piano or because more profoundly my need of the same sort of affection that albertine used to give me the affection of a girl of a certain culture who would at the same time be a sister to me was — like my need of women of the same class as albertine — merely a recrudescence of my memory of albertine of my memory of my love for her and once again i discovered first of all that memory has no power of invention that it is powerless to desire anything else even anything better than what we have already possessed secondly that it is spiritual in the sense that reality cannot furnish it with the state which it seeks lastly that when applied to a person who is dead the resurrection that it incarnates is not so much that of the need to love in which it makes us believe as that of the need of the absent person so that the resemblance to albertine of the woman whom i had chosen the resemblance of her affection even if i succeeded in winning it to albertine’s made me all the more conscious of the absence of what i had been unconsciously seeking of what was indispensable to the revival of my happiness that is to say albertine herself the time during which we had lived together the past in quest of which i had unconsciously gone certainly upon fine days paris seemed to me innumerably aflower with all these girls whom i did not desire but who thrust down their roots into the obscurity of the desire and the mysterious nocturnal life of albertine they were like the girls of whom she had said to me at the outset when she had not begun to distrust me “that girl is charming what nice hair she has” all the curiosity that i had felt about her life in the past when i knew her only by sight and on the other hand all my desires in life were blended in this sole curiosity to see albertine in company with other women perhaps because thus when they had left her i should have remained alone with her the last and the master and when i observed her hesitations her uncertainty when she asked herself whether it would be worth her while to spend the evening with this or that girl her satiety when the other had gone perhaps her disappointment i should have brought to the light of day i should have restored to its true proportions the jealousy that albertine inspired in me because seeing her thus experience them i should have taken the measure and discovered the limit of her pleasures of how many pleasures of what an easy life she has deprived us i said — to myself by that stubborn obstinacy in denying her instincts and as once again i sought to discover what could have been the reason for her obstinacy all of a sudden the memory came to me of a remark that i had made to her at balbec on the day when she gave me a pencil as i rebuked her for not having allowed me to kiss her i had told her that i thought a kiss just as natural as i thought it degrading that a woman should have relations with another woman alas perhaps albertine had never forgotten that imprudent speech

    i took home with me the girls who had appealed to me least i stroked their virginal tresses i admired a wellmodelled little nose a spanish pallor certainly in the past even with a woman of whom i had merely caught sight on a road near balbec in a street in paris i had felt the individuality of my desire and that it would be adulterating it to seek to assuage it with another person but life by disclosing to me little by little the permanence of our needs had taught me that failing one person we must content ourselves with another — and i felt that what i had demanded of albertine another woman mme de stermaria could have given me but it had been albertine and what with the satisfaction of my need of affection and the details of her body an interwoven tangle of memories had become so inextricable that i could no longer detach from a desire for affection all that embroidery of my memories of albertine’s body she alone could give me that happiness the idea of her uniqueness was no longer a metaphysical a priori based upon what was individual in albertine as in the case of the women i passed in the street long ago but an a posteriori created by the contingent and indissoluble overlapping of my memories i could no longer desire any affection without feeling a need of her without grief at her absence also the mere resemblance of the woman i had selected of the affection that i asked of her to the happiness that i had known made me all the more conscious of all that was lacking before that happiness could revive the same vacuum that i had found in my room after albertine had left and had supposed that i could fill by taking women in my arms i found in them they had never spoken to me these women of vinteuil’s music of saintsimon’s memoirs they had not sprayed themselves with too strong a scent before coming to visit me they had not played at interlacing their eyelashes with mine all of which things were important because apparently they allow us to weave dreams round the sexual act itself and to give ourselves the illusion of love but in reality because they formed part of my memory of albertine and it was she whom i would fain have seen again what these women had in common with albertine made me feel all the more clearly what was lacking of her in them which was everything and would never be anything again since albertine was dead and so my love for albertine which had drawn me towards these women made me indifferent to them and perhaps my regret for albertine and the persistence of my jealousy which had already outlasted the period fixed for them in my most pessimistic calculations would never have altered appreciably had their existence isolated from the rest of my life been subjected merely to the play of my memories to the actions and reactions of a psychology applicable to immobile states and had it not been drawn into a vaster system in which souls move in time as bodies move in space as there is a geometry in space so there is a psychology in time in which the calculations of a plane psychology would no longer be accurate because we should not be taking into account time and one of the forms that it assumes oblivion oblivion the force of which i was beginning to feel and which is so powerful an instrument of adaptation to reality because it gradually destroys in us the surviving past which is a perpetual contradiction of it and i ought really to have discovered sooner that one day i should no longer be in love with albertine when i had realised from the difference that existed between what the importance of her person and of her actions was to me and what it was to other people that my love was not so much a love for her as a love in myself i might have deduced various consequences from this subjective nature of my love and that being a mental state it might easily long survive the person but also that having no genuine connexion with that person it must like every mental state even the most permanent find itself one day obsolete be ‘replaced’ and that when that day came everything that seemed to attach me so pleasantly indissolubly to the memory of albertine would no longer exist for me it is the tragedy of other people that they are to us merely showcases for the very perishable collections of our own mind for this very reason we base upon them projects which have all the ardour of our mind but our mind grows tired our memory crumbles the day would arrive when i would readily admit the first comer to albertine’s room as i had without the slightest regret given albertine the agate marble or other gifts that i had received from gilberte
