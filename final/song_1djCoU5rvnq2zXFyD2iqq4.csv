du du du du
du du du dum dum
du du du dum dum dum

verse 1
hand in hand
the flowers understand
that we’re fine you and i
hands are tied
i dont mind
i’ll make you be ok

chorus
but recently everyone says they are seeing less of me
i could do better if i had energy
be like i used to be
and frequently i picture myself walking straight into the sea
laughing as the waves come rolling to my knees
what a place to be

verse 2
side by side
you keep me safe from their static getting through
please be fine
its too late now to go leave you behind
you might also likechorus
but recently everyone says they are seeing less of me
i could do better if i had energy
be like i used to be
and frequently i picture myself walking straight into the sea
laughing as the waves come rolling to my knees
what a place to be

verse 3
du du du dum dum
du du du dum dum
and its a lovely day for swimming
pretend i didn’t see the red flags that said dont go
cause if the storm out there’s beginning
i’ll find it for myself and not cause someone told me so
du du du dum dum
du du du dum dum dum

chorus
recently everyone says they are seeing less of me
i could do better if i had energy
be like i used to be
and frequently i picture myself walking straight into the sea
laughing as the waves come rolling to my knees
what a place to be6embed"
