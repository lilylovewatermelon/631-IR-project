you could find you a girl on a friday night
dancin in the back of a bar
a sunday morning hands up high singing front row in the choir
you could find you a girl through a friend of a friend
or she could show up right out of the blue
it dont matter where you find her
just as long as you

chorus
find you a girl that leaves you speechless
gets wild on the town but still loves jesus
one thats worth the wait even when she aint on time
find you a girl that loves her daddy
talkin bout babies makes her happy
yeah take it from me thats the kind you need to find
you just cant have mine

verse 2
find you a girl that likes to do all the things you love to do
and even on your worst day
she still thinks you hung thе moon
find you a girl thats like fine wine that just gеts better with age
boy youll have it made

chorus
if you find you a girl that leaves you speechless
gets wild on the town but still loves jesus
one thats worth the wait even when she aint on time
find you a girl that loves her daddy
talkin bout babies makes her happy
yeah take it from me thats the kind you need to find
you just cant have mine
