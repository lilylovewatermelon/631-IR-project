verse
will somebody get the body bags
we gon put the beats in em nah
put the mcs in em season em
put em on a beat with me then im eatin em
get away from the table you rappers aint hungry enough
you rappers aint hungry like us
they talk about me like im here they talk about you like you was woo
that nurse came into my room she told me im sick in the head
im in hiphops hospital bed with a pad and a pen and a brace on my neck
they told me that im never leavin
why i am as ill as it gets
any rapper that say that they runnin the game
ima come in they session and cut off they legs woo
strap a grenade to my head pull out the pin
my music is mindblowin
aint nobody do it like i do it
you aint ever been on my level
i got a problem with the way they keep on talkin
and actin like everybody gonna get it
better sleep with your eyes open
you wanna know what i noticed
look around at my fan base and they ready i see you
that last album was heavy i see you
that last album was gritty
how you gon match that just let me
do what i do best youre better off playin russian roulette
than comin in a booth with me cause i get
a little bit intense im like whos next
yall better watch it take a look at where the clock is
its my time
this ladder of music that i climbed
i took the machete the game isnt ready
them rappers they comin up on me
i cut off the ladder and i told em byebye byebye
what you lookin for a highfive nice try woo
do not believe everything that you read on the internet
i do not know who your dentist is
but he should clean out your mouth
dont call me a sellout thats something ive never been
ive been through hell all my life though
but i know what heaven is
father forgive me for i am a sinner
but you gave me music as medicine woo
if nobody want a problem when they get in my zone better leave me be
im a mean mc
better feed me rappers or feed me beats agh
feed me both of em
they like nate whats it like to be famous hahahahahaha
umm ill let you know if i make it yeah
i wonder what life would be like
if i didnt stick out my neck
two hundred dollars inside of my bank account woo
i was livin on that
i need some money to pay for my rent
i need some money to pay for my gas
im not complainin im just bein honest
i promise that i will not beg for respect nah
i get so frustrated take a look at what ive created
time is wasting and i aint waiting
im a doctor with no job me i dont have no patience
i keep pacing back and forth i keep racing
you aint never been in my book and i got a problem with it why cause you actin like you read my pages
i wreck these stages
real talk better give me space cause i am chasing
something they told me that i wont make it agh
im not famous im just nathan woo
and i wonder how the world gon take this
they might hate it
but you know anything about me
you know that dont mean im changin
cause you know im real with it
dont care if you feelin it im feelin it
you dont like it then deal with it
and if god aint real real isnt
used to wonder why i existed
i exist in the world thats real different
and what you gon be when you grow up nate
i doubt they will get it
my life is a mess better watch your step when you step in it
some of this brain is offlimits
im off in a world you dont get
cause you aint ever been in it
in ten minutes i still couldnt explain whats inside my brain dont mess with it
ive invested a lot of me inside these lines im just protectin em
everybody wanna hear the real version of life
then dont get so sensitive when i say something a little bit raw
i jot my thoughts and they call it negative
you wanna know where my heart is
i stand out cause i wear my garbage
i work my hardest
and every time i look into the mirror i dont forget about where i started woo
