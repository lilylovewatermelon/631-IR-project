you wake up i know its time to go
with a spinning head i lie and watch you smoke
change the hands on my watch and hold you close
this misery is weightless as a stone

prechorus
have you lost the same things i have lost
do you know that panic i know
and would i see the terror in your face
do you know that fever i know

chorus
i wish time was still
wed stay right here
with time to kill
in our hearts without chains
and if time was still
wed have no fear
or scars to heal
in our hearts without chains
in our hearts without chains

verse 2
you left everything behind except yourself
but all i see is question marks and nothing else
you mustve landed in new york by now
please dont bring this love down
