all i ever wanted was to be interesting
you said you dont mind
lie to me one more time

im boring
no fun at all
i put my head right through the wall
i tried to make myself feel
no luck this time
try again next year

ive led myself to believe
the world has turned its back on me
hows that for comforting
i just want to be interesting

sorry if you dont see me
as much as you deem necessary
you said you care for your friends
did you lie or just pretend

i never wanted sympathy
just wanted to be something
i never wanted sympathy
just wanted to be something
i never wanted sympathy
just wanted to be something
i never wanted sympathy
just wanted to be something
you might also likeive led myself to believe the world has turned its back on me
