did my invitations disappear
whyd i put my heart on every cursive letter
tell me why the hell no one is here
tell me what to do to make it all feel better

prechorus
maybe its a cruel joke on me
whatever whatever
just means theres way more cake for me
forever forever

chorus
its my party and ill cry if i want to
cry if i want to cry cry cry
ill cry until the candles burn down this place
ill cry until my pity partys in flames
its my party and ill cry if i want to
cry if i want to cry cry cry
ill cry until the candles burn down this place
ill cry until my pity partys in flames

verse 2
maybe if i knew all of them well
i wouldnt have been trapped inside this hell that holds me
maybe if i casted out a spell
or told them decorations were in pastel ribbons
