i become a nervous kid
i imagine your old girlfriends
i imagine what you did
i dont know if this is normal
i dont know if this is love
with you i get so formal
and i feel all this other stuff

shy with you
though ive been around the block
shy with you
cause youre the one i really want

other guys i dont care about
so easy with them
anything you can do without
so easy to win
i cant do without your love
so i try to play it cool
everytime you call my bluff
i just stand there like a fool

shy with you
though ive been around the block
shy with you
cause youre the one i really want
shy with you
sometimes a heart can hurt a lot
shy with you
cause youre the one i really want

i want you
i want you and so its true
