1789
how does the bastard orphan
immigrant decorated war vet
unite the colonies through more debt
fight the other founding fathers til he has to forfeit
have it all lose it all
you ready for more yet
treasury secretary washington’s the president
ev’ry american experiment sets a precedent
not so fast someone came along to resist him
pissed him off until we had a twoparty system
you haven’t met him yet you haven’t had the chance
‘cause he’s been kickin’ ass as the ambassador to france
but someone’s gotta keep the american promise
you simply must meet thomas thomas

company
thomas jefferson’s coming home
thomas jefferson’s coming home
thomas jefferson’s coming home
thomas jefferson’s coming home
thomas jefferson’s coming home lord he’s
been off in paris for so long
aaaooo

i can’t believe that we are free believe that we are free
ready to face
whatever’s awaiting
me in nyc me in nyc
but who’s waitin’ for me when i step in the place
my friend james madison red in the face
he grabs my arm and
i respond
“what’s goin’ on”
aaaooo
