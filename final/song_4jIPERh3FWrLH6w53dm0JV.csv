things will never be the same
still im awfully glad i came
resonating in the shape of things to come
never waiting when i know theres only one
messed it up but rest assured
no one ever thinks theyre cured
just a minute while i reinvent myself
make it up and then i take it off the shelf

prechorus anthony kiedis
over the laws of light
over the moon by midnight
lets do it all this time
everyone wishing well we go and

chorus anthony kiedis with john frusciante
everyone knows anything goes and now
we are the lotus kids
oh better take note of this
for the story

verse 2 anthony kiedis  john frusciante
the rising moon is on the shine
the blood of scorpios a nine
like the fear thats in the eyes of every doe ahah
say it now cause john and jane would like to know ahah
is it safe inside your head
songs to serenade the dead
all along i said i know no enemies
mix it up until there are no pedigrees
