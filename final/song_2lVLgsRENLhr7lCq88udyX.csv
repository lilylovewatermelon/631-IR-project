its a crime you let it happen to me
never mind i let it happen to you
i dont mind forget it theres nothing to lose
but my mind and all the things i wanted

verse 2
every time i get it throw it away
its a sign i get it i wanna stay
by the time i lose it im not afraid
im alive but i can surely fake it

how can i believe
when this cloud hangs over me
youre the part of me
that i dont wanna see

verse 3
theres a place i see you follow me
just a taste of all that might come to be
