man its been a long day
stuck thinking bout it driving on the freeway
wondering if i really tried everything i could
not knowing if i should try a little harder

prechorus
ooh but im scared to death
that there may not be another one like this
and i confess
that im only holding on by a thin thin thread

chorus
im kicking the curb cause you never heard
the words that you needed so bad
and im kicking the dirt cause i never gave you
the things that you needed to have
im so sad sad

verse 2
man its been a long night
just sitting here trying not to look back
still looking at the road we never drove on
and wondering if the one i chose was the right one

prechorus
oh but im scared to death
that there may not be another one like this
and i confess
that im only holding on by a thin thin thread

im kicking the curb cause you never heard
the words that you needed so bad
and im kicking the dirt cause i never gave you
the things that you needed to have
im so sad sad

prechorus
oh but im scared to death
that there may not be another one like this
and i confess
that im only holding on by a thin thin thread

chorus
im kicking the curb cause you never heard
the words that you needed so bad
and im kicking the dirt cause i never gave you
the things that you needed to have
and im kicking the curb cause you never heard
the words that you needed so bad
im so sad so sad11embed"
