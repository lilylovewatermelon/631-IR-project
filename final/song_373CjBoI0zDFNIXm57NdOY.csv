i saw and i swear
an old man with a deadlock stare
and he said to me
youre too old to be pretending

but you dont know me i aint got no legacy
and he said to me its not too late to pick up the pieces
woo woo
yeah
woo woo

verse 2
so i said that i smoke
and been known to drink my share
youre young and youre drunk
he said with a stonecold glare

chorus
but you dont know me i aint got no legacy
and he said to me its not too late to pick up the pieces
woo woo
yeah
woo woo

walking in the shadows of your fear
and youre headed for the gallows
