verse 2 kid cudi
let me tell you bout my month yall
endless shopping i had a ball
i had to ball for therapy my shrink dont think that helps at all
whatever that man aint wearing these leather pants
i diagnose my damn self these damn pills aint working fam
inin my spare time punching walls fucking up my hand
i know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life youd understand
but i cant fold some poor soul got it way worse
were all troubled in a world of trouble
its scary to have a kid walk this earth
im what you made god fuck yes im so odd
thinking bout all my old friends who werent my friends all along
hm when it rains it pours whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
every day to find sanes a chore amidst a dream with no exit doors
