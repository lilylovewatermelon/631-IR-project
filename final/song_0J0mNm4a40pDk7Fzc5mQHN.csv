uncle sam taught him to shoot maybe a little too well
finger on the trigger loaded bullet
he hit the stage so full of rage and let the whole world know it
six feet away they heard him say oh god dont let him pull it
please god dont let him pull it
how could you put us through it
his brother watched you do it

chorus
how could you take his life away what made you think you had the right
how could you be so full of hate to take away somebodys life
and when i heard you let him die and made the world all wonder why
i sat at home and on my own i cried alone
and scratched your name on the side of a bullet

verse 2
and in the wake of his mistake so many lives are broken
gone forever from a loaded bullet
and no excuse that you could use could pull somebody through it
and to this day so many say god whyd you let him do it

how could you let him do it
how could you put us through it
his brother watched him do it

and on my own i scratched your name on the side of a bullet
on the side of a bullet
on the side of a bullet
