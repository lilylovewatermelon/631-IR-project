i would do at this moment
when youre standing before me
with tears in your eyes
trying to tell me that you
have found you another
and you just dont love me no more

what did you think
i would say at this moment
when im faced with the knowledge
that you just dont love me
did you think i would curse you
or say things to hurt you
cause you just dont love me no more

did you think i could hate you
or raise my hands to you
oh come on you know me too well
and how can i hurt you
when darling i love you
and you know i would never hurt you

no no no

what did you think
i would give at this moment
if youd just stay id subtract
twenty years from my life
id fall down on my knees
id kiss the ground that you walk on
if i could just hold you again
you might also likeid fall down on my knees
kiss the ground that you walk on baby
if i could just hold you
mmmmm
if i could just hold you
i would fall down down on my knees
oh god please
let me hold you let me hold you again

woooooh wooooohh

im gonna miss you girl
im gonna miss you girl
i can see the tears in your eyes baby
babe i know
you know im down on my knees

what do you think i would do baby
did you think i could hurt youembed"
