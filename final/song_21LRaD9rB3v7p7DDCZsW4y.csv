its got a touch of the town where i grew up
something in it them california girls love
some people like to make a little fun of
the way i talk
it gets slower after three or four cold beers
and gets louder when im cheerin on the volunteers
folks know im country when they hear
the way i talk

chorus
it sounds a little bit like my daddy
it dont cuss around my mama
got some words youve never heard
less you come from down yonder
the man upstairs gets it
so i aint tryna fix it
no i cant hide it
i dont fight it i just roll with it
oh kinda slow like the mississippi roads
its the only way i know
man it aint my fault
i just live the way i talk

verse 2
yeah its yes sir no maam yall come back now
fightin words if you run my last name down
i aint ashamed matter of fact im damn proud
of the way i talk yall

it sounds a little bit like my daddy
it dont cuss around my mama
got some words youve never heard
less you come from down yonder
the man upstairs gets it
so i aint tryna fix it
no i cant hide it
i dont fight it i just roll with it
oh kinda slow like the mississippi roads
its the only way i know
man it aint my fault
i just live the way i talk

bridge
slow like a sunday morning service back home
and kinda sweet when i got a girl to love on
if you know me you know

chorus
it sounds a little bit like my daddy
it dont cuss around my mama
got some words youve never heard
less you come from down yonder
the man upstairs gets it
so i aint tryna fix it
no i cant hide it
i dont fight it i just roll with it
oh kinda slow like the mississippi roads
its the only way i know
man it aint my fault
i just live the way i talk
