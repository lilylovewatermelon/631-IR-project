verse 1
born to push you round
better just stay down
you pull away he hits the flesh you hit the ground
mouth so full of lies
tend to black your eyes
just keep them closed keep praying just keep waiting

chorus
waiting for the one
the day that never comes ah
when you stand up and feel the warmth
but the sunshine never comes no
no the sunshine never comes

verse 2
push you cross that line
just stay down this time
hide in yourself crawl in yourself youll have your time
god ill make them pay
take it back one day
ill end this day
ill splatter color on this gray

waiting for the one
the day that never comes ah
when you stand up and feel the warmth
but the sunshine never comes

bridge
love is a four letter word
and never spoken here
love is a four letter word
here in this prison
i suffer this no longer
ill put an end to this i swear
this i swear the sun will shine
this i swear this i swear
this i swear31embed"
