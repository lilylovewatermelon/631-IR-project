ive been talking to myself again
not communicating anything
its a never ending fallacy
that you have always been so good to me
that you have always been so good to me

verse 2
when im trying to explain it all
you are making me uncomfortable
take a little piece of honesty
and be the man you always promised me
and be the man you always promised me

chorus
i said that i would never leave
but now i cannot breathe
i said that i would let you know
but im not letting go
ive tried to make you understand
now ive done all i can
its time to make my final move
cause im not happy

verse 3
ive been talking to myself again
making sure that i am listening
im developing an attitude
it pushes me towards my solitude
it pushes me towards my solitude

bridge
i never thought it could happen
i never thought it could be
i never wanted to be here
i never wanted to see
i never wanted to see

chorus
i said that i would never leave
but now i cannot breathe
i said that i would let you know
but im not letting go
ive tried to make you understand
