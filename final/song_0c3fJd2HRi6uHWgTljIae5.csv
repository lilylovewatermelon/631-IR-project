i have nothing left to give
i have found the perfect end
you were made to make it hurt
disappear into the dirt
carry me to heavens arms
light the way and let me go
take the time to take my breath
i will end where i began

prechorus
and i will find the enemy within
because i can feel it crawl beneath my skin

chorus
dear agony
just let go of me
suffer slowly
is this the way its got to be
dear agony

verse 2
suddenly
the lights go out
let forever
drag me down
i will fight for one last breath
i will fight until the end

and i will find the enemy within
because i can feel it crawl beneath my skin

chorus
dear agony
just let go of me
suffer slowly
is this the way its got to be
dont bury me
faceless enemy
im so sorry
is this the way its got to be
dear agony

bridge
leave me alone
god let me go
im blue and cold
black sky will burn
love pull me down
hate lift me up
just turn around
theres nothing left

prechorus
somewhere far beyond this world
i feel nothing anymore
chorus
dear agony
just let go of me
suffer slowly
is this the way its got to be
dont bury me
faceless enemy
im so sorry
is this the way its got to be
dear agony
