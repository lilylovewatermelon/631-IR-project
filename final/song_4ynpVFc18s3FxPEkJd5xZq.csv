remembering what you said
now im laying alone in bed
trying to wrap up this feeling
falling apart instead
cause baby we hit the top
sweeter than sugar rocks
holding onto a moment
let go im falling off

i just need a little of it
need a little not a lot to get into it
oh
keep calling me home

can we go back to adrenaline

but i need to feel need to feel it
adrenaline

remembering all those nights
with your body straight to the sky
you work me until the morning
fall asleep half past nine am
so crazy in love
enough was never enough
tell me our touch ain’t dull now
tell me our touch ain’t dull now
