verse 1
im from a little city with expensive taste
where the cars dont run till the engine breaks
wasnt spending pennies on massive things
but invested in mess with this recipe
couldnt quite see what the future held
and as days went by it would tell itself
let it struggle just a little bit more
let it struggle just a little bit more

chorus
remember what the people said
remember what the people said
when its said and done
let it go
remember what the people said
remember what the people said
when its said and done
let it go

verse 2
shouldnt try to fix it if it keeps getting better
just let it go forget it for ever and ever and ever
dont ever resent a letter inside a single word written
a little change can pave lanes with the right vision
couldnt tell what would happen next
but as weeks went by look what turned to best
let it struggle just a little bit more
let it struggle just a little bit more

if it depended on if anyone was listening
and i was listening
and when they said that what i wanted was a figment
i had to turn the other cheek but i was listening
yeah i was listening listening to all
