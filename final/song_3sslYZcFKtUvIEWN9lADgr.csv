the black hole of the window where you sleep
the night breeze carries something sweet a peach tree
wild women dont get the blues but i find that
lately ive been crying like a tall child

chorus
so please hurry leave me i cant breathe
please dont say you love me
胸がはち切れそうで
one word from you and i would
jump off of this ledge im on baby
tell me dont so i can crawl back in

verse 2
and i was so young when i behaved twentyfive
yet now i find ive grown into a tall child
and i dont wanna go home yet
let me walk to the top of the big night sky

chorus
please hurry leave me i cant breathe
please dont say you love me
胸がはち切れそうで
one word from you and i would
jump off of this ledge im on baby
tell me dont so i can crawl back in

one word from you and i would
jump off of this ledge im on baby
