im that last tab they run at the bar
im a good time that goes too far
yeah im rough around the edges
im far from perfection
call this my country boy confession

chorus
i was a dead end road with no headlights
i was good at hello better at goodbye
was a one night stop in a settle down town
was a little more lost than i ever was found
dancin with the devil left foot up on the pedal
chasin everything that i didnt need
it took an angel like you
to love the hell out of me

verse 2
you showed up when i needed saving
like a prayеr i didnt know i was praying
just saying
we both know right whered id bе
how i got you beats the hell out of me

chorus
i was a dead end road with no headlights
i was good at hello better at goodbye
was a one night stop in a settle down town
was a little more lost than i ever was found
dancing with the devil left foot up on the pedal
chasin everything that i didnt need
it took an angel like you
to love the hell out of me yeah
