i cant believe this

i wish i never ever got drunk that night
made me foolish enough to come to your crib
walked up the stairs and then i turned on the lights
couldnt even speak because it happened so quick
i wish i never saw your punk ass that night
you always seem to calm me down with your lies
even though i know better i try and i try
but you always have the perfect alibi

if a lie gon get me through
i rather not know the truth
if the truth gon make me cry
i rather just live a lie

if a lie gon get me through
i rather not know the truth
if the truth gon make me cry
i rather just live a lie

i wish i never ever saw u that night
right now id still be thinkin we were ok
i called you just before i got on my flight
i say i love you and you tell me the same
if i could go back in time
i never woulda called your phone up
never woulda dialed your number
never woulda gotten that drunk
if i could go back in time
i never woulda gotten that tore
never woulda asked for one more
never woulda walked through your door

easier to live
like you dont see nuttin
even tho it aint right
harder to turn over in your bed and he aint by your side
i think if i didnt walk in that night
and see you with my own eyes
i would still be livin a lie

just gotta know
whatever you do
its gon come back to you
i cant believe this

if the truth gon make me cry
