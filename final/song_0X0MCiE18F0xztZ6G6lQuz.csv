youre saying everything i like
i could watch ya lips move all night
makin me think you might
have the type of brain i like
promise ima make it rain for you
somethin like an ocean wave on you
if you let me open up to you
kiss below the line

chorus
i wanna see what your head game like
do you know what youre doin
is your neck game tight
do you know how to use it
have a long conversation with me
i talk back baby we can get deep
i wanna see what your head game like
do you know what youre doin
is your neck game tight
do you know how to use it
have a long conversation with me
if you love swimming under the sea
then dive dive
ooh dive
you might also likeverse 2
i wanna see you rock the boat
back and forth lick the beach
fuck the shore make me scream
all aboard dont sink
ima be laid back legs cracked
watch your face entertain my lap
if i like that we gon keep it on repeat

chorus
i just wanna see what your head game like
do you know what youre doin
is your neck game tight
do you know how to use it
have a long conversation with me
i talk back baby we can get deep
i wanna see what your head game like
do you know what youre doin
is your neck game tight
do you know how to use it
have a long conversation with me
if you love swimming under the sea
then dive dive
ooh dive
