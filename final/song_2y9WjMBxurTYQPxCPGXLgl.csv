i promise that ill keep it
so confidentially
between just you and me ill never leak it

im the specialist
i know you cant resist
ill bypass your alarm
no need to twist my arm i insist

if youre looking for a war
theres a market for betrayal
dont ask me what i saw
you know my secrets not for sale
dont ask me what i heard
you know i promised not to say
i said id never breathe a word
until my dying day

well seeing is believing
no use it in your deceiving
for now i know its true
its you that holds the clue ill be leaving

now ive got to say goodbye
you know i have to fly
when you get the third degree
and the truth dont set you free youve got to lie

theres a market for betrayal
dont ask me what i saw
you know my secrets not for sale
dont ask me what i heard
you know i promised not to say
i said id never breathe a word
