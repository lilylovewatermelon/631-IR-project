carry me home got my blue nail polish on
its my favorite color and my favorite tone of song
i dont really wanna break up we got it going on
its what you gathered from my talk but you were wrong

prechorus 1
its not easy for me to talk about
i have heavy heartstrings
im not simple its trigonometry
its hard to express
i cant explain

chorus
ever since my baby went away
its been the blackest day
its been the blackest day
all i hear is billie holiday
its all that i play
its all that i play

postchorus
because im going deeper and deeper deeper
harder and harder harder
getting darker and darker
looking for love
in all the wrong places
oh my god
in all the wrong places
oh my god

carry me home got my new car and my gun
wind in my hair holding your hand listenin to our song
carry me home dont wanna talk about the things to come
just put your hands up in the air the radio on

prechorus 2
cause theres nothing for us to talk about
like the future and those things
cause theres nothing for me to think about
now that hes gone i cant feel nothing

chorus
ever since my baby went away
its been the blackest day
its been the blackest day
all i hear is billie holiday
its all that i play
its all that i play

postchorus
because im going deeper and deeper deeper
harder and harder harder
getting darker and darker
looking for love
in all the wrong places
oh my god
in all the wrong places
oh my god

you shouldve known better
than to have to let her
get you under her spell of the weather
i got you where i want you
youre deader than ever
and falling for forever
im playing head games with you
got you where i want you
i got you i got you
i got you where i want you now

chorus
ever since my baby went away
its been the blackest day
its been the blackest day
and all i hear is billie holiday
its all that i play
its all that i play

outro
its not one of those phases im going through
or just a song its not one of them
im on my own
on my own
on my own again
im on my own again
im on my own again
im on my own again
im on my own again43embed"
