she lives in a fairy tale
somewhere too far for us to find
forgotten the taste and smell
of a world that shes left behind
its all about the exposure
the lens i told her
the angles were all wrong now
shes ripping wings off of butterflies

prechorus
keep your feet on the ground
when your heads in the clouds

chorus
well go get your shovel
and well dig a deep hole
to bury the castle
bury the castle
go get your shovel
and well dig a deep hole
to bury the castle
bury the castle

so one day he found her crying
coiled up on the dirty ground
her prince finally came to save her
and the rest you can figure out
but it was a trick
and the clock struck twelve well make sure
to build your home brick by boring brick
or the wolfs gonna blow it down

prechorus
keep your feet on the ground
when your heads in the clouds

chorus
well go get your shovel
and well dig a deep hole
to bury the castle
bury the castle
go get your shovel
and well dig a deep hole
and well bury the castle
bury the castle

postchorus
woah

well you built up a world of magic
because your real life is tragic
yeah you built up a world of magic
well if its not real you cant hold it in your hand
you cant feel it with your heart
and i wont believe it
but if its true you can see it with your eyes
oh even in the dark
and thats where i want to be yeah

chorus
go get your shovel youll be better off without me now
and well dig a deep hole
to bury the castle
bury the castle
go get your shovel youll be better off without me now
and well dig a deep hole
to bury the castle
bury the castle
