breakfast is burning kettle stopped working
milk in the fridge gone sour
ignorant faces ice on my laces
delays on the underground
petrol is rising leaders are lying
watching the world melt down
signal is fading cant hear what youre saying
my minutes are running out
she makes me feel like
woah woah woah

shes my pick me up pick me up

the traffic is crawling my wages are falling
so long till my holiday
sick of the warning a different story
with voices that sound the same
i wish it was cheaper scared of the meter
watching the second hand
late to the station lost in translation
stuck in a taxi cab
she makes me feel like
woah woah woah
you might also likeshes my pick me up pick me up

when i wander alone and she tells me shes home
now im lost but its me in control
its the thought of her face that helps me pick up the pace
the days lost but i know
she makes me feel like
when youre lifting the world and its just too heavy
shes my pick me up pick me up ppppick me upembed"
