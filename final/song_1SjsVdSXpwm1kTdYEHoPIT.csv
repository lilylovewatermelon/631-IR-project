534 am i was about to start my day
but she lay in there across me so i stayed anyway
arms tied legs numb her wrapped around my knee
sweetest of the sunflowers how youre the sun to me

verse 2
i don’t recall what you were wearing on the first night we met
besides the subtle cloud around you from my last cigarette
and you come from a good place with a happy family
the only bad youve ever done was to see the good in me

chorus
cause i’ve been livin waitin on the day
that the good lord willin sends you out my way
ivе seen hard times bad luck all that inbetween
sweetest of thе sunflowers how youre the sun to me

verse 3
and i remember being younger and my mother told me true
find someone who grows flowers in the darkest parts of you
take heed when things get hard and dont you ever turn around
cause you’ll find someone someday somewhere
that grows you to the clouds

verse 4
and you walked me home that evening when i could barely walk
and you spoke to me so sweetly on the days i couldn’t talk
and now im seeing clearly and i’m growing up so free
sweetest of the sunflowers how youre the sun to me
