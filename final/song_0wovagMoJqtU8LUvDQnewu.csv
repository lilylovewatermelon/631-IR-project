we were just river kids
pickin up stones like david did
watchin them longnecks break off of a freight train bridge
we went to church in a detroit car
our daddies drank draft at the local bar
with an achin back just like old granddad did

chorus
and we like cold keg beer and fixin up trucks
old bird dogs and the woman we love
maxwell house steamin out of a coffee cup
we say our prayers send em to the sky
bust our backs barely getting by
carolina to california up to illinois
yeah theres guys like us
blue collar boys

verse 2
were the white paint peeling off a picket fence
the rust stains covering a craftsman wrench
when the suns coming up you can bet were clocking in
cash our paycheck two day break and do it again

chorus
we like cold keg beer and fixin up trucks
old bird dogs and the woman we love
maxwell house steamin out of a coffee cup
we say our prayers send em to the sky
bust our backs barely getting by
carolina to california up to illinois
yeah theres guys like us
blue collar boys
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likebridge
were worn out boots and old levis
the wind behind the stars and stripes

chorus
and we like cold keg beer and fixin up trucks
old bird dogs and the woman we love
maxwell house steamin out of a coffee cup
we say our prayers send em to the sky
bust our backs barely getting by
carolina to california up to illinois
yeah theres guys like us
yeah theres guys like us
blue collar boys
