the faster were fallin were stoppin and stallin
were runnin in circles again
just as things were lookin up you said it wasnt good enough
but still were tryin one more time

prechorus
maybe were just tryin too hard
when really its closer than it is too far

chorus
cause im in too deep and im tryin to keep
up above in my head instead of goin under
cause im in too deep and im tryin to keep
up above in my head instead of goin under
stead of goin under

verse 2
seems like each time im with you i lose my mind
because im bendin over backwards to relate
its one thing to complain but when youre drivin me insane
well then i think its time that we took a break

prechorus
maybe were just tryin too hard
when really its closer than it is too far

and i hate it when you fake it
you cant hide it you might as well embrace it
so believe me its not easy
it seems that somethings telling me
