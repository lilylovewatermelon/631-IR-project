i dont know if its because my heart hurts or if im insecure
im not sure
yeah i like that
uh

chorus
yeah im not sure
i dont know if its because my heart hurts or if im insecure
baby youre not her
my last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur
baby you jump first
its a long way to hell i aint really tryna leave this earth
baby do your worst
ive come to the conclusion you cant kill me if i kill you first

verse 1
ive been through the wringer
tryna put a diamond ring on her finger
she love drama she be watching jerry springer
next thing you know we all on jerry springer
i play love games but no im not a cheater
she hate it when i sip codeine im a leaner
the devil on my shoulder keep on telling me to keep her
should i take her out or should i take her to the cleaner
love dont end good for me no good for me
shes good for me too good
these hoes love playing me heartbreaking me
dont pray for me just give me drugs bring me drugs
you might also likebridge
just give me drugs
just bring me drugs
just give me drugs

chorus
yeah im not sure
i dont know if its because my heart hurts or if im insecure
baby youre not her
my last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur
baby you jump first
its a long way to hell i aint really tryna leave this earth
baby do your worst
ive come to the conclusion you cant kill me if i kill you first

verse 2
i told her run around and get away
i think i need a getaway
i need to call a timeout i need to set another play
i need a umbrella cause every day feel like a rainy day
i need something other than xannies to take the pain away
i ran away to california im tryna cut corners
satan bossin me around but you know i dont take orders
yeah i had to move around i was startin to feel cornered
startin to feel cornered i cant see the front door
startin to feel cornered startin to feel slaughtered
started to not give a fuck screamin out why bother
my exbitch too bad my next bitch way hotter
we met in a car crash she ride it like full throttle
chorus
yeah im not sure
i dont know if its because my heart hurts or if im insecure
baby youre not her
my last girl had me so fucked up it was a blacked out blur
baby you jump first
its a long way to hell i aint really tryna leave this earth
baby do your worst
ive come to the conclusion you cant kill me if i kill you first40embed"
