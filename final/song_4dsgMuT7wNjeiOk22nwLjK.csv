or just a box of bones
call me what you will son
my names travelin jones
and i search for the fire
stumbled upon with a precious desire

travelin jones
have you seen the miles
have you smelled the whiskey and the smoke
burnin out underneath your tires
travelin jones
youre the travelin jones
tell me the secrets of an endless road

its not where youve been son
its what you understand
do you know the right from wrong
tell me boy are you an honest man
have you ever felt the fire
stumbled upon with a precious desire

have your fingers bled boy
off sins strings
tied to that wooden box
that youre playin across your knee
have you ever felt the fire
stumbled upon with a precious desire

ive seen the miles
ive played in every honkytonk bar
behind that chicken wire
travelin jones
youre the travelin jones
tell me the secrets of an endless road

an empty sack of dust
or just a box of bones
call me what you will son
my names travelin jones
and i found the fireembed"
