whats going on cross seas
every minute a child dies by this disease
in record numbers indeed
got mommas crying out please
my baby hold on
my child aint done nothing wrong
still i want to holler
ask them why they dont bother
oh no oh no
make me turn to my father
and ask him why they all got a trapped soul

nas
i can feel what was bothering marvin
why his words forever remain
dealing with these modern day problems
cause of ignorance surrounding me and my constituents
too many infected
too many lives diminishing
nobody say protestants jews blacks and whites latinos and asians
pray together
less fight
we better unite
as genocide chemical war
and the rich and the poor
know that god delivers a cure

eve
its a shame our reality is devastating
people praying for a cure
dying while theyre waiting
ask the lord for the comfort and strength to face it
all the kids with dreams
wont get the chance to chase it
makes me sad
think about the lives they wouldve had
think about the orphan babies got no moms and dads
how can we sit back and not try to make it right
we gotta come together
we gotta fight for life

fred durst
somebody tell me whats going on
whats going on
we got human beings using humans for a bomb
but everyone wanna live
dont nobody really want to die
you feeling me right
i cant be watching people die
die
and watching people cry
let me break it down for a minute
if theres enough room here for you and me
theres plenty of room for some humanity

somebody tell me whats going on
whats going on
somebody tell me whats going on
whats going on
somebody tell me whats going on
whats going on
somebody tell me whats going on
whats going on
somebody tell me whats going on
whats going on
somebody tell me whats going on
whats going on
somebody tell me whats going on
whats going on
somebody tell me whats going on
