theres no shame in being brokenhearted
though i try to do more to fix my soul
im tryin to be more than when i started
theres no path before me
theres no horror story
that could ever keep my god from swinging low

verse 2
people act a certain way in trials
different than they do on any day
this is when you see a mans true colors
this is when he shows you
how much he can go through
before all his faith is stripped away

chorus
i work hard not to fall
cause its a long way down
and i own it to my family
to keep my feet on the ground
its in the sunshine i feel the sunshine
shining down on me

instrumental break

i admit at timеs ive been unfaithful
times wherе all i do is worry and doubt
thats when my god comes like warming rays of summer
melting all my worries
and my insecurities
and giving me the strength ive been without

chorus
i work hard not to fall
oh cause its a long way down
and i own it to my family
to keep my feet on the ground oh oh oh
its in the sunshine i feel the sunshine
shining down on me
uh shining down on me oh

outro
its in the sunshine i feel the sunshine
shining down on meembed"
