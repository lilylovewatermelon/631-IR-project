dont worry about the damage done
just let those words roll off your tongue
even if youre lying
if you really dont mean it i dont care
if you need a little buzz to get you there
then baby im buying

chorus
well couldnt you
say you do
say you might
for tonight
have a heart
bend the truth
even if you dont
couldnt you

mess me up
get in my head
steal my tshirt
wreck my bed
all night long
like you used to
even if you dont
couldnt you
say you do

baby take your hands take your lies
and lay em on me
