breathing in your every move
look around when the world is empty
look around if youre guilty

everybodys after you
i wait in line to touch you
look around if you ever miss me
look around cause it kills me

its over theres nothing you can do
theres nothing you can say to keep me here
its over you say were just friends
were playing pretend to keep me here

every night i lay in bed
i think about the things you said
look around im the one your only
look around because it kills me

doesnt anyone care

everybodys watching you
and counting down your every move
look around when your heartbeats empty
look around if its guilty
you might also likeits over you say were just friends
its almost the end im outta here
its over im outta hereembed"
