verse 2 busta rhymes
one two three four five six seven eight nine
comin through betta tuck in ya shine
once ya lookin for the heat if ya seek you will find
i had these devils watchin me sayin they seekin its mine
now hold up we drop the bomb first
then get under ya moms skirt
to get her frenzied like a motherfuckin rock concert
while youre busy and tryin to figure what the gods worth
ill malfunction your plans til the motherfuckers cant work
now imma cuss when i bust ya ass
and leave em stiff when i hit em like a mustard gas
steam fire when i puff then i flick the ash
you wack and i had enough put your shit in the trash
now you know we got the shit in the smash
wild until you slip and you crash
you know we keep the shit in the stash
from the ground when we come around yes we put it down
and always boom and pound when we shut em down
