interlude

refrain
they all know
they all know

verse 1
sorry did i wake your dream some questions run too deep
we only only wake up when we sleep
led by the lunar light troubles all we find
lost our way tonight

prechorus
is it somethin we said
is it somethin we said to them
is it somethin we said

chorus
save me
im trapped in a vile world
save me
where the endgames all the same as every other
were only here to die
save me
im losin my only dream
save me
i can use some guiding light some place to go
if ya hear me let me know
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likerefrain
they all know
they all know

verse 2
ever since the day you left my fates been set unknown
how many years to walk this path alone
so much to see tonight so whyd you close your eyes
why cant i shut mine

prechorus
is it somethin we did
is it somethin we did to them
is it somethin we did

chorus
save me
im trapped in a vile world
save me
where the endgames all the same as every other
were only here to die
save me
im losin my only dream
save me
i can use some guiding light some place to go
if ya hear me let me know
if ya hear me let me know
guitar solo

bridge
help me find my way
said help me find my way

breakdown
no pulse inside of me
stone cold lips and heresy
all lies and to a degree
losing who i wanna be
youll find out right now
he may be out of his mind
but someday you will find
that sanitys left us all blind
and dragged us all behind
a moment seen through those eyes
crystal blue disguise
they say that all beauty must die
i say it just moves on
if youd only open your mind
then someday you will find
insanity left us behind
and walked right through the door
i can see the pictures clear as yesterday
pictures all my own
i can hear the voices begging you to stay
but know youre not alone
chorus
save me
im trapped in a vile world
save me
where the endgames all the same as every other
were only here to die
save me
im losin my only dream
save me
i can use some guiding light some place to go
if ya hear me let me know
if ya hear me let me know

interlude

outro
tonight we all die young
tonight we all die young
tonight we all die young
tonight we all die young
tonight we all die young
tonight we all die young
tonight we all die
tonight we all die young18embed"
