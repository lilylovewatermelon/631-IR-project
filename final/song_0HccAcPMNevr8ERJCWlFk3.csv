lay your pretty head down on my shoulder
you don’t have to worry anymore
this old world is cold and getting colder
and i know how to lock and bolt the door
i’m strong enough to hold you through the winter
mean enough to stare your demons down
the hard times put the shine into the diamond
i won’t let that keep us in the ground

chorus
im a riser
im a get up off the ground dont run and hider
pushing comes to shove
hey im a fighter
when darkness comes to town im a lighter
a get out aliver of the fire
survivor

verse 2
if we aint got no money i can make it
and i aint afraid of working to the bone
when i don’t know what im doing i can fake it
ill pray til jesus rolls away the stone

chorus
im a riser
im a get up off the ground dont run and hider
pushing comes to shove
hey im a fighter
when darkness comes to town im a lighter
a get out aliver of the fire
survivor

chorus
im a riser
