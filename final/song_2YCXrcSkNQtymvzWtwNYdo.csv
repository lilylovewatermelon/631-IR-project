ive gotten good at leaning on metaphors
ive gotten good at living on someone elses page
i cut my teeth on secondhand sentiments
you cant trust a single thing i say

ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh

i keep my closet free of skeletons
cause im much better at digging graves
but i always dig up bones in your sympathy
i cant trust a single thing you say

ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh

dont look too hard cause you wont like the scars he left in me
ive gotten good at making up metaphors
ive gotten good at stretching the truth out of shape
and all these words are sweet and meaningless
you cant trust a single thing i say ooh ooh ooh
you cant trust a single thing i say ooh ooh ooh
you cant trust a single thing i say ooh ooh ooh
ive gotten good at leaning on metaphors
you cant trust a single thing i say ooh ooh ooh
