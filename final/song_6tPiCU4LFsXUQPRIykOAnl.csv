somethings happening
dont speak too soon
i told the boss off and made my move
got nowhere to go

chorus 1
son of sam
son of the shining path the clouded mind
the couple killer each and every time

verse 2
im not uncomfortable feeling weird
lonely leered options disappeared
but i know what to do

chorus 2
son of sam son of a doctors touch a nurses love
acting under orders from above

bridge
king for a day

guitar solo

chorus 1
son of sam
son of the shining path the clouded mind
the couple killer running out of time

shiva opens her arms now
to make sure i dont get too far
i may talk in my sleep tonight
cause i dont know what i am
im a little like you
more like son of sam5embed"
