though you and i both know its only the warm glow of wine
thats got you to feeling this way
but i dont care i want you to stay
just hold me and tell me youll be here to love me today

children are dancin the gamblers are chancin their all
the windows accusing the door of abusing the wall
but who cares what the night watchmen say
the stage has been set for the play
so just hold me and tell me youll be here to love me today

the moons come and gone but a few stars hang on to the sky
well the winds runnin free but it aint up to me ask why
the poets are demanding their pay
and theyve left me with nothin to say
except hold me and tell me youll be here to love me today
just hold me and tell me that youll be here to love me todaysee norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeembed"
