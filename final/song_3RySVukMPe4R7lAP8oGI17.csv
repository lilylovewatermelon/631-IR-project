yeah these days of preference has no complexion
you could be light dark mixed or fair skin
just light the candle
cold sweats down the handle lifes a gamble
and she know
love with me is like a cnote outside of reno
a couple white lines
a cup of white wine of pinot italian grigio
house keys to po
ride from overseas but thats basic
wasted high on the west side highway
drunk enough to fuck with face it

verse aap rocky
hangovers leftovers in the range rover
shame on her make up or get a makeover
think over glenfiddich start to takeover
when i brainstorm all the hoes aint got a thing on her
audemars season order like summer fall
i throw the audemars then i throw out all the ball
new dior from the boutique store
only thing in common that we got is that we want it all
little cutie pie saw her looking super fly
more justin timberlake on my suit and tie
try to scrutinize cause i keep two inside
suicides no sir hoes get the uber ride
or we can kiss til the sun come up
or sit on my lap til somethin come up
she aint really wanna club i dont really wanna judge
girl just wanna have fun til the fun run up
you might also likerefrain james fauntleroy
on the highway to my place
its higher than you ever been
by to my way be all day
me you and all your friends
in love fuckin
in love just too much oh

chorus aap rocky
these days of preference has no complexion
you could be light dark mixed or fair skin
just light the candle
cold sweats down the handle lifes a gamble
and she know
love with me is like a cnote outside of reno
a couple white lines
a cup of white wine of pinot italian grigio
house keys to po
ride from overseas but thats basic
wasted high on the west side highway
drunk enough to fuck with face it

refrain james fauntleroy
on the highway to my place
its higher than you ever been
by to my way be all day
me you and all your friends
in love fuckin
in love just too much oh26embed"
