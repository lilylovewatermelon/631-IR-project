once upon a time you and i
when we were dreamin easy
fresh as limes and happy as a sunday sky
there was nothing we could sell or buy
cause all we really needed
was our bare feet and a pair of wings to fly

prechorus
what do you think darling
have we lived too much too fast
and have you
have you felt melancholy darling
wishing that time hadnt passed

chorus
can you tell me how it used to be
have we missed our chance
have we changed our hopes for fears
and our dreams for plans
can you tell me how it used to be
when we really cared
and when love was on our side on our side

verse 2
i remember all the times before
when we could spend our living
staring at the ceiling lying on the floor
my vocabulary wasnt broad
i spoke so little english
and the word stress would
sound like something odd
you might also likeprechorus
what do you think darling
have we lived too much too fast
and have you
have you felt melancholy darling
wishing that time hadnt passed

chorus
can you tell me how it used to be
have we missed our chance
have we changed our hopes for fears
and our dreams for plans
can you tell me how it used to be
when we really cared
and when love was on our side on our side

bridge
what is your guess darling
have i lived too much too fast
so if you if you ever come and find me crying
now you know now you know why

chorus
can you tell me how i used to be
have i missed my chance
have i changed my hopes for fears
and my dreams for plans
can you tell me how it used to be
when we really cared
and when love was on our side on our side2embed"
