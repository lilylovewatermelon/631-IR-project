you tell me you like the taste
you just need an excuse
you tell me it calms your nerves
you just think it looks cool
you tell me you want to be different
you just change for the same
you tell me its only natural
you just need the proof
did you fucking get it

chorus
its in my eyes its in my eyes
its in my eyes its in my eyes
its in my eyes its in my eyes
its in my eyes its in my eyes
and it doesnt look that way to me
in my eyes
and it doesnt look that way to me
in my eyes

verse 2
you tell me that nothing matters
youre just fucking scared
you tell me that im better
you just hate yourself
you tell me that you like her
you just wish you did
you tell me that i make no difference
well at least im fucking trying
what the fuck have you done
you might also likechorus
its in my eyes its in my eyes
its in my eyes its in my eyes
its in my eyes its in my eyes
its in my eyes its in my eyes
and it doesnt look that way to me
in my eyes
and it doesnt look that way to me
in my eyesembed"
