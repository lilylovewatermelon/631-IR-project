fighting tears just to carry on
but now but now it’s gone away

hey girl why can’t you carry on
is it cuz your just like your mother
a little tight like to tease for fun
well you ain’t gonna tease no other
gonna make you a lover

everybody’s gonna love today
anyway you want to
anyway you’ve got to
love love me
girl in the blue with the big bust on
wait till your mamma and your papa’s gone
papa’s gone
mamma mamma papa
shock shock me

everybody’s gonna love today
anyway you want to
anyway you’ve got to
love love me

carolina sits on ‘95
give her a dollar and she’ll make you smile
hook her book her nook her
walk away
see mika liveget tickets as low as 37you might also likegirl dresses like a kid for fun
licks her lips like they’re something other
tries to tell you life has just begun
now you know she’s getting something other
than the love from her mother

everybody’s gonna love today
anyway you want to
anyway you’ve got to
love love me
girl in the blue with the big bust on
wait till your mamma and your papa’s gone
papa’s gone
mamma mamma papa
shock shock me

everybody’s gonna love today
anyway you want to
anyway you’ve got to
love love me8embed"
