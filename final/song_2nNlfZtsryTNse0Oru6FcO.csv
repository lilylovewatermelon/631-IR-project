let the waves carry you down to my doorstep
rest your weary souls on my shores yeah
sand and the sun and the tropical breeze yeah
you can get away from the sharks in the seas yeah

prechorus
wild out make a name
stars is out freaky time
sink the ship take a dip
coconut take a sip
wildfire dance around
wear my gold like a crown
where weve been given doubt
where we are in the wild now

chorus
wild beach
cant control these wild things
cant you see youre drowning
tryna tame a wild beast im a wild beach
its like youre tryna tame a wild beast im a wild beach
im a wild beach im a wild beach

verse 2
boy you must be crazy
must be out of my mind
feel like im stranded but it go hand in hand
cause we free to live that life
now see that though
pretty in a drop top we gon blow
palm trees in a backwood he on both knees
make it poppop i dont need no doors

see no evil even if she wont go
