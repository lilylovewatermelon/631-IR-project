outro morgan freeman
heroes are inspired
emerging only when needed
revealing themselves to the world in a moment marked by the realization of their ultimate destiny
with backs against the wall they ascend the winding path of their own fate
barely knowing the ledge despite coping with living their whole life as two halves12embed"
