verse 1 yung plague
straight outta hell ring the bells plague is here to stay
roaches and locusts they cover me
no halo hovering follow me in your grave
aint got no patek because ill be here til the end of fuckin times
thy kingdom come thy will be done
and still you wonder who am i
i am the devils son born and raised
preachin uicide googly eyes
tell me more—okay
praise the fucking devil god can suck my dick
i scorch the plains
makin mountains crumble glaciers meltin oceans swellin
im lord of the plagues
load up my—
wait a fuckin minute i got more to say
threatenin swordplay
some would say nay cause the tip of my sword blade dipped in chlordane
lord plague breakin fortés
carecrow in the corn maze hauntin board games
for war we pray
plague is cold in norway hangin from the doorframe with the sores and stain
for war we pray
7th ward the grey
for war we pray
7th ward the grey
for war we pray
7th ward the grey
for war we pray
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeverse 2 lil choppa
death is inevitable
the fuckin carecrow walkin on his tiptoes
on your bloodstained wood floor you know mister typical
hearin the fuckin voices through my window
beggin to be dead
but no worries
just like chucky cut throat got the blade and the knife
may thy rise for the yung christ—never even died
my father just forsaken i
im still uicide until i die
its an eye for an eye
speaking of i i— someone help me out
see the reaper having a busy season
wont even let me rest while im sleepin
its gettin harder to watch from the bleachers
the father of evil
like knievel ruby and i stay jumpin over people
xanax eatin close to lethal
cigarette breathin junkie used to needles
so i grew up a fuckup pow pow pow pow
load the nine up my times up yeah yeah yeah

outro lil choppa  lil gin
grew up a fuck up
load up my big nine now im finna shoot to kill
