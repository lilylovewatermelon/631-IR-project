verso 1 daddy yankee
im your idol your highest title numero uno
yes im puerto rican but im speaking so that you know mai
arroz con habichuela siempre you know mai
los que se tiran la tela fina you know mai
welcome to mi casa la melaza
donde las mujeres son una amenaza
la cuna del reggaeton y la salsa
jode con mi música a ver lo que pasa
in your eyes i can see looking at me and it happens every day
cause im young and im brown and i thought this way
they might think im carlitos way
man give me a break
dont try to push me cause i cut my hair no te calles dile
if you dont feel me your soul must be dead come on
