but not for long
she said nobody needs her
well girl youre wrong
well if you see her tell her
there is room for her
in my arms in my arms
you dont have to go you should know
ill be there for you
when youre alone ill be there
to comfort you
oh baby please come where its warm
in my arms in arms
darling you should know
ill be your world
the blanket when its cold baby
ill be your sunshine
in the dark oh
cling to me girl
and you will never fall
whatever you need
all you gotta do is call
she says nobody wants her
but not for long
she said nobody needs her
but girl youre wrong
well if you see her tell her
there is room for her
in my arms in my arms
well baby please
come where its warm
in my armsyou might also like1embed"
