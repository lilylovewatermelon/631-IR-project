spread your wings neon pegasus
and go flying through the night
they can take your glitter
but they cant take away your sparkle
and the thousandarmed robot octopus
will try to grab your golden reins
but your wings are strong from the battle
over cupcake mountain

chorus
never again to be lonely
never again to be without a home
never to bow to the gummy kings throne
never again never again

never again to be put down
by the marzipan girl at the silverlake lounge
soaring over it all high up in the clouds
never again never again

bridge
spoken
yeah
when i first saw you defeating the gummy kings glutenpowered armada in the darkness of space i knew you were no ordinary pegasus
you might also likeverse 2
sung
unbreak your heart neon pegasus
and go climbing through the stars
out there with your dreams
your sparkly dreams

and the genetically modified salamander
with a face just like george clooney
cant track you down with
the rockabilly worm from spaceland

chorus
never again to be lonely
never again to be without a home
never to bow to the gummy kings throne
never again never again

never again to be put down
by the marzipan girl at the silver lake lounge
soaring over it all high up in the clouds
never again never again

outro
never again never again
never again never again
no matter how insane and ridiculous they seem
you must follow your dreams
dreams dreams dreams dreams dreamsembed"
