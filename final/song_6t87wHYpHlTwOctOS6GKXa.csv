ive loved everything about you that hurt
so let me see your moves let me see your moves
lips pressed close to mine
true blue
but the prince of any failing empire knows that
everybody wants everybody wants
to drive on through the night if its a
drive back home

prechorus
things arent the same anymore some nights they get so bad
you almost pick up the phone

chorus
trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
i sleep with your old shirts and walk through this house in your shoes
you know its strange
its a strange way of saying that i know im supposed to love you
im supposed to love you

verse 2
ive already given up on myself twice
third time is the charm third time is the charm
threw caution to the wind but ive got a
lousy arm
and ive traced your shadows on the wall now i kiss them
whenever im down whenever im down
figured on not figuring
myself out
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeprechorus
things arent the same anymore some nights they get so bad
i almost pick up the phone

chorus
trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
i sleep with your old shirts and walk through this house in your shoes
you know its strange
its a strange way of saying that i know im supposed to love you
im supposed to love you

bridge
born under a bad sign you saved my life
that night on the roof of your hotel
cross my heart and hope to die
splintered from the headboard in my eye
photoproofed kisses i remembered so well

chorus
trade baby blues for wide eyed browns
i sleep with your old shirts and walk through this house in your shoes
you know its strange
its a strange way of saying that i know im supposed to love you
im supposed to love you
