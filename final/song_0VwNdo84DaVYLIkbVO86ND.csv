i remember when we broke up the first time
saying this is it ive had enough cause like
we hadnt seen each other in a month

remember how that lasted for a day
i say i hate you we break up you call me i love you

verse 2
im really gonna miss you picking fights
and me falling for it screaming that im right
and you would hide away and find your peace of mind
