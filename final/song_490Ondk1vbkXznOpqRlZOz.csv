now i know fools get their own when they chit chat
havent heard yet but you can bet im not with that
with that talk with the digi walk
i struck a bird you heard absurd word to the fact

prechorus 1 nick hexum
im a cat nippin sippin on the flask
passin it talkin shit but only if youre an ass
in front of me cause you could run from me but
in the end revenge send ends to the defendant
i cant get caught in the spiral
cause every bit of energy it goes to my survival
out my way im a flicka flacka blotter
ya try to find a weakness but the shit keeps gettin harder

chorus nick hexum
fourth of july with lucy in sky
i remember pine trees and the coat of many colors
i was nineteen id do anything
shit like that now scares me but id like to do it again

postchorus nick hexum
it was independence day
ive seen the other side and i say
oh ive been insane
and i wont ever be the same

cause we flow we must be fly
first to flow nick oh my brother so wise and then i rise
nick he is an ill kid pimpin cause he is so slick
steps from darkness his body electric
a drone buzzes the air a cracklin tone
then boomin like thunder in a cosmic jungle
death defyin like evil knievel
words that will wobble awkwards and evil

prechorus 2 sa martinez
cause he flow and rock the hardest of the crowds
a marvel pow how you like me now
ive returned the kiss of death the last damien
from the abyss a fresh eternal alien
now famished from pathless ways ima do damage
to the wack mcs i know you cant stand this
right about now get down im the annihilator
rockin with the rhythm of my rhyme detonator

chorus nick hexum
fourth of july with lucy in sky
i remember pine trees and the coat of many colors
i was nineteen id do anything
shit like that now scares me but id like to do it again
postchorus nick hexum
it was independence day
ive seen the other side and i say
oh ive been insane
and i wont ever be the same2embed"
