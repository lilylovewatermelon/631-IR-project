rosetinted view
and satellites that compromise the truth
but i wanted more
with the cuts and the bruises
touch my face
a hopeless embrace

chorus
faith
it drives me away
but it turns me on
like a strangers love
it rockets through the universe
it fuels the lies and feeds the curse
believes we could be glorious

verse 2
i need to believe
but i still want more
with the cuts and the bruises
dont close the door
on what you adore

chorus
yeah and faith
it drives me away
but it turns me on
like a strangers love
it rockets through the universe
it fuels the lies and feeds the curse
believes we could be gloriousyou might also like4embed"
