yeah dah dah dah dah is there an ashtray in here
—can we smoke in here
—yeah eric said it was in his pockets

the good times yeah
who needs the good times
the good times are killing me

modest mouse
the good times are killing me
here we go

verse 1
got dirt got air got water
and i know you can carry on
shrugged off shortsighted false excitement
and oh what can i say
have one have twenty more one mores
and oh it does not relent

chorus
the good times are killing me

verse 2
kick butt buzzcut dickheads
who didnt like what i said
the good times are killing me
jaws clenched tight we talked all night
oh but what the hell did we say
the good times are killing me

fed up with all that lsd
need more sleep than coke or methamphetamines
late nights with warm warm whiskey
i guess the good times they were all just killing me

verse 3
got dirt got air got water
and i know you can carry on
the good times are killing me
enough hair of the dog to make myself an entire rug
the good times are killing me
have one have twenty more one mores
and oh it does not relent
the good times are killing me
shitkicker city slickers who all wanted me dead
the good times are killing me
get sucked in and stuck in late nights
with more folks that i dont know
the good times are killing me

chorus
the good times are killing me
the good times are killing me
the good times are killing me
outro
the good times are killing me
the good times are killing me
the good times are killing me
