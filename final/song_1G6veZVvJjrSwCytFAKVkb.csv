wake up well its nice to meet you
do you have a name cause i would like to teach you baby
alright if its unfamiliar
when the sharks are swimming we will watch them kill you baby
yeah you im a little shocked
cause i can see the future looking through your eyes
tonight dont you fall asleep
dont you fall its only gonna take a little time

before we start to lose our minds
were leaving all the haters behind
before the sun decides to hide
i know you think im maybe out of line
im scared to love what we love most
its only gonna take a little time
before we start to lose our minds
wake up

wake up well its nice to know you
have you learned to fly cause i would die to show you baby
alright if its unfamiliar
when i taste your face then i can break the mirror baby
yeah you im afraid to hide
cause i can live today before i say goodbye
tonight dont you fall asleep
dont you fall its only gonna take a little time
you might also likebefore we start to lose our minds
were leaving all the haters behind
before the sun decides to hide
i know you think im maybe out of line
im scared to love what we love most
its only gonna take a little time
before we start to lose our minds

take some time to breathe
lets take some time to breathe
from the desert to the sea
its the same for you and me

lets take some time to breathe

before we start to lose our minds
were leaving all the haters behind

i know you think im maybe out of line
im scared to love what we love most

before we start to lose our minds
