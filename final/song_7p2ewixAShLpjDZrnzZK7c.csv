look they gave a bitch two options strippin or lose
used to dance in a club right across from my school
i said dance not fuck dont get it confused
had to set the record straight cause bitches love to assume
mama couldnt give it to me had to get it at sues
lord only knows how i got in those shoes
i was covered in dollars now im drippin in jewels
a bitch play with my money might as well spit in my food
bitches hated my guts now they swear we was cool
went from makin tuna sandwiches to makin the news
i started speakin my mind and tripled my views
real bitch only thing fake is the boobs
get money go hard youre mothafuckin right
never been a fraud in my mothafuckin life
get money go hard damn fuckin right
stunting on these bitches out of mothafuckin spite
aint no runnin up on me went from nothin to glory
i aint tellin yall to do it im just tellin my story
i dont hang with these bitches cause these bitches be corny
and i got enough bras yall aint gotta support me
i went from rag to riches went from wic to lit nigga
only person in my fam to see six figures
the pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
when you gotta make sure that everybody straight
bitches stab you in your back while they smilin in your face
talking crazy on your name trying not to catch a case
i waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
climbed to the top floor so i can spit on niggas
said i was just tryna chill and make bangers bangers
tell all these old bitches they in danger stop
the thing on my hip whip bitches into shape brrrt
