youve been on my mind ive been tryna let it go
ive been tryna find somethin as incredible
as you and i but thats a never
no feeling can compare to you
you just gotta let me know

chorus jhené aiko
can i hit it again can i hit it again
can i hit it again can i hit it again
can i hit it again can i hit it again
take me over
can i hit it again
im under your control
can i hit it again

verse 2 jhené aiko
you stay on the grind im always available
rollin in my ride so i gotta take it slow
you got me so high up up and away we go
racin to the sky im feelin unfadable
cause the vapors could save us
and take us and make us believe
that we are free that we are free
we can be free we can be free
so can i please…

verse 3 vince staples
please dont rain on my parade
the fallin from the sky just remind of the days
when you was cryin for attention
i ignored it as a phase
until you couldnt take the tension
now i wish you would have stayed
walkin through the smoke and mirrors
burdened you burning bridges
memories fading faded it help you not to remember
the trials and tribulations eyes red from cryin
the perfect way to disguise it you was blinded by our fate
please dont rain on my parade cause this float was built for you
kinda hard to chase you down when you floatin through the room
all you wanted was the truth and all i wanted was my way
regardless how i word the phrase all you hear me say is
chorus jhené aiko
can i hit it again can i hit it again
can i hit it again can i hit it again
can i hit it again can i hit it again
take me over
can i hit it again can i hit it again

outro jhené aiko
take me over im under your control69embed"
