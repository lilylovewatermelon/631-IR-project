niggas sayin they the goat but i cant buy into the hype
i dig deep into my spirit when i spit into the mic
all them sitdowns in that county made me think about my life
went through some tragedies i made it out to make it right d major baby
i was doin drugs just to get me through the night
they werent with me through my struggles all this shit i sacrificed
i climbed out the darkness now my patek shinin bright
i been ballin just for you i put yall faces in my ice

verse 1
i got a problem its no problem my lil brother gon get him
before he hopped up off that porch we always knew it was in him
dont give no fuck the twins gone and he wish he was with him
he say them niggas aint been slidin and his crown dont fit him
he want all them niggas dead its sad to say but i feel him
if i aint had so much to lose id be riskin it with him
always rap about the guys cause i genuinely miss em
five years later thousand tears later still feel like the day when they hit em
make sure i always say yall name so aint no way they forget em
gon always feel like fuck the opps cause nigga i cant forgive em
i got that shit up out the mud i spent 10k on my denims
snakes in disguise they try to love you with a heart full of venom

chorus
niggas sayin they the goat but i cant buy into the hype
i dig deep into my spirit when i spit into the mic
all them sitdowns in that county made me think about my life
went through some tragedies i made it out to make it right
i was doin drugs just to get me through the night
they werent with me through my struggles all this shit i sacrificed
i climbed out the darkness now my patek shinin bright
i been ballin just for you i put yall faces in my ice

with clips we pop out taper shit like who need a trim
inherit hate it got me wonderin can we forgive
everybody got they input on how we should live oh
life on the road i barely see the crib
facetime the fam my son smilin every time i call
back then i slipped up i got artwork on them county walls
i signed a contract like carmelo im just tryna ball
matter of time before we blitz him he been tryna stall
got smoke for hoppin in this shit he shouldnt have got involved
them rips put him to sleep like he off tylenol
hot nem gon tweak them boys crazy they aint got it all
you know my pain and you my brother im gon ride for yall

chorus
niggas sayin they the goat but i cant buy into the hype
i dig deep into my spirit when i spit into the mic
all them sitdowns in that county made me think about my life
went through some tragedies i made it out to make it right
i was doin drugs just to get me through the night
they werent with me through my struggles all this shit i sacrificed
i climbed out the darkness now my patek shinin bright
i been ballin just for you i put yall faces in my ice oh oh oh11embed"
