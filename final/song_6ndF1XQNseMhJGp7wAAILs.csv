verse 1 pnk
dear mr president
come take a walk with me come take a walk with me
lets pretend were just two people and youre not better than me
id like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly

prechorus pnk
what do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street
who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep
what do you feel when you look in the mirror
are you proud

chorus pnk  indigo girls pnk
how do you sleep while the rest of us cry
how do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye
how do you walk with your head held high
can you even look me in the eye
and tell me why

verse 2 pnk indigo girls both
dear mr president were you a lonely boy were you a lonely boy
are you a lonely boy are you a lonely boy
how can you say no child is left behind
were not dumb and were not blind were not blind
theyre all sitting in your cells
while you pave the road to hell

what kind of father would take his own daughters rights away
and what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay
i can only imagine what the first lady has to say
youve come a long way from whiskey and cocaine

chorus pnk  indigo girls
how do you sleep while the rest of us cry
how do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye
how do you walk with your head held high
can you even look me in the eye

bridge pnk  indigo girls pnk
let me tell you bout hard work
minimum wage with a baby on the way
let me tell you bout hard work
rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away
let me tell you bout hard work
building a bed out of a cardboard box
let me tell you bout hard work
hard work
hard work
you dont know nothing bout hard work
hard work
hard work
outro indigo girls pnk
how do you sleep at night
how do you walk with your head held high
dear mr president
