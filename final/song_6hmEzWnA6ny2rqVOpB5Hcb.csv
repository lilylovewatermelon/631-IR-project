3 pm on my feet and staggering
through misplaced words and a sinking feeling
i got carried away
sick sick of sleeping on the floor
another night another score
im jaded bottles breaking

chorus
youre only happy when im wasted
i point my finger but i just cant place it
feels like im falling in love
when im falling to the bathroom floor
i remember how you tasted
ive had you so many times lets face it
feels like im falling in love alone
stella would you take me home
stella would you take me home

verse 2
2 am im on a blackout binge again
you know i dont need sleep and i lost my keys
but ive got so many friends
and they keep keep me coming back for more
another night another score
im faded bottles breaking
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likechorus
youre only happy when im wasted
i point my finger but i just cant place it
feels like im falling in love
when im falling to the bathroom floor
i remember how you tasted
ive had you so many times lets face it
feels like im falling in love alone
stella would you take me

bridge
one more reason i should never have met you
just another reason i could never forget you
down we go the rooms spinning outta control
lose myself in a chemical moment
night lifes taking its toll
thats just the way it goes come on
stella would you take me home

chorus
youre only happy when im wasted
i point my finger but i just cant place it
feels like im falling in love alone
stella would you take me home
youre only happy when im wasted
i point my finger but i just cant place it
feels like im falling in love
when im falling to the bathroom floor
i remember how you tasted
ive had you so many times lets face it
feels like im falling in love alone
stella would you take me4embed"
