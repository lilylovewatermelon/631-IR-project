so you say you want to tie the knot
and youre asking me if i think that the two of you have got
what it takes to make it work
well one things for sure
all you really need is love

verse 2
let me say im happy for you both
and heres a little something that the two of you should know
if you want to do it right
just take my advice
all you really need is love

verse 3
and a license and a blood test and a bunch of invitations
a minister a white dress and of course a congregation
and flowers and music and candles and cake
and a bunch of rice for folks to throw as you drive away

verse 4
now whats that expression on your face
youre looking kind of pale is everything ok
dont worry youll be fine
if you just keep in mind
all you really need is love

and bridesmaids and groomsmen and a wedding coordinator
and food for the reception youll need someone to cater
did i forget to mention itll take a couple rings
and of course a pa system if youre wanting me to sing

verse 6
now you look so happy you could cry
and that explains the tear drops i see welling in your eyes
dont worry youll be fine
if you just keep in mind
all you really need is love

im sure im telling you something you already knew
all you really need is love1embed"
