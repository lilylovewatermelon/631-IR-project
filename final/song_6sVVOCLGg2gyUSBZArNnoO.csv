do i remind you of the pain
that he put you through girl
is that the reason im to blame
before i do it
is it because he treated you badly
i always stand accused
protecting yourself from somebody else
im not whos hurting you girl

prechorus
and its killing me girl knowing
you compare me to him
always guilty before the sin
i cant win no i cant win

chorus
ill do anything to prove i love you
baby girl but i refuse to
pay for something i didnt do
i love you girl
but i refuse to stay
paying for his mistakes

verse 2
he left a scar across your heart
i understand girl
dont let his wrongs tear us apart
cause girl im your man
just because he did you swear im cheating
you think i just dont care
why must i do time for another mans crime
girl you know that aint fair

and its killing me girl knowing
you compare me to him
always guilty before the sin
i cant win no i cant win

chorus
ill do anything to prove i love you
baby girl but i refuse to
pay for something i didnt do
i love you girl
but i refuse to stay
paying for his mistakes

bridge
i know he did you wrong
but tell me what does that have to do with me
trying to show you something real
figure out what is going on
before you look up and ill be gone

chorus
ill do anything to prove i love you
baby girl but i refuse to
pay for something i didnt do girl
i love you and i love you i love you
ill do anything to prove i love you
baby girl but i refuse to
pay for something i didnt do girl
i love you girl
but i refuse to stay
paying for his mistakes1embed"
