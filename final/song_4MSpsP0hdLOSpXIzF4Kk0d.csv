girl its astounding the way that you ground me
just by being around me help me stay true
behind every man is a woman standing
holding his hand and seeing him through

chorus
youre my copilot
always by my side looking so fly
baby you got me
clouds hit the sky
i know that im never flying
in the lightning alone

verse 2
freedom is overrated and over
do it alone and that goes for me too
just like a story without an ending
baby im nothing without you

chorus
youre my copilot
always by my side looking so fly
baby you got me
clouds hit the sky
i know that im never flying
in the lightning alone
youre my copilot
always by my side looking so fly
baby you got me
clouds hit the sky
i know that im never flying
in the lightning alone
you might also likebridge
and nearly every time that i lean off track
you dont even know it but you lead me back
and when im swimming in the dark
you are the compass of my heart
no one can do it alone

chorus
youre my copilot
always by my side looking so fly
baby you got me
clouds hit the sky
i know that im never flying
in the lightning alone
youre my copilot
always by my side looking so fly
baby you got me
clouds hit the sky
i know that im never flying
in the lightning aloneembed"
