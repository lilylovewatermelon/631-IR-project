theres a house fly swimming in my sweet tea
hey darling pass another kerr jar to me
butter dripping off a biscuit baby better take a bite
cantaloupe thumps like its finally ripe
box fan on a lawn chair sucking in swamp air
two hundred mile marker signs from nowhere
thats what country is

chorus
it aint a rebel flag you bought at the mall
its a hideaway bed in an old horse stall
two kids getting caught stealing a boones farm kiss
it aint a john deere cap thats never fell in the cotton
its a jimmie rodgers song that was long forgotten
its homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
thats what country is

verse 2
when the sun starts slipping from the delta sky
and the last scarecrow tucks in for the night
make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank
bout an hour til we feel the first catfish yank
barefoot cane pole waving at the riverboats
and when theyre gone take a dip in the moon glow
thats what country is

it aint a rebel flag you bought at the mall
its a hideaway bed in an old horse stall
two kids getting caught stealing a boones farm kiss
it aint a john deere cap thats never fell in the cotton
its a jimmy rodgers song that was long forgotten
its homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
thats what country is

outro
it aint a jacked up truck thats never seen a pasture
its cars pulling over for a nocab tractor
its homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
no it cant be bought its something youre born with
thats what country is
thats what country is
thats what country is
thats what country is1embed"
