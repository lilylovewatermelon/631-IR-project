last night i dreamed i was brooklyn on my own
lord i couldnt see the shadows all in me
i dreamed i was in brooklyn on my own

now those demons had there face bright as gold
those demons had their faces bright as gold
they came and shook my hand fingers crossed behind their back
those demons had their faces bright as gold

so im sittin by my lonesome in the light
im sittin by my lonesome in the light
i dont know what i see that light plays tricks on me
im sittin by my lonesome in the light

and i dont know whats ahead up comin next
the wind shakes me feet rattles my head
theres no tellin home just a sign up all alone
sayin oh oh elizabeth

and that season came in quiet with the rain
and loving you was just like raising cain
it was strong and bound for glory and cursed with a thousand stories
oh that season came in quiet with the rain

so im pickin up the pieces where i went wrong
oh im pickin up the pieces where i went wrong
and theres somethin so familiar like an old bedtime song
im pickin up the pieces where i went wrongâ€¦see gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeembed"
