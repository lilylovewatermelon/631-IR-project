uptight out of sight
baby everything is all right
uptight out of sight

im a poormans son from across the railroad tracks
the only shirt i own is hangin on my back
but im the envy of every single guy
since im the apple of my girls eye

when we go out stepping on the town for a while
my moneys low and my suits out of style
but its all right if my clothes arent new
out of sight because my heart is true

she says baby everything is all right
uptight out of sight
baby everything is all right
uptight clean out of sight

shes a pearl of a girl
i guess thats what you might say
i guess her folks brought her up that way
the right side of the tracks she was born and raised
in a great big old house full of butlers and maids
you might also likeshe says no one is better than i
and i know im just an average guy
no footfall hero or smooth don juan
got empty pockets you see im a poor mans son

cant give her the things that money can buy
but ill never never never make my baby cry
and its all right what if i cant do
out of sight because my heart is true

she says baby everything is all right
uptight clean out of sight
baby everything is all right
uptight clean out of sight

baby everything is all right
uptight clean out of sight
baby everything is all right
uptight way out of sightembed"
