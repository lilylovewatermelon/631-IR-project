tell me why did you do this to me
after we made plans for a family
a liar a cheater a deceiver heartbreaker
and i wont let you back in my life so im takin

verse 1
i wanna start with your mama she shouldve whooped your ass
know you aint shit but she dont care cause you lit
payin for trips cars bags bags and bought the crib crib
but she aint never call you out cause she like the way that she live
but that some foul shit she wasnt even around when you aint have no money money
thats why i find it funny funny
i guess that guilt hit hard bein gonе for so long hard
thats why she makes excusеs for all your wrongs
now whats the point in keep on havin kids
if she just gon be raisin them thats just pure laziness
i dont get it is you tryna keep up with thug is you racin him
crazy how you really think that shits cute be embracin it oh
it really dont get no worse than you ‘cause you aint even got the nerve to stand up on your word
oh nonono uh word
oh nonono huh

chorus
what was you tellin them
what was you tellin me
what was you tellin them
and what was you tellin me
why would you do all that
just to be sellin dreams
aint even pullin through
you just be talkin

damn i aint know niggas be out here tryna trap bitches
never took me nowhere lavish til you seen drake hop on the track with it
if you ask me you was actin whole time just actin
you aint give a fuck about me you was just tryna cash in no
only buy me nice shit big dates just for instagram flashin no
tryna get your likes up know you a clout addict
gotta let niggas know that you have it
gotta let niggas know that you have it
and all you be doin is braggin

verse 3
tellin people that im your queen
but all you mean is just of rb
i know you aint care cause you always gone
how could you make me spend my whole fucking pregnancy alone
and where was you at cause you claim you at work
but them other niggas said they made the beats so how that add up
probably was with your baby mamas one through three
you claim that you had a ring for me you was probably out fuckin hoes

chorus
what was you tellin them
what was you tellin me
what was you tellin them
and what was you tellin me
why would you do all that
just to be sellin dreams
aint even pullin through
you just be talkin
outro
tell me why did you do this to me
after we made plans for a family
a liar a cheater a deceiver heartbreaker
and i wont let you back in my life so im takin11embed"
