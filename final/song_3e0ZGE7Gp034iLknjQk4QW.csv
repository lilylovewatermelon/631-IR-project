yeah can i baby can i baby
verse drake  beyoncé
can i bring you to the six where i really stay baby
show you why i am the way i am
can i tell you what i think my biggest flaw is baby
i try to be consistent but i cant
can i have an honest moment wit you right now baby
tell me who the fuck you want to be
can i get an honest answer from you right now baby
cause all we ever talk about is me
can i before i turn the lights out
fore i turn the lights out tell me who the fuck you want to be
can i call instead of text you on the hotline
sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
can i see you right now i know the sun is up baby
sorry i dont really have a choice
can i ever make you feel like im down for you baby
you do so much more than that for me
can i finally take the time and open up to you baby
cause thats the side you never get to see
can i before i turn the lights out one more time
fore i turn the lights out tell me who the fuck you want to be
