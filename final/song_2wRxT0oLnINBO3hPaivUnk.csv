in a time of need
only few can see whats wrong
millions tend to crawl
but only those who choose can make it through this all
only few can sing like lions
cause we sing until were gone
and weve got each others backs
until were back where we belong
a woman held my shield
and through the battle we did wrong
a man who taught me wisdom
through the static we recall
and maybe when were gone
our names will echo through the stars
every starts got its ending
even when weve learned to rise above it all

chorus deuce
these lies are leading me astray
its too much for me to stay
i dont wanna live this destiny
it goes on endlessly
i see you so please stay strong
ill sing you one last song and then im gone
i dont wanna live this destiny
it goes on endlessly

and we once also had a story too
you can see that good men only come in few
even in our greatest moments
we may win or we may lose
every songs got its rules
youve got to learn to make it through
maybe one day we can choose
how it feels to be a woman or a man
without rules but buried underneath
theres a picture glued
so when my body burns in ashes
only sing the truth
let these words strengthen all your views
because these words were meant for you

chorus deuce
these lies are leading me astray
its too much for me to stay
i dont wanna live this destiny
it goes on endlessly
i see you so please stay strong
ill sing you one last song and then im gone
i dont wanna live this destiny
it goes on endlessly
bridge deuce
and now im floating
right above my coffin as it closes
i look down i see sigh
as shes crying on my mamas shoulder
i look up into the sky
as the gates of heaven open
somethings wrong
is this destiny or am i going home
what will happen to my soul
will i come back
i dont know
will you meet me when its over
let me know
you can meet me here in heaven
dont you ever let me go
this love this hate is burning me away

chorus deuce
these lies are leading me astray
its too much for me to stay
i dont wanna live this destiny
it goes on endlessly
i see you so please stay strong
ill sing you one last song and then im gone
i dont wanna live this destiny
it goes on endlessly
these lies are leading me astray
its too much for me to stay
i dont wanna live this destiny
it goes on endlessly
i see you so please stay strong
ill sing you one last song and then im gone
i dont wanna live this destiny
it goes on endlessly
outro deuce
this love this hate is burning me away
this love this hate is burning me away12embed"
