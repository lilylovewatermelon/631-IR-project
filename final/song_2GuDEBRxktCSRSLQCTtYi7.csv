verse 1 king geedorah
geedorah has arrived you guys could take five
by the time it’s over no snakes alive
take the dive i’m telling you you’re better off
then up against the flow that make her take her sweater off
from the setoff when it came to scripts he could hardly brag
it’s the result of concentration and lollygag
i said “yeah right”  he pulled a mic out a snotty rag
was sealed up airtight and tied up in a body bag
get an advance and catch chance writer’s block  after
spending the first and last penny my own worst enemy
tell me if i’m od and usual flow
and made deals with these cats who keep sending dough so
the threeheaded set it never get busted
he’s a man of his word who’s yet to be trusted
beats encrypted multifaceted encrusted
sweaty palm keep mic rusted
sort of mellow type of fellow
who sometimes spaz on wife like othello
hell no  he won’t use words like illuminati
or gotti or shotty he might use karate
azar the gaza caught cut i’ll ask why
a mask with the ballstyle caps saying “that’s fly”
exact dough ‘til it stack high
the white hoes black guys the rap game’s black eye

exhilaration jet jag’s accelerations
touch speeds minds can’t conceive
achieve altered altitudes and angles angels answer
aura illumination awesome interpretation
awkward alarm ankle house arrest
who’s best  monster island czars
crush pawn dreams to be king
a frank reality calculation could never be
quest destined distant competition dusted
disgusted race for second crowded clouded
confusion conclusion simple plain
selfeducation selfmade millionaires
serpents slithering sidewinds searching
stalking heatsensing can’t have me
jet jag’s rikkitikkitavi superhero
hit zero to sixty hot pursuit pedal to
the floor handling
lyrics traction
swerving left right
making headfakes
playing high stakes
levitates
quick  hit breaks they fly past hit wall parts
fly loose killer mongoose
verse 3 rodan
fake niggas continue to practice the art of intimidation
sterile minds conceiving thought for artificial insemination
syntax the sequence arranging lessons so deliberate making
wise words clear but population stay illiterate
consider it  gods refine power fools get rid of it men build
dreams on promises but lacking the will to deliver it
yo i dissolve connivers like saliva on tictacs gone
astray but get the job done like socks that’s mismatched
flip tracks murder snakes drunk niggas killing six packs
choking on venom suffering tricknological kickbacks
povertystricken minds with thoughts barely worth two cents
build history through time linear design on blueprints
a nuisance lies in disguise eightyfive percent never knew
wise men arise and pull files like internal revenue
forever true opposing selfevidence with leverage
upset the beast belly concoct homogenized beverage
clever shit calculated sabotage trojan horse
giftwrapped ambush lethal energy in motion that grows in force
trojan swords strategically aligned throughout the underworld
god of elevation kill superman rape wondergirl
fictitious character decapitated fake beings susceptible
to everyday occurrence a fatal outcome’s inevitable

verse 4 king geedorah
might as well join the force
boss  chance  take a loss like a cointoss
roll with a doubleheaded nickel
while the partner jet jag with the sickle you in a pickle
king geedorah your ass needs to leave him alone
‘fore he coldcatch a seizure and then you’re blown
if he ain’t the best he’s the best in
the top three out of myself i and me1embed"
