i pledge my allegiance
to rhythm and sound
music is my medicine
let the rhythm pound

and play it loud baby play it loud
play it loud baby play it loud
rock the crowd baby rock the crowd
and play it loud baby play it loud

verse 1 william
i found a love its in the music
drop all your guns drop all that bullshit
we found the love inside the instruments
john lennon bob marley are my presidents
the sound of trumpets wake up people sleepin now
the drummer boy is drumming beats to shake the ground
the violins will pick you up when you are down
the melody will spin around and round and round
