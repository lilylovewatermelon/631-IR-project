theres a place that they call heaven
just south of town way up on a hill
they say you can see for miles
when the sun goes down time stands still
no ive never been up to heaven
but ive always wanted to go
its ten miles down highway eleven
and ten more minutes up the old dirt road

chorus
well hey baby i was hoping
maybe youd feel like taking a drive
cause i can take you on a trip to heaven
and have you back by tonight

verse 2
well theres a store on the way to heaven
they oughta have everything we need
a bag of ice a six pack of something
and a few dollars worth of gasoline

chorus
well hey baby i was hoping
maybe youd feel like taking a drive
cause i can take you on a trip to heaven
and have you back by tonight

and have you back by tonight

well hey baby i was hoping

cause i can take you on a trip to heaven
and have you back by tonight

verse 4
theres a place that they call heaven
just south of town way up on a hill
