in a while now i will feel better
i’ll face the weather before me
in a while now i’ll race the irony
and buy back each word of my eulogy
all the uninvited tragedies
step outside

prechorus 1
ask yourself now where would you be without
days like this
when you finally collide
with the moment you can’t forget

chorus
so do i remind you of
someone you never met a lonely silhouette
and do i remind you of
somewhere you wanna be so far out of reach
ohoh i wish you’d open up for me
cause i wanna know you

verse 2
stay a while now undress your colors
cause they’re like no others i’ve ever seen
i could get used to your company
step inside

when you finally collide
with emotions you can’t resist

chorus
so do i remind you of
someone you never met a lonely silhouette
and do i remind you of
somewhere you wanna be so far out of reach
