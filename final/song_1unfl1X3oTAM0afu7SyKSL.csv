— xerxes37 clarence clarity – “those who can’t cheat”“those who can’t cheat” likely the catchiest tune off clarence clarity’s debut album no now may also be the most cryptic through rb and pop influenced the melodies clarence tells the tale of a cheating lover while simultaneously explaining that our time on this earth is limited relating to what might be the theme of the whole album live life as we never know what the future might hold watch this strange universe unfold on “those who can’t cheat — mattw11636 towkio feat lido chance the rapper  eryn allen kane – “heaven only knows”four young talents accompanied by a hook interpolated from john legends heaven combine to create a divine and heavenly track heaven only knows  hosts an electric multilayered hook and a strong opening verse from towkio – as he declares savemoney “an army full of generals” if this weren’t enough chance the rapper drops a feature verse delivered so rapidly with such a condense and varying rhyme scheme lido literally ups the tempo to match it and that’s why for those reasons and morei love it i love it love it i love it love it i love it— skhills35 jay rock – “gumbo”real flavour is hard to come by these days but tde’s jay rock delivered with standout single gumbo the strength of the song lies in the hidden references to his youth the song title for example refers to his grandmothers gumbo the flavor it tastes so good it was an analogy with music” he told genius similar to fly on the wall rock shows a vulnerable side of life in the projects realizing how personal gumbo is makes it even more fascinating — sem groeneweg34 wolf alice – “you’re a germ”since bursting to prominence with “moaning lisa smile” in early 2014 wolf alice have been hailed as the instigators of a new wave of british grunge although they’ve distanced themselves from that label “you’re a germ” is their most grunge song yet its quiet introduction presents biker georgie who uses his age to impress schoolgirls then the behemoth of a chorus complete with a monstrous countin tears him down he’s a “dodgy fucker” doomed to become a washed up rocker and ultimately get dragged down to hell it’s like cobain at his best — vesuvius33 the weeknd – “tell your friends”of all the songs on beauty behind the madness “tell your friends” is one of the few nonpop records kanye west  co samples soul dog’s 1976 song “can’t stop loving you” to blend soul and rock effortlessly as abel opens up about self destruction chasing fame drugs and of course women “they told me not to fall in love that shit is pointless” he croons just moments before mike dean rips his best guitar solo since “devil in a new dress” want to impress your friends this holiday season tell them about this song
— michael heal32 florence  the machine – “delilah”in “delilah” florence welch takes the phone call that she never received from her lover and elevates it into a modern biblical adaptation the baroquepop stomper anchors the anguish with a clapaccompanied drum piano chords and throaty brass that exhales as welch proclaims “i’m calling for my mother as i pull the pillars down” when she finishes with the words “these chains never leave me i keep dragging them around” her falsetto — and the bouncing cello — devastes — chihuahua031 joanna newsom – “sapokanikan”the best candidate for this millennium’s bard joanna newsom works best when she’s able to transform complex poetic devices into a singalong as evinced by “sapokanikan” she begins by referring to “ozymandias” and the futility of creating art ironic considering  she created some of the most lasting music of 2015 the stunning piano piece complete with drums is an epistemic journey where every listener comes away knowing something new  — brian duricy30 justin bieber – “what do you mean”bieber fever hit an alltime high prior to the release of “what do you mean” thanks to a month packed with promotion from justin’s highprofile friends the unique rollout proved worthwhile as the song became his first ever number one single the nowubiquitous bieber crooning is complimented by one mason levy who adds in a syncopated synth rhythm along with that catchy clock beat meanwhile maturity is shown in the lyrics  when would you ever think the “baby” singer would ever get real about arguing and makeup sex although the song highlights indecision there’s none on our end  “what do you mean” is one of our favorite tracks of the year — streetlights29 skepta – “shutdown”grime was first introduced to the american blogosphere in 2003 but the last 12 months have seen the genre make a serious overseas crossover thanks to cosigns from hiphop’s reigning tastemakers kanye west and drake sensing the moment skepta released one of the most zeitgeisty grime songs yet while armed with a drake sample and a media reaction to kanye’s “all day” brit awards performance this song completely belongs to skepta the frantic beat suits his energetic style spitting tough bars while speaking the same language as man booker prize winner marlon james’ book a brief history of seven killings with both having no time for “your ism and schisms” no skepta’s only got time for making the most of his moment something he does completely on “shutdown — brian duricy28 tame impala – “let it happen”kevin parker described this song as “totally different from anything ever” are we sure that’s hyperbole from the auditory rorschach test  in the bridge to the inexplicable record skips that would feel serendipitous if parker’s masterplanner reputation didn’t precede him “let it happen” sounds as much like the soundtrack to the apocalypse as it does the first notes of a glorious new wave synthheavy and sensual moody and meticulous “let it happen” was the perfect sonic and thematic intro to an album birthed by surrendering to desires — heisenferg27 sufjan stevens – “blue bucket of gold”carrie  lowell finds sufjan stevens stripped bare trading his usual experimental instrumentation for minimalism focusing attention on the devastatingly personal delivery of his mother’s passing the album’s final track “blue bucket of gold” begins much the same plodding piano keys and the fuzzy warmth of sufjan’s voice draws the listener in with its intimacy belying the metaphor of loss and ghostly backing vocals that threaten to knock you out cold sufjan asks for answers and pleas for the impossible as the album seems to fizzle to a bleak conclusion swallowed by its own grief just then the ethereal drone crescendos out of nowhere its oscillations washing over like a wave of catharsis providing comfort where words have fallen short in the face of death hope springs eternal — brock chenier26 travi scott feat justin bieber  young thug – “maria i’m drunk”while many made a lot of antidote which features all the typical hooks and beats that you’d expect from a banger rodeo’s true work of art is a very cool and calculated twoparter maria sets the tone perfectly offering a slow but captivating atmosphere that allows i’m drunk to wash over you for a night’s cruise this song also features a surprisingly well incorporated justin bieber verse showing his newfound prominence within the hiphop industry through his newly developed range “girl i want you on the rocks no chaser be sure to drink it all wont waste ya” — zachary “thezachman1” mahabir25 drake – “back to back”“back to back” was the biggest hiphop event of 2015 the first diss song to be nominated for a grammy had timelines ablaze and has so far garnered over 105 million soundcloud plays everyone knew drake was waiting for a chance to prove himself everyone except meek mill who fired off a series of tweets claiming drake didn’t write his own raps “is that a world tour or your girls tour” drake clapped back over the noah “40” shebib laced beat as the punchlines kept rolling in “yeah trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers  yeah you gettin bodied by a singin nigga” meek’s career hung by a thread the drizzy drake we knew was gone the 6ix god was born — michael heal24 father john misty – “the night josh tillman came to our apartment”in the middle of a collection of beautiful unapologetic love songs “the night josh tillman came to our apartment” stands out it’s an antilove song in which our weary narrator complains about his lover’s annoying habits some lyrics are biting with sarcasm dripping off them others are understated and subtle the result is a song which complements rather than contradicts the central message of i love you honeybear  it’s tillman’s greatest songwriting achievement yet — vesuvius23 kendrick lamar – “alright”a rap song has never won “song of the year” at the grammys but kendrick lamar’s “alright” might be the first the song isn’t just a catchy pharrell produced banger it’s socially aware we’re angry “we hate popo  wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho”  we’re tired “im at the preachers door  my knees gettin weak and my gun might blow  but we have hope “but we gon be alright” black lives matter protesters evened chanted the hook during the 20th anniversary celebration of million man march in washington dc kendrick lamar managed to capture the emotions of a nation and evidently the world in three and a half minutes no award can match that — michael heal22 beach house – “space song”though many tracks on depression cherry may seem to “blend” “space song” is a true standout while beach house’s classic use of drones pulls you into the song it’s the magnificent riffs that keep you there these riffs promote an ambivalent feeling on one hand they represent sorrowful cries capable of breaking down whatever wall you might place against it but on the other they represent a hypnotic happiness contemplate “what makes this fragile world go round” as beach house transports you to a new one on “space song — mattw11621 snakehips feat chance the rapper  tinashe – “all my friends”drunk on a friday night look no further than the infectious “all my friends” the soaring chorus and hypnotic synths create a party anthem with a twist tinashe delivers a standout vocal performance complete with vulture metaphors while chance the rapper spits a sweet sixteen entirely about the effects of xanax you can’t escape the irony of one liners like “the nights we wont remember  are the nights we wont remember” in a society where todays youth consider “turning up” on their list of basic human rights — michael heal20 future – “march madness”lively and anthemic this tarentinoproduced track was the highlight of futures best project in a year he dominated releasing 2 billboard 1 albums in the span of 3 months in addition to his usual drug references future takes

encapsulation of america at its best — haz19 drake – “hotline bling”drake’s “hotline bling” has dominated the latter half of 2015 thanks to its simplistic but captivating beat and incredibly

of mistreated prisoners jealous guards and an artist’s conflict with a record label could be told in 9 minutes lupe fiasco however is not your average lyricist on the stringdriven side of “prisoner 1” lupe details the tragedy of the “new jim crow” until the song breaks down to the sound of menacing grunts and pleas to be freed leading towards “prisoner 2” where the guards abuse their privileges to feel powerful only to realize they’re trapped as well in classic lupe style the metaphorical subplot runs deep click here for the genius annotated page you’re welcome — mattw11617 miguel – “waves”while it wasn’t the lead single on wildheart miguel’s “waves” proved to be a fan favorite the booming instrumentation shines bright alongside miguel’s fiery delivery that seems to endlessly intensify leading up to a passionatefrenzy of an outro compared to “coffee” this song shines bright when performed live the rocking guitars amplify even further while the crowd emulates miguel’s enormous energy always experimenting with ways to push the genre forward miguel masters the crossover between rock and rb to create an anthemic soundtrack to our summer — shyink16 jack ü feat justin bieber – “where are ü now”while where are ü now is the brainchild of skrillex  diplo the superproducer duo behind jack ü  its justin bieber who steals the show with an outstanding comeback vocal

voice anoint the songthe best traits of skrillex and diplo as bieber croons about an ex guess who we can only wonder where has mature justin been all our lives  — babu sea15 aap rocky feat bones – “canal st”“canal st” featuring bones is that vibe and by no accident either imagine aap rocky treading down canal st towards mercer with his hood up and head down watching the rain splash off his vintage leather boots smoking a blunt in the dead of night the hustlers sermon is delivered over a stripped back smoldering beat looping in and out of bones’ hook as rocky snarls “heard the people want that raw shit but yall be talkin bullshit” to end the second verse we realize what we just heard was most definitely the former — michael heal14 courtney barnett – “pedestrian at best”at first listen “pedestrian at best” is organized chaos witty bars on fame and philosophy are thrown into crashing guitar riffs the execution might seem awkward at first but lyrics like “put me on a pedestal  and i’ll only disappoint you” and “i think you’re a joke  but i don’t find you very funny” are some of the most poignant and hilarious lines of the year barnett doesn’t need to worry about her fame falling through  songs like these will certainly keep her afloat — babu sea13 major lazer feat dj snake  mø – “lean on“lean on” mashes edm reggae and traditional indian sounds into a dancefloor ballad about taking on love’s difficulties danish darling mø brings plenty to the table as the vocalist melting into the words “but the nights are long longing for you to come home” staccato synths and a chipmunked riff complete the presentation of one of the world’s biggest songs of the summer — chihuahua012 alessia cara – “here”here functions as the ultimate introvertanthem in a world where mainstream pop music largely celebrates and glorifies the party lifestyle newcomer alessia cara sheds light on the other side of the spectrum antisocials of society can find comfort in the idea that a rising star feels the same way as they do melodic throughout “here” is perfect for radio but also has the storytelling chops of a deeper cut drawing the listener in and allowing thoughtprovoking

and soon please — vesuvius10 grimes – “kill v maim”a song written from the point of view of a “vampire spacetravelling al pacino from the godfather part 2 who can change gender” kill v maim is as eccentric of a piece as its perspective suggests boucher’s delivery and production are in a constant state of flux yet melt and cohere into a glorious final product it’s hyperactive she moves from articulated statements into accented growls and from taunting cheerleader chants to genderbent rebellion the song’s a prime example of forwardthinking pop breaking down expectations with every turn and interstellar sound effect fun unexpected and a total wild card  it’s undeniably grimes — tyler yan lanadelreyquaza9 jamie xx feat romy madley croft – “loud places”on “loud places” jamie xx recruits former bandmate romy to essentially create a new xx song something fans have patiently awaited since 2012 “loud places” is a song of antithesis searching for peace in the most rowdy of places

truly transcends — mattw1168 kendrick lamar – “the blacker the berry”“i’m the biggest hypocrite of 2015” kendrick lamar screams on “the blacker the berry” as he rages over a raw boi1da instrumental the song is the purest hiphop track on to pimp a butterfly  a refreshing break on an album filled with chaotic jazz and gfunk production

on a song that’s accusatory yet selfreflecting provocative yet selfcontaining kendrick accurately points out how the problems addressed on the record are not just black and white he tries to engage with every side of the discussion by emphasizing black on black violence is just as common as any other form of violence hypocrite yes but kendrick makes hypocrisy seem like a natural response  maybe even an inevitable one — steven frölke7 beach house – “levitation”a pound of feathers or a pound of lead – which is heavier beach house has consistently found themselves on the former end of the common riddle layering airy synths and organs behind victoria legrand’s buoyant voice to create music that seemingly hovers over the listener but don’t mistake lightweight for superficial a pound of feathers is still a pound after all and music this light on its toes is far from punchless in its qualitative or emotional weight “levitation” bubbles with hope in the face of the unknown even as they duly note the looming dread of uncertainty with metaphors of aging they don’t leave you hanging uplifting organs and alex scally’s momentous guitar riffs burst through the fear with a warm incandescence that could soundtrack a sunrise as legrand promises to take you away from all the darkness inviting you to elope into her soothing arms — brock chenier6 dangelo – “really love”d’angelo’s “really love” has existed since 2007 and on the black messiah version of the track he fittingly makes us wait more than two minutes before his voice is heard the latin funk guitar plucks serve as a transition from a whispered spanish lover’s query foreshadowing the intimate softness of d’angelo’s singing lyrically the song aspires to a higher order of love that of “really” love on an album concerned with vital heavy topics like police brutality d’angelo showcases his capacity for romance nearly two decades after releasing his classic debut lp brown sugar it’s really refreshing — brian duricy5 the weeknd – “the hills”horrorinfluenced in theme and sound “the hills” was an unlikely breakout hit a throwback to abel’s mixtape period — in stark contrast to the max martinpenned mj impression cant feel my face it initially surfaced during a sxsw performance immediately stirring up anticipation for the weeknd’s 2015 domination the track builds to the brutally honest hook and crescendos into a punishing low end additional eerie vibes and atmospheric feel combine for one of the most addictive songs of the year half past five will never be the same again — haz4 kanye west feat paul mccartney – “only one”“no you’re not perfect but you’re not your mistakes” are words to live by and if anyone knows it’s kanye omari west on ye’s most personal song since 2008’s 808’s  heartbreak he draws parallels to the beatles’ “let it be”  a song written by sir paul mccartney after waking from a dream about his late mother some 45 years later mccartney joins west as he sings a strikingly beautiful incredibly stark autotuned ballad to his daughter north kanye claimed he couldn’t remember the song when the lines were played to him and concluded it was a message from his late mother donda west considering ye delivered “only one” on the first day of the year here’s hoping he starts 2016 in the same fashion — michael heal3 sufjan stevens – “fourth of july”closing the first side of carrie and lowell “fourth of july” sees sufjan stevens summoned to his estranged mother’s deathbed over quiet piano chords carrie pleads with her “little versailles” for his forgiveness and tries to console him by reminding him of the inevitability of death sufjan covers a tremendous amount of emotional ground over the minimalist production searching desperately for what he “could have said to raise you from the dead” it’s incredibly honest and easily one of the most affecting songs of the year —  vesuvius2 kendrick lamar – “u”this visceral cut from album of the year to pimp a butterfly is an intense disturbing listen rather than the the selfloving “i” “u” serves as the selfloathing antithesis kendrick gives unrestricted access to his tormented soul as he raps about his sixteen year old sister falling pregnant and facetiming his childhood friend chad keaton in hospital while he was away on tour this comes in an intense fit of drunken rage we’re not used to seeing from lamar but it ultimately makes for a more impactful song from the haunting screams gripping internal struggle and manic state kendrick tackles depression head on loving u is complicated
