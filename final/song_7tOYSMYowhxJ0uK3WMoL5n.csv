i dont want much
i just wanna be a better man
to my baby
meet me off for good luck
i was singing with them jezebels
under perfume sheets
got a golden smile heart overflowing
but got us in love but it wasnt enough

chorus
what can i do what can i do
to get back to your heart
id swim the mississippi river
if you would give me another start girl

verse 2
all night long i was out
out till the morning
but baby youre tender
lost when im longing
baby please im down on my knees begging
i thirst for you girl
baby im running to your well

chorus
what can i do what can i do
to get back to your heart
id swim the mississippi river
if you would give me another start girl

what can i do what can i do
to get back to your heart
id swim the mississippi river
if you would give me another start girl

chorus
what can i do what can i do
to get back to your heart

if you would give me another start girl5embed"
