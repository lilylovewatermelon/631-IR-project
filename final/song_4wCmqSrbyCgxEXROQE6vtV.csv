now and then i think of when we were together
like when you said you felt so happy you could die
i told myself that you were right for me
but felt so lonely in your company
but that was love and its an ache i still remember

instrumental break

verse 2 gotye
you can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
like resignation to the end always the end
so when we found that we could not make sense
well you said that we would still be friends
but ill admit that i was glad it was over

chorus gotye
but you didnt have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
and i dont even need your love
but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
no you didnt have to stoop so low
have your friends collect your records and then change your number
i guess that i dont need that though
now youre just somebody that i used to know
now youre just somebody that i used to know
now youre just somebody that i used to know

verse 3 kimbra
now and then i think of all the times you screwed me over
but had me believing it was always something that id done
but i dont wanna live that way
reading into every word you say
you said that you could let it go
and i wouldnt catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

chorus gotye
but you didnt have to cut me off
make out like it never happened and that we were nothing ah
and i dont even need your love ooh
but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough ah
no you didnt have to stoop so low ooh
