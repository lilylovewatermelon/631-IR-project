im gettin older i think im agin well
i wish someone had told me id be doin this by myself
theres reasons that im thankful theres a lot im grateful for
but its different when a strangers always waitin at your door
which is ironic cause the strangers seem to want me more
than anyone before anyone before
too bad theyre usually deranged

verse 2
last week i realized i crave pity
when i retell a story i make everything sound worse
cant shake the feeling that im just bad at healing
and maybe thats the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
which is ironic because when i wasnt honest
i was still bein ignored lyin for attention just to get neglection
now were estranged

chorus
things i once enjoyed
just keep me employed now
things im longing for
someday ill be bored of
its so weird
that we care so much until we dont

im gettin older ive got more on my shoulders
but im gettin better at admitting when im wrong
im happier than ever at least thats my endeavor
to keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
cause to be honest i just wish that what i promise
would depend on what im given mmm not on his permission
wasnt my decision to be abused mmm

chorus
things i once enjoyed
just keep me employed now mmm
things im longing for mmm
someday ill be bored of
its so weird
that we care so much until we dont

outro
but next week i hope im somewhere laughing
for anybody asking i promise ill be fine
ive had some trauma did things i didnt wanna
was too afraid to tell ya but now i think its time56embed"
