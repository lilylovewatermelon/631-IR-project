seat by actors ball players and drug dealers
and some lesbians that never loved niggas
twisted love story true romance

chorus elly jackson
ive been waiting for a long long time
just to get off and throw my hands up high
and live my life and live my life
just to get off and throw my hands up high high high high25embed"
