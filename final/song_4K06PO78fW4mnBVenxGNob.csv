oh my god ronny

chorus
the devil hit my phone he wanna talk
but im not really up for conversations
i can have my cake and eat it too
i just gotta make a reservation
chillin in my head but its hot
flames everywhere i see satan
demons tryna run up in my spot a lot
really really runnin out of patience ticktock

verse 1
timing timing timing
all about timing timing timing
sit back in my chair relaxing and reclining
he has not a care in the world nah im lying
takin all these meds to the face got me flying
takin all these meds to the face got me dying
smoke til my mind frying eyes red high and crying
numb the pain with oxy and dior yeah pricey
juice like tupac shakur no ice tea
givenchy louis v double v icy
wedding ring better things better half wifey
only things numbing me from this hard life thing uh alright

chillin in my head but its hot
flames everywhere i see satan
demons tryna run up in my spot a lot
really really runnin out of patience

verse 2
im waiting waiting waiting sittin up
waiting waiting waiting contemplating
my heart racing
feels like ima die every second of the day
so i gotta get high
aint no coming down aint no coming down why
my anxiety bring me down thats the fucking downside
its like every time i ball i just end up offsides
this light of mine goes dim tonight
will i be alright
let me guess no answer right

chorus
the devil hit my phone he wanna talk
but im not really up for conversations
i can have my cake and eat it too
i just gotta make a reservation
chillin in my head but its hot
flames everywhere i see satan
demons tryna run up in my spot a lot
really really runnin out of patience93embed"
