we swung our feet off of the edge of the moon
we  got that high for a minute
sometimes  forever gets away from you
no matter how hard you grip it

prechorus
sorry the sky fell down
sorry  i dont know why
all  we do is apologize

chorus
oh but ill never be sorry for my hands in the pockets
of  your hoodie called you sugar just to make you smile
and ill never be sorry for the shoes that i bought you
in chicago we were walking down the miracle mile
oh i oh i

postchorus
ill  never be sorry ill never be sorry
ill never be sorry for loving you
ill never be sorry ill never be sorry
ill never be sorry for loving you

verse 2
sometimes two people end up victims of love
it dont work out like you planned it oh no no no
just cause we couldnt get the stars to line up
dont mean we leave emptyhanded

sorry the second verse

we got locked out of your car in the pouring rain
and ill never be sorry for missing the party
cause the way your body looked in that dress blew me away
