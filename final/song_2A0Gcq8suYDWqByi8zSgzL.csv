when im single it dont really matter who it is
or how many i decide to kick it with
long as she can understand how i do it
im a man with a very healthy appetite for chicks
but when i settle down find a woman to live for
still may be a couple cuties at my door
thinking we could get down like we did before
and get mad when i tell her
it cant be like that no more

bridge
girl you know i got a girl

chorus
i just dont get down like that
i dont get down like that
baby you fine baby yous a dime
but i just dont get down like that
i dont get down like that

verse 2
understand baby girl that im a totally new man
i dont live to crush as many as i can
no no
found a girl that changed my whole game plan
she the one she the one
only one that im wanting
and i know girl i know
that you really want me back
id be lying if i said i wasnt tempted
all the things we used to do i kinda miss it
it aint nothing you can give as good as this is
