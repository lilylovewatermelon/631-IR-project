yeah when i grow up you know what i wanna be
take a seat let me tell you my ridiculous dreams
i wanna rap yeah i know its hard to believe
and i can tell youre already thinkin i will never succeed
but im okay with it i admit the lyrics are weak
ive been workin on em ill be good eventually
i understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
but i been running for a while they aint ready for me ahh
i know this prolly isnt really realistic
and honestly i might not ever make a difference
but that dont make a difference ima have to risk it
ive been crunchin numbers you aint gotta be a mathematician
to see the odds aint rootin for me
i cant lie though its kinda how i like it to be
the underdog yeah you prolly think you know what i mean
but what im saying is they ever push me im gonna swing yeah
i could go to college get in debt like everybody else
graduate and prolly get a job that doesnt pay the bills
that dont make a lot of sense to me forget the happy meals
i dont like the dollar menu i would rather make a meal
huh make a mil nah i said make a meal
homecookin get the grill how you want it pretty well
everything i see is overdone to me im not adele
but ima get a record deal and say hello to mass appeal
see nf liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likechorus
when i grow up i just want to pay my bills
rappin about the way i feel oh yeah
i just want to make a couple mil
leave it to the fam in the will oh yeah
i just want to sign a record deal
maybe buy a house up in the hills oh yeah
might not be the best in my field
but i guarantee that ima die real
when i grow up

postchorus
yeah ayy
when i grow up

verse 2
ima make em notice me rhymin like its poetry
everything i oversee i just like to overthink
mockin me you pay the fee no return and no receipts
those of you that dont believe quiet you dont know a thing
quiet when im tryna sing quiet when im making beats
quiet when im tryna think sorry i dont mean to scream
i just feel like no one really gets me and its sad to see
cause someday ima grow up and show all of you its meant to be yeah
anybody wanna hear me rap no
come on let me play a couple tracks no
come on i can spit it really fast no
you think i should throw this in the trash no
tricked ya haters go away before i hit ya
i am not a beggar or a kissup
you dont understand well i forgive ya
i am not a quitter you aint really think that did ya
maybe someday i could even be up on the radio
have a tour bus and maybe even play a couple shows
everybody in the crowd singing every word i wrote
tellin me that i am not the only one that feels alone
huh you feel alone yeah i kinda feel alone
wonder if that feelin ever goes away when you get old
will i ever make it as an artist i dont really know
might not make a lot of dough
ima have to try it though
