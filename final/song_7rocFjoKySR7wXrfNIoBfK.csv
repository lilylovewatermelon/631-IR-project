hook


verse
ridin through my hood lookin for them bitches
smokin on dope as i hit them switches
deuce deuce tucked in a young nigga britches
mind on my money but a murder came with it
thinkin that a young black man gotta get it
reefer in my blunt man i swear i gotta hit it
wanted to stop but a nigga cant quit it
left out the club but his bitch came with me
crazy shit huh chris travis for you dummies
sippin codeine got me feelin like a zombie
poppin them pills got me feelin kinda funny
chris fuckin travis and yo ho wanna fuck me
but im just chillin we can fuck in the morning
smokin on mids when my day gets boring
my bitch on my side keep a young nigga soaring
fuck with a nigga just ride with me
and roll somethin up get high with me
only real niggas in the sky with me
now vibe to this hypnotizin shit
girl shut up you better ride this dick
hoes on my dick cause they know a nigga steezin
kush so loud mane it got a nigga sneezin
if yo bitch left then nigga im the reason
smokin on packs ashin on the bitch cleavage
full of them drugs as im ridin through the night
codeine in my cup got a nigga feelin right
pretty bitch on my side and she on that shit tonight
take her back to my crib my nigga its only right
