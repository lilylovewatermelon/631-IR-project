its too late to turn back now
oh god i tried but i dont know how

verse 1
i wanna be someone you used to hate
without the memory of the pain
i went too far now we cant restart
its like we cut them brakes tore em off the car
ninety miles inside the dark
familiar scars and electric hearts
i know im gonna die in this bed i made
and im drowning in a dream that i cant escape
if i could wake up id hesitate

chorus
but its too late to turn back now
oh god i tried but i dont know how
if i could escape it id trade in
the blamе you can take it
if it doesnt take mе first
if it doesnt take me first

verse 2
i lie to myself like its not too late
convinced the past can still be changed
we know its gone but i cant move on
i want to rewind but it just replays
jumping on a hand grenade
but it wont go off
no it wont go off
see bad omens liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likechorus
but its too late to turn back now
oh god i tried but i dont know how
if i could escape it id trade in
the blame you can take it
if it doesnt take me first

i know im gonna die in this bed i made

chorus
but its too late to turn back now
oh god i tried but i dont know how
if i could escape it id trade in
