i know you got that fever for me hundred and two
and boy i know i feel the same my temperatures through the roof

prechorus
if theres a camera up in here
then its gon leave with me when i do i do

i will hunt you down
cause they be all up in my business like a wendy interview
but this is private tween you and i

chorus
touch my body put me on the floor
wrestle me around play with me some more
