through all these days of mortal sin
through all these eternal nights with no tomorrow
gotta stay on the straight and narrow and find a little light within

gotta walk that road all the way to heaven
gotta walk that road until the dawn
gotta walk that road all night
all you need is a little light
and the closer you get lord the brighter it turns on

dont need no compass no map or chart
dont need no stars shining above
dont need nothing but a little light in my heart
glowing inside me like a blanket of loveyou might also like2embed"
