abandoned by his parents and raised by the gods
who could see he was destined for greatness
though he was no bigger than you or me as a baby
he was a demigod

ensemble
wow

linmanuel miranda
with lightning speed
and he gave our people all the things we need yes indeed
we were crawling on the ground
he looked around and said you need a little more space
and he raised the sky
so we could walk so we could fly

ensemble
we were crawling on the ground
he looked around and said you need a little more space
and he raised the sky
so we could walk so we could fly

linmanuel miranda
we were walking in the dark
til maui found a spark down in the underworld
he climbed up higher and higher
bringing the gift of fire

we were walking in the dark
til maui found a spark down in the underworld
he climbed up higher and higher
bringing the gift of fire

linmanuel miranda
when maui was around we were unstoppable
we shattered all the rules ran free
we tore down every wall
and we answered the call of the sea

we used to sail with gods we were unstoppable
to islands we could go explore
with every breaking dawn
our adventures would go on beyond the shore

maui taught us how to see the waves
maui taught us how the sea behaves
maui taught us how to see the skies
how to see the way the seagull flies

maui taught us how the stars can guide us
the secrets that the ocean can provide us
how to see our way through wind and rain
and know the way back home is there inside us
we ran the world we were unstoppable
we learned to sail the seas alone
with every escapade
we were brave and unafraid of the unknown

we gathered up our strength we were unstoppable
we chased the long horizon line
we faced tremendous odds
but we rumbled with the gods and we were fine

hey master of disguise
he could assume any form any shape or size
he used to fight fantastic monsters
take em by surprise

ensemble
master of disguise
he could assume any form any shape or size
he used to fight fantastic monsters
take em by surprise

linmanuel miranda
until the fateful night
the only time he ever lost a fight
a thousand years ago
against a demon named
ensemble
tepō

tepō
tepō

linmanuel miranda spoken
tepō was a brutal land spirit
legend says she devoured maui whole and with the disappearance of maui came the end of our voyages

the villainous tepō did the impossible
and maui just like that was gone
our demigod our friend fought for us until the end
and he lives on

for a thousand years we have made motunui our home
but there can be a new maui a new generation

sung

i am moana i am unstoppable
i know how big the world can be
if maui lives in you
we can sail across the blue unending sea

were ready for whats next we are unstoppable
we want to see the world beyond the shore
for maui years ago
taught us everything we know so lets explore

we want more
we want more
we want more
