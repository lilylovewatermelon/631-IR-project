nobody ever believes me cause im skinny and silly

off the walls on a high
coming down dying to kick it

so you wanna have a good time
you wanna get on down
so come on over to my house where we can fool around
dont look at me im too ugly im too skinny and silly
nobody wants to hang out with a rejection man
yeah cmon cmon gotta give it everything you

give it everything

the merry goes the merry goes round and round
there he goes the merry goes bouncing now
off the walls on a high
coming down dying to kick it
