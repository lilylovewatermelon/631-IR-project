as time goes by
nothing has changed
i wont stand and watch
you wither away

refrain 1
after all this time
i stand by you
through all of the years
ive been with you

verse 2
through pain and affliction
with every addiction
i will never let you down
i will live by this code
never surrender
you and i are one

chorus
through the eye of the storm
you are never alone
even through the shadows
you are never alone
see killswitch engage liveget tickets as low as 89you might also likerefrain 2
after all this time
still you struggle
even words of love
ring so hollow

verse 3
i have no regrets
i have no remorse
and if you falter
i wont let you down

chorus
through the eye of the storm
you are never alone
even through the shadows
you are never alone

bridge
come on
together we stand
never fall
no matter the trial
we will overcome
together we stand
never fall
no matter the trial
we will overcome
chorus
through the eye of the storm
you are never alone
you are never alone
even through the shadows
you are never alone

outro
never
together we stand
never fall
no matter the trial
we will overcome
we will overcome1embed"
