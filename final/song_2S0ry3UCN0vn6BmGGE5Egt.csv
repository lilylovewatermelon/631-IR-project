i been walking the wire over your love
and they fall into your hands
but i dont know where ill land
your body holds me hostage whenever i touch you
im a prisoner inside
baby til the end of time

verse 2 usher
try to keep my balance but i still fall
but howd i fall so hard
right into your arms
wrapped inside you baby and its so warm
love without a cause
leaves me trapped inside my own bars

you need this in your life two kings revolutionary
without you girl i would be barely breathing
i never would survive if you would leave me
but i realize its worth running a race
when the finish line is you

chorus romeo santos  usher
baby i want you i need you pero yo tengo miedo
so promise me youll never be anybodys but mine
if i give you my heart girl but you got to promise
promise that youll love me baby
promise youll hold me hold me
touch me touch me
