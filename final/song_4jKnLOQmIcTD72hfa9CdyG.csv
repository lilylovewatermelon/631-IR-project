verse
i tried to motivate the people but i made em angry
i tried to show em it was all love that made em hate me
they criticize me and talk bad bout me on the daily
i get the money and stay out the way they think im crazy
maybe if i werent built for this id let it phase me
cant bend or fold my folks dependin on for me to make it
im atr for life the leadеr of the fucking navy
this hithouse entеrtainment baby we all drive mercedes
its crazy we came a long way to get to this
i opened up about my pain let the world in
i know exactly how it feels to come out the bottom
how the hell you hate on somebody with so much in common
stay to myself and get these dollas
take care grandma take care mama
get the bread and feed my partners
never hear my name in drama
im focused on these commas
fuck a bitch i love my kids they grandmama and they mama
dont care about no followers
i made my first million way before i made it big
i made my second million way before i made my kids
my third and fourth million i made em the same night
my fifth million made em when they platinumed heart on ice
on the phone with the lawyer talkin bout my next five yeah yeah yeah
look if i could make ten then i can make a hunnid
then i can make a billion we turned nothing into something yeah
the youngest out my city but the dumbest out my city out my city
youngin ran up some millies aint have to dickride to get it
and i still fuck with gates but sometimes im in my feelings
