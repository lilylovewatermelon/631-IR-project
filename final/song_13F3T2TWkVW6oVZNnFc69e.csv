i find shelter in this way
under cover hideaway
can you hear when i say
i have never felt this way

chorus
maybe i had said something that was wrong
can i make it better with the lights turned on
maybe i had said something that was wrong
can i make it better with the lights turned on

verse 2
could i be was i there
it felt so crystal in the air
i still want to drown whenever you leave
please teach me gently how to breathe

interlude
and ill cross oceans like never before
so you can feel the way i feel it too
and ill mirror images back at you
so you can see the way i feel it too

chorus
maybe i had said something that was wrong
can i make it better with the lights turned on
maybe i had said something that was wrong
can i make it better with the lights turned on
