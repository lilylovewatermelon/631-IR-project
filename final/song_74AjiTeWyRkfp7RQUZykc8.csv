verse 2
me and the homie pull off the corner
inside of a old honda accord
the feeling felt like a torture
the nigga that we just robbed just popped one in his shoulder
it led to me pulling over to check him and tell him dawg
just take the passenger seat and ill hit the road
cause its way too many police out here to feel like we low
my back windshield broke and the driver seat soaked
from the blood that was previously leaking from his coat
we switch sides while i put this shit to drive
at 80 some odd miles im shiftin the gear to 5
hopin that them 50 pigs dont see the ride
cause normally i aint scared tonight its fear in my eyes
my phone blingin cause my girl at home clingin
and unaware of the problem this night on the road bringin
then i pick up the phone and tell her im speedin home
as soon as i drop my dawg at the emergency room17embed"
