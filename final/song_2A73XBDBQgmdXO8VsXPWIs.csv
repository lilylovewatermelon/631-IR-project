ooh ooh ooh ooh

verse 1
she she aint real
she aint gon be able to love you like i will
she is a stranger
you and i have history or dont you remember
sure shes got it all
but baby is that really what you want

prechorus
bless your soul youve got your head in the clouds
she made a fool out of you and boy shes bringin you down
she made your heart melt but youre cold to the core
now rumour has it she aint got your love anymore

chorus
rumour has it rumour
rumour has it rumour
rumour has it rumour
rumour has it rumour
rumour has it rumour
rumour has it rumour
rumour has it rumour

but im guessin thats the reason that you strayed
i heard youve been missin me
youve been tellin people things you shouldnt be
like when we creep out when she aint around
havent you heard the rumours bless your soul

prechorus
bless your soul youve got your head in the clouds
you made a fool out of me and boy youre bringin me down
you made my heart melt yet im cold to the core
but rumour has it im the one youre leaving her for

people say crazy things
just cause i said it dont mean that i meant it
just cause you heard it
