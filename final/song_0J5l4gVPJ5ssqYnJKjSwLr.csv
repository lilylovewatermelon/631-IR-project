i cant see too clear
so i dont know whats near
i wake up and see my friends walking around
and i know that theres no fear

chorus
how does that feel
how does that feel

and everyone delivers all you do is sit
i dont care if you cant imagine living everyday like this

chorus
and how would that feel
how would that feel
