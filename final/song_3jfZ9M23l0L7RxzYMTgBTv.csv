i guess i should stop looking out for you like i always do
when will you start looking out for me too
instead of leaving me staring at my shoes
its just the way youre glancing at me
something about you just makes me feel guilty for liking you
when youre with him when youre with him

chorus
this is a love song for a girl who will never know its about her
i know its pretty stupid but im much too shy to tell her
shes beaming that smile all the while
im all choked up on my own throat i guess there is no hope

verse 2
and were walking out in the snow i say i guess i should go
and were talking bout someone else
when we should be talking about ourselves
its the same old situation youve always got me waiting
come on dear i think times awastin
before we have to go back inside and return to our normal lives

chorus
this is a love song for a girl who will never know its about her
i know its pretty stupid but im much too shy to tell her
shes beaming that smile all the while
im all choked up on my own throat i guess there is no hopesee joy again liveget tickets as low as 65you might also like28embed"
