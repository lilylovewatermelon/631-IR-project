soft kiss and wine
what a pretty friend of mine
were finally intertwined
nervous and shy
for the moment we will come
alive tonight

prechorus
secret valentine

hook
well write a song
that turns out the lights
when both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
dont waste your time
speed up your breathing
just close your eyes
well hope its not for nothing at all

verse 2
lay down be still
dont worry talk they will
ill be loving you until
mornings first light
breaks tomorrow
ill take care of you tonight

secret valentine

hook
well write a song
that turns out the lights
when both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
dont waste your time
speed up your breathing
just close your eyes
well hope its not for nothing at all

bridge
when guilt fills your head
brush off rise up from the dead
this is the moment that we
will come alive
brace yourself for love
sweet love secret love

hook
well write a song
that turns out the lights
when both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
dont waste your time
speed up your breathing
just close your eyes
well hope its not for nothing at all
well write a song
that turns out the lights
when both boy and girl start suddenly shaking inside
dont waste your time
speed up your breathing
just close your eyes
well hope its not for nothing at all
nothing at allembed"
