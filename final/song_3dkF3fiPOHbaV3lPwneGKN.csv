there is not a single word in the whole world
that could describe the hurt
the dullest knife just sawing back and forth
and ripping through the softest skin there ever was

bridge hayley
how were you to know
oh how were you to know

chorus hayley  joy
and i i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but ive been there before
and i i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but ive been there before

verse 2 joy
love happens all the time
to people who arent kind
and heroes who are blind
expecting perfect scripted movie scenes
who wants an awkward silent mystery

bridge joy
how were you to know
well how were you to knowohoh

and i i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but ive been there before
and i i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but ive been there before

bridge hayley joy both
for all the air thats in your lungs
for all the joy that is to come
for all the things that youre alive to feel
just let the pain remind you hearts can heal

bridge hayley joy
oh how were you to know how were you to know
oh how were you to know

chorus hayley  joy
and i i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but ive been there before
and i i hate to see your heart break
i hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
but ive been there beforeembed"
