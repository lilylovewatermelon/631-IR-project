verse 1
always see it on tv​
or read in the magazines
celebrities who want sympathy
all they do is piss and moan
inside the rolling stone
talking about how hard life can be

prechorus
id like to see them spend a week living life out on the street
i dont think they would survive
if they could spend a day or two walking in someone elses shoes
i think theyd stumble and theyd fall they would fall fall

chorus
lifestyles of the rich and the famous
theyre always complaining always complaining
if money is such a problem
well they got mansions think we should rob them

verse 2
well did you know if you were famous you could
kill your wife and theres no such thing as 25 to life
as long as youve got the cash to pay for cochran
and did you know if you were caught and you were
smoking crack mcdonalds wouldnt even want to take you back
you could always just run for mayor of dc​
