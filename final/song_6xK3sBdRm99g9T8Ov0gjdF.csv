theres no more cops outside
it just takes away
its kinda why ill talk to you
its hella sensitive

verse 1
always the same old taste just new injury
well ill wear the claws if youd like that
yeah if youd like that we can ride on a black horse
a great new wave hesperian death horse
i can call you when i get back
yeah when i get back i will call

chorus
but dont speak dont say nothing
in case we ever do meet again
somethings wrong with you
well i hope we never do meet again

verse 2
you always sharpen your teeth cause youre like that
and youre like that every time you pull heart back
and her compacts carving deeper in your lap
i would call but i forget where the phone is at
guess ill talk to you when i get back
yeah when i get back i will talk
