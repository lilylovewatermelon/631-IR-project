i can still remember the words and what they meant
as we etched them with our fingers in years of wet cement
the days blurred into each other though everything seemed clear
we cruised along at half speed but then we shifted gears

prechorus
we ran like vampires from a thousand burning suns
but even then we should have stayed

chorus
but we ran away now all my friends are gone
maybe weve outgrown all the things that we once loved
run away but what are we running from
a show of hands from those in this audience of one

postchorus
where have they gone

verse 2
identities assume us as nine and five add up
synchronizing watches to the seconds that we lost
i looked up and saw you i know that you saw me
we froze but for a moment in empathy

prechorus
i brought down the sky for you but all you did was shrug
you gave my emptiness a name
you might also likechorus
and you ran away now all my friends are gone
maybe weve outgrown all the things that we once loved
run away but what are we running from
a show of hands from those in this audience of one

postchorus
where have they gone

bridge
were all okay until the day were not
the surface shines while the inside rots
we raced the sunset and we almost won
we slammed the brakes but the wheels went on

chorus
we ran away now all my friends are gone
maybe weve outgrown all the things that we once loved
runaway but what are we running from
a show of hands from those in this audience of one

postchorus
where have they gone8embed"
