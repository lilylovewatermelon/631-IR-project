yeah ayy

verse
i got rent i got bills but i want a record deal
dont wanna give up on my dreams cause i know i got skills
people sayin i wont make it sometimes thats how it feels
dreams and ambitions of makin millions from record deals
emotions i let it spill im goin in for the kill
give em my everything still i hope you feel me for real
just me and all my homies we want it now more than ever
destined to work a ninetofive man fuck all that whatever
i want this life forever
i wanna make it out my hood i wanna do shit better
i got nothin to my namе not even no ged
but i dont wanna be somе hasbeen lookin back at fortythree
wonderin who he could be if he had the guts to take the leap
thats why im here to take the beat
and not repeat the cycle of people who never lived their dreams
i was destined a life of nothin my parents both fiends
my name is logic i wrote this record at nineteen
and now at thirtyone i read pages from my old rhyme book
thinkin bout the time that it took to get here
see it clear like visine me and my regime made it by any means
used to eat at dennys now its nobu hella clean
relieve the pain like ketamine relive the pain and let em in
started as a freshman now logic a veteran
thinkin bout the time it took to get here
i signed a deal and made the mills can finally afford to pay the bills
this world is cold as fuck like im from the ville
let that last line chill everything i ever wanted now i got it
fuck a subject school i dropped it grabbed a gat and cocked it
me and my homies in the lab dope shit what we concocted
yo i been to hell and back motherfuck a platinum plaque
none of that that dont mean shit if your family aint got your back
im unretired yeah im back thats a fact thats thatyou might also like12embed"
