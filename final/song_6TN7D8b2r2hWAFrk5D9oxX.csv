theres a party and were all going
and were all growing up
somebodys driving and he will be drinking
and no ones going back
cause weve tried hungry and weve tried full
and nothing seems enough
so tonight tonight the boys are gonna go
for more more more

chorus 1
and i want a love that falls as fast as a body from the balcony
and i want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
im holding my breath with a baseball bat
though i dont know what im waiting for
i am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

verse 2
smell that its wet grass and smoke in my hair
i think ive had enough
but he wants a finale and i came prepared
and were not going back
and ive tried sharing and ive tried caring
and ive tried putting out
but the boys boys boys keep coming on
for more more more
and change change change is gonna come but
when when when

i am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be
