verse 1 beyoncé
he walks in the club with love in his eyes
as he steps flockflockin females by his side
lookin scrumptious even though he aint tryin
the finest thing that you ever did see
the sexy creation had his hat tilted to the side
starin at me had my nostrils open wide
cant even vocalize what i visualized
and my body paralyzed as he smiled at me i said
