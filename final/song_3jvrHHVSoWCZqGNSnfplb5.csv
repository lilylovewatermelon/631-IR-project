some days you got it all together
you swear you have it figured out
other days youre stumbling and a wondering
what the hell its all about
lifes kind of funny like that
sometimes youre the dog sometimes youre the cat
all you can do is just keep going
and thank god for what you have

chorus
keep chuggin along
keep singing your song
put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
when you look back over your shoulder
at everything youve done
put the good in your pocket
let the bad ones make you strong
keep chuggin along

verse 2
sometimes you get a bill in the mail
you dont know how youre going to pay
then your baby wraps her arms around you
and makes it all go away
lifes kind of funny like that
sometimes youre the train sometimes youre the track
and when that sun goes down
and there aren’t no going back

keep chuggin along
keep singing your song
put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
when you look back over your shoulder
at everything youve done
put the good in your pocket
let the bad ones make you strong
keep chuggin along
keep chuggin along
keep singing your song
put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
when you look back over your shoulder
at everything youve done
put the good in your pocket
let the bad ones make you strong
keep chuggin along

outro
keep chuggin along
yeah keep chuggin alongembed"
