im waitin my whole life but im tired
tired of wishin for you
im waitin patiently but my mischief
wishin for somethin new

verse 3
money come right back never had to fight that
but i come back back
thought it was a night cap life hit a hijack
girl i speak facts facts
heartbreak drake for my first heartbreak
i was seventeen and i made mistakes
went to dances but i never did dance
got pretty fly but i never did land
now im twentythree
lovin and learnin from all the lovers that i see
nissan babes with the body burgundy
love my car same way i used to love key
friends need a uber sis need tuition
fans want the music but they want a politician
pressure pressure pressure pressure pressure
shut the fuck up i dont need the extras
spice girl sittin in a red mercedes
attitude like im tryna have your babies
but i aint tryna have no babies
no i aint tryna have no baby
outro
been waitin my whole life but im tired so tired
tired of wishin for you
im waitin patiently but my mischief
wishin for somethin new3embed"
