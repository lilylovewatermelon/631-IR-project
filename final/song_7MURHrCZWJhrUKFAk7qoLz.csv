you only called me your baby
when she wasnt there
now you go calling me crazy
because i dont care

prechorus
well never turn back time
now lovin you is an afterthought
too late to press rewind
when all i wanna do do is stop

chorus
i gotta break you free
dont know why youd ever say love
knowing ill never be enough
breaking the best part of me
when i dont let you do me like that
cant keep pullin you back to me

cant keep pullin you back to me
me me me me
