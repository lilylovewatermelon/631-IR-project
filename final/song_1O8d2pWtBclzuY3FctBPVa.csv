stranded in this spooky town
stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
floor is crackling cold
she took my heart i think she took my soul
with the moon i run
far from the carnage of the fiery sun

verse 2
driven by the strangle of vein
showing no mercy id do it again
open up your eyes
you keep on crying baby ill bleed you dry
skies they blink at me
i see a storm bubbling up from the sea

chorus
and its coming closer
and its coming closer

verse 3
you shimmy shook my boat
leaving me stranded all in love on my own
do you think of me
where am i now baby where do i sleep
feels so good but im old
two thousand years of chasing taking its toll
see kings of leon liveget tickets as low as 117you might also likechorus
and its coming closer
and its coming closer
and its coming closer
and its coming closer34embed"
