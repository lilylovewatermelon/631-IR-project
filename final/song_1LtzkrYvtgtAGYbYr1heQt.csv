im getting out im leaving here
im kicking right through this door
i stole your girl who was my girl
i always said shes a whore
bust through accelerate
from everything i hate
now this is my kind of disaster
break in and take what we want
and then burn down the liquor store
pick up our friends tell them
lets all get in dont ask what its for
sub woofer kicking it
porn on the tv screen
these spinning rims dont go no faster

chorus
we can ride all night
and were not gonna stop for the pigs or no one
just follow the light
and were not gonna stop for the pigs or no one

verse 2
were flipping off the people
who dissed on us thats just our game
were throwing bricks right through their windows
and then we drive away
lets break this spin around
new things are better found
we keep on changing our direction
go past the school the church
the places that caused us hurt were done
if we keep moving forward
maybe well forget where were from
were gonna shake things up
were gonna break you down
well fuel this car with our rejection
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likechorus
we can ride all night
and were not gonna stop for the pigs or no one
just follow the light
and were not gonna stop for the pigs or no one

verse 3
you can never go back not even
if you wanted to know where youre in deep now
youve been fucking up real good lately
one minute you come from zero go now

chorus
we can ride all night
and were not gonna stop for the pigs or no one
just follow the light
and were not gonna stop for the pigs or no one
we can ride all night
and were not gonna stop for the pigs or no one
just follow the light
and were not gonna stop for the pigs or no oneembed"
