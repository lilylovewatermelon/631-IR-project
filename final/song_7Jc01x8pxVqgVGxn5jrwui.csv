verse 2
okay i get it i understand
theres people here to hold my hand
but what happens when happens when
i cant comprehend someone holding my hand
numb the pain with the drank what i spent five bands
a bunch of pills oxyco spent another five grand
but understand none of these drugs make the person i am
sober up i can sorry but i cant
hope to see tomorrow the potency of sorrows
i was thinking hopefully maybe hopefully
theres some dopamine i could borrow
its a long shot from the finish line long shot
so many obstacles in this life life of mine life of mine yeah
