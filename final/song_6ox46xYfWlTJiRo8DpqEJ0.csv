verse 1 timbaland
its life or death either one
the king is back take heed and run
i piss and take a shit on your beats for fun
i killed the game i aint even use a gun
who better than me dont make me laugh
i run this shit haters chase my ass
i aint talkin shit nigga just tellin the facts
i think all the tracks im hearin from niggas is whack
i be hearin these niggas what they say in their rhymes
i took my spot nobody gave me mine
i make the beats that boom boom boom in they trunks
you disagree homie then go on and jump
you can bump your gums you can say what you want
thats all you gon do cause you niggas is punks
im number one you aint nuttin but shit
when they need a hit im who they come to get

prechorus timbaland

if you wont fuck with me i wont fuck with you
we can do it however you wanna do

verse 3 sebastian
see my heart feel my pain
some is stars some is lames
how they follow little trends to get they fame
i aint snap my damn fingers to get in the game
you claim you rich show me son
if you got so many dollars then loan me one
fools think theyre killers they own a gun
when you know you bout as sweet as a honey bun
trashy broads behind the bar
like you that dude youre frontin hard
vip bands dont make you a star
like we really still dont know who the fuck you are
dont talk behind my back just call me nigga
move my heart to the side make room to forgive ya
if you still wanna hang well come to get ya
put the rope around your neck jump my nigga
distorted outro
youre all going to die down here
get out get out
you cant be in here
youre all going to die down here2embed"
