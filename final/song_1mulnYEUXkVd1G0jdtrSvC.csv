i want to go right im safe on my block
except for the cops
will they attack
would it be cause im black
i want to ride away off into space and into the sun
with all those spirits and space dust and aliens
where we belong fuck yeah

verse 2
although it seems like its all crashing down
i just want to ride my bike
through all the bullshit with the wind in my face
miss me with that nonsense
im free as a bird free
and light as the wind
just leave me alone easy
just let me ride off into space space ride
thats where i want to be space ridesee thundercat liveget tickets as low as 54you might also like2embed"
