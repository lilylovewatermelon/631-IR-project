i gave my heart to you
i gave up my friends like you said i should do
put aside my smile for you
and threw up my dreams if you said you didnt approve
i gave my mind compromised my life
just to see id find

slowly throwin me off of my track
disappointed again

oh there you go comparin me
to every little model on the tv screen

i dont know where to go
