there is concrete below me and a sky above so blue
im finally leaving austin and i wish it was with you
i am just a sickness and you seem to be the cure
how much can a southern girl honestly endure
remember northwest mountains they were snowcapped in june
you were napping on my arms on a sunday afternoon
but babe ive gotta heal myself from the things ive never felt
repression is my heaven but id rather go through hell

chorus
its bout time that i left austin
bout time you settled down
with a man who doesnt move as quick
as the train rolling through town
bout time that i face
the hard times ive let go
if love was just an ocean
i would drown before i float

verse 2
you remember getting drunk on the outskirts of this town
when i gave you all i had but it still let you down
everyone ive ever loved has either left or died
wish i was born with concrete shoes but im leaving tonight

its bout time that i left austin

with a man who doesnt move as quick
as the trains rolling through town
bout time that i face
the hard times ive let go
if love was just an ocean

postchorus

bridge
theres concrete below me and a sky above so blue
people ruin people i dont wanna ruin you
i am just a sickness and you seem to be the cure
how much can a southern girl honestly endure

outro
and im finally gone from austin
you finally settled down
with a man who didnt move as quick
as the trains that rolled through town
i finally had to face
the hard times ive let go
if loving you was an ocean
id have drowned so you could float2embed"
