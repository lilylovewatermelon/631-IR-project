more rhymin pure diamond tore hymen poor timing
raw lining paul simon touring im in
boring typing snoring pipe when hyper than four hypemen
excited writing trifling times ten
long stay songs play gone haywire wrong way
on the interstate integrate all day
its just a small phase thats what them all say
then fall prey in a minimall hallway
meant to be sold not told to friendly enemies
remember these intentionally empathy please
silent moment violent prone atonement
miles a minute on a microphone own rent loan spent
no debt has bet fast get cash jet
master mcsmash asterix stashed it last
not least pass the pot of hot grease
geese shot not easily spotted plot cease snot release
hold your insulting tongue and mark his words well
or end up to the curb and shocked by third rail
get the message by bird mail or turds flail
villain man best nerd male you heard wail
an absurd tale of books nooks and crannies
before she look he have his fancy hooks in them granny panties
or plan b when in rome go back home
and get real dome from a wellknown crack gnome
he talk to himself when he need someone to hate on
the black mccain campaign negative debateathon
gone wrong on the song
whos zooming who knew it was you doom all along
ever since he first started the art its been worth it
soon to charter a stint on part of the chitlin circuit
word kid get your ticket from the telepath
wicked wicked wicked on electroencephalograph
you might also likeoutro
villain nice to meet you
