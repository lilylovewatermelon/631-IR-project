already woke spared a joke barely spoke rarely smoke
stared at folks when properly provoked mirror broke
here share a strawberry morning
gone an more important spawning torn in poor men sworn in
cornish hens switching positions
auditioning morticians saw it in a vision ignoring prison
ignoramuses enlist and sound dumb
found em drowned in cows dung crowns flung
rings a tinkerbell sing for things thats frail as a fingernail
bring a scale stale ginger lingers
seven figures invigor
nigga fresh from out the jail alpha male
sickest ninja injury this century enter plea
lend sympathy to limper simple simon rhymin emcees
trees is free please leave a key
these meager fleas hes the breeze
and shes the bees knees for sheez gs of gs
seize property shopper sprees chop the cheese
drop degrees to stop diseases geewhiz pa
doom rock grandma like the kumbaya
mama was a ho hopper papa was a rolling stone star like obama
pull a card like oh drama
civil liberties
these little titties abilities riddle me middle c ah
mm give a mc a rectal hysterectomy
lecture on removal of the bowels foul technically
dont expect to see the recipe
until we receive the check as well as the collection fee
more wreck than section z what you expect to get for free
shit from me history
the key plucked it off the mayor
chucked it in the ol tar pit off la brea player
they say hes gone too far
doomll catch em after jumah on cue lacka
do what ya gotta do grrah
the rumors are not true got to ma
no prob got the job hot bod heartthrob
scotchguard the bar with cotton swabs dart lob
bake a cake sweet jamaica trade in treats on the beach
make her skeet til her feets meet

can it be i stayed away too long
did you miss these rhymes when i was gone
as you listen to these crazy tracks
check them stats then you know where im at
and thats that
outro
look theres doom now
i followed him to the studio but i was too late to stop him
thats right youll never stop me
youre dead youre all dead doom53embed"
