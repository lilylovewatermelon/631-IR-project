pictures of the old us got me feelin older
i just thought you should know i never wanted closure
but you had no problem leavin
now im the one to feel it

chorus
i just cant believe you dont know what im feeling
guess you got the best of this
pickin up the pieces you just wanna leave em
killing me a little bit
and i hate the way you love me
and i hate that i still care
funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
how could you think id be your friend

verse 2
im sure youre doin fine but i dont wanna hear it
and if i left my tshirt you can keep it
i dont wanna see you again if its different
cause ill only see all the things that im missin
and i shouldve cut all the ties but i didnt i didnt let go mmm

chorus
i just cant believe you dont know what im feeling
guess you got the best of this guess you got the best of this
pickin up the pieces you just wanna leave em
killing me a little bit killing me a little bit
and i hate the way you love me
and i hate that i still care i still care
funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
how could you think id be
you might also likebridge
you had no problem leavin
now im the one to feel it

chorus
i just cant believe you dont know what im feeling
guess you got the best of this guess you got the best of this
pickin up the pieces you just wanna leave em
killing me a little bit killing me a little bit
and i hate the way you love me
and i hate that i still care i still care
so funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
how could you think id be your friend8embed"
