your friends say shes out at the bar with her friends so you go
you show up look around but you dont see her face
they tell you she probably went back to her place so you go
then you knock on her door but she wont let you in
she aint ready to do this again

so you go all kinds of crazy just thinking that she might be gone
you go out of your mind at the thought that she finally moved on
she tells you its over this time she means it  she doesnt love you but you dont believe it

the beach where you met is a five hour drive
you know that you wont be sleeping tonight so you go
but the oceans just water the beach is just sand  none of it matters she aint holding your hand so you go

so you go all kinds of crazy just thinking that she might be gone
you go out of your mind at the thought that she finally moved on
she tells you its over this time she means it  she doesnt love you but you dont believe it
so you go all out and try to fix everything that you did wrong

she tells you its over this time she means it  she doesnt love you but you dont believe it
so you go all out and try to fix everything that you did wrong

youre home all alone theres a buzz on your phone its her and she asks if you wanna come oversee old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeembed"
