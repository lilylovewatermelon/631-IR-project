goodfornothing is the name theyll remember me by
done nothin with my life for no one im just waitin to die
i turned my back on the world
you know id given up on livin till i met you girl
then you came into my life with come hither in your eyes
pulling me outta the grave oh what a nice surprise
i die when our nights end
but i only stay dead till i see you again

verse 2
i lie awake in the night just to see another dawn
used to be the sun was my weakness but them days are gone
i feel your lips on mine
will you meet me by the river baby one more time
ill give you what you wanna have ill take you where you wanna go
im the only man youll ever need girl and now you know
ill write your name on my skin
as a promise that well never be apart again

chorus
i feel alive when im with you baby
so tell me that i wont ever be lonely again
dont wanna die i wanna wander the world with you
and no one else for the rest of my days on this earth
see lord huron liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likebridge
i turned my back on the world
i wasnt always like this girl
do you know what loneliness does to a man
turn him into the walking dead
i may have died but your lovin raised me

chorus
i feel alive when im with you baby
so tell me that i wont ever be lonely again
you saved my life i just wanna repay you in kind
aint no one else ever tell you youre beautiful girl

i feel alive when im with you baby
so tell me that i wont ever be lonely again
dont wanna die i wanna wander the world with you
and no one else for the rest of my days on this earth5embed"
