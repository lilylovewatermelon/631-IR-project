every inch of me is trembling
but not from the cold
something is familiar
like a dream i can reach but not quite hold
i can sense you there
like a friend ive always known
im arriving
and it feels like i am home

prechorus idina menzel
i have always been a fortress
cold secrets deep inside
you have secrets too
but you dont have to hide

chorus idina menzel  siren
show yourself
im dying to meet you
show yourself
its your turn
are you the one ive been looking for
all of my life
show yourself
im ready to learn
ahah ahah
ahah ahahah

i finally find out why

you are the answer ive waited for
all of my life

one moment more
oh come to me now
open your door
