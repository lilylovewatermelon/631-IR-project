heartbreak is a headache
like a toothache or an earthquake
spontaneous combustion
leaves a taste thats so disgusting
and it dont go away too fast
im a window made of broken glass
ive never needed anything
anything but you

prechorus
and thats what wrong and thats what wrong
thats what i get thats what i get
for feeling this for feeling this
anyway
just let me know just let me know
all ill miss all ill miss
when im gone when im gone

chorus
just throw it all away you let me down
like everybody says you let me down
write me off like yesterday you let me down
oh i guess that youre not good enough to be with me

verse 2
rumors are tumors
of the sick and mainly useless
when you come to me with these things
its the shit that i cant deal with
still i gave you all of me
faithfulness and honesty
prayed for god to bring you near
along with all these tears
