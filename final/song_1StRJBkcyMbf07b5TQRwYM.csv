ay ay ay once again mr back selling crack
its an honor keeping real nigga music on the map
street raps new face sampling with no credits
doubting myself cause i dont think the world can relate
to my surprise everyone does so have faith
half of the other side dont live it they push play
the young illest alive harlem world to the bay
it feels good waking up to money in the bank
cause last year it was shoebox and lint
i only write raps just to give you niggas hints
every verse a gift as you smoke like a chimney
my album coming november thats twenty years of memory
and thats assuming ima live that long
if i dont dont cry cause i aint live that wrong

an artist in the purest form i live that song bambino
