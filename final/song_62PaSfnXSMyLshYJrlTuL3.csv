hello its me
i was wondering if after all these years youd like to meet
to go over everything
they say that times supposed to heal ya
but i aint done much healin
hello can you hear me
im in california dreaming about who we used to be
when we were younger and free
ive forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

prechorus
theres such a difference between us
and a million miles
chorus
hello from the other side
i mustve called a thousand times
to tell you im sorry for everything that ive done
but when i call you never seem to be home
hello from the outside
at least i can say that ive tried
to tell you im sorry for breaking your heart
but it dont matter it clearly doesnt tear you apart anymore

verse 2
hello how are you

i hope that youre well

where nothing ever happened
