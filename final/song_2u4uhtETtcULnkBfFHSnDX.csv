wait for your call love
the call never came
ready to fall up
ready to claim
and im ready for it all love
ready for the pain
meet under sun and
meet me again
in the rain
in the rain
in the rain
the rain

verse 2
behind the walls love
im trying to change
and im ready for it all love
im ready for the change
meet me in blue sky
meet me again
in the rain
the rain
in the rain
the rain
