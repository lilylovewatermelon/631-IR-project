is my life
not all that i thought it would be
is it simply ordinary
oh is it far from all my fantasies
i lie awake lie awake
i lie awake at night and brood poor you
about the things i never do oh no
and how im missing out on love and truth

chorus
oh love and truth
why are they so hard to achieve to achieve
oh love and truth
well theyre such hot commodities
but come in such small quantities
oh love and truth where are you
oh where are you

instrumental break

verse 2
i dance ashoop shoop
i go out on the town and dance ashoop shoop
i go and try to find romance smooch smooch
but all i come home is with empty hands
oh boo hoo hoo
oh no no no no no no no
oh chachagrin chagrin
oh all i really want is love and truth

oh love and truth
why is it that i cannot find it sweet delights
oh love and truth
well if everything was up to me
well id make sure that there was plenty
of love and truth
love and truth where are you
oh where are you

outro
oh oh love and truth
oh oh where are you
oh oh where are you5embed"
