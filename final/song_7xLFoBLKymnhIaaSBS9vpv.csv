waiting for the manna coming from the west
barren is her bosom empty as her eyes
death a certain harvest scattered from the skies

skin and bones is creeping doesnt know hes dead
ancient eyes are peeping from his infant head
politicians argue sharpening their knives
drawing up their bargains trading baby lives

chorus
ivory madonna dying in the dust
waiting for the manna coming from the west

hear the bells are ringing christmas on its way
hear the angels singing what is that they say
eat and drink rejoicing joy is hear to stay
jesus son of mary is born again today
