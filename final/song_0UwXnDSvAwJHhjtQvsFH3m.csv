the blue light spills like oceans
we smile and let it in
it cures us of our questions
like hoods on peregrine

prechorus
knowledge locked in a tower
barons will hold the key
but if knowledge is power
know this is tyranny
all were asking for is whats ours

chorus 1
you think theyre selling you truth
truth is theyre selling you out
the truths theyre selling you out

verse 2
the black ink fuels our notions
that all the facts are in
it cures us of our questions
like hoods on peregrine

prechorus
knowledge locked in a tower
barons will hold the key
but if knowledge is power
know this is tyranny
all were asking for
all were asking for is whats ours
see thrice liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likechorus 2
you think theyre selling you truth
but theyre just selling you

bridge
and if we keep buying in
the line between lies and truth
will wear paper thin
paper thin

chorus 1
you think theyre selling you truth
the truth is theyre selling you outembed"
