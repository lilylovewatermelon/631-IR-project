well now ive found myself
i wish i was someone else
my hands are stained with love
wish i could take it away

i heal behind the shell
in time the pain will melt
my heart is stained with love
i wish i could fake it

chorus
i gave my life away
theres nothing left to say
i gave my life away
you take it in your own way
you take it in your own way

verse 2
my selfish enemy
still has the best of me
empty and feeling numb
wish i could take it away

i cant control the need
too weak to not concede
i wish i was deaf and dumb
wish i could fake it

i gave my life away
theres nothing left to say
i gave my life away
you take it in your own way

i gave my life away
theres nothing left to say
i gave my life away
you take it in your own way

bridge
i cant pretend were the same
i cant pretend were the same
i cant pretend were the same

and now i find myself
wish i was someone else
my hands are stained with love
wish i could fake

chorus
i gave my life away
theres nothing left to say
i gave my life away
you take it in your own way
i gave my life away
theres nothing left to say
i gave my life away
you take it in your own way

outro
you take it in your own way
you take it in your own way
you take it in your own way
you take it in your own wayembed"
