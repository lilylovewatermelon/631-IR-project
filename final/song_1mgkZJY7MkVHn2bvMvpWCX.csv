put our lives on
hold and meet some
where inside of the world
i would meet you
would you meet me

2 3 4

on a park bench
on a skyscrape
on a mountain
oh yeah whatever it takes
i would meet you
would you meet me

im glad to say that weve met
but im sad to say that the circumstances werent
on our side

so go on
go on be your own
go on be your own star

what if we could
where would we go
if it felt right
would you want me to know
i would meet you
would you meet me
see blue october liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeits like a last chance
for a first dance
youre a sunrise
cant somehow exist
i would meet you
would you meet me

im glad to say that weve met
but im sad to say that the circumstances werent
on our side

so go on
go on be your own
go on be your own star

a superstar in my eyes
in my eyes

look in my eyes
just look in my eyes
my eyes
my eyes

what if we could
put our lives on
hold and meet some
where inside of the world
i would meet you
would you meet me
on a park bench
on a skyscrape
on a mountain
oh yeah whatever it takes
i would meet you
would you meet me

god i would
god i would
i would meet you
would you meet me

i would meet you
i would meet you
i would meet youembed"
