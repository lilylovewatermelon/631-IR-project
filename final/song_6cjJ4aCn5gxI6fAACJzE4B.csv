bright lights shine right through me
ghostly figures playing chess for money
lonely fingers bittersweet and ugly
backwards vs cover all the honey

chorus
you will never be free
you are all you can see

verse 2
your veins run right through me
awkward encounters at our favorite movies
laugh at all your jokes when youre not even funny
visit all the bars when its nice and sunny

chorus
you will never be free
you are all you can seeyou might also likeembed"
