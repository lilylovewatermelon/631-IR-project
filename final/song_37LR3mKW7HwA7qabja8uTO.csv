i lost perspective of who i was i hit the wall
i knew that it would take a lot but it took it all
no you dont come this far to turn around
covered too many miles
no you dont get this close to breaking out
just to close your eyes

chorus
while the world sleeps under my feet tonight
im chasing myself in the sky
while the world sleeps under my feet tonight
ill be up here learning to fly
when you love what you cant let go
and your heart it already knows
sure itll hurt but its worth every burn
cause one day youll get home
still it feels like i am always on the red eye

verse 2
this time around its not even about getting paid
im just an addict for the moment when the magic is made
when you are who you are who you really are
it can put you through hell
spend a day in the skin that you want to live in
and see how it feels
you might also likechorus
while the world sleeps under my feet tonight
im chasing myself in the sky
while the world sleeps under my feet tonight
ill be up here learning to fly
when you love what you cant let go
and your heart it already knows
sure itll hurt but its worth every burn
cause one day youll get home
still it feels like i am always on the red
feels like i am always on the red eye

bridge
finding myself these days
looking down from the window seat
im counting lights on houses
when i should be counting sheep
truth is that i cant complain
ill do it over and over again
and over again

chorus
while the world sleeps under my feet tonight
im chasing myself in the sky
while the world sleeps under my feet tonight
ill be up here learning to fly
while the world sleeps under my feet tonight
im chasing myself in the sky
while the world sleeps under my feet tonight
ill be up here learning to fly
when you love what you cant let go
and your heart it already knows
sure itll hurt but its worth every burn
cause one day youll get home
still it feels like i am always on the red
feels like i am always on the red eyeembed"
