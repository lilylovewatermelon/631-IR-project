pardon me i dont mean to pry
i saw the tears falling from your eyes and i thought
youre too pretty not to wear a smile
hope you dont mind if i sit down for awhile

chorus
cause i want tequila little time with you
a little salt and a lime will do
hey bar man will you bring us two
i want tequila little time with you
talkin it all out
seein what youre all about
i hope youre wantin tequila little time with me too

verse 2
we dont have to talk about the past
heres to moving forward and not looking back
little later we can take it to the dance floor
but until then lets order a couple more

chorus
cause i want tequila little time with you
a little salt and a lime will do
hey bar man will you bring us two
i want tequila little time with you
talkin it all out
seein what youre all about
i hope youre wantin tequila little time with me too
