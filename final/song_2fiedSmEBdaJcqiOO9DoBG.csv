2fiedSmEBdaJcqiOO9DoBG,Michael's Christmas Greeting - Hidden Track,Michael Bubl√©,7uVimUILdzSZG4KKKWToq0,"7 contributorsevangeline a tale of acadie lyricsthis is the forest primeval the murmuring pines and the hemlocks
bearded with moss and in garments green indistinct in the twilight
stand like druids of eld with voices sad and prophetic
stand like harpers hoar with beards that rest on their bosoms
loud from its rocky caverns the deepvoiced neighboring ocean
speaks and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest

this is the forest primeval but where are the hearts that beneath it
leaped like the roe when he hears in the woodland the voice of the huntsman
where is the thatchroofed village the home of acadian farmers
men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands
darkened by shadows of earth but reflecting an image of heaven
waste are those pleasant farms and the farmers forever departed
scattered like dust and leaves when the mighty blasts of october
seize them and whirl them aloft and sprinkle them far oer the ocean
naught but tradition remains of the beautiful village of grandpre

ye who believe in affection that hopes and endures and is patient
ye who believe in the beauty and strength of womans devotion
list to the mournful tradition still sung by the pines of the forest
list to a tale of love in acadie home of the happy


part the first

i
in the acadian land on the shores of the basin of minas
distant secluded still the little village of grandpre
lay in the fruitful valley vast meadows stretched to the eastward
giving the village its name and pasture to flocks without number
dikes that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant
shut out the turbulent tides but at stated seasons the floodgates
opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will oer the meadows
west and south there were fields of flax and orchards and cornfields
spreading afar and unfenced oer the plain and away to the northward
blomidon rose and the forests old and aloft on the mountains
seafogs pitched their tents and mists from the mighty atlantic
looked on the happy valley but neer from their station descended
there in the midst of its farms reposed the acadian village
strongly built were the houses with frames of oak and of chestnut
such as the peasants of normandy built in the reign of the henries
thatched were the roofs with dormerwindows and gables projecting
over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway
there in the tranquil evenings of summer when brightly the sunset
lighted the village street and gilded the vanes on the chimneys
matrons and maidens sat in snowwhite caps and in kirtles
scarlet and blue and green with distaffs spinning the golden
flax for the gossiping looms whose noisy shuttles within doors
mingled their sound with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens
solemnly down the street came the parish priest and the children
paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them
reverend walked he among them and up rose matrons and maidens
hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome
then came the laborers home from the field and serenely the sun sank
down to his rest and twilight prevailed anon from the belfry
softly the angelus sounded and over the roofs of the village
columns of pale blue smoke like clouds of incense ascending
rose from a hundred hearths the homes of peace and contentment
thus dwelt together in love these simple acadian farmers
dwelt in the love of god and of man alike were they free from
fear that reigns with the tyrant and envy the vice of republics
neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows
but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners
there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance
somewhat apart from the village and nearer the basin of minas
benedict bellefontaine the wealthiest farmer of grandpre
dwelt on his goodly acres and with him directing his household
gentle evangeline lived his child and the pride of the village
stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters
hearty and hale was he an oak that is covered with snowflakes
white as the snow were his locks and his cheeks as brown as the oakleaves
fair was she to behold that maiden of seventeen summers
black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside
black yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses
sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows
when in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide
flagons of homebrewed ale ah fair in sooth was the maiden
fairer was she when on sunday morn while the bell from its turret
sprinkled with holy sounds the air as the priest with his hyssop
sprinkles the congregation and scatters blessings upon them
down the long street she passed with her chaplet of beads and her missal
wearing her norman cap and her kirtle of blue and the earrings
brought in the olden time from france and since as an heirloom
handed down from mother to child through long generations
but a celestial brightnessa more ethereal beauty
shone on her face and encircled her form when after confession
homeward serenely she walked with gods benediction upon her
when she had passed it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music

firmly builded with rafters of oak the house of the farmer
stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea and a shady
sycamore grew by the door with a woodbine wreathing around it
rudely carved was the porch with seats beneath and a footpath
led through an orchard wide and disappeared in the meadow
under the sycamoretree were hives overhung by a penthouse
such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside
built oer a box for the poor or the blessed image of mary
farther down on the slope of the hill was the well with its mossgrown
bucket fastened with iron and near it a trough for the horses
shielding the house from storms on the north were the barns and the farmyard
there stood the broadwheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows
there were the folds for the sheep and there in his feathered seraglio
strutted the lordly turkey and crowed the cock with the selfsame
voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent peter
bursting with hay were the barns themselves a village in each one
far oer the gable projected a roof of thatch and a staircase
under the sheltering eaves led up to the odorous cornloft
there too the dovecot stood with its meek and innocent inmates
murmuring ever of love while above in the variant breezes
numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation
thus at peace with god and the world the farmer of grandpre
lived on his sunny farm and evangeline governed his household
many a youth as he knelt in the church and opened his missal
fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion
happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment
many a suitor came to her door by the darkness befriended
and as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps
knew not which beat the louder his heart or the knocker of iron
or at the joyous feast of the patron saint of the village
bolder grew and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered
hurried words of love that seemed a part of the music
but among all who came young gabriel only was welcome
gabriel lajeunesse the son of basil the blacksmith
who was a mighty man in the village and honored of all men
for since the birth of time throughout all ages and nations
has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people
basil was benedicts friend their children from earliest childhood
grew up together as brother and sister and father felician
priest and pedagogue both in the village had taught them their letters
out of the selfsame book with the hymns of the church and the plainsong
but when the hymn was sung and the daily lesson completed
swiftly they hurried away to the forge of basil the blacksmith
there at the door they stood with wondering eyes to behold him
take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything
nailing the shoe in its place while near him the tire of the cartwheel
lay like a fiery snake coiled round in a circle of cinders
oft on autumnal eves when without in the gathering darkness
bursting with light seemed the smithy through every cranny and crevice
warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows
and as its panting ceased and the sparks expired in the ashes
merrily laughed and said they were nuns going into the chapel
oft on sledges in winter as swift as the swoop of the eagle
down the hillside bounding they glided away oer the meadow
oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters
seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone which the swallow
brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings
lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow
thus passed a few swift years and they no longer were children
he was a valiant youth and his face like the face of the morning
gladdened the earth with its light and ripened through into action
she was a woman now with the heart and hopes of a woman
sunshine of saint eulalie was she called for that was the sunshine
which as the farmers believed would load their orchards with apples
she too would bring to her husbands house delight and abundance
filling it full of love and the ruddy faces of children

now had the season returned when the nights grow colder and longer
and the retreating sun the sign of the scorpion enters
birds of passage sailed through the leaden air from the icebound
desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands
harvests were gathered in and wild with the winds of september
wrestled the trees of the forest as jacob of old with the angel
all the signs foretold a winter long and inclement
bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey
till the hives overflowed and the indian hunters asserted
cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes
such was the advent of autumn then followed that beautiful season
called by the pious acadian peasants the summer of allsaints
filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light and the landscape
lay as if newcreated in all the freshness of childhood
peace seemed to reign upon earth and the restless heart of the ocean
was for a moment consoled all sounds were in harmony blended
voices of children at play the crowing of cocks in the farmyards
whir of wings in the drowsy air and the cooing of pigeons
all were subdued and low as the murmurs of love and the great sun
looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him
while arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow
bright with the sheen of the dew each glittering tree of the forest
flashed like the planetree the persian adorned with mantles and jewels

now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness
day with its burden and heat had departed and twilight descending
brought back the evening star to the sky and the herds to the homestead
pawing the ground they came and resting their necks on each other
and with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening
foremost bearing the bell evangelines beautiful heifer
proud of her snowwhite hide and the ribbon that waved from her collar
quietly paced and slow as if conscious of human affection
then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside
where was their favorite pasture behind them followed the watchdog
patient full of importance and grand in the pride of his instinct
walking from side to side with a lordly air and superbly
waving his bushy tail and urging forward the stragglers
regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept their protector
when from the forest at night through the starry silence the wolves howled
late with the rising moon returned the wains from the marshes
laden with briny hay that filled the air with its odor
cheerily neighed the steeds with dew on their manes and their fetlocks
while aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles
painted with brilliant dyes and adorned with tassels of crimson
nodded in bright array like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms
patiently stood the cows meanwhile and yielded their udders
unto the milkmaids hand whilst loud and in regular cadence
into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended
lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farmyard
echoed back by the barns anon they sank into stillness
heavily closed with a jarring sound the valves of the barndoors
rattled the wooden bars and all for a season was silent

indoors warm by the widemouthed fireplace idly the farmer
sat in his elbowchair and watched how the flames and the smokewreaths
struggled together like foe in a burning city behind him
nodding and mocking along the wall with gestures fantastic
darted his own huge shadow and vanished away into darkness
faces clumsily carved in oak on the back of his armchair
laughed in the flickering light and the pewter plates on the dresser
caught and reflected the flame as shields of armies the sunshine
fragments of song the old man sang and carols of christmas
such as at home in the olden time his fathers before him
sang in their norman orchards and bright burgundian vineyards
close at her fathers side was the gentle evangeline seated
spinning flax for the loom that stood in the corner behind her
silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle
while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe
followed the old mans song and united the fragments together
as in a church when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases
footfalls are heard in the aisles or words of the priest at the altar
so in each pause of the song with measured motion the clock clicked

thus as they sat there were footsteps heard and suddenly lifted
sounded the wooden latch and the door swung back on its hinges
benedict knew by the hobnailed shoes it was basil the blacksmith
and by her beating heart evangeline knew who was with him
welcome the farmer exclaimed as their footsteps paused on the threshold
welcome basil my friend come take thy place on the settle
close by the chimneyside which is always empty without thee
take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco
never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling
smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams
round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes
then with a smile of content thus answered basil the blacksmith
taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside
benedict bellefontaine thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad
ever in cheerfullest mood art thou when others are filled with
gloomy forebodings of ill and see only ruin before them
happy art thou as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe
pausing a moment to take the pipe that evangeline brought him
and with a coal from the embers had lighted he slowly continued
four days now are passed since the english ships at their anchors
ride in the gaspereaus mouth with their cannon pointed against us
what their design may be is unknown but all are commanded
on the morrow to meet in the church where his majestys mandate
will be proclaimed as law in the land alas in the mean time
many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people
then made answer the farmerperhaps some friendlier purpose
brings these ships to our shores perhaps the harvests in england
by untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted
and from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children
not so thinketh the folk in the village said warmly the blacksmith
shaking his head as in doubt then heaving a sigh he continued
louisburg is not forgotten nor beau sejour nor port royal
many already have fled to the forest and lurk on its outskirts
waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of tomorrow
arms have been taken from us and warlike weapons of all kinds
nothing is left but the blacksmiths sledge and the scythe of the mower
then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer
safer are we unarmed in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields
safer within these peaceful dikes besieged by the ocean
than our fathers in forts besieged by the enemys cannon
fear no evil my friend and tonight may no shadow of sorrow
fall on this house and hearth for this is the night of the contract
built are the house and the barn the merry lads of the village
strongly have built them and well and breaking the glebe round about them
filled the barn with hay and the house with food for a twelvemonth
rene leblanc will be here anon with his papers and inkhorn
shall we not then be glad and rejoice in the joy of our children
as apart by the window she stood with her hand in her lovers
blushing evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken
and as they died on his lips the worthy notary entered

iii

bent like a laboring oar that toils in the surf of the ocean
bent but not broken by age was the form of the notary public
shocks of yellow hair like the silken floss of the maize hung
over his shoulders his forehead was high and glasses with horn bows
sat astride on his nose with a look of wisdom supernal
father of twenty children was he and more than a hundred
childrens children rode on his knee and heard his great watch tick
four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive
suffering much in an old french fort as the friend of the english
now though warier grown without all guile or suspicion
ripe in wisdom was he but patient and simple and childlike
he was beloved by all and most of all by the children
for he told them tales of the loupgarou in the forest
and of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses
and of the white letiche the ghost of a child who unchristened
died and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children
and how on christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable
and how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell
and of the marvellous powers of fourleaved clover and horsehoes
with whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village
then up rose from his seat by the fireside basil the blacksmith
knocked from his pipe the ashes and slowly extending his right hand
father leblanc he exclaimed thou hast heard the talk in the village
and perchance canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand
then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public
gossip enough have i heard in sooth yet am never the wiser
and what their errand may be i know not better than others
yet am i not of those who imagine some evil intention
brings them here for we are at peace and why then molest us
gods name shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith
must we in all things look for the how and the why and the wherefore
daily injustice is done and might is the right of the strongest
but without heeding his warmth continued the notary public
man is unjust but god is just and finally justice
triumphs and well i remember a story that often consoled me
when as a captive i lay in the old french fort at port royal
this was the old mans favorite tale and he loved to repeat it
when his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them
once in an ancient city whose name i no longer remember
raised aloft on a column a brazen statue of justice
stood in the public square upholding the scales in its left hand
and in its right a sword as an emblem that justice presided
over the laws of the land and the hearts and homes of the people
even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance
having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them
but in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted
might took the place of right and the weak were oppressed and the mighty
ruled with an iron rod then it chanced in a noblemans palace
that a necklace of pearls was lost and erelong a suspicion
fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the household
she after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold
patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of justice
as to her father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended
lo oer the city a tempest rose and the bolts of the thunder
smote the statue of bronze and hurled in wrath from its left hand
down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance
and in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie
into whose claybuilt walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven
silenced but not convinced when the story was ended the blacksmith
stood like a man who fain would speak but findeth no language
all his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face as the vapors
freeze in fantastic shapes on the windowpanes in the winter

then evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table
filled till it overflowed the pewter tankard with homebrewed
nutbrown ale that was famed for its strength in the village of grandpre
while from his pocket the notary drew his papers and inkhorn
wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties
naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle
orderly all things proceeded and duly and well were completed
and the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin
then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table
three times the old mans fee in solid pieces of silver
and the notary rising and blessing the bride and the bridegroom
lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare
wiping the foam from his lip he solemnly bowed and departed
while in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside
till evangeline brought the draughtboard out of its corner
soon was the game begun in friendly contention the old men
laughed at each lucky hit or unsuccessful manoeuver
laughed when a man was crowned or a breach was made in the kingrow
meanwhile apart in the twilight gloom of a windows embrasure
sat the lovers and whispered together beholding the moon rise
over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows
silently one by one in the infinite meadows of heaven
blossomed the lovely stars the forgetmenots of the angels

thus passed the evening away anon the bell from the belfry
rang out the hour of nine the village curfew and straightway
rose the guests and departed and silence reigned in the household
many a farewell word and sweet good night on the doorstep
lingered long in evangelines heart and filled it with gladness
carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearthstone
and on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer
soon with a soundless step the foot of evangeline followed
up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness
lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden
silent she passed the hall and entered the door of her chamber
simple that chamber was with its curtains of white and its clothespress
ample and high on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded
linen and woollen stuffs by the hand of evangeline woven
this was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage
better than flocks and herds being proofs of her skill as a housewife
soon she extinguished her lamp for the mellow and radiant moonlight
streamed through the windows and lighted the room till the heart of the maiden
swelled and obeyed its power like the tremulous tides of the ocean
ah she was fair exceeding fair to behold as she stood with
naked snowwhite feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber
little she dreamed that below among the trees of the orchard
waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow
yet were her thoughts of him and at times a feeling of sadness
passed oer her soul as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight
flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment
and as she gazed from the window she saw serenely the moon pass
forth from the folds of a cloud and one star follow her footsteps
as out of abrahams tent young ishmael wandered with hagar

iv

pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of grandpre
pleasantly gleamed in the soft sweet air the basin of minas
where the ships with their wavering shadows were riding at anchor
life had long been astir in the village and clamorous labor
knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning
now from the country around from the farms and neighboring hamlets
came in their holiday dresses the blithe acadian peasants
many a glad good morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk
made the bright air brighter as up from the numerous meadows
where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward
group after group appeared and joined or passed on the highway
long ere noon in the village all sounds of labor were silenced
thronged were the streets with people and noisy groups at the housedoors
sat in the cheerful sun and rejoiced and gossiped together
every house was an inn where all were welcomed and feasted
for with this simple people who lived like brothers together
all things were held in common and what one had was anothers
yet under benedicts roof hospitality seemed more abundant
for evangeline stood among the guests of her father
bright was her face with smiles and words of welcome and gladness
fell from her beautiful lips and blessed the cup as she gave it

under the open sky in the odorous air of the orchard
bending with golden fruit was spread the feast of betrothal
there in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated
there good benedict sat and sturdy basil the blacksmith
not far withdrawn from these by the ciderpress and the beehives
michael the fiddler was placed with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats
shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snowwhite
hair as it waved in the wind and the jolly face of the fiddler
glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers
gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle
tous les bourgeois de chartres and le carillon de dunkerque
and anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music
merrily merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances
under the orchardtrees and down the path to the meadows
old folk and young together and children mingled among them
fairest of all the maids was evangeline benedicts daughter
noblest of all the youths was gabriel son of the blacksmith

so passed the morning away and lo with a summons sonorous
sounded the bell from its tower and over the meadows a drum beat
thronged erelong was the church with men without in the churchyard
waited the women they stood by the graves and hung on the headstones
garlands of autumnleaves and evergreens fresh from the forest
then came the guard from the ships and marching proudly among them
entered the sacred portal with loud and dissonant clangor
echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement
echoed a moment only and slowly the ponderous portal
closed and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers
then uprose their commander and spake from the steps of the altar
holding aloft in his hands with its seals the royal commission
you are convened this day he said by his majestys orders
clement and kind has he been but how you have answered his kindness
let your own hearts reply to my natural make and my temper
painful the task is i do which to you i know must be grievous
yet must i bow and obey and deliver the will of our monarch
namely that all your lands and dwellings and cattle of all kinds
forfeited be to the crown and that you yourselves from this province
be transported to other lands god grant you may dwell there
ever as faithful subjects a happy and peaceable people
prisoners now i declare you for such is his majestys pleasure
as when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer
suddenly gathers a storm and the deadly sling of the hailstones
beats down the farmers corn in the field and shatters his windows
hiding the sun and strewing the ground with thatch from the houseroofs
bellowing fly the herds and seek to break their enclosures
so on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker
silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder and then rose
louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger
and by one impulse moved they madly rushed to the doorway
vain was the hope of escape and cries and fierce imprecations
rang through the house of prayer and high oer the heads of the others
rose with his arms uplifted the figure of basil the blacksmith
as on a stormy sea a spar is tossed by the billows
flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted
down with the tyrants of england we never have sworn them allegiance
death to these foreign soldiers who seize on our homes and our harvests
more he fain would have said but the merciless hand of a soldier
smote him upon the mouth and dragged him down to the pavement

in the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention
lo the door of the chancel opened and father felician
entered with serious mien and ascended the steps of the altar
raising his reverend hand with a gesture he awed into silence
all that clamorous throng and thus he spake to his people
deep were his tones and solemn in accents measured and mournful
spake he as after the tocsins alarum distinctly the clock strikes
what is this that ye do my children what madness has seized you
forty years of my life have i labored among you and taught you
not in word alone but in deed to love one another
is this the fruit of my toils of my vigils and prayers and privations
have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness
this is the house of the prince of peace and would you profane it
thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred
lo where the crucified christ from his cross is gazing upon you
see in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion
hark how those lips still repeat the prayer o father forgive them
let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us
let us repeat it now and say o father forgive them 
few were his words of rebuke but deep in the hearts of his people
sank they and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak
and they repeated his prayer and said o father forgive them

then came the evening service the tapers gleamed from the altar
fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded
not with their lips alone but their hearts and the ave maria
sang they and fell on their knees and their souls with devotion translated
rose on the ardor of prayer like elijah ascending to heaven

meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill and on all sides
wandered wailing from house to house the women and children
long at her fathers door evangeline stood with her right hand
shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun that descending
lighted the village street with mysterious splendor and roofed each
peasants cottage with golden thatch and emblazoned its windows
long within had been spread the snowwhite cloth on the table
there stood the wheaten loaf and the honey fragrant with wildflowers
there stood the tankard of ale and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy
and at the head of the board the great armchair of the farmer
thus did evangeline wait at her fathers door as the sunset
threw the long shadows of trees oer the broad ambrosial meadows
ah on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen
and from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended
charity meekness love and hope and forgiveness and patience
then allforgetful of self she wandered into the village
cheering with looks and words the disconsolate hearts of the women
as oer the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed
urged by their household cares and the weary feet of their children
down sank the great red sun and in golden glimmering vapors
veiled the light of his face like the prophet descending from sinai
sweetly over the village the bell of the angelus sounded

meanwhile amid the gloom by the church evangeline lingered
all was silent within and in vain at the door and the windows
stood she and listened and looked till overcome by emotion
gabriel cried she aloud with tremulous voice but no answer
came from the graves of the dead nor the gloomier grave of the living
slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father
smouldered the fire on the hearth on the board stood the supper untasted
empty and drear was each room and haunted with phantoms of terror
sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber
in the dead of the night she heard the whispering rain fall
loud on the withered leaves of the sycamoretree by the window
keenly the lightning flashed and the voice of the echoing thunder
told her that god was in heaven and governed the world he created
then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of heaven
soothed was her troubled soul and she peacefully slumbered till morning

v

four times the sun had risen and set and now on the fifth day
cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farmhouse
soon oer the yellow fields in silent and mournful procession
came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the acadian women
driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the seashore
pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings
ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland
close at their sides their children ran and urged on the oxen
while in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings
thus to the gaspereaus mouth they hurried and there on the seabeach
piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants
all day long between theshore and the ships did the boats ply
all day long the wains came laboring down from the village
late in the afternoon when the sun was near to his setting
echoed far oer the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard
thither the women and children thronged on a sudden the churchdoors
opened and forth came the guard and marching in gloomy procession
followed the longimprisoned but patient acadian farmers
even as pilgrims who journey afar from their homes and their country
sing as they go and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn
so with songs on their lips the acadian peasants descended
down from the church to the shore amid their wives and their daughters
foremost the young men came and raising together their voices
sang they with tremulous lips a chant of the catholic missions
sacred heart of the saviour o inexhaustible fountain
fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience
then the old men as they marched and the women that stood by the wayside
joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them
mingled their notes therewith like voices of spirits departed

halfway down to the shore evangeline waited in silence
not overcome with grief but strong in the hour of affliction
calmly and sadly she waited until the procession approached her
and she beheld the face of gabriel pale with emotion
tears then filled her eyes and eagerly running to meet him
clasped she his hands and laid her head on his shoulder and whispered
gabriel be of good cheer for if we love one another
nothing in truth can harm us whatever mischances may happen
smiling she spake these words then suddenly paused for her father
saw she slowly advancing alas how changed was his aspect
gone was the glow from his cheek and the fire from his eye and his footstep
heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom
but with a smile and a sigh she clasped his neck and embraced him
speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not
thus to the gaspereaus mouth moved on that mournful procession

there disorder prevailed and the tumult and stir of embarking
busily plied the freighted boats and in the confusion
wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children
left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties
so unto separate ships were basil and gabriel carried
while in despair on the shore evangeline stood with her father
half the task was not done when the sun went down and the twilight
deepened and darkened around and in haste the refluent ocean
fled away from the shore and left the line of the sandbeach
covered with waifs of the tide with kelp and the slippery seaweed
farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons
like to a gypsy camp or a leaguer after a battle
all escape cut off by the sea and the sentinels near them
lay encamped for the night the houseless acadian farmers
back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean
dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles and leaving
inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors
then as the night descended the herds returned from their pastures
sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders
lowing they waited and long at the wellknown bars of the farmyard
waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milkmaid
silence reigned in the streets from the church no angelus sounded
rose no smoke from the roofs and gleamed no lights from the windows

but on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled
built of the driftwood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest
round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered
voices of women were heard and of men and the crying of children
onward from fire to fire as from hearth to hearth in his parish
wandered the faithful priest consoling and blessing and cheering
like unto shipwrecked paul on melitas desolate seashore
thus he approached the place where evangeline sat with her father
and in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man
haggard and hollow and wan and without either thought or emotion
een as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken
vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him
vainly offered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not
but with a vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering firelight
benedicite murmured the priest in tones of compassion
more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents
faltered and paused on his lips as the feet of a child on a threshold
hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow
silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden
raising his eyes full of tears to the silent stars that above them
moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals
then sat he down at her side and they wept together in silence

suddenly rose from the south a light as in autumn the bloodred
moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven and oer the horizon
titanlike stretches its hundred hands upon mountain and meadow
seizing the rocks and the rivers and piling huge shadows together
broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village
gleamed on the sky and the sea and the ships that lay in the roadstead
columns of shining smoke uprose and flashes of flame were
thrust through their folds and withdrawn like the quivering hands of a martyr
then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch and uplifting
whirled them aloft through the air at once from a hundred housetops
started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled

these things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard
speechless at first they stood then cried aloud in their anguish
we shall behold no more our homes in the village of grandpre
loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farmyards
thinking the day had dawned and anon the lowing of cattle
came on the evening breeze by the barking of dogs interrupted
then rose a sound of dread such as startles the sleeping encampments
far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the nebraska
when the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind
or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river
such was the sound that arose on the night as the herds and the horses
broke through their folds and fences and madly rushed oer the meadows

overwhelmed with the sight yet speechless the priest and the maiden
gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them
and as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion
lo from his seat he had fallen and stretched abroad on the seashore
motionless lay his form from which the soul had departed
slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head and the maiden
knelt at her fathers side and wailed aloud in her terror
then in a swoon she sank and lay with her head on his bosom
through the long night she lay in deep oblivious slumber
and when she woke from the trance she beheld a multitude near her
faces of friends she beheld that were mournfully gazing upon her
pallid with tearful eyes and looks of saddest compassion
still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape
reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her
and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses
then a familiar voice she heard as it said to the people
let us bury him here by the sea when a happier season
brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile
then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard
such were the words of the priest and there in haste by the seaside
having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches
but without bell or book they buried the farmer of grandpre
and as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow
lo with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation
solemnly answered the sea and mingled its roar with the dirges
twas the returning tide that afar from the waste of the ocean
with the first dawn of the day came heaving and hurrying landward
then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking
and with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor
leaving behind them the dead on the shore and the village in ruins


part the second

i

many a weary year had passed since the burning of grandpre
when on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed
bearing a nation with all its household gods into exile
exile without an end and without an example in story
far asunder on separate coasts the acadians landed
scattered were they like flakes of snow when the wind from the northeast
strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the banks of newfoundland
friendless homeless hopeless they wandered from city to city
from the cold lakes of the north to sultry southern savannas
from the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the father of waters
seizes the hills in his hands and drags them down to the ocean
deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth
friends they sought and homes and many despairing heartbroken
asked of the earth but a grave and no longer a friend nor a fireside
written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards
long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered
lowly and meek in spirit and patiently suffering all things
fair was she and young but alas before her extended
dreary and vast and silent the desert of life with its pathway
marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her
passions long extinguished and hopes long dead and abandoned
as the emigrants way oer the western desert is marked by
campfires long consumed and bones that bleach in the sunshine
something there was in her life incomplete imperfect unfinished
as if a morning of june with all its music and sunshine
suddenly paused in the sky and fading slowly descended
into the east again from whence it late had arisen
sometimes she lingered in towns till urged by the fever within her
urged by a restless longing the hunger and thirst of the spirit
she would commence again her endless search and endeavor
sometimes in churchyards strayed and gazed on the crosses and tombstones
sat by some nameless grave and thought that perhaps in its bosom
he was already at rest and she longed to slumber beside him
sometimes a rumor a hearsay an inarticulate whisper
came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward
sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him
but it was long ago in some faroff place or forgotten
gabriel lajeunesse they said o yes we have seen him
he was with basil the blacksmith and both have gone to the prairies
coureursdesbois are they and famous hunters and trappers
gabriel lajeunesse said others o yes we have seen him
he is a voyageur in the lowlands of louisiana
then would they say dear child why dream and wait for him longer
are there not other youths as fair as gabriel others
who have hearts as tender and true and spirits as loyal
here is baptiste leblanc the notarys son who has loved thee
many a tedious year come give him thy hand and be happy
thou art too fair to be left to braid st catherines tresses
then would evangeline answer serenely but sadly i cannot
whither my heart has gone there follows my hand and not elsewhere
for when the heart goes before like a lamp and illumines the pathway
many things are made clear that else lie hidden in darkness
thereupon the priest her friend and fatherconfessor
said with a smile o daughter thy god thus speaketh within thee
talk not of wasted affection affection never was wasted
if it enrich not the heart of another its waters returning
back to their springs like the rain shall fill them full of refreshment
that which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain
patience accomplish thy labor accomplish thy work of affection
sorrow and silence are strong and patient endurance is godlike
therefore accomplish thy labor of love till the heart is made godlike
purified strengthened perfected and rendered more worthy of heaven
cheered by the good mans words evangeline labored and waited
still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean
but with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered despair not
thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort
bleeding barefooted over the shards and thorns of existence
let me essay o muse to follow the wanderers footsteps
not through each devious path each changeful year of existence
but as a traveller follows a streamlets course through the valley
far from its margin at times and seeing the gleam of its water
here and there in some open space and at intervals only
then drawing nearer its banks through sylvan glooms that conceal it
though he behold it not he can hear its continuous murmur
happy at length if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet

ii

it was the month of may far down the beautiful river
past the ohio shore and past the mouth of the wabash
into the golden stream of the broad and swift mississippi
floated a cumbrous boat that was rowed by acadian boatmen
it was a band of exiles a raft as it were from the shipwrecked
nation scattered along the coast now floating together
bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune
men and women and children who guided by hope or by hearsay
sought for their kith and their kin among the fewacred farmers
on the acadian coast and the prairies of fair opelousas
with them evangeline went and her guide the father felician
onward oer sunken sands through a wilderness somber with forests
day after day they glided adown the turbulent river
night after night by their blazing fires encamped on its borders
now through rushing chutes among green islands where plumelike
cottontrees nodded their shadowy crests they swept with the current
then emerged into broad lagoons where silvery sandbars
lay in the stream and along the wimpling waves of their margin
shining with snowwhite plumes large flocks of pelicans waded
level the landscape grew and along the shores of the river
shaded by chinatrees in the midst of luxuriant gardens
stood the houses of planters with negrocabins and dovecots
they were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer
where through the golden coast and groves of orange and citron
sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward
they too swerved from their course and entering the bayou of plaquemine
soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters
which like a network of steel extended in every direction
over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress
met in a dusky arch and trailing mosses in midair
waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals
deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons
home to their roosts in the cedartrees returning at sunset
or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter
lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water
gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches
down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin
dreamlike and indistinct and strange were all things around them
and oer their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness
strange forebodings of ill unseen and that cannot be compassed
as at the tramp of a horses hoof on the turf of the prairies
far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa
so at the hoofbeats of fate with sad forebodings of evil
shrinks and closes the heart ere the stroke of doom has attained it
but evangelines heart was sustained by a vision that faintly
floated before her eyes and beckoned her on through the moonlight
it was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom
through those shadowy aisles had gabriel wandered before her
and every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer

then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen
and as a signal sound if others like them peradventure
sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew a blast on his bugle
wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang
breaking the seal of silence and giving tongues to the forest
soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music
multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance
over the watery floor and beneath the reverberant branches
but not a voice replied no answer came from the darkness
and when the echoes had ceased like a sense of pain was the silence
then evangeline slept but the boatmen rowed through the midnight
silent at times then singing familiar canadian boatsongs
such as they sang of old on their own acadian rivers
and through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert
far offindistinctas of wave or wind in the forest
mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator

thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades and before them
lay in the golden sun the lakes of the atchafalaya
waterlilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations
made by the passing oars and resplendent in beauty the lotus
lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen
faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms
and with the heat of noon and numberless sylvan islands
fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses
near to whose shores they glided along invited to slumber
soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended
under the boughs of wachita willows that grew by the margin
safely their boat was moored and scattered about on the greensward
tired with their midnight toil the weary travellers slumbered
over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar
swinging from its great arms the trumpetflower and the grapevine
hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of jacob
on whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending descending
were the swift hummingbirds that flitted from blossom to blossom
such was the vision evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it
filled was her heart with love and the dawn of an opening heaven
lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial

nearer and ever nearer among the numberless islands
darted a light swift boat that sped away oer the water
urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers
northward its prow was turned to the land of the bison and beaver
at the helm sat a youth with countenance thoughtful and careworn
dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow and a sadness
somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written
gabriel was it who weary with waiting unhappy and restless
sought in the western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow
swiftly they glided along close under the lee of the island
but by the opposite bank and behind a screen of palmettos
so that they saw not the boat where it lay concealed in the willows
and undisturbed by the dash of their oars and unseen were the sleepers
angel of god was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden
swiftly they glided away like the shade of a cloud on the prairie
after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance
as from a magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden
said with a sigh to the friendly priest o father felician
something says in my heart that near me gabriel wanders
is it a foolish dream an idle and vague superstition
or has an angel passed and revealed the truth to my spirit
then with a blush she added alas for my credulous fancy
unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning
but made answer the reverend man and he smiled as he answered
daughter thy words are not idle nor are they to me without meaning
feeling is deep and still and the word that floats on the surface
is as the tossing buoy that betrays where the anchor is hidden
therefore trust to thy heart and to what the world calls illusions
gabriel truly is near thee for not far away to the southward
on the banks of the teche are the towns of st maur and st martin
there the longwandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom
there the longabsent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold
beautiful is the land with its prairies and forests of fruittrees
under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens
bending above and resting its dome on the walls of the forest
they who dwell there have named it the eden of louisiana

with these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey
softly the evening came the sun from the western horizon
like a magician extended his golden wand oer the landscape
twinkling vapors arose and sky and water and forest
seemed all on fire at the touch and melted and mingled together
hanging between two skies a cloud with edges of silver
floated the boat with its dripping oars on the motionless water
filled was evangelines heart with inexpressible sweetness
touched by the magic spell the sacred fountains of feeling
glowed with the light of love as the skies and waters around her
then from a neighboring thicket the mockingbird wildest of singers
swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung oer the water
shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music
that the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen
plaintive at first were the tones and sad then soaring to madness
seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied bacchantes
single notes were then heard in sorrowful low lamentation
till having gathered them all he flung them abroad in derision
as when after a storm a gust of wind through the tree tops
shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches
with such a prelude as this and hearts that throbbed with emotion
slowly they entered the teche where it flows through the green opelousas
and through the amber air above the crest of the woodland
saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling
sounds of a horn they heard and the distant lowing of cattle

iii

near to the bank of the river oershadowed by oaks from whose branches
garlands of spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted
such as the druids cut down with golden hatchets at yuletide
stood secluded and still the house of the herdsman a garden
girdled it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms
filling the air with fragrance the house itself was of timbers
hewn from the cypresstree and carefully fitted together
large and low was the roof and on slender columns supported
rosewreathed vineencircled a broad and spacious veranda
haunt of the hummingbird and the bee extended around it
at each end of the house amid the flowers of the garden
stationed the dovecots were as loves perpetual symbol
scenes of endless wooing and endless contentions of rivals
silence reigned oer the place the line of shadow and sunshine
ran near the tops of the trees but the house itself was in shadow
and from its chimneytop ascending and slowly expanding
into the evening air a thin blue column of smoke rose
in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran a pathway
through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie
into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending
full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas
hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics
stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grapevines

just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie
mounted upon his horse with spanish saddle and stirrups
sat a herdsman arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin
broad and brown was the face that from under the spanish sombrero
gazed on the peaceful scene with the lordly look of its master
round about him were numberless herds of kine that were grazing
quietly in the meadows and breathing the vapory freshness
that uprose from the river and spread itself over the landscape
slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side and expanding
fully his broad deep chest he blew a blast that resounded
wildly and sweet and far through the still damp air of the evening
suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle
rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean
silent a moment they gazed then bellowing rushed oer the prairie
and the whole mass became a cloud a shade in the distance
then as the herdsman turned to the house through the gate of the garden
saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him
suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement and forward
rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder
when they beheld his face they recognized basil the blacksmith
hearty his welcome was as he led his guests to the garden
there in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer
gave they vent to their hearts and renewed their friendly embraces
laughing and weeping by turns or sitting silent and thoughtful
thoughtful for gabriel came not and now dark doubts and misgivings
stole oer the maidens heart and basil somewhat embarrassed
broke the silence and said if you came by the atchafalaya
how have you nowhere encountered my gabriels boat on the bayous
over evangelines face at the words of basil a shade passed
tears came into her eyes and she said with a tremulous accent
gone is gabriel gone and concealing her face on his shoulder
all her oerburdened heart gave way and she wept and lamented
then the good basil saidand his voice grew blithe as he said it
be of good cheer my child it is only today he departed
foolish boy he has left me alone with my herds and my horses
moody and restless grown and tried and troubled his spirit
could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence
thinking ever of thee uncertain and sorrowful ever
ever silent or speaking only of thee and his troubles
he at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens
tedious even to me that at length i bethought me and sent him
unto the town of adayes to trade for mules with the spaniards
thence he will follow the indian trails to the ozark mountains
hunting for furs in the forests on rivers trapping the beaver
therefore be of good cheer we will follow the fugitive lover
he is not far on his way and the fates and the streams are against him
up and away tomorrow and through the red dew of the morning
we will follow him fast and bring him back to his prison

then glad voices were heard and up from the banks of the river
borne aloft on his comrades arms came michael the fiddler
long under basils roof had he lived like a god on olympus
having no other care than dispensing music to mortals
far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle
long live michael they cried our brave acadian minstrel
as they bore him aloft in triumphal procession and straightway
father felician advanced with evangeline greeting the old man
kindly and oft and recalling the past while basil enraptured
hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips
laughing loud and long and embracing mothers and daughters
much they marvelled to see the wealth of the cidevant blacksmith
all his domains and his herds and his patriarchal demeanor
much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate
and of the prairies whose numberless herds were his who would take them
each one thought in his heart that he too would go and do likewise
thus they ascended the steps and crossing the airy veranda
entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil
waited his late return and they rested and feasted together

over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended
all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver
fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors
brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight
then from his station aloft at the head of the table the herdsman
poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion
lighting his pipe that was filled with sweet natchitoches tobacco
thus he spake to his guests who listened and smiled as they listened
welcome once more my friends who long have been friendless and homeless
welcome once more to a home that is better perchance than the old one
here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers
here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer
smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil as a keel through the water
all the year round the orangegroves are in blossom and grass grows
more in a single night than a whole canadian summer
here too numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies
here too lands may be had for the asking and forests of timber
with a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses
after your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests
no king george of england shall drive you away from your homesteads
burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle
speaking these words he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils
while his huge brown hand came thundering down on the table
so that the guests all started and father felician astounded
suddenly paused with a pinch of snuff halfway to his nostrils
but the brave basil resumed and his words were milder and gayer
only beware of the fever my friends beware of the fever
for it is not like that of our cold acadian climate
cured by wearing a spider hung round ones neck in a nutshell
then there were voices heard at the door and footsteps approaching
sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda
it was the neighboring creoles and small acadian planters
who had been summoned all to the house of basil the herdsman
merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors
friend clasped friend in his arms and they who before were as strangers
meeting in exile became straightway as friends to each other
drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together
but in the neighboring hall a strain of music proceeding
from the accordant strings of michaels melodious fiddle
broke up all further speech away like children delighted
all things forgotten beside they gave themselves to the maddening
whirl of the dizzy dance as it swept and swayed to the music
dreamlike with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments

meanwhile apart at the head of the hall the priest and the herdsman
sat conversing together of past and present and future
while evangeline stood like one entranced for within her
olden memories rose and loud in the midst of the music
heard she the sound of the sea and an irrepressible sadness
came oer her heart and unseen she stole forth into the garden
beautiful was the night behind the black wall of the forest
tipping its summit with silver arose the moon on the river
fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight
like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit
nearer and round about her the manifold flowers of the garden
poured out their souls in odors that were their prayers and confessions
unto the night as it went its way like a silent carthusian
fuller of fragrance than they and as heavy with shadows and nightdews
hung the heart of the maiden the calm and the magical moonlight
seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longings
as through the garden gate beneath the shade of the oaktrees
passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie
silent it lay with a silvery haze upon it and the fireflies
gleaming and floating away in mingled and infinite numbers
over her head the stars the thoughts of god in the heavens
shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship
save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple
as if a hand had appeared and written upon them upharsin
and the soul of the maiden between the stars and the fireflies
wandered alone and she cried o gabriel o my beloved
art thou so near unto me and yet i cannot behold thee
art thou so near unto me and yet thy voice does not reach me
ah how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie
ah how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me
ah how often beneath this oak returning from labor
thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers
when shall these eyes behold these arms be folded about thee
loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded
like a flute in the woods and anon through the neighboring thickets
farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence
patience whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness
and from the moonlit meadow a sigh responded tomorrow

bright rose the sun next day and all the flowers of the garden
bathed his shining feet with their tears and anointed his tresses
with the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal
farewell said the priest as he stood at the shadowy threshold
see that you bring us the prodigal son from his fasting and famine
and too the foolish virgin who slept when the bridegroom was coming
farewell answered the maiden and smiling with basil descended
down to the rivers brink where the boatmen already were waiting
thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness
swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them
blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert
not that day nor the next nor yet the day that succeeded
found they trace of his course in lake or forest or river
nor after many days had they found him but vague and uncertain
rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate country
till at the little inn of the spanish town of adayes
weary and worn they alighted and learned from the garrulous landlord
that on the day before with horses and guides and companions
gabriel left the village and took the road of the prairies

iv

far in the west there lies a desert land where the mountains
lift through perpetual snows their lofty and luminous summits
down from their jagged deep ravines where the gorge like a gateway
opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrants wagon
westward the oregon flows and the walleway and owyhee
eastward with devious course among the windriver mountains
through the sweetwater valley precipitate leaps the nebraska
and to the south from fontainequibout and the spanish sierras
fretted with sands and rocks and swept by the wind of the desert
numberless torrents with ceaseless sound descend to the ocean
like the great chords of a harp in loud and solemn vibrations
spreading between these streams are the wondrous beautiful prairies
billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine
bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas
over them wandered the buffalo herds and the elk and the roebuck
over them wandered the wolves and herds of riderless horses
fires that blast and blight and winds that are weary with travel
over them wander the scattered tribes of ishmaels children
staining the desert with blood and above their terrible wartrails
circles and sails aloft on pinions majestic the vulture
like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle
by invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens
here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders
here and there rise groves from the margins of swiftrunning rivers
and the grim taciturn bear the anchorite monk of the desert
climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brookside
and over all is the sky the clear and crystalline heaven
like the protecting hand of god inverted above them

into this wonderful land at the base of the ozark mountains
gabriel far had entered with hunters and trappers behind him
day after day with their indian guides the maiden and basil
followed his flying steps and thought each day to oertake him
sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his campfire
rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall
when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes
and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary
hope still guided them on as the magic fata morgana
showed them her lakes of light that retreated and vanished before them

once as they sat by their evening fire there silently entered
into the little camp an indian woman whose features
wore deep traces of sorrow and patience as great as her sorrow
she was a shawnee woman returning home to her people
from the faroff huntinggrounds of the cruel camanches
where her canadian husband a coureurdesbois had been murdered
touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome
gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them
on the buffalomeat and the venison cooked on the embers
but when their meal was done and basil and all his companions
worn with the long days march and the chase of the deer and the bison
stretched themselves on the ground and slept where the quivering firelight
flashed on their swarthy cheeks and their forms wrapped up in their blankets
then at the door of evangelines tent she sat and repeated
slowly with soft low voice and the charm of her indian accent
all the tale of her love with its pleasures and pains and reverses
much evangeline wept at the tale and to know that another
hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed
moved to the depths of her soul by pity and womans compassion
yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her
she in turn related her love and all its disasters
mute with wonder the shawnee sat and when she had ended
still was mute but at length as if a mysterious horror
passed through her brain she spake and repeated the tale of the mowis
mowis the bridegroom of snow who won and wedded a maiden
but when the morning came arose and passed from the wigwam
fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine
till she beheld him no more though she followed far into the forest
then in those sweet low tones that seemed like a weird incantation
told she the tale of the fair lilinau who was wooed by a phantom
that through the pines oer her fathers lodge in the hush of the twilight
breathed like the evening wind and whispered love to the maiden
till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest
and never more returned nor was seen again by her people
silent with wonder and strange surprise evangeline listened
to the soft flow of her magical words till the region around her
seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress
slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose
lighting the little tent and with a mysterious splendor
touching the sombre leaves and embracing and filling the woodland
with a delicious sound the brook rushed by and the branches
swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers
filled with the thoughts of love was evangelines heart but a secret
subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror
as the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow
it was no earthly fear a breath from the region of spirits
seemed to float in the air of night and she felt for a moment
that like the indian maid she too was pursuing a phantom
with this thought she slept and the fear and the phantom had vanished

early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee
said as they journeyed along on the western slope of these mountains
dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission
much he teaches the people and tells them of mary and jesus
loud laugh their hearts with joy and weep with pain as they hear him
then with a sudden and secret emotion evangeline answered
let us go to the mission for there good tidings await us
thither they turned their steeds and behind a spur of the mountains
just as the sun went down they heard a murmur of voices
and in a meadow green and broad by the bank of a river
saw the tents of the christians the tents of the jesuit mission
under a towering oak that stood in the midst of the village
knelt the black robe chief with his children a crucifix fastened
high on the trunk of the tree and overshadowed by grapevines
looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it
this was their rural chapel aloft through the intricate arches
of its aerial roof arose the chant of their vespers
mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches
silent with heads uncovered the travellers nearer approaching
knelt on the swarded floor and joined in the evening devotions
but when the service was done and the benediction had fallen
forth from the hands of the priest like seed from the hands of the sower
slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers and bade them
welcome and when they replied he smiled with benignant expression
hearing the homelike sounds of his mothertongue in the forest
and with words of kindness conducted them into his wigwam
there upon mats and skins they reposed and on cakes of the maizeear
feasted and slaked their thirst from the watergourd of the teacher
soon was their story told and the priest with solemnity answered
not six suns have risen and set since gabriel seated
on this mat by my side where now the maiden reposes
told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey
soft was the voice of the priest and he spake with an accent of kindness
but on evangelines heart fell his words as in winter the snowflakes
fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed
far to the north he has gone continued the priest but in autumn
when the chase is done will return again to the mission
then evangeline said and her voice was meek and submissive
let me remain with thee for my soul is sad and afflicted
so seemed it wise and well unto all and betimes on the morrow
mounting his mexican steed with his indian guides and companions
homeward basil returned and evangeline stayed at the mission

slowly slowly slowly the days succeeded each other
days and weeks and months and the fields of maize that were springing
green from the ground when a stranger she came now waving above her
lifted their slender shafts with leaves interlacing and forming
cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels
then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens
blushed at each bloodred ear for that betokened a lover
but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the cornfield
even the bloodred ear to evangeline brought not her lover
patience the priest would say have faith and thy prayer will be answered
look at this delicate plant that lifts its head from the meadow
see how its leaves all point to the north as true as the magnet
this is the compassflower that the finger of god has suspended
here on its fragile stock to direct the travellers journey
over the sealike pathless limitless waste of the desert
such in the soul of man is faith the blossoms of passion
gay and luxuriant flowers are brighter and fuller of fragrance
but they beguile us and lead us astray and their odor is deadly
only this humble plant can guide us here and hereafter
crown us with asphodel flowers that are wet with the dews of nepenthe

so came the autumn and passed and the winteryet gabriel came not
blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird
sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not
but on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted
sweeter than song of bird or hue or odor of blossom
far to the north and east it said in the michigan forests
gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the saginaw river
and with returning guides that sought the lakes of st lawrence
saying a sad farewell evangeline went from the mission
when over weary ways by long and perilous marches
she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests
found she the hunters lodge deserted and fallen to ruin

thus did the long sad years glide on and in seasons and places
divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden
now in the tents of grace of the meek moravian missions
now in the noisy camps and the battlefields of the army
now in secluded hamlets in towns and populous cities
like a phantom she came and passed away unremembered
fair was she and young when in hope began the long journey
faded was she and old when in disappointment it ended
each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty
leaving behind it broader and deeper the gloom and the shadow
then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray oer her forehead
dawn of another life that broke oer her earthly horizon
as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning

v

in that delightful land which is washed by the delawares waters
guarding in sylvan shades the name of penn the apostle
stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded
there all the air is balm and the peach is the emblem of beauty
and the streets still reecho the names of the trees of the forest
as if they fain would appease the dryads whose haunts they molested
there from the troubled sea had evangeline landed an exile
finding among the children of penn a home and a country
there old rene leblanc had died and when he departed
saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants
something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city
something that spake to her heart and made her no longer a stranger
and her ear was pleased with the thee and thou of the quakers
for it recalled the past the old acadian country
where all men were equal and all were brothers and sisters
so when the fruitless search the disappointed endeavor
ended to recommence no more upon earth uncomplaining
thither as leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps
as from a mountains top the rainy mists of the morning
roll away and afar we behold the landscape below us
sunillumined with shining rivers and cities and hamlets
so fell the mists from her mind and she saw the world far below her
dark no longer but all illumined with love and the pathway
which she had climbed so far lying smooth and fair in the distance
gabriel was not forgotten within her heart was his image
clothed in the beauty of love and youth as last she beheld him
only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence
into her thoughts of him time entered not for it was not
over him years had no power he was not changed but transfigured
he had become to her heart as one who is dead and not absent
patience and abnegation of self and devotion to others
this was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her
so was her love diffused but like to some odorous spices
suffered no waste nor loss though filling the air with aroma
other hope had she none nor wish in life but to follow
meekly with reverent steps the sacred feet of her saviour
thus many years she lived as a sister of mercy frequenting
lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city
where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight
where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected
night after night when the world was asleep as the watchman repeated
loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city
high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper
day after day in the gray of the dawn as slow through the suburbs
plodded the german farmer with flowers and fruits for the market
met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings

then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city
presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons
darkening the sun in their flight with naught in their craws but an acorn
and as the tides of the sea arise in the month of september
flooding some silver stream till it spreads to a lake in the meadow
so death flooded life and oerflowing its natural margin
spread to a brackish lake the silver stream of existence
wealth had no power to bribe nor beauty to charm the oppressor
but all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger
only alas the poor who had neither friends nor attendants
crept away to die in the almshouse home of the homeless
then in the suburbs it stood in the midst of meadows and woodlands
now the city surrounds it but still with its gateway and wicket
meek in the midst of splendor its humble walls seem to echo
softly the words of the lordthe poor ye always have with you
thither by night and by day came the sister of mercy the dying
looked up into her face and thought indeed to behold there
gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor
such as the artist paints oer the brows of saints and apostles
or such as hangs by night oer a city seen at a distance
unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial
into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter

thus on a sabbath morn through the streets deserted and silent
wending her quiet way she entered the door of the almshouse
sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden
and she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them
that the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty
then as she mounted the stairs to the corridors cooled by the east wind
distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of christ church
while intermingled with these across the meadows were wafted
sounds of psalms that were sung by the swedes in their church at wicaco
soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit
something within her said at length thy trials are ended
and with light in her looks she entered the chambers of sickness
noiselessly moved about the assiduous careful attendants
moistening the feverish lip and the aching brow and in silence
closing the sightless eyes of the dead and concealing their faces
where on their pallets they lay like drifts of snow by the roadside
many a languid head upraised as evangeline entered
turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed for her presence
fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison
and as she looked around she saw how death the consoler
laying his hand upon many a heart had healed it forever
many familiar forms had disappeared in the nighttime
vacant their places were or filled already by strangers

suddenly as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder
still she stood with her colorless lips apart while a shudder
ran through her frame and forgotten the flowerets dropped from her fingers
and from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning
then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish
that the dying heard it and started up from their pillows
on the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man
long and thin and gray were the locks that shaded his temples
but as he lay in the morning light his face for a moment
seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood
so are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying
hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever
as if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals
that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over
motionless senseless dying he lay and his spirit exhausted
seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness
darkness of slumber and death forever sinking and sinking
then through those realms of shade in multiplied reverberations
heard he that cry of pain and through the hush that succeeded
whispered a gentle voice in accents tender and saintlike
gabriel o my beloved and died away into silence
then he beheld in a dream once more the home of his childhood
green acadian meadows with sylvan rivers among them
village and mountain and woodlands and walking under their shadow
as in the days of her youth evangeline rose in his vision
tears came into his eyes and as slowly he lifted his eyelids
vanished the vision away but evangeline knelt by his bedside
vainly he strove to whisper her name for the accents unuttered
died on his lips and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken
vainly he strove to rise and evangeline kneeling beside him
kissed his dying lips and laid his head on her bosom
sweet was the light of his eyes but it suddenly sank into darkness
as when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement

all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow
all the aching of heart the restless unsatisfied longing
all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience
and as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom
meekly she bowed her own and murmured father i thank thee


still stands the forest primeval but far away from its shadow
side by side in their nameless graves the lovers are sleeping
under the humble walls of the little catholic churchyard
in the heart of the city they lie unknown and unnoticed
daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them
thousands of throbbing hearts where theirs are at rest and forever
thousands of aching brains where theirs no longer are busy
thousands of toiling hands where theirs have ceased from their labors
thousands of weary feet where theirs have completed their journey

still stands the forest primeval but under the shade of its branches
dwells another race with other customs and language
only along the shore of the mournful and misty atlantic
linger a few acadian peasants whose fathers from exile
wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom
in the fishermans cot the wheel and the loom are still busy
maidens still wear their norman caps and their kirtles of homespun
and by the evening fire repeat evangelines story
while from its rocky caverns the deepvoiced neighboring ocean
speaks and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest3embed"
