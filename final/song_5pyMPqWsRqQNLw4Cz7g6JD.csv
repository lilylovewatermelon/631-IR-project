well thats true thats why we never have no beef
and so i washed off the soap and brushed the gold teeth
change my clothes spark my hair
i busted out the brand new gucci underwear
and for all the little girls that i might take home we have
the johnsons baby powder and the polo cologne
fresh dressed like a million dollas
i wore the high tops and pop the flat colla
stepped out the crib stopped short oh no

den me dilly dally we run into an alley
got me busted into me old girl shaniqua from the valley

so i said whats up girl you look like shit

shaniqua tells her momma you all better hide tonight
because her mom stepped up from behind
hit her in the face stabbed her in the eye
punched her in the belly stepped on her feet
slammed the girl on the hard concrete
oohhhh bitch was strong mommas gone
something seemed wrong now what is going on
i tried to bust it up i said stop it leave her
she said if i cant have you she cant eitherrrrrrrrr
she grabbed me hard around my cock
i broke out like i had the chicken pox
momma gave chase she caught us quickly
she put her fucking finger in the face of little jimmy
and said why dont you give me some play
