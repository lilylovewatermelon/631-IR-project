there was a time when i was
in a hurry as you are
i was like you
there was a day when i just
had to tell my point of view
i was like you

prechorus
now i dont mean to make you frown
no i just want you to slow down

chorus
have you never been mellow
have you never tried
to find a comfort from inside you
have you never been happy
just to hear your song
have you never let someone else be strong

verse 2
running around as you do
with your head up in the clouds
i was like you
never had time to lay back
kick your shoes off close your eyes
i was like you
you might also likeprechorus
now youre not hard to understand
you need someone to take your hand

chorus
have you never been mellow
have you never tried
to find a comfort from inside you
have you never been happy
just to hear your song
have you never let someone else be strongembed"
