verse 2 tuff dawg

as i dey hustle baba na u be my witness
i swear poverty be sickness
if you no get money all your short stories go be long
but my guy you for stay stroong
the rich man’s story ain’t always funny
but we laugh cus we ain’t got no money
niggas are getting money and flex
we getting money and invest
know the difference we no be the same
i no dey compete you i’m jus riding my wave
walk like a king don’t run like a slave
life na one e no get part two
so make u no live am like u be cartoon
no be who start first go win the race
love me now if i make am i no go remember ur face
anything wey get beginning surely get ein end
if you get famous everybody go pretend dem be ur friend
wise up no love on the streets all i see is lust
i hope my story has a happy ending cus i done suffer a lot
these days nobody really cares unless you’re dead
alhamdulillah i never lack my daily bread
i rather be rich and unknown than to be poor and famous
fame without money is meaningless
i ma keep chasing money till the day i’m lifeless
