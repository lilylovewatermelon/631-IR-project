intro đen

den vau

verse 1 đen
you set forth on life through the highway me the alley
i recalled my then love confession your then rejection
i recalled that nights ride just a lone passenger in sight
heavy heart through relieftinged a smile at last i recalled

guess i have you to thank for all ive been through
your memory is my keepsake with which ill never parti
but for a thing to hold dear i fear my heart would turn arid
conceive of you as a nuwa able to mend my chipped soul

oftentimes i set off alone in quest of greenery
reminisce about the olden days having slipped through my fingers
hardly pondering i dont wish for a lucky streak
a few bygone sorrow somehow surface anew this afternoon

i still jam out to thời trống vắng or kiếp ve sầu
budding dreams like the lush green canopies over my head
love is inherently simple like a vegan steamed bun
rather kindle a small flame than keep seeking to pluck a passing star
you might also likechorus phương anh đào
the road is long filling me with desolation now and then
your appearance brings a fleeting joy then youre gone before long
hand on heart to feel the dream still ablaze
like the seasons first puff of chill through my soul in many white nights

verse 2 đen
you set forth on life through the high rise me the thatched roof
hence all my longings have never been outrageous
simple doings are my gotos and thus often scorned
some would feast on seafood then scoff at the fish pond smell

like my character guileless and breezy
this song has no pretense an easy listen with lucid prose
i have few special requests rather a laidback fellow
this is no tearjerker this music is a chill pill

you set forth on life with a frenzy me with quietude
you pursue elevating high notes my heart the low
you seek the hubbub of city life me the sound of guitar
you lead me to tumult me shaking head and taking leave

you set forth on life with red wine me with tea
with rain emanating an earthy scent with flowering weeds thriving in the front
you set forth on life with a plan me with daydreams
your logical mind is a tool my heart an engine
you set forth on life with many colleagues me many affections
just want to plant my feet on the ground not step on others
you set forth on life with white clouds you with shining blue sky
you set forth on life through the highway the way that now misses me

chorus phương anh đào
the road is long filling me with desolation now and then
your appearance brings fleeting joy then youre gone before long
hand on heart to feel the dream still ablaze
like the seasons first puff of chill through my soul in many white nights

the road is long filling me with desolation now and then
your appearance brings fleeting joy then youre gone before long
hand on heart to feel the dream still ablaze
like the seasons first puff of chill through my soul in many white nights
