—and we have have we not those priceless pages of wilhelm meister a great poet on a great brother poet a hesitating soul taking arms against a sea of troubles torn by conflicting doubts as one sees in real life

he came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step backward a sinkapace on the solemn floor

a noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a noiseless beck

—directly said he creaking to go albeit lingering the beautiful ineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts one always feels that goethes judgments are so true true in the larger analysis
twicreakingly analysis he corantoed off bald most zealous by the door he gave his large ear all to the attendants words heard them and was gone

two left

—monsieur de la palice stephen sneered was alive fifteen minutes before his death

—have you found those six brave medicals john eglinton asked with elders gall to write paradise lost at your dictation the sorrows of satan he calls it

smile smile cranlys smile

first he tickled her
then he patted her
then he passed the female catheter
for he was a medical
jolly old medi

—i feel you would need one more for hamlet seven is dear to the mystic mind the shining seven wb calls them
glittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought the face bearded amid darkgreener shadow an ollav holyeyed he laughed low a sizars laugh of trinity unanswered

orchestral satan weeping many a rood
tears such as angels weep

mulligan has my telegram

folly persist

—our young irish bards john eglinton censured have yet to create a figure which the world will set beside saxon shakespeares hamlet though i admire him as old ben did on this side idolatry

—all these questions are purely academic russell oracled out of his shadow i mean whether hamlet is shakespeare or james i or essex clergymens discussions of the historicity of jesus art has to reveal to us ideas formless spiritual essences the supreme question about a work of art is out of how deep a life does it spring the painting of gustave moreau is the painting of ideas the deepest poetry of shelley the words of hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal wisdom platos world of ideas all the rest is the speculation of schoolboys for schoolboys

a e has been telling some yankee interviewer wall tarnation strike me

—the schoolmen were schoolboys first stephen said superpolitely aristotle was once platos schoolboy

—and has remained so one should hope john eglinton sedately said one can see him a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm

he laughed again at the now smiling bearded face
formless spiritual father word and holy breath allfather the heavenly man hiesos kristos magician of the beautiful the logos who suffers in us at every moment this verily is that i am the fire upon the altar i am the sacrificial butter
dunlop judge the noblest roman of them all ae arval the name ineffable in heaven hight kh their master whose identity is no secret to adepts brothers of the great white lodge always watching to see if they can help the christ with the bridesister moisture of light born of an ensouled virgin repentant sophia departed to the plane of buddhi the life esoteric is not for ordinary person op must work off bad karma first mrs cooper oakley once glimpsed our very illustrious sister hpbs elemental

o fie out ont pfuiteufel you naughtnt to look missus so you naughtnt when a ladys ashowing of her elemental

mr best entered tall young mild light he bore in his hand with grace a notebook new large clean bright

—that model schoolboy stephen said would find hamlets musings about the afterlife of his princely soul the improbable insignificant and undramatic monologue as shallow as platos

john eglinton frowning said waxing wroth

—upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare aristotle with plato

—which of the two stephen asked would have banished me from his commonwealth
unsheathe your dagger definitions horseness is the whatness of allhorse streams of tendency and eons they worship god noise in the street very peripatetic space what you damn well have to see through spaces smaller than red globules of mans blood they creepycrawl after blakes buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a shadow hold to the now the here through which all future plunges to the past

mr best came forward amiable towards his colleague

—haines is gone he said

—is he

—i was showing him jubainvilles book hes quite enthusiastic dont you know about hydes lovesongs of connacht i couldnt bring him in to hear the discussion hes gone to gills to buy it
bound thee forth my booklet quick
to greet the callous public
writ i ween twas not my wish
in lean unlovely english

—the peatsmoke is going to his head john eglinton opined

we feel in england penitent thief gone i smoked his baccy green twinkling stone an emerald set in the ring of the sea

—people do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be the auric egg of russell warned occultly the movements which work revolutions in the world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasants heart on the hillside for them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living mother the rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the sixshilling novel the musichall song france produces the finest flower of corruption in mallarme but the desirable life is revealed only to the poor of heart the life of homers phaeacians

from these words mr best turned an unoffending face to stephen

—mallarme dont you know he said has written those wonderful prose poems stephen mackenna used to read to me in paris the one about hamlet he says il se promène lisant au livre de luimême dont you know reading the book of himself he describes hamlet given in a french town dont you know a provincial town they advertised it

his free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air

hamlet
ou
le distrait
pièce de shakespeare
he repeated to john eglintons newgathered frown

—pièce de shakespeare dont you know its so french the french point of view hamlet ou

—the absentminded beggar stephen ended

john eglinton laughed

—yes i suppose it would be he said excellent people no doubt but distressingly shortsighted in some matters

sumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder
—a deathsman of the soul robert greene called him stephen said not for nothing was he a butchers son wielding the sledded poleaxe and spitting in his palms nine lives are taken off for his fathers one our father who art in purgatory khaki hamlets dont hesitate to shoot the bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the concentration camp sung by mr swinburne

cranly i his mute orderly following battles from afar

whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none but we had spared
between the saxon smile and yankee yawp the devil and the deep sea

—he will have it that hamlet is a ghoststory john eglinton said for mr bests behoof like the fat boy in pickwick he wants to make our flesh creep

list list o list

my flesh hears him creeping hears

if thou didst ever

—what is a ghost stephen said with tingling energy one who has faded into impalpability through death through absence through change of manners elizabethan london lay as far from stratford as corrupt paris lies from virgin dublin who is the ghost from limbo patrum returning to the world that has forgotten him who is king hamlet

john eglinton shifted his spare body leaning back to judge

lifted

—it is this hour of a day in mid june stephen said begging with a swift glance their hearing the flag is up on the playhouse by the bankside the bear sackerson growls in the pit near it paris garden canvasclimbers who sailed with drake chew their sausages among the groundlings

local colour work in all you know make them accomplices
—shakespeare has left the huguenots house in silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank but he does not stay to feed the pen chivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes the swan of avon has other thoughts

composition of place ignatius loyola make haste to help me
—the play begins a player comes on under the shadow made up in the castoff mail of a court buck a wellset man with a bass voice it is the ghost the king a king and no king and the player is shakespeare who has studied hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre he speaks the words to burbage the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth calling him by a name

hamlet i am thy fathers spirit

bidding him list to a son he speaks the son of his soul the prince young hamlet and to the son of his body hamnet shakespeare who has died in stratford that his namesake may live for ever

is it possible that that player shakespeare a ghost by absence and in the vesture of buried denmark a ghost by death speaking his own words to his own sons name had hamnet shakespeare lived he would have been prince hamlets twin is it possible i want to know or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises you are the dispossessed son i am the murdered father your mother is the guilty queen ann shakespeare born hathaway

—but this prying into the family life of a great man russell began impatiently

art thou there truepenny

—interesting only to the parish clerk i mean we have the plays i mean when we read the poetry of king lear what is it to us how the poet lived as for living our servants can do that for us villiers de lisle has said peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day the poets drinking the poets debts we have king lear and it is immortal

mr bests face appealed to agreed

flow over them with your waves and with your waters mananaan mananaan maclir

how now sirrah that pound he lent you when you were hungry

marry i wanted it

take thou this noble

i i and i i
aeiou

—do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries john eglintons carping voice asked her ghost at least has been laid for ever she died for literature at least before she was born

—she died stephen retorted sixtyseven years after she was born she saw him into and out of the world she took his first embraces she bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed

mothers deathbed candle the sheeted mirror who brought me into this world lies there bronzelidded under few cheap flowers liliata rutilantium
i wept alone

john eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp
—the world believes that shakespeare made a mistake he said and got out of it as quickly and as best he could

—bosh stephen said rudely a man of genius makes no mistakes his errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery

portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian softcreakfooted bald eared and assiduous

—a shrew john eglinton said shrewdly is not a useful portal of discovery one should imagine what useful discovery did socrates learn from xanthippe

—dialectic stephen answered and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world what he learnt from his other wife myrto absit nomen socratididions epipsychidion no man not a woman will ever know but neither the midwifes lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of sinn fein and their naggin of hemlock

—but ann hathaway mr bests quiet voice said forgetfully yes we seem to be forgetting her as shakespeare himself forgot her

his look went from brooders beard to carpers skull to remind to chide them not unkindly then to the baldpink lollard costard guiltless though maligned

—he had a good groatsworth of wit stephen said and no truant memory he carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to romeville whistling the girl i left behind me if the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor wat sitting in his form the cry of hounds the studded bridle and her blue windows that memory venus and adonis lay in the bedchamber of every lightoflove in london is katharine the shrew illfavoured hortensio calls her young and beautiful do you think the writer of antony and cleopatra a passionate pilgrim had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all warwickshire to lie withal good he left her and gained the world of men but his boywomen are the women of a boy their life thought speech are lent them by males he chose badly he was chosen it seems to me if others have their will ann hath a way by cock she was to blame she put the comether on him sweet and twentysix the greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy adonis stooping to conquer as prologue to the swelling act is a boldfaced stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself
and my turn when

come

—ryefield mr best said brightly gladly raising his new book gladly brightly

he murmured then with blond delight for all

between the acres of the rye these pretty countryfolk would lie

paris the wellpleased pleaser
a tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its cooperative watch

—i am afraid i am due at the homestead

whither away exploitable ground

—are you going john eglintons active eyebrows asked shall we see you at moores tonight piper is coming

—piper mr best piped is piper back

peter piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper

—i dont know if i can thursday we have our meeting if i can get away in time

in quintessential triviality

—they say we are to have a literary surprise the quaker librarian said friendly and earnest mr russell rumour has it is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets verses we are all looking forward anxiously

anxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces lighted shone

—thank you very much mr russell stephen said rising if you will be so kind as to give the letter to mr norman

—o yes if he considers it important it will go in we have so much correspondence

—i understand stephen said thanks

god ild you the pigs paper bullockbefriending

synge has promised me an article for dana too are we going to be read i feel we are the gaelic league wants something in irish i hope you will come round tonight bring starkey

stephen sat down

the quaker librarian came from the leavetakers blushing his mask said

—mr dedalus your views are most illuminating

he creaked to and fro tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a chopine and covered by the noise of outgoing said low
—is it your view then that she was not faithful to the poet

alarmed face asks me why did he come courtesy or an inward light
—where there is a reconciliation stephen said there must have been first a sundering

—yes

christfox in leather trews hiding a runaway in blighted treeforks from hue and cry knowing no vixen walking lonely in the chase women he won to him tender people a whore of babylon ladies of justices bully tapsters wives fox and geese and in new place a slack dishonoured body that once was comely once as sweet as fresh as cinnamon now her leaves falling all bare frighted of the narrow grave and unforgiven
—yes so you think

the door closed behind the outgoer

rest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell rest of warm and brooding air

a vestals lamp

here he ponders things that were not what caesar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer what might have been possibilities of the possible as possible things not known what name achilles bore when he lived among women

coffined thoughts around me in mummycases embalmed in spice of words thoth god of libraries a birdgod moonycrowned and i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest in painted chambers loaded with tilebooks
they are still once quick in the brains of men still but an itch of death is in them to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale urge me to wreak their will
—certainly john eglinton mused of all great men he is the most enigmatic we know nothing but that he lived and suffered not even so much others abide our question a shadow hangs over all the rest

—but hamlet is so personal isnt it mr best pleaded i mean a kind of private paper dont you know of his private life i mean i dont care a button dont you know who is killed or who is guilty
he rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk smiling his defiance his private papers in the original ta an bad ar an tir taim in mo shagart put beurla on it littlejohn

quoth littlejohn eglinton

—i was prepared for paradoxes from what malachi mulligan told us but i may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that shakespeare is hamlet you have a stern task before you
bear with me

stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows a basilisk e quando vede luomo lattosca messer brunetto i thank thee for the word
—as we or mother dana weave and unweave our bodies stephen said from day to day their molecules shuttled to and fro so does the artist weave and unweave his image and as the mole on my right breast is where it was when i was born though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth in the intense instant of imagination when the mind shelley says is a fading coal that which i was is that which i am and that which in possibility i may come to be so in the future the sister of the past i may see myself as i sit here now but by reflection from that which then i shall be

drummond of hawthornden helped you at that stile

—yes mr best said youngly i feel hamlet quite young the bitterness might be from the father but the passages with ophelia are surely from the son

has the wrong sow by the lug he is in my father i am in his son

—that mole is the last to go stephen said laughing

john eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow

—if that were the birthmark of genius he said genius would be a drug in the market the plays of shakespeares later years which renan admired so much breathe another spirit

—the spirit of reconciliation the quaker librarian breathed

—there can be no reconciliation stephen said if there has not been a sundering

said that

—if you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of king lear othello hamlet troilus and cressida look to see when and how the shadow lifts what softens the heart of a man shipwrecked in storms dire tried like another ulysses pericles prince of tyre

head redconecapped buffeted brineblinded

—a child a girl placed in his arms marina

—the leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity john eglinton detected the highroads are dreary but they lead to the town

good bacon gone musty shakespeare bacons wild oats cypherjugglers going the highroads seekers on the great quest what town good masters mummed in names a e eon magee john eglinton east of the sun west of the moon tir na nog booted the twain and staved

how many miles to dublin three score and ten sir will we be there by candlelight

—mr brandes accepts it stephen said as the first play of the closing period

—does he what does mr sidney lee or mr simon lazarus as some aver his name is say of it

—marina stephen said a child of storm miranda a wonder perdita that which was lost what was lost is given back to him his daughters child my dearest wife pericles says was like this maid will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother

—the art of being a grandfather mr best gan murmur lart dêtre grand

—will he not see reborn in her with the memory of his own youth added another image

do you know what you are talking about love yes word known to all men amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus 

—his own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience material and moral such an appeal will touch him the images of other males of his blood will repel him he will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself

the benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope

—i hope mr dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public and we ought to mention another irish commentator mr george bernard shaw nor should we forget mr frank harris his articles on shakespeare in the saturday review were surely brilliant oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets the favoured rival is william herbert earl of pembroke i own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony with—what shall i say—our notions of what ought not to have been

felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them auks egg prize of their fray

he thous and thees her with grave husbandwords dost love miriam dost love thy man

—that may be too stephen said theres a saying of goethes which mr magee likes to quote beware of what you wish for in youth because you will get it in middle life why does he send to one who is a buonaroba a bay where all men ride a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood a lordling to woo for him he was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written romeo and juliet why belief in himself has been untimely killed he was overborne in a cornfield first ryefield i should say and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down assumed dongiovannism will not save him no later undoing will undo the first undoing the tusk of the boar has wounded him there where love lies ableeding if the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her womans invisible weapon there is i feel in the words some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion a darker shadow of the first darkening even his own understanding of himself a like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool

they list and in the porches of their ears i pour

—the soul has been before stricken mortally a poison poured in the porch of a sleeping ear but those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come the poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it king hamlets ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator that is why the speech his lean unlovely english is always turned elsewhere backward ravisher and ravished what he would but would not go with him from lucreces bluecircled ivory globes to imogens breast bare with its mole cinquespotted he goes back weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself an old dog licking an old sore but because loss is his gain he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed his beaver is up he is a ghost a shadow now the wind by elsinores rocks or what you will the seas voice a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow the son consubstantial with the father

—amen was responded from the doorway

hast thou found me o mine enemy

a ribald face sullen as a deans buck mulligan came forward then blithe in motley towards the greeting of their smiles my telegram

—you were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate if i mistake not he asked of stephen

primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed panama as with a bauble

they make him welcome was du verlachst wirst du noch dienen

brood of mockers photius pseudomalachi johann most

he who himself begot middler the holy ghost and himself sent himself agenbuyer between himself and others who put upon by his fiends stripped and whipped was nailed like bat to barndoor starved on crosstree who let him bury stood up harrowed hell fared into heaven and there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of his own self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead when all the quick shall be dead already
glo—o—ri—a in ex—cel—sis de—o

he lifts his hands veils fall o flowers bells with bells with bells aquiring

—yes indeed the quaker librarian said a most instructive discussion mr mulligan ill be bound has his theory too of the play and of shakespeare all sides of life should be represented

he smiled on all sides equally

buck mulligan thought puzzled

—shakespeare he said i seem to know the name

a flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features

—to be sure he said remembering brightly the chap that writes like synge

mr best turned to him

—haines missed you he said did you meet him hell see you after at the d b c hes gone to gills to buy hydes lovesongs of connacht

—i came through the museum buck mulligan said was he here

—the bards fellowcountrymen john eglinton answered are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising i hear that an actress played hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in dublin vining held that the prince was a woman has noone made him out to be an irishman judge barton i believe is searching for some clues he swears his highness not his lordship by saint patrick

—the most brilliant of all is that story of wildes mr best said lifting his brilliant notebook that portrait of mr w h where he proves that the sonnets were written by a willie hughes a man all hues

—for willie hughes is it not the quaker librarian asked

or hughie wills mr william himself w h who am i

—i mean for willie hughes mr best said amending his gloss easily of course its all paradox dont you know hughes and hews and hues the colour but its so typical the way he works it out its the very essence of wilde dont you know the light touch

his glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled a blond ephebe tame essence of wilde

youre darned witty three drams of usquebaugh you drank with dan deasys ducats

how much did i spend o a few shillings

for a plump of pressmen humour wet and dry

wit you would give your five wits for youths proud livery he pranks in lineaments of gratified desire

there be many mo take her for me in pairing time jove a cool ruttime send them yea turtledove her

eve naked wheatbellied sin a snake coils her fang ins kiss

—do you think it is only a paradox the quaker librarian was asking the mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious

they talked seriously of mockers seriousness

buck mulligans again heavy face eyed stephen awhile then his head wagging he came near drew a folded telegram from his pocket his mobile lips read smiling with new delight

—telegram he said wonderful inspiration telegram a papal bull

he sat on a corner of the unlit desk reading aloud joyfully

—the sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done signed dedalus where did you launch it from the kips no college green have you drunk the four quid the aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father telegram malachi mulligan the ship lower abbey street o you peerless mummer o you priestified kinchite

joyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a querulous brogue

—its what im telling you mister honey its queer and sick we were haines and myself the time himself brought it in twas murmur we did for a gallus potion would rouse a friar im thinking and he limp with leching and we one hour and two hours and three hours in connerys sitting civil waiting for pints apiece

he wailed

—and we to be there mavrone and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful

stephen laughed

quickly warningfully buck mulligan bent down

—the tramper synge is looking for you he said to murder you he heard you pissed on his halldoor in glasthule hes out in pampooties to murder you

—me stephen exclaimed that was your contribution to literature

buck mulligan gleefully bent back laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling

—murder you he laughed

harsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash of lights in rue saintandrédesarts in words of words for words palabras oisin with patrick faunman he met in clamart woods brandishing a winebottle cest vendredi saint murthering irish his image wandering he met i mine i met a fool ithe forest

—mr lyster an attendant said from the door ajar

— in which everyone can find his own so mr justice madden in his diary of master william silence has found the hunting terms yes what is it

—theres a gentleman here sir the attendant said coming forward and offering a card from the freeman he wants to see the files of the kilkenny people for last year

—certainly certainly certainly is the gentleman

he took the eager card glanced not saw laid down unglanced looked asked creaked asked

—is he o there

brisk in a galliard he was off out in the daylit corridor he talked with voluble pains of zeal in duty bound most fair most kind most honest broadbrim

—this gentleman freemans journal kilkenny people to be sure good day sir kilkenny we have certainly

a patient silhouette waited listening

—all the leading provincial northern whig cork examiner enniscorthy guardian 1903 will you please evans conduct this gentleman if you just follow the atten or please allow me this way please sir

voluble dutiful he led the way to all the provincial papers a bowing dark figure following his hasty heels

the door closed

—the sheeny buck mulligan cried

he jumped up and snatched the card

—whats his name ikey moses bloom

he rattled on

—jehovah collector of prepuces is no more i found him over in the museum where i went to hail the foamborn aphrodite the greek mouth that has never been twisted in prayer every day we must do homage to her life of life thy lips enkindle

suddenly he turned to stephen

—he knows you he knows your old fellow o i fear me he is greeker than the greeks his pale galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove venus kallipyge o the thunder of those loins the god pursuing the maiden hid

—we want to hear more john eglinton decided with mr bests approval we begin to be interested in mrs s till now we had thought of her if at all as a patient griselda a penelope stayathome

—antisthenes pupil of gorgias stephen said took the palm of beauty from kyrios menelaus brooddam argive helen the wooden mare of troy in whom a score of heroes slept and handed it to poor penelope twenty years he lived in london and during part of that time he drew a salary equal to that of the lord chancellor of ireland his life was rich his art more than the art of feudalism as walt whitman called it is the art of surfeit hot herringpies green mugs of sack honeysauces sugar of roses marchpane gooseberried pigeons ringocandies sir walter raleigh when they arrested him had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays the gombeenwoman eliza tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of sheba twenty years he dallied there between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love and its foul pleasures you know manninghams story of the burghers wife who bade dick burbage to her bed after she had seen him in richard iii and how shakespeare overhearing without more ado about nothing took the cow by the horns and when burbage came knocking at the gate answered from the capons blankets william the conqueror came before richard iii and the gay lakin mistress fitton mount and cry o and his dainty birdsnies lady penelope rich a clean quality woman is suited for a player and the punks of the bankside a penny a time

cours la reine encore vingt sous nous ferons de petites cochonneries minette tu veux

—the height of fine society and sir william davenant of oxfords mother with her cup of canary for any cockcanary

buck mulligan his pious eyes upturned prayed

—blessed margaret mary anycock

—and harry of six wives daughter and other lady friends from neighbour seats as lawn tennyson gentleman poet sings but all those twenty years what do you suppose poor penelope in stratford was doing behind the diamond panes

do and do thing done in a rosery of fetter lane of gerard herbalist he walks greyedauburn an azured harebell like her veins lids of junos eyes violets he walks one life is all one body do but do afar in a reek of lust and squalor hands are laid on whiteness

buck mulligan rapped john eglintons desk sharply

—whom do you suspect he challenged

—say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets once spurned twice spurned but the court wanton spurned him for a lord his dearmylove

love that dare not speak its name

—as an englishman you mean john sturdy eglinton put in he loved a lord

—it seems so stephen said when he wants to do for him and for all other and singular uneared wombs the holy office an ostler does for the stallion maybe like socrates he had a midwife to mother as he had a shrew to wife but she the giglot wanton did not break a bedvow two deeds are rank in that ghosts mind a broken vow and the dullbrained yokel on whom her favour has declined deceased husbands brother sweet ann i take it was hot in the blood once a wooer twice a wooer

stephen turned boldly in his chair

—the burden of proof is with you not with me he said frowning if you deny that in the fifth scene of hamlet he has branded her with infamy tell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years between the day she married him and the day she buried him all those women saw their men down and under mary her goodman john ann her poor dear willun when he went and died on her raging that he was the first to go joan her four brothers judith her husband and all her sons susan her husband too while susans daughter elizabeth to use granddaddys words wed her second having killed her first

o yes mention there is in the years when he was living richly in royal london to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her fathers shepherd explain you then explain the swansong too wherein he has commended her to posterity

he faced their silence

to whom thus eglinton
you mean the will
but that has been explained i believe by jurists
she was entitled to her widows dower
at common law his legal knowledge was great
our judges tell us
him satan fleers
mocker
and therefore he left out her name
from the first draft but he did not leave out
the presents for his granddaughter for his daughters
for his sister for his old cronies in stratford
and in london and therefore when he was urged
as i believe to name her
he left her his
secondbest

—pretty countryfolk had few chattels then john eglinton observed as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type

—he was a rich country gentleman stephen said with a coat of arms and landed estate at stratford and a house in ireland yard a capitalist shareholder a bill promoter a tithefarmer why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace

—it is clear that there were two beds a best and a secondbest mr secondbest best said finely

—separatio a mensa et a thalamo bettered buck mulligan and was smiled on

—antiquity mentions famous beds second eglinton puckered bedsmiling let me think

—antiquity mentions that stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage stephen said who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves pays tribute to his elders wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress dont forget nell gwynn herpyllis and let her live in his villa

—do you mean he died so mr best asked with slight concern i mean

—he died dead drunk buck mulligan capped a quart of ale is a dish for a king o i must tell you what dowden said

—what asked besteglinton

william shakespeare and company limited the peoples william for terms apply e dowden highfield house

—lovely buck mulligan suspired amorously i asked him what he thought of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard he lifted his hands and said all we can say is that life ran very high in those days lovely

catamite

—the sense of beauty leads us astray said beautifulinsadness best to ugling eglinton

steadfast john replied severe

—the doctor can tell us what those words mean you cannot eat your cake and have it

sayest thou so will they wrest from us from me the palm of beauty

—and the sense of property stephen said he drew shylock out of his own long pocket the son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots his borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by chettle falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing he sued a fellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound of flesh in interest for every money lent how else could aubreys ostler and callboy get rich quick all events brought grist to his mill shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queens leech lopez his jews heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive hamlet and macbeth with the coming to the throne of a scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting the lost armada is his jeer in loves labour lost his pageants the histories sail fullbellied on a tide of mafeking enthusiasm warwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porters theory of equivocation the sea venture comes home from bermudas and the play renan admired is written with patsy caliban our american cousin the sugared sonnets follow sidneys as for fay elizabeth otherwise carrotty bess the gross virgin who inspired the merry wives of windsor let some meinherr from almany grope his life long for deephid meanings in the depths of the buckbasket

—prove that he was a jew john eglinton daredexpectantly your dean of studies holds he was a holy roman

sufflaminandus sum

—he was made in germany stephen replied as the champion french polisher of italian scandals

—a myriadminded man mr best reminded coleridge called him myriadminded
amplius in societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos

—saint thomas stephen began

—ora pro nobis monk mulligan groaned sinking to a chair

there he keened a wailing rune

—pogue mahone acushla machree its destroyed we are from this day its destroyed we are surely

all smiled their smiles

—saint thomas stephen smiling said whose gorbellied works i enjoy reading in the original writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new viennese school mr magee spoke of likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions he means that the love so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some stranger who it may be hungers for it jews whom christians tax with avarice are of all races the most given to intermarriage accusations are made in anger the christian laws which built up the hoards of the jews for whom as for the lollards storm was shelter bound their affections too with hoops of steel whether these be sins or virtues old nobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet but a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife no sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass

—or his jennyass buck mulligan antiphoned

—gentle will is being roughly handled gentle mr best said gently

—which will gagged sweetly buck mulligan we are getting mixed

—the will to live john eglinton philosophised for poor ann wills widow is the will to die

—requiescat stephen prayed

what of all the will to do
it has vanished long ago

—she lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed the mobled queen even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a motorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes in old age she takes up with gospellers one stayed with her at new place and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which bed he slept it skills not to ask and heard she had a soul she read or had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the merry wives and loosing her nightly waters on the jordan she thought over hooks and eyes for believers breeches and the most spiritual snuffbox to make the most devout souls sneeze venus has twisted her lips in prayer agenbite of inwit remorse of conscience it is an age of exhausted whoredom groping for its god

—history shows that to be true inquit eglintonus chronolologos the ages succeed one another but we have it on high authority that a mans worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family i feel that russell is right what do we care for his wife or father i should say that only family poets have family lives falstaff was not a family man i feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation

lean he lay back shy deny thy kindred the unco guid shy supping with the godless he sneaks the cup a sire in ultonian antrim bade it him visits him here on quarter days mr magee sir theres a gentleman to see you me says hes your father sir give me my wordsworth enter magee mor matthew a rugged rough rugheaded kern in strossers with a buttoned codpiece his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten forests a wand of wilding in his hand

hurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay paris on the quayside i touched his hand the voice new warmth speaking dr bob kenny is attending her the eyes that wish me well but do not know me
—a father stephen said battling against hopelessness is a necessary evil he wrote the play in the months that followed his fathers death if you hold that he a greying man with two marriageable daughters with thirtyfive years of life nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita with fifty of experience is the beardless undergraduate from wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen no the corpse of john shakespeare does not walk the night from hour to hour it rots and rots he rests disarmed of fatherhood having devised that mystical estate upon his son boccaccios calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with child fatherhood in the sense of conscious begetting is unknown to man it is a mystical estate an apostolic succession from only begetter to only begotten on that mystery and not on the madonna which the cunning italian intellect flung to the mob of europe the church is founded and founded irremovably because founded like the world macro and microcosm upon the void upon incertitude upon unlikelihood amor matris subjective and objective genitive may be the only true thing in life paternity may be a legal fiction who is the father of any son that any son should love him or he any son

what the hell are you driving at

i know shut up blast you i have reasons

amplius adhuc iterum postea

are you condemned to do this

—they are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal annals of the world stained with all other incests and bestialities hardly record its breach sons with mothers sires with daughters lesbic sisters loves that dare not speak their name nephews with grandmothers jailbirds with keyholes queens with prize bulls the son unborn mars beauty born he brings pain divides affection increases care he is a new male his growth is his fathers decline his youth his fathers envy his friend his fathers enemy

in rue monsieurleprince i thought it

—what links them in nature an instant of blind rut

am i a father if i were

shrunken uncertain hand

—sabellius the african subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the field held that the father was himself his own son the bulldog of aquin with whom no word shall be impossible refutes him well if the father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a father be a son when rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet of the same name in the comedy of errors wrote hamlet he was not the father of his own son merely but being no more a son he was and felt himself the father of all his race the father of his own grandfather the father of his unborn grandson who by the same token never was born for nature as mr magee understands her abhors perfection

eglintoneyes quick with pleasure looked up shybrightly gladly glancing a merry puritan through the twisted eglantine

flatter rarely but flatter

—himself his own father sonmulligan told himself wait i am big with child i have an unborn child in my brain pallas athena a play the plays the thing let me parturiate

he clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands

—as for his family stephen said his mothers name lives in the forest of arden her death brought from him the scene with volumnia in coriolanus his boysons death is the deathscene of young arthur in king john hamlet the black prince is hamnet shakespeare who the girls in the tempest in pericles in winters tale are we know who cleopatra fleshpot of egypt and cressid and venus are we may guess but there is another member of his family who is recorded

—the plot thickens john eglinton said

the quaker librarian quaking tiptoed in quake his mask quake with haste quake quack

door closed cell day

stephen he had three brothers gilbert edmund richard gilbert in his old age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from maister gatherer one time mass he did and he seen his brud maister wull the playwriter up in lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man ons back the playhouse sausage filled gilberts soul he is nowhere but an edmund and a richard are recorded in the works of sweet william

stephen in his trinity of black wills the villain shakebags iago richard crookback edmund in king lear two bear the wicked uncles names nay that last play was written or being written while his brother edmund lay dying in southwark

best i hope edmund is going to catch it i dont want richard my name 

laughter

quakerlyster a tempo but he that filches from me my good name

stephen stringendo he has hidden his own name a fair name william in the plays a super here a clown there as a painter of old italy set his face in a dark corner of his canvas he has revealed it in the sonnets where there is will in overplus like john ogaunt his name is dear to him as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for on a bend sable a spear or steeled argent honorificabilitudinitatibus dearer than his glory of greatest shakescene in the country whats in a name that is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that we are told is ours a star a daystar a firedrake rose at his birth it shone by day in the heavens alone brighter than venus in the night and by night it shone over delta in cassiopeia the recumbent constellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars his eyes watched it lowlying on the horizon eastward of the bear as he walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from shottery and from her arms

both satisfied i too

—what is that mr dedalus the quaker librarian asked was it a celestial phenomenon

—a star by night stephen said a pillar of the cloud by day

what mores to speak

stephen looked on his hat his stick his boots

stephanos my crown my sword his boots are spoiling the shape of my feet buy a pair holes in my socks handkerchief too

—you make good use of the name john eglinton allowed your own name is strange enough i suppose it explains your fantastical humour

me magee and mulligan

fabulous artificer the hawklike man you flew whereto newhavendieppe steerage passenger paris and back lapwing icarus pater ait seabedabbled fallen weltering lapwing you are lapwing be

mr best eagerquietly lifted his book to say

—thats very interesting because that brother motive dont you know we find also in the old irish myths just what you say the three brothers shakespeare in grimm too dont you know the fairytales the third brother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize

best of best brothers good better best

the quaker librarian springhalted near

—i should like to know he said which brother you i understand you to suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers but perhaps i am anticipating

he caught himself in the act looked at all refrained

an attendant from the doorway called

—mr lyster father dineen wants

—o father dineen directly

swiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone

john eglinton touched the foil

—come he said let us hear what you have to say of richard and edmund you kept them for the last didnt you

—in asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle richie and nuncle edmund stephen answered i feel i am asking too much perhaps a brother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella

lapwing

where is your brother apothecaries hall my whetstone him then cranly mulligan now these speech speech but act act speech they mock to try you act be acted on

lapwing

i am tired of my voice the voice of esau my kingdom for a drink

on

—you will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he took the stuff of his plays why did he take them rather than others richard a whoreson crookback misbegotten makes love to a widowed ann whats in a name woos and wins her a whoreson merry widow richard the conqueror third brother came after william the conquered the other four acts of that play hang limply from that first of all his kings richard is the only king unshielded by shakespeares reverence the angel of the world why is the underplot of king lear in which edmund figures lifted out of sidneys arcadia and spatchcocked on to a celtic legend older than history

—that was wills way john eglinton defended we should not now combine a norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by george meredith que voulezvous moore would say he puts bohemia on the seacoast and makes ulysses quote aristotle

—why stephen answered himself because the theme of the false or the usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to shakespeare what the poor are not always with him the note of banishment banishment from the heart banishment from home sounds uninterruptedly from the two gentlemen of verona onward till prospero breaks his staff buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his book it doubles itself in the middle of his life reflects itself in another repeats itself protasis epitasis catastasis catastrophe it repeats itself again when he is near the grave when his married daughter susan chip of the old block is accused of adultery but it was the original sin that darkened his understanding weakened his will and left in him a strong inclination to evil the words are those of my lords bishops of maynooth an original sin and like original sin committed by another in whose sin he too has sinned it is between the lines of his last written words it is petrified on his tombstone under which her four bones are not to be laid age has not withered it beauty and peace have not done it away it is in infinite variety everywhere in the world he has created in much ado about nothing twice in as you like it in the tempest in hamlet in measure for measure—and in all the other plays which i have not read

he laughed to free his mind from his minds bondage

judge eglinton summed up

—the truth is midway he affirmed he is the ghost and the prince he is all in all

—he is stephen said the boy of act one is the mature man of act five all in all in cymbeline in othello he is bawd and cuckold he acts and is acted on lover of an ideal or a perversion like jose he kills the real carmen his unremitting intellect is the hornmad iago ceaselessly willing that the moor in him shall suffer

—cuckoo cuckoo cuck mulligan clucked lewdly o word of fear
dark dome received reverbed

—and what a character is iago undaunted john eglinton exclaimed when all is said dumas fils or is it dumas père is right after god shakespeare has created most

—man delights him not nor woman neither stephen said he returns after a life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born where he has always been man and boy a silent witness and there his journey of life ended he plants his mulberrytree in the earth then dies the motion is ended gravediggers bury hamlet père and hamlet fils a king and a prince at last in death with incidental music and what though murdered and betrayed bewept by all frail tender hearts for dane or dubliner sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse to be divorced if you like the epilogue look long on it prosperous prospero the good man rewarded lizzie grandpas lump of love and nuncle richie the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place where the bad niggers go strong curtain he found in the world without as actual what was in his world within as possible maeterlinck says if socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his doorstep if judas go forth tonight it is to judas his steps will tend every life is many days day after day we walk through ourselves meeting robbers ghosts giants old men young men wives widows brothersinlove but always meeting ourselves the playwright who wrote the folio of this world and wrote it badly he gave us light first and the sun two days later the lord of things as they are whom the most roman of catholics call dio boia hangman god is doubtless all in all in all of us ostler and butcher and would be bawd and cuckold too but that in the economy of heaven foretold by hamlet there are no more marriages glorified man an androgynous angel being a wife unto himself

—eureka buck mulligan cried eureka

suddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride john eglintons desk

—may i he said the lord has spoken to malachi

he began to scribble on a slip of paper

take some slips from the counter going out

—those who are married mr best douce herald said all save one shall live the rest shall keep as they are

he laughed unmarried at eglinton johannes of arts a bachelor

unwed unfancied ware of wiles they fingerponder nightly each his variorum edition of the taming of the shrew

—you are a delusion said roundly john eglinton to stephen you have brought us all this way to show us a french triangle do you believe your own theory

—no stephen said promptly

—are you going to write it mr best asked you ought to make it a dialogue dont you know like the platonic dialogues wilde wrote

john eclecticon doubly smiled

—well in that case he said i dont see why you should expect payment for it since you dont believe it yourself dowden believes there is some mystery in hamlet but will say no more herr bleibtreu the man piper met in berlin who is working up that rutland theory believes that the secret is hidden in the stratford monument he is going to visit the present duke piper says and prove to him that his ancestor wrote the plays it will come as a surprise to his grace but he believes his theory

i believe o lord help my unbelief that is help me to believe or help me to unbelieve who helps to believe egomen who to unbelieve other chap

—you are the only contributor to dana who asks for pieces of silver then i dont know about the next number fred ryan wants space for an article on economics

—for a guinea stephen said you can publish this interview

buck mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling laughing and then gravely said honeying malice

—i called upon the bard kinch at his summer residence in upper mecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the summa contra gentiles in the company of two gonorrheal ladies fresh nelly and rosalie the coalquay whore

he broke away

—come kinch come wandering aengus of the birds

—longworth is awfully sick he said after what you wrote about that old hake gregory o you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit she gets you a job on the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to jaysus couldnt you do the yeats touch

he went on and down mopping chanting with waving graceful arms

—the most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time one thinks of homer

he stopped at the stairfoot

—i have conceived a play for the mummers he said solemnly

the pillared moorish hall shadows entwined gone the nine mens morrice with caps of indices

in sweetly varying voices buck mulligan read his tablet everyman his own wife or a honeymoon in the hand a national immorality in three orgasms by ballocky mulligan

he turned a happy patchs smirk to stephen saying

—the disguise i fear is thin but listen

he read marcato

—characters
