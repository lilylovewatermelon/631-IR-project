washing off last nights fake blood
from an even faker cut
some poor girls bleeding bleeding
all over everything i own

verse 1
merry christmas hare krishnas
dont you wish you had it as good as i do
nothing new to report from the floor of the airport
oh oh oh
they took my baby
they took it from me
thats the worst thing you could have done to yourselves
now im out for black magic revenge
on all of your friends
theres a pet death coming

chorus
washing off last nights fake blood
from an even faker cut
some poor girls bleeding bleeding
all over everything i own

verse 2
diamond death
theres nothing left
for you and me
but a maker cut down from a family tree
its leaves changing
now everythings gonna change

washing off last nights fake blood
from an even faker cut
some poor girls bleeding bleeding
all over everything i own

bridge
take my shrunken head from your shelf
witch doctor with your potions and spells
youre just another evil girl i will have to forget
its such a fantasy with her i dont have to pretend
that this isnt happening to me again
dont look here when you lose your friends
yeah you can disrobe take off all of your clothes
look at you now youre the ones whos exposed
