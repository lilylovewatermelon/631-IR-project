just like you know your southern stars always going to come back out
i’ll give you everything i got like nobody else you found
open up your heart open up your eyes baby listen to the sound
of my voice when i tell you girl don’t worry i aint ever going to let you down
i want to show you where im from take you for a ride on a long dirt road
let you see let you taste let you feel just a little bit of that moonshine glow
i won’t hold you down or hold you back but i won’t let you go
this aint no one night show

chorus
i heard you looking for a good man
to hold you with some good hands
somebody get you through the bad land
so you looking for a good man
well you looking at a good man now

verse 2
ill climb your tower slay your dragons fight your battles girl
i’ll take a bullet for you i’ll take on the whole world

cam on won’t cha give it a whirl

chorus
