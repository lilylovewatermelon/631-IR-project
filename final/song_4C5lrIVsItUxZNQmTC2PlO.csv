down goes the sun sitting ducking on guitar
up comes the moon twinkle twinkle little star
one and one is two hitching two to make it four
johnny get your guitar lets go go go oh baby

verse 2
johnny plays the guitar at the weekly record hop
he starts to twist and turn and then they wouldnt let him stop
girls so shook up seeing him shaking on the show
everybody starts to holler go go go oh baby

duckwalking on his knees pecking like a hen
looking like a locomotive here he comes again
