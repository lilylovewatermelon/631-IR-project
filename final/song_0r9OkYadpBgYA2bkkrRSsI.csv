long black tulips born in your blue tints
lemongrass eyelids smoke in your slick lips
chocolate chapstick backbeat strat flips
swimming pool spaceships light through the wave tips

prechorus
hot sugar in the afternoon
i wish that we could be real too
hot sugar in the afternoon
i wish that we could be real too

chorus
so cool but we dont talk
hotels and alcohol
pool paintings on the wall
hot rubber on the tar
i dont wanna be around you
just wanna be like you
i dont wanna be around you
just wanna be like

verse 2
bath time cool whip
watermelon juice kiss
esprit gold rims
skin so sunlicked
santal freshness
hologram glasses
put it on plastic
you never been desperate
you might also likeprechorus
hot sugar in the afternoon
i wish that we could be real too
hot sugar in the afternoon
i wish that we could be real too

chorus
so cool but we dont talk
hotels and alcohol
pool paintings on the wall
hot rubber on the tar
i dont wanna be around you
just wanna be like you
i dont wanna be around you
just wanna be like you

break
just wanna be like you
just wanna be like you
just wanna be like you

chorus
so cool but we dont talk
hotels and alcohol
pool paintings on the wall
hot rubber on the tar
i dont wanna be around you
just wanna be like you
i dont wanna be around you
just wanna be like you

so cool
so cool
