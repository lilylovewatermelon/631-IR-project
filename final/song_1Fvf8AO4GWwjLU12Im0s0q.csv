i wrote a goodbye note in lipstick on your arm
when you passed out
i couldnt bring myself to call
except to call it quits

chorus patrick stump
best friends exfriends til the end
better off as lovers and not the other way around
racing through the city windows down
in the back of yellow checkered cars

verse 2 patrick stump
this city says come hell or high water
well im feeling hot and wet
i cant commit to a thing
be it heart or hospital

best friends exfriends til the end
better off as lovers and not the other way around

the tombstones were waiting they were halfengraved
they knew it was over they just didnt know the date
and i cast a spell over the west to make you think of me
the same way i think of you
this is a love song in my own way
happily ever after below the waist

in the back of yellow checkered cars
