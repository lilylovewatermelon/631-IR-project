ill be good i dont care
my whole life sucks anyway
i could feel it in the air today
ill be fine on my own
i got nowhere left to go
you got no one left to turn to now
will you cry when you die
and theres no one by your side
and your bedroom walls are burnin down
or will you take a stand tonight
get your ass away from that light
one more try youll be just fine
do whats right baby drop that knife
i dont wanna watch you bleed watch you bleed
i dont wanna watch you leave ill leave too
i could never live my dream live my dream
i would never live my dream baby i need youyou might also like19embed"
