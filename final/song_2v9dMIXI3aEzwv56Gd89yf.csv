chiquitita tell me whats wrong
youre enchained by your own sorrow
in your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow
how i hate to see you like this
there is no way you can deny it
i can see that youre oh so sad so quiet

verse 2
chiquitita tell me the truth
im a shoulder you can cry on
your best friend im the one you must rely on
you were always sure of yourself
now i see you broken and fettered
how it hurts to see you cry
and how it hurts to see you sad
i hope we can patch it up together

chorus
chiquitita you and i know
how the heartaches come and they go
and the scars theyre leaving
youll be dancing once again
and the pain will end
you will have no time for grieving
chiquitita you and i cry
but the sun is still in the sky
and shining above you
even though you cry
the sun is shining in the sky
let me hear you sing once more
so let me hear you sing some more
like you did before
the way you used to do before
sing a new song chiquitita
try once more like you did before
sing a new song chiquitita

so the walls came tumbling down
and your loves a blownout candle
all is gone and it seems too hard to handle
chiquitita tell me the truth
there is no way you can deny it
i see that youre oh so sad so quiet

chorus
chiquitita you and i know
how the heartaches come and they go
and the scars theyre leaving
you and i we know
how all the heartaches come and go
youll be dancing once again
you’ll be dancing once again
and the pain will end
and all the pain you take will end
you will have no time for grieving
chiquitita you and i cry
but the sun is still in the sky
and shining above you
even though you cry
the sun is shining in the sky
let me hear you sing once more
so let me hear you sing some more
like you did before
the way you used to do before
sing a new song chiquitita
try once more like you did before
sing a new song chiquitita
outro
try once more like you did before
