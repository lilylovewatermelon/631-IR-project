i remember what you told me
said i wasnt made right
said i wasnt cut right
thats why im so lonely mm
cant turn a ho into a housewife
that i was just a homie a fun girl
i can still be your day one girl mm
i dont understand it
takes me out of the categories of marriage
is it cause i know what i want just like you
cause i make my own money and my own moves
love who i want and fuck who i choose to
dont take no shit and wont be used

chorus
but i guess that makes me undesirable
guess that makes you so attractive oh
guess that makes me undesirable oh
guess that makes you so attractive oh yeah
