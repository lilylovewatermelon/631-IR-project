playin a gosdin song
in a smoky bar

call me hick hillbilly hell im proud to be what makes me

verse 2
i like a 60s truck
the kind thats solid steel
the kind that always runs
it takes a man to turn that wheel

chorus
if that makes me a little old school
go ahead and call me yesterdays old fool
if that makes me a little throwback
throw it at me dont worry i can take that
call me hick hillbilly hell im proud to be what makes me
