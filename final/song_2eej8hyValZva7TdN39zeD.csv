its been a long time coming and im still not there almost to japan
just got to get into the air then off the ground cant wait but kind of scared
to float among the clouds suspended 12 rounds but im bound for destiny
saving grace from sanity for sure some more request a cold publishing and bound from another soul what we see is probably chuck chiva city he knows that the love ring sounds good to me
coach class after my birthday pass blast off for unknown territory que sera
whatever i suggest im the distinguished guest im blessed any wishes last minute requests
quench my needs its almost unreal all the things im seeing
makes me appreciate all gods human beings
in a special way some things that a rhyme cant say let me start from the heart
i just want to state

hook

verse 2
its an intimidating task flipping the crowds making magic over and over
i take a stab at it as a ritual predicting to the operation the attraction is spiritual
rap is habitual have me feeling higher than a sentinel damn im strung on it who would have thunk it
that when i first begun it for fun writing rhymes to stack em one by one now im iller than radiation
plan on keep spitting til im cremated reincarnated then became my name at the top keeping focused like a spotlight
staying up all night writing rhymes by starlight real deep with it
20 000 leagues beneath the hype im impotent intimate same with life twists and turns perks and achievements
i get home back im speaking because it needs to be heard i know i have power so i use it to infuse my words

verse 3
i still cant believe it im stunned
land of the rising sun here i come
im here next stop lower eastern hemisphere
hip hops hot all around the globe
witness culture unfold before me
absorb it in and write the story corny as it sounds it makes me want to cry
i was born chosen to live this life one soul
worlds to explore im going down undercover me fans wont abandon me
trainers love me i get my own stage feel the sound brutality
im 1000 miles away so things a rhyme cant say let me start from the heart and sincerely state
