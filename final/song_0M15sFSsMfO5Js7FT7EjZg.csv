i was born in a big grey cloud
screaming out a love song
all the broken chords and unnamed cries
what a place to come from
i wish to remain nameless
and live without shame
cause whats in a name boy
i still remain the same

chorus
you can call it what you want
you can call me anything you want
you can call us what you want
you can call me anything you want

verse 2
everybody lets you down
what you want what you want
in this brief hole of a town
all the different souls rushing out
what you want what you want
tell me what youre running from
i know everybody lets you down
and ill do the same
ill do the same
but know ill always be around
this can remain the same
what you want what you want
