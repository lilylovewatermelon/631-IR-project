ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh
yeah

verse 1
i thought about
leavin but i couldnt even get outta bed
im hangin cause i couldnt get a ride outta town
now anyone who really wanted me to be down
come round

verse 2
i thought about
singin but i couldnt member all of the words
breakin but i couldnt get the pieces apart
laughin never knowing what the joke was about
now im down

chorus
and i wonder how i never got the burn
and if im ever gonna learn
how lonely people make a life
one strain at a time

verse 3
forgot about
everything and everyone i needed before
tryin to get a handle on a reason to shine
pickin up the pieces that are falling behind
takes time
