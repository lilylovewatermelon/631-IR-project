watching the video that you sent me
the one where youre showering with wet hair dripping
you know that im obsessed with your body
but its the way you smile that does it for me

chorus
its so sweet knowing that you love me
though we dont need to say it to each other sweet
knowing that i love you and running my fingers through your hair
its so sweet

verse 2
watching the video where youre lying
in your red lingerie ten times nightly
you know i think your skins the perfect color
but its always your eyes that pull me under

chorus
its so sweet knowing that you love me
though we dont need to say it to each other sweet
knowing that i love you and running my fingers through your hair
its so sweet

bridge
and i will gladly break it i will gladly break my heart for you
and i will gladly break it i will gladly break my heart for you
and i will gladly break it i will gladly break my heart for you
and i will gladly break it i will gladly break my heart for you

knowing that i love you and running my fingers through your hair
