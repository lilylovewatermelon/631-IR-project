satan you know where i lie
gently i go into that good night

chorus 1
all our lives get complicated
search for pleasures overrated
never armed our souls
for what the future would hold
when we were innocent

verse 2
angels lend me your might
forfeit all my lives to get just one right

chorus 2
all those colors long since faded
all our smiles are confiscated
never were we told
wed be bought and sold
when we were innocent yeah

bridge
yeah this prayer is for me tonight
this far down that line and still aint got it right

oh and while confessions not yet stated
our next sin is contemplated
never did we know
what the future would hold
or that wed be bought and sold
when we were innocent innocent
when we were innocent1embed"
