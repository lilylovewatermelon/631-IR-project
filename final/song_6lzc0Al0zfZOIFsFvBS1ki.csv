im walkin fast through the traffic lights
busy streets and busy lives
and all we know is touch and go
we are alone with our changing minds
we fall in love til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

chorus
and i never i never
saw you comin
and ill never ill never
be the same

verse 2
you come around and the armor falls
pierce the room like a cannonball
now all we know is dont let go
we are alone just you and me
up in your room and our slates are clean
just twin fire signs four blue eyes

prechorus
so you were never a saint and i loved in shades of wrong
we learn to live with the pain mosaic broken hearts
but this love is brave and wild

this is the golden age of somethin good
and right and real
