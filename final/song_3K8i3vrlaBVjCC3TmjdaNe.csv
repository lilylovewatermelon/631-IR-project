hey

verse 1 chris brown
turn the lights on if you afraid of the dark
pay it forward dusk til dawn death do us part
see the moonlight and sun rays above between us two huh
we are shootin stars huh one red one blue

dont blink youll miss the chance
its deep inside
all these fireworks anticipation
a new revelation
freedom without a care
