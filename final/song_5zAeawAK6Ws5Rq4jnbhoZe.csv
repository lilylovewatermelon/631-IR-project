whats this your kiss
is as cold as fallen snow
and your eyes cannot disguise
theres a secret in your soul
well did you think that i
was born yesterday
well i may be blind
but i can hear what you wont say

chorus
i feel it comin
i feel it comin onx2
this love is dead and gone
i know it wont be long
i feel it comin on

verse 2
a cold spell in hell
thats when i take you back
if you have been untrue
theres nothing left to do but pack your bags
and sleep in the bed that you made
and youll wake up cryin
callin out my name my name

bridge
comin on like the morning sun
like a summer rain
like the river runs
like the ocean waves
like the stormy sea
like the flood of tears
wash over me
