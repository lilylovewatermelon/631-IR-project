mumbling
“edelweiss“ 
i  couldn’t catch
your eyes
“mama
what  went wrong
forgot  why i’m still here
silent calls”

chorus
you  slowly bend over the table
our sleepless bodies tumbling down
still watching scenes from 1994
i don’t feel anything at all

verse 2
morning 
red like wine
got me trapped under
venetian blinds
one more
piece of cake
round and round they go
i’m porcelain
see men i trust liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likechorus
you slowly bend over the table
our sleepless bodies tumbling down
still watching scenes from 1994
i don’t feel anything at all2embed"
