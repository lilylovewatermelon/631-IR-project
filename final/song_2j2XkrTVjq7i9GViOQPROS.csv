good and bad i swear ive had them
both theyre overrated
but isnt it fun
when you get hold of one
some gone bad and some gone back
the good ones all get taken
im callin your bluff
you aint strong enough

prechorus
wait and pray youll pick on me the day i raise my hand
guess that ive been blessed but ill be damned

chorus
halo god only knows
right behind me everywhere i go
halo god only knows
right behind me everywhere i go

verse 2
say your prayers when you get scared
and pray youre gonna make it
and then when youre done
you keep fuckin up
one day soon ill disappear
and if youll come ill take you
somewhere to go
to keep from growin old
