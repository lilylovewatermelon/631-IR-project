tonight ill have a look and try to find my face again
buried beneath this house my spirit screams and dies again
out back a monster wears a cloak of persian leather
behind the tv screen ive fallen to my knees

prechorus
i said youve got me where you want me again and i cant turn away
im hanging by a thread and im feeling like ill fall
im stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday
i want to get away i need to get away

verse 2
blanket of silence makes me want to sink my teeth in deep
burn all the evidence of fabricated disbelief
pull back the curtains took a look into your eyes
my tongue has now become a platform for your lies

prechorus
i said youve got me where you want me again and i cant turn away
im hanging by a thread and im feeling like ill fall
im stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday
i want to get away i need to get away

chorus
now you know yeah youve got my back against the wall
oh god i aint got no other place to hide
chained down like a sitting duck just waiting for the fall
you know yeah youve got my back against the wall
see cage the elephant liveget tickets as low as 399you might also likeverse 3
deep in the jungle camouflaged by all the fallen leaves
a hand holds up the sky while shamefully i make my plea
the altars calling but my legs wont seem to stand
guess im a coward scared to face the man i am

prechorus
i said youve got me where you want me again and i cant turn away
im hanging by a thread and im feeling like ill fall
im stuck here in between these shadows of my yesterday
i want to get away i need to get away

chorus
now you know yeah youve got my back against the wall
oh god i aint got no other place to hide
chained down like a sitting duck just waiting for the fall
you know yeah youve got my back against the wall
now you know yeah youve got my back against the wall
oh god i aint got no other place to hide
chained down like a sitting duck just waiting for the fall
you know yeah youve got my back against the wall9embed"
