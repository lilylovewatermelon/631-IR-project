there is a house built out of stone
wooden floors walls and window sills
tables and chairs worn by all of the dust
this is a place where i dont feel alone
this is a place where i feel at home

chorus
and i built a home
for you for me
until it disappeared
from me from you
and now its time to leave
and turn to dust

verse 2
out in the garden where we planted the seeds
there is a tree as old as me
branches were sewn by the color of green
ground had arose and passed its knees

verse 3
by the cracks of his skin i climbed to the top
i climbed the tree to see the world
when the gusts came around to blow me down
held on as tightly as you held onto me
held on as tightly as you held onto me

and i built a home
for you for me
until it disappeared
from me from you
and now its time to leave
and time to die53embed"
