livin my life in a slow hell
different girl every night at the hotel
i aint seen the sunshine in three damn days
been fuelin up on cocaine and whiskey
wish i had a good girl to miss me
lord i wonder if ill ever change my ways

chorus kid rock
i put your picture away
sat down and cried today
i cant look at you while im lying next to her
i put your picture away
sat down and cried today
i cant look at you while im lying next to her oohooh

verse 2 sheryl crow
i called you last night in the hotel
everyone knows but they wont tell
but their halfhearted smiles tell me something just aint right
ive been waitin on you for a long time
fuelin up on heartaches and cheap wine
i aint heard from you in three damn nights

chorus sheryl crow
i put your picture away
i wonder where youve been
i cant look at you while im lyin next to him ooh
i put your picture away
i wonder where youve been
i cant look at you while im lyin next to him ooh

i saw you yesterday with an old friend
it was the same old same how have you been
since youve been gone my worlds been dark and grey
you reminded me of brighter days
i hoped you were comin home to stay
i was headed to church
i was off to drink you away drink you away
i thought about you for a long time
cant seem to get you off my mind
i cant understand why were living life this way
