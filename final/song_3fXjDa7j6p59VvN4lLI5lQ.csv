i want to keep my money
and give away absolutely nothing
to the government who moderates my spending
and obliterates depending on what time of the year
brutality is near
in the form of income tax
id rather take a fucking axe
to my face blow up this place
with you all in it id do it in a minute

chorus
if i could write off your murder
id save all of my receipts
because id rather you be dead
than lose a tiny shred of what i made this fiscal year
id rather you be dead than ponder parting with my second home
id rather you be dead than consider not opening a restaurant
id rather you be dead
id rather you be dead

bridge
prepare the laser beam
im gonna use it tonight
engage the laser beam
its gonna end your life
were gonna use it tonight

if i could write off your murder
id save all of my receipts
because id rather you be dead
than lose a tiny shred of what i made this fiscal year
id rather you be dead than ponder parting with my second home
id rather you be dead than consider not opening a restaurant
id rather you be dead
id rather you be dead now

outro
be dead now
be dead now
be dead now
