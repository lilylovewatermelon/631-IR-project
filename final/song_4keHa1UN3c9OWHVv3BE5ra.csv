why switch like different seasons
i give that shit a weekend
hollywood dont need a reason
to make you think you look bigger than you are

chorus
mileage politics and violence
at least somebodys drivin
all you need to fall in love
mileage politics and violence
at least somebodys drivin
all you need to fall in love

postchorus
all you need to fall in love

bridge
you wont find heaven not in these hills
boy you shouldnt be here
all you need to fall in love
you wont find heaven not in these hills
boy you shouldnt be here
all you need to fall in love

verse
when she arrived it was 210 at night
we had sex then you cried was the best in your life
and the last time we spoke if we shoot for july
you can still make your mind but i cant save your life
baby sorry but i rarely do this you cant carry me through this
i just wanna shine like barracudas kid do this shit for mammy sue
this shit aint nothin new this this i knew since i was a jit
clean my room and pray for this
eat my dinner then go back to whatever finna make me rich
whole lotta feelin that you cant dismiss
i was somewhere stuck in a hotel room
we was serving to the kids no waitresses
all this shit come back around
homie dont get too down
i got your back sometime
ride til the wheels fall off
and if this shit dont sell
she said youll still be my favorite
and i wish i could save her but
do this shit for mammy sue this shit aint nothin new huh
do this shit for apollonia bitch i thought i told you ayy
see dominic fike liveget tickets as low as 186you might also likeoutro

you know i am in a booth
shaped like a u24embed"
