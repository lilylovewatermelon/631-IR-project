head underwater and they tell me
to breathe easy for a while
the breathing gets harder even i know that
made room for me its too soon to see
if im happy in your hands
im unusually hard to hold on to

prechorus
blank stares at blank pages
no easy way to say this
you mean well but you make this hard on me

chorus
im not gonna write you a love song
cause you asked for it cause you need one
you see im not gonna write you a love song
cause you tell me its make or break in this
if youre on your way
im not gonna write you to stay
if all you have is leavin ima need a better reason
to write you a love song today
yeah today yeah

verse 2
i learned the hard way that they all say
things you wanna hear
and my heavy heart sinks deep down under you
and your twisted words your help just hurts
you are not what i thought you were
hello to high and dry

convinced me to please you
made me think that i need this too
im trying to let you hear me as i am

chorus
im not gonna write you a love song
cause you asked for it cause you need one
you see im not gonna write you a love song
cause you tell me its make or break in this
if youre on your way
im not gonna write you to stay
if all you have is leavin ima need a better reason
to write you a love song today

bridge

with daylight my guide gone
cause i believe theres a way
