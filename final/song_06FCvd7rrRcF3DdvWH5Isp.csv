i need some water
something came over me
way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
too close to comfort
as blood rush my favorite vein
heartbeat racing like a junkies
i just need you to want me
am i asking too much
let me put the head in
ooh i dont want more than that girl i respect the cat
i promise just a touch
let me put the head in
if its okay she said its okay

interlude kendrick lamar  rat boy
yeah i need everybodys motherfuckin hands up right now
i need everybodys motherfuckin—
door and his nike air rattles
rush the fire exit no time for battles
well i i never expected
this that new shit
this that new new shit

verse 1 kendrick lamar
wake up in the mornin thinkin bout money kick your feet up
watch you a comedy take a shit then roll some weed up
go hit you a lick go fuck on a bitch

or maybe some kicks and make you—

door and his nike air rattles
rush the fire exit no time for battles
well i i never expected

verse 1 contd kendrick lamar
wake up in the morning thinking bout money kick your feet up
watch you a comedy—hol up
wake up in the mornin thinkin bout money kick your feet up
watch you a comedy take a shit then roll some weed up
go hit you a lick go fuck on a bitch dont go to work today
cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
hang with the homies stunt on your baby mama
sip some lean go get a pistol shoot out the window
bet your favorite team play you some madden
go to the club or your mama house
whatever you doing just make it count i need some water
wake up in the morning thinking bout money kick your feet up
hop in the shower put on your makeup lace your weave up
touch on yourself call up your nigga tell him he aint shit
credit card scam get you a visa make it pay your rent
hop on the gram flex on the bitches that be hatin on you
pop you a pill call up your bitches have em waitin on you
go to the club have you some fun make that ass bounce
its whatever just make it count
chorus kendrick lamar
i need some water

way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
too close to comfort
as blood rush my favorite vein
heartbeat racing like a junkies
i just need you to want me

ooh i dont want more than that girl i respect the cat
i promise just a touch

verse 2 kendrick lamar
i wake in the morning my head spinning from the last night
both in a trance feelings are dead—what a fast life
manager called the lobby call is 1130
did this before promised myself id be a hour early
room full of clothes bag full of money call it loose change
fumbled my jewelry 100k i lost a new chain
hop on the bird hit the next city for another m
take me a nap then do it again
we all woke up tryna tune to the daily news
looking for confirmation hoping election wasnt true
all of us worried all of us buried in our feelings deep
none of us married to his proposal make us feel cheap
stale and sad distraught and mad tell the neighbor bout it—
bet they agree parade the streets with your voice proudly
time passing things change
reverting back to our daily programs stuck in our ways
lust
bridge kendrick lamar
lately i feel like i been lusting over the fame
lately we lust on the same routine of shame
lately lately lately my lust been heightened lately
lately its all contradiction lately im not here
lately i lust over self lust turn into fear
lately in james 44 says
friend of the world is enemy of the lord
brace yourself lust is all yours

chorus kendrick lamar
i need some water
something came over me
way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
too close to comfort
as blood rush my favorite vein
heartbeat racing like a junkies
i just need you to want me
am i asking too much
let me put the head in
ooh i dont want more than that girl i respect the cat
i promise just a touch
let me put the head in
if its okay she said its okay133embed"
