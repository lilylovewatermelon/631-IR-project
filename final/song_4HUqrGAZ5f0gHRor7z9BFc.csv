there’s no room for lies
and everyone’s waitin for you

bridge
too far gone and im by the phone
and im all alone and im awful lonely by the wayside

refrain
im by the wayside
im by the wayside
im by the wayside

by the wayside

black eyes open wide
it’s time to testify
there’s no room for lies
and everyone’s waitin for you
