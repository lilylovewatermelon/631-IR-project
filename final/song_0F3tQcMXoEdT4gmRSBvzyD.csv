knuckles clenched to white
as the landing gear detracts for flight
my heads a balloon
inflating with the altitude

i watch the patchwork farms slow fade into the oceans arms
and from here they cant see me stare
the stale taste of recycled air
i watch the patchwork farms slow fade into the oceans arms
calm down release your cares
the stale taste of recycled airembed"
