it only hurts this much right now
was what i was thinkin the whole time
breathe in breathe through breathe deep breathe out
ill be gettin over you my whole life

prechorus
you know how scared i am of elevators
never trust it if it rises fast
it cant last

chorus
uhoh im fallin in love
oh no im fallin in love again
oh im fallin in love
i thought the plane was goin down
howd you turn it right around

verse 2
it only feels this raw right now
lost in the labyrinth of my mind
break up break free break through break down
you would break your back to make me break a smile

prechorus
you know how much i hate
that everybody just expects me to bounce back
just like that

uhoh im fallin in love
oh no im fallin in love again
oh im fallin in love
i thought the plane was goin down
howd you turn it right around
uhoh im fallin in love
oh no im fallin in love again
oh im fallin in love
i thought the plane was goin down
howd you turn it right around
