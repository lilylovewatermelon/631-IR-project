i am missing someone but i dont know who
now im standing alone and im trying to remember
sometimes i wonder how i ever started loving you

noontime wind can you blow for me one more time
and take me on back to the start
where the midnight moon shines so bright
nearly pulled us up to heaven by the strings of our heart

take me back josephine to that cold and dark december
i am missing someone but i dont know who
now im standing alone and im trying to remember
sometimes i wonder how i ever started loving you

morning sun shine on me
come light inside my window
and rest on my brow
kiss my eyes when i sleep
and carry me back home
if my dreams will allow

take me back josephine to that cold and dark december
i am missing someone but i dont know who
now im standing alone and im trying to remember
sometimes i wonder how i ever started loving you
