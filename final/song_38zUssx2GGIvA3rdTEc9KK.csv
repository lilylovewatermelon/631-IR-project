oh oh oh oh

verse 1
never even knew what you meant to convey
you handed us a retrospect
till you didnt have a thing to say
no one questions you
even someone set out to do
now its nothing but dead and gone

refrain
lets go
lets go
lets go
lets go

verse 2
better with a lie than the worlds ever seen
you wanted all the recognition
until you lost the means
no one talks to you
even someone set out to do
take a number your time has come

chorus
cause youre another one
hey yeah
youre another soul to feed to the mans machine
hey yeah
youre another one
hey yeah
youre another soul to feed to the mans machine
hey yeah

my excuses lay me down
my emotions make me drown
my endeavor takes blame
at least i have a name

chorus
cause youre another one
hey yeah
youre another soul to feed to the mans machine
hey yeah
cause youre another one
hey yeah
youre another soul to feed to the mans machine
hey yeah
cause youre another one
