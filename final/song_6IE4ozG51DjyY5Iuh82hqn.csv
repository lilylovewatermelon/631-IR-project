no cheap cologne whenever i shhshh
success never smelled so sweet
i stink of success the new black elite
they say my black card bear the mark of the beast

im all dressed up with nowhere to go uh

verse 2 kanye west
yeah its all messed up when its nowhere to go
so we wont take the time out til we reach the top
from parolees that hold gs sold keys low keys
we like the promised land of the ogs
in the past if you picture events like a black tie
what the last thing you expect to see black guys
whats the life expectancy for black guys
the systems working effectively thats why
ill be a real man take care of your son
every problem you had before this day is now done
new crib watch a movie
cause there aint nothin on the news but the blues
hit the mall pick up some gucci
now aint nothing new but your shoes
sunday morning praise the lord
you the girl that jesus had been saving me for
so lets savor this moment and take it to the floor
black excellence truly yours55embed"
