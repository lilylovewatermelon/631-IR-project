feel your every heartbeat
feel you on these empty nights
calm the ache stop the shakes
you clear my mind
youre my escape
from this messed up place
cause you let me forget
you numb my pain

prechorus
how can i tell you just all that you are
what you do to me

youre better than drugs
your love is like wine
feel you coming on so fast
feel you coming to get me high
youre better than drugs
addicted for life
feel you coming on so fast
feel you coming on to get me high

verse 2
feel you when im restless
feel you when i cannot cope
youre my addiction my prescription my antidote
you kill the poison
ease the suffering
calm the rage when im afraid
