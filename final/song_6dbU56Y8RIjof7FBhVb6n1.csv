verse 1
coming to you honey on the east side runnin and i aint got time to waste
jump into the car in the back seat lovin but you keep me on the chase

tempted by your tainted love i surely like for you to come inside my crystal ball what can i do

and i dont what to do to get next to you next to you
every night every day you just push me away
tell me what should i do to get next to you next to you

i wrote about you baby in this song cause i want to get next to you
