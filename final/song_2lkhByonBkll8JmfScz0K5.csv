verse 1
i  got lost down in rio
i  was running from the fbi
yeah they had me on some charges back in san anton
you know i never got the reason why
i  turned up in a casino
my  hands up and ready to fight
the whole damn mariachi band
for  playing the same tune twice

chorus
i get high cause i want to
i get low every day
i get high cause i want to
gotta  do something
to keep the blues away

verse 2
you know the last time that i seen her
my girl was lookin mighty fine
starin through the glass at a police station
just tryna hear the end of the line
i know i said it and i mean it
i am tryin to change my life
but when times get tough
yeah the tough get hard
you can cut me with a butter knife
