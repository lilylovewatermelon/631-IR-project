flowers of the fields
here today vanish in the wind
go to sleep you may not wake up with the morning sunrise
move so fast baby right before you close your eyes

chorus
so you better run
move fast like the bullet from the gun
over the hills salvation rests in the sun
eternity baby rests in the sun
so wont you come
so wont you come baby
so wont you come
so wont you come baby

verse 2
making plans ooh bop bop bop
for tomorrow ooh bop bop bop
even though you dont ooh bop bop bop
dont know your fate ooh bop bop bop
blind eyes ooh bop bop bop
leaning on a whole dead faith ooh bop bop bop
sink your feet into ooh bop bop bop
a concrete foundation ooh bop bop bop

so you better run
move fast like the bullet from the gun
over the hills salvation rests in the sun
eternity baby rests in the sun
so wont you come
so wont you come baby
so wont you come
so wont you come

bridge
i wanna tell you tell you about the good news good news
i wanna tell you tell you about the good news good news
i wanna tell you tell you about the good news good news
i wanna tell you tell you

chorus
so you better run
move fast like the bullet from the gun
over the hills salvation rests in the sun
eternity baby rests in the sun
so wont you come
so wont you come baby
so wont you come
so wont you come babyembed"
