your lips your eyes dont wanna let go
your skin on mine im losing control
hear the rumble in your chest
feel the wind comin off your breath
your curves aint slowin me down
aint nothing gonna stop us now

chorus
youre fire im lightning were burnin at the core
fallin and crashin girl were a perfect storm
every time our hearts collide
i can feel our love come to life
its insane baby
were like thunder in the rain

verse 2
twisted tangled like a hurricane
we shake these walls like an earthquake
hear the rumble in your chest
feel the wind comin off your breath
the way youre callin out my name
makes me hard to contain

chorus
youre fire im lightning were burnin at the core
fallin and crashin girl were a perfect storm
every time our hearts collide
i can feel our love come to life
its insane baby
were like thunder in the rain
were like thunder in the rain
