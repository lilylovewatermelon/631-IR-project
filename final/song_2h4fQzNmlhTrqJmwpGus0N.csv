i can still see your blue sky blue eyes hangin on a mango kiss
hear the waves and the breeze and the joshua trees
was just about as good as it gets
taste the salt on the rim feel the sand on your skin
and the wild in the wind like im right there again

chorus
under a moon over mexico
holdin onto you as the low tide rolls
whatever that buzz was i aint felt it since
but i cant seem to let it go
and there was a shine in the dark a flame from a spark
and a lime in a pacifico
under a moon over mexico

verse 2
the second i left i was kickin myself
cause i knew i shouldve stayed
still tequila love drunk from us wakin up
under the cabo palm leaf shade
and its crazy i know but id give anything to go
to you and me on that coast in the midnight glow

chorus
of a moon over mexico
holdin onto you as the low tide rolls
whatever that buzz was i aint felt it since
but i cant seem to let it go
and there was a shine in the dark a flame from a spark
and a lime in a pacifico
under a moon over mexico
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likebridge
taste the salt on the rim feel the sand on your skin
and the wild in the wind like im right there again

chorus
under a moon over mexico
holdin onto you as the low tide rolls
whatever that buzz was i aint felt it since
but i cant seem to let it go
and there was a shine in the dark a flame from a spark
and a lime in a pacifico
under a moon over mexico
under a moon over mexico
