in the tylers flat jackie is decorating the white plastic christmas tree and putting presents under it she looks at the one for rose and gazes wistfully into the distance

blake in other words theyve got a ship and the probe is on board
llewellyn but if theyre not from the surface then they might not be from mars itself maybe theyre not actual martians

spaceship
alex you killed them
doctor what do you think big fellow are they dead
sycorax we allow them to live
doctor allow youve no choice i mean thats all blood control is a cheap bit of voodoo scares the pants off you but thats as far as it goes its like hypnosis you can hypnotise someone to walk like a chicken or sing like elvis you cant hypnotise them to death survival instincts too strong
sycorax blood control was just one form of conquest i can summon the armada and take this world by force
doctor well yeah you could yeah you could do that of course you could but why look at these people these human beings consider their potential from the day they arrive on the planet and blinking step into the sun there is more to see than can ever be seen more to do than no hold on sorry thats the lion king but the point still stands leave them alone
sycorax or what

the leader is the more experienced swordsman the doctor retreats up a tunnel
doctor bit of fresh air
