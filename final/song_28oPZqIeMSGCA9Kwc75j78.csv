evidently we cant work it out
i guess that courage aint allowed
evidently youre not in the mood
and everything i say just bothers you

prechorus
you built this fortress
i stumble towards it

verse 2
evidently you look furious
walls up and i know youre serious
evidently im not always there
but you left and i looked everywhere

prechorus
you built this fortress
i stumble towards it
i stumble towards it

chorus
and guilty i may be
but dont give up on me
in the wake of the odyssey
we will still be thick as thieves
you and me still thick as thieves

evidently this is my mistake
lost touch but i think ive been replaced
evidently somethings gotta give
id play it safe but i know youre worth the risk

prechorus
you built this fortress
i stumble towards it
i stumble towards it

chorus
and guilty i may be
but dont give up on me
in the wake of the odyssey
we will still be thick as thieves
you and me still thick as thieves

bridge
i got an escape if you want it
we can leave first thing in the morning
well be back before you know it
were as thick as thieves

chorus
and guilty i may be
but dont give up on me
in the wake of the odyssey
we will still be thick as thieves
you and me still thick as thieves
outro
and guilty i may be guilty i may be
but dont give up on me dont you give up on me
in the wake of the odyssey you and me
we will still be thick as thievesembed"
