was the dial tone ring in my ear
if i could go back in time
id say those three words
i shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you

and this cant be saved if you cant be found
you hung up and left me for dead on the ground
you didnt even say goodbye
i shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you
i shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you

now that youre gone im wasting away
the life has been siphoned right out of my veins
if i could go back in time
id say those three words
i shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you

and this cant be saved if you cant be found
you hung up and left me for dead on the ground
you didnt even say goodbye
i shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you
i shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you

when you said those three words
i kinda freaked out
when you said them first my jaw hit the ground
shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you
shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you

you hung up and left me for dead on the ground
you didnt even say goodbye
and this cant be saved
and this cant be saved
if you cant be found
if you cant be found
and this cant be saved
i shoulda woulda coulda said it back to you
i shoulda woulda coulda said it back to youembed"
