i hope they dont work him to his grave
this ones for my mother
for keepin me fed everyday
this ones for my brother
so that they never make him their slave
this ones for my sister
that she might find someone to love her in the right way
i aint got no reason left to be afraid
no
i aint got no reason left to be afraid
i aint got no reason left to be afraid
this ones for my father
and for that crazy look in his eye
this ones for my mother
that she might be a child and cry
this ones for my brother
for showin me theres things that money cant buy
this ones for my sister
for teachin me to always keep my weapons by my side
i aint gonna sit and let this world go by
no
i aint gonna sit and let this world go by
i aint gonna sit and let this world go by

for crazy screams flyin up the stairs
this ones for my family
cause theyre the only ones who were there
this ones for the card game
that we might all play out our hands
and this ones for my family
cause i guess i know exactly who i am
and i guess thats thanks to them
oh i guess thats thanks to themembed"
