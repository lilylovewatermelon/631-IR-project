it had a perfectly round door like a porthole painted green with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle the door opened on to a tubeshaped hall like a tunnel a very comfortable tunnel without smoke with panelled walls and floors tiled and carpeted provided with polished chairs and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats  the hobbit was fond of visitors the tunnel wound on and on going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill  the hill as all the people for many miles round called it  and many little round doors opened out of it first on one side and then on another no going upstairs for the hobbit bedrooms bathrooms cellars pantries lots of these wardrobes he had whole rooms devoted to clothes kitchens diningrooms all were on the same floor and indeed on the same passage the best rooms were all on the lefthand side going in for these were the only ones to have windows deepset round windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond sloping down to the river

this hobbit was a very welltodo hobbit and his name was baggins the bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of the hill for time out of mind and people considered them very respectable not only because most of them were rich but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected you could tell what a baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking him this is a story of how a baggins had an adventure found himself doing and saying things altogether unexpected he may have lost the neighbours respect but he gainedwell you will see whether he gained anything in the end

the mother of our particular hobbit what is a hobbit i suppose hobbits need some description nowadays since they have become rare and shy of the big people as they call us they are or were a little people about half our height and smaller than the bearded dwarves hobbits have no beards there is little or no magic about them except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off they are inclined to be at in the stomach they dress in bright colours chiefly green and yellow wear no shoes because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads which is curly have long clever brown fingers goodnatured faces and laugh deep fruity laughs especially after dinner which they have twice a day when they can get it now you know enough to go on with as i was saying the mother of this hobbit  of bilbo baggins that is  was the fabulous belladonna took one of the three remarkable daughters of the old took head of the hobbits who lived across the water the small river that ran at the foot of the hill it was often said in other families that long ago one of the took ancestors must have taken a fairy wife that was of course absurd but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbitlike about them  and once in a while members of the tookclan would go and have adventures they discreetly disappeared and the family hushed it up but the fact remained that the tooks were not as respectable as the bagginses though they were undoubtedly richer not that belladonna took ever had any adventures after she became mrs bungo baggins bungo that was bilbos father built the most luxurious hobbithole for her and partly with her money that was to be found either under the hill or over the hill or across the water and there they remained to the end of their days still it is probable that bilbo her only son although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father got something a bit queer in his makeup from the took side something that only waited for a chance to come out the chance never arrived until bilbo baggins was grown up being about fifty years old or so and living in the beautiful hobbithole built by his father which i have just described for you until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably

by some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world when there was less noise and more green and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous and bilbo baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to his woolly toes neatly brushed  gandalf came by gandalf if you had heard only a quarter of what i have heard about him and i have only heard very little of all there is to hear you would be prepared for any sort i of remarkable tale tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went in the most extraordinary fashion he had not been down that way under the hill for ages and ages not since his friend the old took died in fact and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like he had been away over the hill and across the water on business of his own since they were all small hobbitboys and hobbitgirls

all that the unsuspecting bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff he had a tall pointed blue hat a long grey cloak a silver scarf over which a white beard hung down below his waist and immense black boots good morning said bilbo and he meant it the sun was shining and the grass was very green but gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat what do you mean be said do you wish me a good morning or mean that it is a good morning whether i want not or that you feel good this morning or that it is morning to be good on

all of them at once said bilbo and a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors into the bargain if you have a pipe about you sit down and have a fill of mine theres no hurry we have all the day before us then bilbo sat down on a seat by his door crossed his legs and blew out a beautiful grey ring of smoke that sailed up into the air without breaking and floated away over the hill

very pretty said gandalf but i have no time to blow smokerings this morning i am looking for someone to share in an adventure that i am arranging and its very difficult to find anyone

i should think so  in these parts we are plain quiet folk and have no use for adventures nasty disturbing uncomfortable things make you late for dinner i cant think what anybody sees in them said our mr baggins and stuck one thumb behind his braces and blew out another even bigger smokering then he took out his morning letters and begin to read pretending to take no more notice of the old man he had decided that he was not quite his sort and wanted him to go away but the old man did not move he stood leaning on his stick and gazing at the hobbit without saying anything till bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even a little cross

good morning he said at last we dont want any adventures here thank you you might try over the hill or across the water by this he meant that the conversation was at an end

what a lot of things you do use good morning for said gandalf now you mean that you want to get rid of me and that it wont be good till i move off

not at all not at all my dear sir let me see i dont think i know your name

yes yes my dear sir  and i do know your name mr bilbo baggins and you do know my name though you dont remember that i belong to it i am gandalf and gandalf means me to think that i should have lived to be goodmorninged by belladonna tooks son as if i was selling buttons at the door gandalf gandalf good gracious me not the wandering wizard that gave old took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came undone till ordered not the fellow who used to tell such wonderful tales at parties about dragons and goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses and the unexpected luck of widows sons not the man that used to make such particularly excellent fireworks i remember those old took used to have them on midsummers eve splendid they used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening you will notice already that mr baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe also that he was very fond of flowers dear me she went on not the gandalf who was responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the blue for mad adventures anything from climbing trees to visiting elves  or sailing in ships sailing to other shores bless me life used to be quite inter  i mean you used to upset things badly in these parts once upon a time i beg your pardon but i had no idea you were still in business where else should i be said the wizard all the same i am pleased to find you remember something about me you seem to remember my fireworks kindly at any rate land that is not without hope indeed for your old grandfather tooks sake and for the sake of poor belladonna i will give you what you asked for
i beg your pardon i havent asked for anything

yes you have twice now my pardon i give it you in fact i will go so far as to send you on this adventure very amusing for me very good for you and profitable too very likely if you ever get over it

sorry i dont want any adventures thank you not today good morning

but please come to tea  any time you like why not tomorrow come tomorrow

goodbye

with that the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door and shut it as quickly as he dared not to seen rude wizards after all are wizards

what on earth did i ask him to tea for he said to himself as he went

to the pantry he had only just had break fast but he thought a cake or two and a drink of something would do him good after his fright gandalf in the meantime was still standing outside the door and laughing long but quietly after a while he stepped up and with the spike of his staff scratched a queer sign on the hobbits beautiful green frontdoor then he strode away just about the time when bilbo was finishing his second cake and beginning to think that he had escape adventures very well

the next day he had almost forgotten about gandalf he did not remember things very well unless he put them down on his engagement tablet like this

gandalf a wednesday yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of the kind just before teatime there came a tremendous ring on the frontdoor bell and then he remembered he rushed and put on the kettle and put out another cup and saucer and an extra cake or two and ran to the door i am so sorry to keep you waiting he was going to say when he saw that it was not gandalf at all it was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt and very bright eyes under his darkgreen hood as soon a the door was opened he pushed inside just as if he had been expected he hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg and dwalin at your service he said with a low bow

bilbo baggins at yours said the hobbit too surprised to ask any questions for the moment when the silence that followed had become uncomfortable he added i am just about to take tea pray come and have some with me a little stiff perhaps but he meant it kindly and what would you do if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation

they had not been at table long in fact they had hardly reached the third cake when there came another even louder ring at the bell excuse me said the hobbit and off he went to the door so you have got here at last was what he was going to say to gandalf this time but it was not gandalf instead there was a very oldlooking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open just as if he had been invited i see they have begun to arrive already he said when he caught sight of dwalins green hood hanging up he hung his red one next to it and balin at your service he said with his hand on his breast

thank you said bilbo with a gasp it was not the correct thing to say but they have begun to arrive had flustered him badly he liked visitors but he liked to know them before they arrived and he preferred to ask them himself he had a horrible thought that the cakes might run short and then heas the host he knew his duty and stuck to it however painfulhe might have to go without
come along in and have some tea he managed to say after taking a deep breath

a little beer would suit me better if it is all the same to you my good sir said balin with the white beard but i dont mind some cakeseedcake if you have any

lots bilbo found himself answering to his own surprise and he found himself scuttling off too to the cellar to fill a pint beermug and to the pantry to fetch two beautiful round seedcakes which he had baked that afternoon for his aftersupper morsel

when he got back balin and dwalin were talking at the table like old friends as a matter of fact they were brothers bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them when loud came a ring at the bell again and then another ring

gandalf for certain this time he thought as he puffed along the passage but it was not it was two more dwarves both with blue hoods silver belts and yellow beards and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade in they hopped as soon as the door began to openbilbo was hardly surprised at all

what can i do for you my dwarves he said kili at your service

said the one and fili added the other and they both swept off their blue hoods and bowed

at yours and your familys replied bilbo remembering his manners this time

dwalin and balin here already i see said kili let us join the throng

throng thought mr baggins i dont like the sound of that i really must sit down for a minute and collect my wits and have a drink he had only just had a sipin the corner while the four dwarves sat around the table and talked about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins and the depredations of dragons and lots of other things which he did not understand and did not want to for they sounded much too adventurouswhen dingdongaling dang his bell rang again as if some naughty little hobbitboy was trying to pull the handle off someone at the door he said blinking some four i should say by the sound said fili besides we saw them coming along behind us in the distance

the poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands and wondered what had happened and what was going to happen and whether they would all stay to supper then the bell rang again louder than ever and he had to run to the door it was not four after all it was five another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall he had hardly turned the knob bexre they were all inside bowing and saying at your service one after another dori nori ori oin and gloin were their names and very soon two purple hoods a grey hood a brown hood and a white hood were hanging on the pegs and off they marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to join the others already it had almost become a throng some called for ale and some for porter and one for coffee and all of them for cakes so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while a big jug of coffee bad just been set in the hearth the seedcakes were gone and the dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones when there camea loud knock not a ring but a hard rattat on the hobbits beautiful green door somebody was banging with a stick

bilbo rushed along the passage very angry and altogether bewildered and bewutheredthis was the most awkward wednesday he ever remembered he pulled open the door with a jerk and they all fell in one on top of the other more dwarves four more and there was gandalf behind leaning on his staff and laughing he had made quite a dent on the beautiful door he had also by the way knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before carefully carefully he said it is not like you bilbo to keep friends waiting on the mat and then open the door like a popgun let me introduce bifur bofur bombur and especially thorin at your service said bifur bofur and bombur standing in a row then they hung up two yellow hoods and a pale green one and also a skyblue one with a long silver tassel this last belonged to thorin an enormously important dwarf in fact no other than the great thorin oakenshield himself who was not at all pleased at falling flat on bilbos mat with bifur bofur and bombur on top of him for one thing bombur was immensely fat and heavy thorin indeed was very haughty and said nothing about service but poor mr baggins said he was sorry so many times that at last he grunted pray dont mention it and stopped frowning

now we are all here said gandalf looking at the row of thirteen hoodsthe best detachable party hoodsand his own hat hanging on the pegs quite a merry gathering
i hope there is something left for the latecomers to eat and drink whats that tea no thank you a little red wine i think for me and for me said thorin and raspberry jam and appletart said bifur and mincepies and cheese said bofur and porkpie and salad said bombur and more cakesand aleand coffee if you dont mind called the other dwarves through the door

put on a few eggs theres a good fellow gandalf called after him as

the hobbit stumped off to the pantries and just bring out the cold chicken and pickles

seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as i do myself thought mr baggins who was feeling positively flummoxed and was beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house by the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays he was getting very hot and red in the face and annoyed

confusticate and bebother these dwarves he said aloud why dont they come and lend a hand lo and behold there stood balin and dwalin at the door of the kitchen and fili and kili behind them and before he could say knife they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlour and set out everything afresh

gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen dwarves all round and bilbo sat on a stool at the fireside nibbling at a biscuit his appetite was quite taken away and trying to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and not in the least an adventure the dwarves ate and ate and talked and talked and time got on at last they pushed their chairs back and bilbo made a move to collect the plates and glasses i suppose you will all stay to supper he said in his politest unpressing tones of course said thorin and after we shant get through the business till late and we must have some music first now to clear up thereupon the twelve dwarvesnot thorin he was too important and stayed talking to gandalfjumped to their feet and made tall piles of all the things off they went not waiting for trays balancing columns of plates each with a bottle on the top with one hand while the hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with fright please be careful and please dont trouble i can manage but the dwarves only started to sing

chip the glasses and crack the plates
blunt the knives and bend the forks
thats what bilbo baggins hates
smash the bottles and burn the corks
cut the cloth and tread on the fat
pour the milk on the pantry floor
leave the bones on the bedroom mat
splash the wine on every door
dump the crocks in a boiling bowl
pound them up with a thumping pole
and when youve finished if any are whole
send them down the hall to roll
thats what bilbo baggins hates
so carefully carefully with the plates

and of course they did none of these dreadful things and everything was cleaned and put away safe as quick as lightning while the hobbit was turning round and round in the middle of the kitchen trying to see what they were doing then they went back and found thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a pipe he was blowing the most enormous smokerings and wherever he told one to go it wentup the chimney or behind the clock on the mantelpiece or under the table or round and round the ceiling but wherever it went it was not quick enough to escape gandalf pop he sent a smaller smokering from his short claypipe straight through each one of thorins the gandalfs smokering would go green and come back to hover over the wizards head he had quite a cloud of them about him already and in the dim light it made him look strange and sorcerous bilbo stood still and watchedhe loved smokeringsand then be blushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the smokerings he had sent up the wind over the hill now for some music said thorin bring out the instruments

kili and fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles

dori nori and ori brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats bombur produced a drum from the hall bifur and bofur went out too and came back with clarinets that they had left among the walkingsticks dwalin and balin said excuse me i left mine in the porch just bring mine in with you said thorin they came back with viols as big as themselves and with thorins harp wrapped in a green cloth it was a beautiful golden harp and when thorin struck it the music began all at once so sudden and sweet that bilbo forgot everything else and was swept away into dark lands under strange moons far over the water and very far from his hobbithole under the hill the dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of the hill the firelight flickeredit was apriland still they played on while the shadow of gandalfs beard wagged against the wall the dark filled all the room and the fire died down and the shadows were lost and still they played on and suddenly first one and then another began to sing as they played deepthroated singing of the dwarves in the deep places of their ancient homes and this is like a fragment of their song if it can be like their song without their music

far over the misty mountains cold
to dungeons deep and caverns old
we must away ere break of day
to seek the pale enchanted gold
the dwarves of yore made mighty spells
while hammers fell like ringing bells
in places deep where dark things sleep
in hollow halls beneath the fells
for ancient king and elvish lord
there many a gloaming golden hoard
they shaped and wrought and light they caught
to hide in gems on hilt of sword
on silver necklaces they strung
the flowering stars on crowns they hung
the dragonfire in twisted wire
they meshed the light of moon and sun
far over the misty mountains cold
to dungeons deep and caverns old
we must away ere break of day
to claim our longforgotten gold
goblets they carved there for themselves
and harps of gold where no man delves
there lay they long and many a song
was sung unheard by men or elves
the pines were roaring on the height
the winds were moaning in the night
the fire was red it flaming spread
the trees like torches biased with light
the bells were ringing in the dale
and men looked up with faces pale
the dragons ire more fierce than fire
laid low their towers and houses frail
the mountain smoked beneath the moon
the dwarves they heard the tramp of doom
they fled their hall to dying fall
beneath his feet beneath the moon
far over the misty mountains grim
to dungeons deep and caverns dim
we must away ere break of day
to win our harps and gold from him

as they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him a fierce and jealous love the desire of the hearts of dwarves then something tookish woke up inside him and he wished to go and see the great mountains and hear the pinetrees and the waterfalls and explore the caves and wear a sword instead of a walkingstick he looked out of the window the stars were out in a dark sky above the trees he thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns suddenly in the wood beyond the water a flame leapt up  probably somebody lighting a woodfireand he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet hill and kindling it all to flames he shuddered and very quickly he was plain mr baggins of bagend underhill again he got up trembling he had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp and more than half a mind to pretend to and go and hide behind the beer barrels in the cellar and not come out again until all the dwarves had gone away suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped and they were all looking at him with eyes shining in the dark

where are you going said thorin in a tone that seemed to show that he guessed both halves of the hobbits mind

what about a little light said bilbo apologetically

we like the dark said the dwarves dark for dark business there are many hours before dawn

of course said bilbo and sat down in a hurry he missed the stool and sat in the fender knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash hush said gandalf let thorin speak and this is bow thorin began gandalf dwarves and mr baggins we are not together in the house of our friend and fellow conspirator this most excellent and audacious hobbitmay the hair on his toes never fall out all praise to his wine and ale he paused for breath and for a polite remark from the hobbit but the compliments were quite lost onpoor bilbo baggins who was wagging his mouth in protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator though no noise came out he was so flummoxed so thorin went on

we are met to discuss our plans our ways means policy and devices we shall soon before the break of day start on our long journey a journey from which some of us or perhaps all of us except our friend and counsellor the ingenious wizard gandalf may never return it is a solemn moment our object is i take it well known to us all to the estimable mr baggins and perhaps to one or two of the younger dwarves i think i should be right in naming kili and fili for instance the exact situation at the moment may require a little brief explanation this was thorins style he was an important dwarf if he had been allowed he would probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath without telling any one there anything that was not known already but he was rudely interrupted poor bilbo couldnt bear it any longer at may never return he began to feel a shriek coming up inside and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel all the dwarves sprang bp knocking over the table gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his magic staff and in its firework glare the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the hearthrug shaking like a jelly that was melting then he fell flat on the floor and kept on calling out struck by lightning struck by lightning over and over again and that was all they could get out of him for a long time so they took him and laid him out of the way on the drawingroom sofa with a drink at his elbow and they went back to their dark business

excitable little fellow said gandalf as they sat down again gets funny queer fits but he is one of the best one of the bestas fierce as a dragon in a pinch

if you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch you will realise that this was only poetical exaggeration applied to any hobbit even to old tooks greatgranduncle bullroarer who was so huge for a hobbit that he could ride a horse he charged the ranks of the goblins of mount gram in the battle of the green fields and knocked their king golfirnbuls head clean off with a wooden club it sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole and in this way the battle was won and the game of golf invented at the same moment

in the meanwhile however bullroarers gentler descendant was reviving in the drawingroom after a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the parlour this is what he heard gloin speaking humph or some snort more or less like that will he do do you think it is all very well for gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement would be enough to wake the dragon and all his relatives and kill the lot of us i think it sounded more like fright than excitement in fact if it bad not been for the sign on the door i should have been sure we had come to the wrong house as soon as i clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing on the mat i had my doubts he looks more like a grocerthan a burglar

then mr baggins turned the handle and went in the took side had won he suddenly felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce as for little fellow bobbing on the mat it almost made him really fierce many a time afterwards the baggins part regretted what he did now and he said to himself bilbo you were a fool you walked right in and put your foot in it

pardon me he said if i have overheard words that you were saying i dont pretend to understand what you are talking about or your reference to burglars but i think i am right in believing this is what he called being on his dignity that you think i am no good i will show you i have no signs on my doorit was painted a week ago and i am quite sure you have come to the wrong house as soon as i saw your funny faces on the doorstep i had my doubts but treat it as the right one tell me what you want done and i will try it if i have to walk from here to the east of east and fight the wild wereworms in the last desert i bad a greatgreatgreatgranduncle once bullroarer took and  yes yes but that was long ago said gloin i was talking about you and i assure you there is a mark on this doorthe usual one in the trade or used to be burglar wants a good job plenty of excitement and reasonable reward thats how it is usually read you an say expert treasurehunter instead of burglar if you like some of them do its all the same to us gandalf told us that there was a man of the sort in these parts looking for a job at once and that he had arranged for a meeting here this wednesday teatime

of course there is a mark said gandalf i put it there myself for very good reasons you asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition and i chose mr baggins just let any one say i chose the wrong man or the wrong house and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like or go back to digging coal

he scowled so angrily at gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair and when bilbo tried to open his mouth to ask a question he turned and frowned at him and stuck oat his bushy eyebrows till bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap thats right said gandalf lets have no more argument i have chosen mr baggins and that ought to 6te enough for all of you if i say he is a burglar a burglar he is or will be when the time comes there is a lot more in him than you guess and a deal more than he has any idea of himself you may possibly all live to thank me yet now bilbo my boy fetch the lamp and lets have little light on this

on the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shad he spread a piece of parchment rather like a map

this was made by thror your grandfather thorin he said in answer to the dwarves excited questions it is a plan of the mountain i dont see that this will help us much said thorin disappointedly after a glance i remember the mountain well enough and the lands about it and i know where mirkwood is and the withered heath where the great dragons bred

there is a dragon marked in red on the mountain said balin but it will be easy enough to find him without that if ever we arrive there there is one point that you havent noticed said the wizard and that is the secret entrance you see that rune on the west side and the hand pointing to it from the other runes that marks a hidden passage to the lower halls

it may have been secret once said thorin but how do we know that it is secret any longer old smaug had lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves

he maybut he cant have used it for years and years why because it is too small five feet high the door and three may walk abreast say the runes but smaug could not creep into a hole that size not even when he was a young dragon certainly not after devouring so many of the dwarves and men of dale

it seems a great big hole to me squeaked bilbo who had no experience of dragons and only of hobbitholes he was getting excited and interested again so that he forgot to keep his mouth shut he loved maps and in his hall there hung a large one of the country round with all his favourite walks marked on it in red ink how could such a large door be kept secret from everybody outside apart from the dragon he asked he was only a little hobbit you must remember

in lots of ways said gandalf but in what way this one has been hidden we dont know without going to see from what it says on the map i should guess there is a closed door which has been made to look exactly like the side of the mountain that is the usual dwarves method  i think that is right isnt it quite right said thorin

also went on gandalf i forgot to mention that with the map went a key a small and curious key here it is he said and handed to thorin a key with a long barrel and intricate wards made of silver keep it safe indeed i will said thorin and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck and under his jacket now things begin to look more hopeful this news alters them much forthe better so far we have had no clear idea what to do we thought of going east as quiet and careful as we could as far as the long lake after that the trouble would begin a long time before that if i know anything about the loads east interrupted gandalf

we might go from there up along the river running went on thorin taking no notice and so to the ruins of dalethe old town in the valley there under the shadow of the mountain but we none of us liked the idea of the front gate the river runs right out of it through the great cliff at the south of the mountain and out of it comes the dragon toofar too often unless he has changed

that would be no good said the wizard not without a mighty warrior even a hero i tried to find one but warriors are busy fighting one another in distant lands and in this neighbourhood heroes are scarce or simply lot to be found swords in these parts are mostly blunt and axes are used for trees and shields as cradles or dishcovers and dragons are comfortably faroff and therefore legendary that is why i settled on burglaryespecially when i remembered the existence of a sidedoor and here is our little bilbo baggins the burglar the chosen and selected burglar so now lets get on and make some plans

very well then said thorin supposing the burglarexpert gives us some ideas or suggestions he turned with mockpoliteness to bilbo first i should like to know a bit more about things said he feeling all confused and a bit shaky inside but so far still lookishly determined to go on with things i mean about the gold and the dragon and all that and how it got there and who it belongs to and so on and further bless me said thorin havent you got a map and didnt you hear our song and havent we been talking about all this for hours

all the same i should like it all plain and clear said he

obstinately putting on his business manner usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money off him and doing his best to appear wise and prudent and professional and live up to gandalfs recommendation also i should like to know about risks outofpocket expenses time required and remuneration and so forthby which he meant what am i going to get out of it and am i going to come back alive

o very well said thorin long ago in my grandfather thrors time our family was driven out of the far north and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this mountain on the map it had been discovered by my far ancestor thrain the old but now they mined and they tunnelled and they made huger halls and greater workshops and in addition i believe they found a good deal of gold and a great many jewels too anyway they grew immensely rich and famous and my grandfather was king under the mountain again and treated with great reverence by the mortal men who lived to the south and were gradually spreading up the running river as far as the valley overshadowed by the mountain they built the merry town of dale there in those days kings used to send for our smiths and reward even the least skilful most richly fathers would beg us to take their sons as apprentices and pay us handsomely especially in foodsupplies which we never bothered to grow or find for ourselves altogether those were good days for us and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend and leisure to make beautiful things just for the fun of it not to speak of the most marvellous and magical toys the like of which is not to be found in the world nowadays so my grandfathers halls became full of armour and jewels and carvings and cups and the toymarket of dale was the wonder of the north

undoubtedly that was what brought the dragon dragons steal gold and jewels you know from men and elves and dwarves wherever they can find them and they guard their plunder as long as they live which is practically forever unless they are killed and never enjoy a brass ring of it indeed they hardly know a good bit of work from a bad though they usually have a good notion of the current market value and they cant make a thing for themselves not even mend a little loose scale of their armour there were lots of dragons in the north in those days and gold was probably getting scarce up there with the dwarves flying south or getting killed and all the general waste and destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse there was a most specially greedy strong and wicked worm called smaug one day he flew up into the air and came south the first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane coming from the north and the pinetrees on the mountain creaking and cracking in the wind some of the dwarves who happened to be outside i was one luckily a fine adventurous lad in those days always wandering about and it saved my life that daywell from a good way off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame then he came down the slopes and when he reached the woods they all went up in fire by that time all the bells were ringing in dale and the warriors were arming the dwarves rushed out of their great gate but there was the dragon waiting for them none escaped that way the river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on dale and in the fog the dragon came on them and destroyed most of the warriorsthe usual unhappy story it was only too common in those days then he went back and crept in through the front gate and routed out all the halls and lanes and tunnels alleys cellars mansions and passages after that there were no dwarves left alive inside and he took all their wealth for himself probably for that is the dragons way he has piled it all up in a great heap far inside and sleeps on it for a bed later he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to dale and carry away people especially maidens to eat until dale was ruined and all the people dead or gone what goes on there now i dont know for certain but i dont suppose anyone lives nearer to the mountain than the far edge of the long lake nowadays

the few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding and cursed smaug and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards they looked very grim but they said very little when i asked how they had got away they told me to hold my tongue and said that one day in the proper time i should know after that we went away and we have had to earn our livings as best we could up and down the lands often enough sinking as low as blacksmithwork or even coalmining but we have never forgotten our stolen treasure and even now when i will allow we have a good bit laid by and are not so badly offhere thorin stroked the gold chain round his neckwe still mean to get it back and to bring our curses home to smaugif we can

i have often wondered about my fathers and my grandfathers escape i see now they must have had a private sidedoor which only they knew about but apparently they made a map and i should like to know how gandalf got hold of it and why it did not come down to me the rightful heir i did not get hold of it i was given it said the wizard your grandfather thror was killed you remember in the mines of moria by azog the goblin  curse his name yes said thorin

and thrain your father went away on the twentyfirst of april a hundred years ago last thursday and has never been seen by you since true true said thorin

well your father gave me this to give to you and if i have chosen my own time and way of handing it over you can hardly blame me considering the trouble i had to find you your father could not remember his own name when he gave me the paper and he never told me yours so on the whole i think i ought to be praised and thanked here it is said he handing the map to thorin i dont understand said thorin and bilbo felt he would have liked to say the same the explanation did not seem to explain your grandfather said the wizard slowly and grimly gave the map to his son for safety before he went to the mines of moria your father went away to try his luck with the map after your grandfather was killed and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had but he never got near the mountain how he got there i dont know but i found him a prisoner in the dungeons of the necromancer

whatever were you doing there asked thorin with a shudder and all the dwarves shivered

never you mind i was finding things out as usual and a nasty dangerous business it was even i gandalf only just escaped i tried to save your father but it was too late he was witless and wandering and had forgotten almost everything except the map and the key we have long ago paid the goblins of moria said thorin we must give a thought to the necromancer dont be absurd he is an enemy quite beyond the powers of all the dwarves put together if they could all be collected again from the four corners of the world the one thing your father wished was for his son to read the map and use the key the dragon and the mountain are more than big enough tasks for you

hear hear said bilbo and accidentally said it aloud hear what they all said turning suddenly towards him and he was so flustered that he answered hear what i have got to say whats that they asked well i should say that you ought to go east and have a look round

after all there is the sidedoor and dragons must sleep sometimes i suppose

if you sit on the doorstep long enough i daresay you will think of something and well dont you know i think we have talked long enough for one night if you see what i mean what about bed and an early start and all that i will give you a good breakfast before you go

before we go i suppose you mean said thorin arent you the burglar and isnt sitting on the doorstep your job not to speak of getting inside the door but i agree about bed and breakfast i like eggs with my ham when starting on a journey fried not poached and mind you dont break em

after all the others had ordered their breakfasts without so much as a please which annoyed bilbo very much they all got up the hobbit had to find room for them all and filled all his sparerooms and made beds on chairs and sofas before he got them all stowed and went to his own little bed very tired and not altogether happy one thing he did make his mind up about was not to bother to get up very early and cook everybody elses wretched breakfast the tookishness was wearing off and he was not now quite so sure that he was going on any journey in the morning as he lay in bed he could hear thorin still humming to himself in the best bedroom next to him

far over the misty mountains cold
to dungeons deep and caverns old
we must away ere break of day
to find our longforgotten gold

bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears and it gave him very uncomfortable dreams it was long after the break of day when he woke up5embed"
