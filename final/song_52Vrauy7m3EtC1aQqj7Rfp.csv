chorus
i be slidin round with my firearm i gotta keep a weapon
i be ridin round everywhere i dare one of yall lil niggas to test me
i keep on drivin round got me goin through all these transgressions
shootin niggas and foolin round wont let me see my blessin
i be slidin round with my firearm i gotta keep a weapon
i be ridin round everywhere i dare one of yall lil niggas to test me
i keep on drivin round got me goin through all these transgressions
shootin niggas and foolin round wont let me see my blessin

verse
i did everything the streets told me was cool to do
now id rather prove it to myself before i prove to you
i never tell put me in jail put me in any dorm
and i can make it through whatever ill weather any storm
say park the wraith outside the prison when i eos
my mama told me bout you niggas i swear she know best
my bitch did a whole bid with me thats my baby
now sure enough i blowed up she bout to have my baby
i swear it feel like yesterday i was just in the county
when me and snake was talkin bout how we was in the projects
when we was on the ugly corner we were poppin molly
how we be bootin up on niggas when they actin rowdy
sniper gang i hate how i cant have my niggas round me
we love each other so much our energies just keep collidin
we down to suit up any moment we be too excited
and free lil cool its been a minute since we reunited
my nigga pee just caught a body and he still fightin it
i hate i fell in love with thuggin i give my mama anxiety
i love lil dj like a brother you play with him ill kill you
lil jackboy shoulda just been my brother i swear i love that nigga
i dont even need your love no more i got a leather heart
i do my own time i dont need no nigga to take no charge
i couldnt even get a letter from you and that was your gun
you aint send me nothin or ask no boy how your lil brother doinyou might also like2embed"
