i never walk about after dark
its my point of view
cause someone could break your neck
coming up behind you
always coming and youd never have a clue
i never look behind all the time
i will wait forever
always looking straight
thinking counting all the hours you wait

chorus
see you on a dark night lalalalala
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night lalalalala
see you on a dark night

verse 2
and no im not a jerk
i would ask if you could help me out
its hard to understand
cause when youre running by yourself
its hard to find someone to hold your hand
you know its good to be tough like me
but i would wait forever
i need someone else
to look into my eyes and tell me
girl you know youve got to watch your health
you might also likebridge
to look into my eyes and tell me
lalalalala
to look into my eyes and tell me
lalalalala
lalalalala
lalalalala
lalalalala
lalalalala

chorus
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night lalalalala80embed"
