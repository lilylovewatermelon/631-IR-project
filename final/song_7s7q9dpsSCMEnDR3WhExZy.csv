starin at the water lookin like a bunch of satin
look into my eyes and all you see is motherfuckin static
toe taggin bitch im baggin up the dope
no ratting to the po
actin like you shy readin the latin quote across my fuckin throat
hos go oh no heard this motherfucker likes to give burials
and i dont know if i want to go with him he invited me into his home gave her the number to my phone
told her dialup 666 if she need to get a hold of me
and hopefully shell give me a call when she is home and free and lonely
phone rang twice but i missed both calls i was hangin in the hall tollfree

bridge uicide christ
hello

verse 2 uicide christ
got a pocket fulla stones stones watchin game of thrones thrones
bitches on the phone tellin me she home alone lone
motherfuck a future countin down til i die die
days roll by i just wanna get high high
neverever sober need drugs for my composure
lookin like im dyin layin back on the sofa
six feet deep deep
three gold teeth teeth
zero fuckin hopes for this young tragedy dy
days of our lives lives
watch em roll by by
whole fuckin family got bloodshot eyes eyes
scripts in the kitchen right next to the dishes dishes
finger fuckin bitches listening to no limit limit
westbank soulja straight up out the nola
when it come to this shit aint a motherfucker coldersee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like37embed"
