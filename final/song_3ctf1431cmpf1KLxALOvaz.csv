what a strange day
maybe i was dreaming
nothing seemed entirely awake
what uncertain light

verse 2
what a strange night
its dancing with the candle
the atmosphere is scandalous and drunk
and you could cut it with a knife

verse 3
what a strange life
even as its passing
its hard to see it happening at all
like a shadow on the wall

verse 4
what a strange god
if everything is nothing
then why is nothing ever what it seems
what a hidden kind of love

verse 5
what a strange word
just because you told it
dont mean you told anything at all
its better from a mime
see dr dog liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likeverse 6
and what a strange line
wrapped around in letters
a drawing of a symbol for a sound
its never right before its wrong

verse 7
what a strange song
a heart to beat the rhythm
a brain to move the melody along
a tune of everybodys choice

verse 8
what a strange voice
coming from the speaker
recorded on the twentieth of may
what a strange dayembed"
