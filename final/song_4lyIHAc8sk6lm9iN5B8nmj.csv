shall we beat this or celebrate it
you’re not the one to talk things through
you checked your texts while i masturbated
manelich i feel so used

chorus 1
found myself on spencer’s butte
traced your shadow with my shoe
empty outline changed my view
now all of me thinks less of you

verse 2
on the sheet i see your horizon
all of me pressed onto you
but in this light you look like poseidon
i’m just a ghost you walk right through

chorus 2
saw myself on spencer’s butte all of me wants all of you
landscape changed my point of view all of me wants all of you
revelation may come true all of me wants all of you
now all of me thinks less of you all of me wants all of you

outro
all of me wants all of you
all of me wants all of you
all of me wants all of you
all of me wants all of youyou might also like35embed"
