you come creeping in six in the morning
like aint nobody suppose to know
say you been working but get in bed
smelling just like fresh bar of soap
ask you about it you just turn ya back
and get mad and just fall asleep sleep
got a lot on ya mind and a argument
is the last thing you need

hook
baby you trippin
you dont go that way
this aint a movie
or a tyler perry play
if you really wanted to mess around
thats all you had to say
but it aint gonna be itty bitty silly me
so dont waste ya energy

chorus
expect me to listen
when all i keep hearin
is you spitting nothing but game
expect me to stay
when all you can say
one day everythingll change
dont wanna leave wanna believe
that you wont do me wrong
but its starting to
bore me bore me bore me yawn

but you do it to me

hook
