paint on a caution wind
neath the bleeding sky
i called your name
there was no one there
and in the cold and snow
i saw your face

chorus
and we sang the song for the little thing
magic calm but the joy you bring
running it down the line
wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
magic gone from a pretty thing
maybe it might be time
for a better day
for a better day
for a better day

verse 2
straight from the path of love
in the road of life
i tumble forward
but going on imma keep it strong
i saw your face
you might also likechorus
and we sang the song for the little thing
magic calm but the joy you bring
running it down the line
wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
magic gone from a pretty thing
maybe it might be time
for a better day
for a better day
for a better day
for a better day
for a better day
for a better day
and we sang the song for the little thing
magic calm but the joy you bring
running it down the line
wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
magic gone from a pretty thing
maybe it might be time
for a better day14embed"
