and i only spit heat cause im playing for the son
playing for the king playing for the title
im surprised you didnt hear this in the bible

yo at the table with the family havin dinner
blackberry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
then i took a look to see before it activates the ringer
came to realize my homie bieber hit me on the twitter
then i hit him back despite i had some food up on my fingers
sippin eggnog with a little sprinkle of vanilla
even though its kinda cold im pullin out a chinchilla
bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter i said cool
you know ima deliver
lets collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
before we work i gotta get this off
see the other family members and drop gifts off
then im headed to the studio cause aint nothing stopping how
you know we bout to turn it up and really get it poppin now
people everywhere and all our twitter followers
merry christmas kwanza happy hanukkah

chorus justin bieber
mary nodded pa rum pa pum pum
the ox and lamb kept time pa rum pa pum pum
i played my drum for him pa rum pa pum pum
i played my best for him pa rum pa pum pum rum pa pum pum rum pa pum pum

verse 3 justin bieber
if you wanna give its the time of year
jb on the beat yeah yeah im on the snare
its crazy how some people say they say they dont care
when theres people on the street with no food its not fair
its about time for you to act merrily
its about time for you to give to charity
rarely do people even wanna help at all
cause theyre warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
not thinkin theres a family out hungry and cold
wishin wishin that they had somebody they could hold
so i think some of you need to act bold
give a can to a drive lets change the globe globe globe globe globe
outro justin bieber
im the drummer boy so do it do it
im the drummer boy so do it do it
im the drummer boy so do it do it
im the drummer boy so do it do it
im the drummer boy so do it do it8embed"
