sittin on a bench at west town mall
he sat down in his overalls and asked me
you waitin on a woman
i nodded yeah and said how bout you
he said son since 1952 ive been
waitin on a woman

prechorus
when i picked her up for our first date
i told her id be there at 8
and she came down the stairs at 830
she said im sorry that i took so long
didnt like a thing that i tried on
but let me tell you son she sure looked pretty

chorus
yeah shell take her time
but i dont mind waitin on a woman

verse 2
he said the wedding took a year to plan
you talk about an anxious man i was nervous
waitin on a woman
and then he nudged my arm like old men do
and said ill say this about the honeymoon it was worth it
waitin on a woman

and i dont guess we been anywhere
she hasnt made us late i swear
sometimes she does it just cause she can do it
boy its just a fact of life
itll be the same with your young wife
might as well go on and get used to it

chorus
shell take her time
cause you dont mind waitin on a woman

bridge
ive read somewhere statistics show
the mans always the first to go
and that makes sense cause i know she wont be ready
so when it finally comes my time
and i get to the other side
ill find myself a bench if theyve got any

chorus
i hope she takes her time
cause i dont mind waitin on a woman
honey take your time
cause i dont mind waitin on a woman2embed"
