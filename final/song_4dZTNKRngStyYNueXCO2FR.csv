we was out here gangbangin now
posted on the block my chain swangin

chorus
oh to be young and dumb
dont believe in oneonones
thirty clip the ar and we love them drums
from where niggas die gotta be smart and keep you a gun
my homie died heard his mama cry rip to her son
wasnt on point hed be alive he aint get to run
livin every day hopin we survive this the life of the slums
in that black hearse took his last ride in the dirt now he done
so much goin on i cant feel a thing i think that im numb

verse 1
pay attention to detail
made a million off my email
out in malibu steppin on seashells
but it could be a glock 23 shell
was stuck in the hood but i prevailed
where i come from we dont see yale
block baby im a trap scholar
i really studied them streets well
eyeball the work we dont need scales
i got baking soda on resale
hed do anything not to see jail
no respect if he act like a female
he really a bitch uh
i gave my glizzy a switch
four seconds we empty a stick
bro just like curry he really dont miss uh

verse 2
society got too many distractions
every problem dont need a reaction
toughest niggas they be in the past tense
even though kept his heat he was lackin
lost his homie he seen the shit happen
kneedeep in that beef it was crackin
all his trauma increasin the damage
hot shit with em demons attractin
this shitll leave you writin love letters from a county cell
have you fight in your sleep cause you haunted from soul odors dead body smell
face to face with the devil and he got control on him cause he know him well
he just hopin the lord gon give him another chance fore he go to hell
