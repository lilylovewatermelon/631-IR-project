yo yo follow me follow me
come with me to the dark side of the force force
no man would boldly go to this place
the devil only knows of this world
so dark and oh so cold its oh so cold
oh so cold oh

prechorus
soon as my flow starts i compose art like the ghost of mozart
even though they all say that theyre real i know that most arent
boy you think youre clever dont ya girl you think youre so smart
come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

chorus
stay wide awake
a world so dark a world so cold
a world where only some will go
stay wide awake
but none return when will they learn
where do they go god only knows
stay wide awake

so dark and so cold my friends dont know this other side of me
theres a monster inside of me its quite ugly and it frightens me
but they cant see what i can see theres a vacancy in my tummy
its makin me play hideandseek like jason im so hungry
shes naked see no privacy but i can see she wants me
so patient see i try to be but gee why does she taunt me
pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep and i creep right through the front see
so blatantly but silently cause i know that shes sound sleep
whos wakin me so violently and whys he on top of me
hes rapin me she tries to scream somebody please get him off me
hes tapin me hes bitin me hes laughin like its funny
shes scrapin me shes fightin me shes scratchin like some dumb freak
escapin me no dice you see i might just be ted bundy
or satan gee what a sight to see im dancin in my red panties
im crazy but its alright with me man life can be so empty
stay away from me cause im dancin to quite a different drum beat

verse 3
better try to stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake
soon as you lay me down to sleep bitch your soul ima try to take
pray for light of day right away why do they try to fight today
i must make them pay twice as much might as well put the knife away
now i use power tools how bout now are you in the shower
scour you for six hours til outage of power outlets
how did you figure out i was down in your basement now ya
mustve just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there
prowler theres no one fouler bound ya thats how they found ya
face down in the tub i drown ya with piles of downers around ya
such nostalgia and power such prowess look how you cower
jump out on you now like i was a jawa from fuckin star wars
jabba the hutt biddybyebye biddybyebye its time to diedie
ought to not even bother to scream it dont even matter
amazing when grazin skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
not ya everyday damien bathe me in holy water
nothing like son of sam so please understand theres no gun in hand
wheres the thrill in the hunt theres no fun in that here i come with axe
fun to act like lumberjack when im hackin em up with that
what was that dial 911 someones comin in from the back
prechorus
soon as my flow starts i compose art like the ghost of mozart
even though they all say that theyre real i know that most arent
boy you think youre clever dont ya girl you think youre so smart
come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark

chorus
stay wide awake
a world so dark a world so cold
a world where only some will go
stay wide awake
but none return when will they learn
where do they go god only knows
