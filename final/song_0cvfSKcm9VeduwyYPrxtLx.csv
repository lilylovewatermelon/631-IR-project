i hoped youd stay just a little bit longer
and i hoped that youd keep calling

prechorus 1
with every single day i have to face

im drowning above the water oh help me breathe again

with every single night i have to face
with every single dream i have to chase
i wonder if our love is in the same place

im burning like a fire will someone help my pain
im drowning above the water oh help me breathe again
and i i cant let you go so when youre ready come back home yeah
