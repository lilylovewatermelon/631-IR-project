i was down for the count
feeling like ive come to the end
nothing really mattered
nothing left for me to mend
ooh but then you came and i still couldnt see
til you tore down every wall in me
how you healed me with your patience
if its all i ever do ill never stop loving you

chorus
cause im alive i can breathe i can feel i believe
and there aint doubt about it there aint no doubt about it
im in love and its all because of you
i was fading but you pulled me through
cause im awake i survived i was hurt thought id die
but there aint no doubt about it its love and i have found it
feel the beat again stronger than before
im gonna give you my heart until it beats no more

verse 2
was in place full of pain
with a broken down heart in despair
he took away my feelings
and made it hard for me to care
ooh but then you crashed through the door to my soul
put back all the pieces and made me whole
i was living in the past oh no
now im never looking back im never looking back
