verse 1 nf
faith is something i am not accustomed to
and trusting other peoples something i dont really love to do
ive never been a fan of it i act tougher
really my shoulders they aint built for this and i dont have nothing
its like im standing in the rain and you offer me a raincoat
but i would rather stand there and get wet than take the handout
whats wrong with me you said youve always got your hands out
and i cannot continue on my own so take my hands now
i give you everything god not just a little bit
take it from me i am nothing but a hypocrite
i hate sin but i built a house and i still live in it
afraid to open up the door to you and let you into it
my soul is lost and what it needs is your direction
i know ive told you i do not need your protection
but i lied to you this thing is tiring
and man was not created for it god
please retire me now

oh these hands are tired
oh this heart is tired

but ill keep on

verse 2 nf
trust is something i am not accustomed to
and i know the bible says i should always trust in you
but i dont never read that book enough
and when i have a question i dont take the time to look it up
or pick it up
it collects dust on my nightstand
im just being honest
please take this outta my hands
i have no control  i am just a person
but thank the lord that i serve a god thats perfect
i do not deserve the opportunity youve given me
i never knew what freedom was until i learned what prison means
i am not ashamed i dont care if they remember me
my life will always have a hole if you are not the centerpiece
take me out of bondage take all of my pride
if i dont have a savior i dont have nothing inside
take all of my lust take all of my lies
theres no better feeling than when i look in the sky in your eyes
its amazing
hook jeremiah carlson
oh these hands are tired
oh this heart is tired
oh this soul is tired
but ill keep on
ill keep on
ill keep on
ill keep on
ill keep on
