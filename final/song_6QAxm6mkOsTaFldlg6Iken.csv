it was the night before christmas 1995
you broke her poor heart and she shattered your pride
outside that little honky tonk in nashville tennessee
neon never looked so dim to me

verse 2
so you went back to your barstool reopened your tab
the barkeep came by and asked why you looked so sad
well you said it was nothin but you knew that was a lie
tried your best not to break down and cry

chorus
then you said damn darlin
oh why’d you have to leave me alone in this bar
with no damn darlin
oh nashville you’ve broken my heart

verse 3
then the jukebox started playing for the first time all night
since the band loaded out and they said their goodbyes
and the first song they played was one she loved to hear
so you listened as you finished your beer

verse 4
and then that tear that hank talked about fell right on in
out of your eye and over the rim
of that glass that just became your only true friend
hearts break harder at the old exitin
you might also likechorus
and you said damn darlin
well why’d you have to leave me alone in this bar
with no damn darlin
oh nashville you’ve broken my heart

outro
oh nashville you’ve broken my heart
oh nashville you’ve broken my heart
oh you have broken my my heartembed"
