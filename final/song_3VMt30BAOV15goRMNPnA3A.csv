i’m a mess thats the best way to describe it
having no time to myself is the only way i can fight it
when im alone its like im staring into a mirror
dont know the person inside it and thats never been any clearer
i miss your family and i miss all our friends
if you had it to do over would you do it over again
cause i would it means something more to me
theres a hole in my heart where you used to be

prechorus
i still wish you the best of luck baby
and dont go thinking that this was a waste of time
i couldnt forget you if i tried

chorus
you killed what was left of the good in me
im tired so let me be broken
look down at the mess thats in front of me
no other words need be spoken
and ive got nobody else to blame though i tried
kept all of our past mistakes held inside
i’ll live with regret for my whole life

verse 2
i confess that i brought this all on myself
condemned to suffer alone like theres nobody else
when youre gone its like a whole part of me’s missing
so ill keep living the lie and just hope that youre listening
i tried to make us a life here
but our foundation was built on sand
no time to run until the damage was done
and ive never had the upper hand
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likeprechorus
i still wish you the best of luck baby
and dont go thinking that this was a waste of time
i couldnt forget you if i tried

chorus
you killed what was left of the good in me
im tired so let me be broken
look down at the mess thats in front of me
no other words need be spoken
and ive got nobody else to blame though i tried
kept all of our past mistakes held inside
i’ll live with regret for my whole life

bridge
all the things you love are all the things i hate
how did we get here in the first place oh

breakdown
i play it cool but its hard to be all my trust
is slowly burning inside of me over what
there cant be anymore progress i know our fate
the only thing that can heal this is time and space

chorus
you killed what was left of the good in me
im tired so let me be broken
look down at the mess thats in front of me
no other words need be spoken
and ive got nobody else to blame though i tried
kept all of our past mistakes held inside
i’ll live with regret for my whole life
for my whole life5embed"
