verse
the good die young green light they be the first ones to leave
ace told me keep my strap but now he restin in peace
if i ever catch the nigga who killed him out on the street
ima tie him to my truck and drive that nigga to the beach brr

fuck it jump in the bucket lets go find these niggas
all i need is a half a ounce of weed my brand new ar15
