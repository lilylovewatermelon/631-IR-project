ive felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you cant see
inside my shell i wait and bleed

chorus
ive felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you cant see
inside my shell i wait and bleed

postchorus
goodbye

verse 1
i wipe it off on tile the light is brighter this time
everything is 3d blasphemy
my eyes are red and gold the hair is standing straight up
this is not the way i pictured me
i cant control my shakes how the hell did i get here
something about this so very wrong
i have to laugh out loud i wish i didnt like this
is it a dream or a memory

chorus
ive felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you cant see
inside my shell i wait and bleed
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likeverse 2
get outta my head cause i dont need this
why didnt i see this
but im a victim manchurian candidate
i have sinned by just
making my mind up and taking your breath away

chorus
ive felt the hate rise up in me
kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
i wander out where you cant see
inside my shell i wait and bleed

chorus
ive felt the hate rise up in me
