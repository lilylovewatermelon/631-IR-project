dont my baby look good in them blue jeans
tight on the top with a belly button ring
a little tattoo somewhere in between
she only shows to me

hey were going out dancin shes ready tonight
so damn goodlookin boys it aint even right
and when bartender says for the lady
whats it going to be

prechorus 1
she aint into wine and roses
beer just makes her turn up her nose and
she cant stand the thought of sippin champagne

prechorus 2
no cuervo gold margaritas
just aint enough good burn in tequila she needs
somethin with a little more edge and a little more pain
