well on the other shore theres a hook for all your hangups
a pier full of disasters and a word for everything
you had to be there i know its somewhere
where all of us have grown and understood

prechorus
well on the other shore theres a week thats filled with weekends
a crick that trickles bourbon in your cup
theres always free time its never bed time
your friends are around or sleeping inx3

chorus
where nobodys famous and nobody cares
where everyones broke but nobodys scared
oh man oh man oh man

prechorus
well on the other shore theres a week thats filled with weekends
a crick that trickles bourbon in your cup
theres always free time its never bed time
your friends are around or sleeping inx2
