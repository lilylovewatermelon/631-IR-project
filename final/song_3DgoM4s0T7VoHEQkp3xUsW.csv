mama always told me papa always warned me
dont hang around with boys like you

dont mess around with boys like you
mama always told me papa always warned me
dont hang around with boys like you
teacher always told me never to be naughty
dont mess around with boys like you

verse 1 geazy
ayy they talk a lot
your friends say hes troublesome
dont do it youll get hurt
but they dont know where im coming from
cause if i do make you the one
i could never love another one
im just saying give it a chance
i dont see what youre running from
love is pain love is risk
on the flip side love is bliss
honestly lets go for this
take a shot not gonna miss
all started with just a kiss
i walked up and grabbed your wrists
fast forward the crash course
now were here imagine this you know
love comes for a season or a reason
some things you gotta know before you leavin
know this goes against everything you believe in
but im crazy about you this aint pretend

verse 2 geazy
label me as a bad guy
safe bet im the anti
chastise throw dirt on me
thats how it is dont ask why
everyones got their opinion
but i dont know why cats lie
i would never let that fly
honestly im not that guy im not that guy
now dont believe everything you hear
all these people wanna interfere
fuck em all its our world
cant let em get into here
we could really build something strong
think where we could be in a year
youve gotta give me a fair chance
before you tell me were finished here
already know youve been hurt before
understand what youre afraid of
talks cheap actions speak
let me show you im demonstrative
we could rewrite the old story
lets get it started lets get creative
cause im the one
honesty and loyalty is what im made of
chorus madison love
