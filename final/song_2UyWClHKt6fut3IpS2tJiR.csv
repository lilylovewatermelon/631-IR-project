ill hold your hand when you are feeling mad at me
yeah when the monsters they wont go and your windows dont close
ill pretend to see what you see
how long i say how long
will you relive the things that are gone
oh yeah the devils on your back but i know you can shake him off
mmm

chorus
and every day that you want to waste
that you want to waste you can
and every day that you want to wake up
and you want to wake you can
and every day that you want to change
that you want to change yeah
ill help you see it through
cause i just really want to be with you

verse 2
you know its funny how freedom can make us feel contained
yeah when the muscles in our legs arent used to all the walking
mmm
i know if you could snap both your fingers that youd escape with me
but in the meantime ill just wait here and listen to you when you speak
or scream

and every day that you want to waste
that you want to waste you can
and every day that you want to wake up
and you want to wake you can
and every day that you want to change
that you want to change yeah
ill help you see it through
cause i just really want to be with you

bridge
the truth cuts us and pulls us back up
and separates the things that look the same
you can fight it off you can fight it off you can

chorus
and every day that you want to waste
that you want to waste you can
and every day that you want to wake up
and you want to wake you can
and every day that you want to change
that you want to change yeah
ill help you see it through
cause i just really want to be with you36embed"
