i fly like paper get high like planes
if you catch me at the border i got visas in my name
if you come around here i make em all day
i get one done in a second if you wait

if you catch me at the border i got visas in my name
if you come around here i make em all day
i get one done in a second if you wait

pirate skulls and bones
sticks and stones and weed and bongs
running when we hit em
lethal poison for the system

already going hard just pumping that gas
no one on the corner has swagger like us
hit me on my burner prepaid wireless

already going hard just pumping that gas
