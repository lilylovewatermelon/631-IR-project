verse 1
you say you trust us but dont pick the phone up
act like we mean something to you i know you doing you
i called your brother on the landline
he said you aint never got no down time
you always working so late hope that you safe
your family been missing you you gon come back this way
you know its real out here for us
its like you dont care enough

chorus
but out here baby boys so far gone
lord knows i aint been home in so long
game so deep and the drinks so strong
and i dont trust no one at all
far away from you
ive already paid my dues
i dont got a lot but im making do
im trying just to get along

verse 2
went to muddy water from holy water
from being children to slaying daughters
you might also likerefrain
who gon go to hell for me
tryna give myself a reason
to keep believing in season that leaves fall for me
say boy dont talk to me
get from round my way
cant judge round my way

verse 3
you gon be so rich and dont ever show it
you can buy all the clothes you need and still dont visit me
i called your brother on his cell phone
he said you went out and you aint been home
youre always partying late hope that you safe
you dont even message me when you leave out the states
you know its real out here for us
its like you dont care enough

chorus
but out here baby boys so far gone
lord knows i aint been home in so long
game so deep and the drinks so strong
and i dont trust no one at all
far away from you
ive already paid my dues
i dont got a lot but im making do
im trying just to get along
verse 4
went from being cozy to living crazy
from you dont know me to wanting babies

refrain
who gon go to hell for me
tryna give myself a reason
to keep believing in season that leaves fall for me
say boy dont talk to me
get from round my way
cant judge round my way

outro
who gon go to hell for me
believing in season that leaves fall for me
cant judge round my way
