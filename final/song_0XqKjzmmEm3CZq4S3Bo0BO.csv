ive had too many days where im ready to break
theres gotta be more theres gotta be more
so i incest everything cause im in it to win
nothing but time on my side
anywhere i choose cause i wasnt built to lose
and you think im going to fall face down on the floor
just because im high high
as for me i have to disagree

chorus
cause im one who will survive
the ones you eat alive and nobody puts up a fight
they die they die rolling dollar bills and popping all these pills
but ill do what i wanna do cause i wasnt built to lose

you keep making the rounds you push me to the ground
making you feel bigger than real but im so fucking sick of your face
im not running a race im running away im running away

while everybody else is happy on the shelf
and i want it messily wrestling everything down
everything down down down
you might also likeas for i im way too fucking high

chorus

there has gotta be morex3
there has gotta be

chorus

now break this fucking place
go
im so sick of your face im not running a race
im running away im running away away
so sick of your face im not running a race
im running away im running away awayembed"
