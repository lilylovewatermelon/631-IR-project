across the sea by the tennessee skyline
they told me id find my hopes and my dreams
but i long to be in the bed of my true love
back where i came from shes waiting for me

chorus
so ill make my way through long winding country roads
but my heart still beats for my home and my english rose


verse 2
i told my dad on the phone its amazing
from the straight to the craziest places ive seen
but i long to be in the arms of my true love
like he loves my mother he understands me

chorus
i spend my days just traveling and playing shows
but my heart still beats for my home and my english rose

verse 3
i met a man in the bar down in memphis
he told me he went there to follow his dreams
he told me son you know i lost my true love
for the same exact reason that you crossed the sea

and i found truth in people i barely know
but my heart still beats for my home and my english rose

outro
oh my heart still beats for my home and my english rose
oh my heart still beats for my home and my english rose6embed"
