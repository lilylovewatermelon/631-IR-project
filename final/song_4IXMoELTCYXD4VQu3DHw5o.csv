verse 1
hey i know it hurts to watch me leave
but say it aint sooooo how could you ever replace me
youre so shy when you wanna be standing in front of me
mind spinning in circles youre waiting to speak
these hands here in front of me anxiously wait to see
hows it gonna be

chorus
before i go ohoh ohoh
let me remind you what youre waiting for
before you go ohoh ohoh
could you love me just a little bit more
one more time

refrain
