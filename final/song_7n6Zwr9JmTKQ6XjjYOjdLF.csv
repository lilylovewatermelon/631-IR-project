dont walk away
dont walk away away
dont walk away
dont walk baby dont walk away
dont walk away
dont walk away again
dont walk away
dont walk
baby dont walk away

verse 1
said you can go fuck somebody
i did not say to cuff somebody
still you went and you found somebody
bitch i thought there was nobody
im on my lonely
im on some fuck everybody
im on some just let it cool
put you on this pedestal
like look what i did look what i did look what i did
i made you a star gave you your start look what i did
made you who you are thats why you rock your style like this
and all of your friends will still tell you that im him
im him this nigga that you been looking for
the one that you wanna be cooking for im him
this nigga that you be textin with
the one that you wanna be sexin with im him dont walk away
yes im him yes im him dont walk away
even though i talk crazy get under your skin im him dont walk away
sent you to the streets i want you back dont walk
cause all of these niggas that play with thе ball and rap gon treat you like crap baby dont walk away
and this is not the placе for that and this is not something youre built for dont walk away
you are not built for that dont walk away
no you are not built for that away
imagine seeing me out and dont walk away
having to act like
like we dont even see each other like we dont even need each other dont walk
when you know im needing you back baby dont walk away
its tearing my soul to pieces
i sent you out to the streets and
now i made my bed gotta sleep in it
and now i need you back in my home and
now i need you back in my sheets and
now i need you back in my arms and
all of these rb songs are startin to make sense to me
like lonely im mr lonely
cause i have nobody to call my own
heard that song on the radio it made me sick
then i realized that its half legit
cause then i realized that it was accurate
cause im so fuckin lonely
im so fuckin lonely
the woman i left you for tried to test you for it
is somewhere out with some nigga from atlanta and shes probably out there fucking on me
nah fuck it ill be real that bitch is fucking on me
and i feel so stupid for leaving you
cause every time i told you lies
you looked inside my face with these eyes
and you told me i believe in you
knowing damn well i didnt want you to
you might also likeinterlude
shawty i think that thats where you twist it
feel like you have this thing in your heart where you think im just cold
i feel like i just never got you the chance to show you my heart
nigga this shit yearns for you

verse 2
look i know its scary to love me
clearly im aware of all the rumors you hear when they judge me
i call em blessings testimonies some call em unlucky
im standing with my peers sipping liquor
and i can tell that none of these people love me
its crazy whos there when im facing twentytwo years and i need someone to hug me
its nobody but the ones that love me
and you love me but do you
cause im seeing angers and emotions thats running all through you
i know you feel it too but fuck thats the air of the moment
you feel it clearly dont it
you talking louder when you quiet but im the only one that hear it dont it
know when you feel things i know your real pain
i know the real you
i hope you found somebody new that does you better than me
really im lying but i just say that cause it sound like its the mature thing to say
the last time we spoke i felt like i had more things to say but i just didnt
so i just let you talk until you finished
its things like that to this day that piss me off
moments i wasted
you gave me warm love when i was too cold to embrace it
i guess at times i felt like i would have to face it
that one day youd find somebody better than me at these mazes look
the way it endeds not how it started
i felt like every left out creature when noahs ark had departed
finding somebody new i contemplated plus i thought it
i know you thought it too
that almost led me into cheating but the times i tried to cheat im blocked with thoughts of you
caught up in my past ways conflicted with our last days
couple things you said to me never left from my brain
i just hope you still mean em cause ill never get between em
look higher hopes and heavy hearts
funny how we came from fresh starts
to now us arguing bout who what and who gets parts
and whos really leaving
you say you hate me and you dont love me
but shit you dont even believe it when you talk like that
quit acting like im not your only friend
and like im not the one with good intentions that i intend
i fucked your heart up but i tried to make amends
for the times that i offend i apologize dearly
outro
oh baby dont dont be afraid
you can trust me
tell her you get off
cut him off
can you trust me just trust me just trust me
can you trust me just trust me just trust me1embed"
