you should be loving someone
oh oh loving someone
yeah you should be loving someone
oh oh loving someone
yeah you should be

verse 1
my heart is telling me the telly isnt telling me anything
i need but it needs to keep selling me
besides celebrities lacking in integrity
holding up the status quo instead of showing the kids
that they matter who are they gonna batter next
just keep holding their necks and keep selling them sex
it’s better if we keep them perplexed
its better if we make them want the opposite sex
disenfranchised young criminal minds in a car park beside where your nan resides are not slow they’ve just never been shown that you should be

chorus
loving someone
oh oh loving someone
yeah you should be loving someone
oh oh loving someone
oh oh

verse 2
were all human were just like you man
we’re sentient or something or other i can’t remember whatever
we shouldnt have people afloat
if it was safer on the ground we wouldnt be on a boat
charlatan telepathy exploiting insecurity and praying on the purity
of grief and its simplicity  but i know that maybe im too skeptical
even guy debord needed spectacles you see
im the greek economy of cashing intellectual cheques
and im trying to progress but instead of selling sex
and i think i should be

oh oh loving someone
yeah you should be loving someone
oh oh loving someone
yeah you should be loving someone
oh oh loving someone
yeah you should be loving someone
oh oh loving someone
yeah you should be
interlude spoken word
i am forever in alongside the boys in jumpers
on bikes from schools and cars
with autumn leaves fallen sparse across midafternoon
she blazed about how cultural language is an operating system
a simple interface rendered feeble and listless
when tested with divinity or a true understanding of the human condition
i never did understand the duality of art and reality living life and treating it as such but with a certain disconnect
to touch that cajoles at the artist with comfort and abandon and between the spires and rolling roofs of the white city
that orange english light cast only one singular shadow
for you are not beside but within me

chorus
you should be loving someone
oh oh loving someone
were all human were just like you man
yeah you should be loving someone
oh oh loving someone
were all human were just like you man
yeah you should be loving someone
oh oh loving someone
yeah you should be loving someone
oh oh loving someone
