godless meteoric war
anger our existence nevermore
you awoke the giants
who were dormant in the sky
comets raining down from a fiery eye

chorus
mother of all
your time is coming
one with eternity
planets collide
planets collide

verse 2
damage galaxy destruct
endless celestial orbit corrupt
you will be forgotten
like the others lost in time
dead civilization left behind

chorus
mother of all
your time is coming
one with eternity
planets collide
planets collide

take me to find that much is closing in
you cant defeat them on your own
weapons are loaded for the final stand
and theyre all aimed at you from heaven

bridge
planets collide
planets collide
planets collide
planets collide

verse 4
you will be forgotten
like the others lost in time
dead civilization left behind

chorus
mother of all
your time is coming
one with eternity
planets collide
