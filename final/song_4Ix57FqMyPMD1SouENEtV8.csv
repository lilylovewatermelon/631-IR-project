she can drive a truck and rope and ride
she feels right at home right by my side
thats my kind of woman thats my cup of tea
thats my kind of woman the girl i want for me

verse 2
shes got a pair of boots that she just loves
and like me likes gus from lonesome dove
thats my kind of woman thats me to a t
thats my kind of woman the one i want for me

chorus
after all ive seen and all ive done
i know somewhere there is someone
wholl look my way and say i want that one
thats my kind of woman thats me to a t

verse 3
no matter what she wears she turns my head
on rainy days i cant pry her out of bed
lord i know the orders pretty tall
but find me and thatll be all
thats my kind of woman thats me to a t
