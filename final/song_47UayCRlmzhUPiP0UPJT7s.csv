id rather spend my evening
talking to chloe on twitter
than having you come over
so itll be like old times
but i know that you dont give a fuck
cause youre knee deep in your iphone

verse 2
but now that you saw my tweets
you know that im home
buried in my cell phone
tryna get a hold of someone new
instead of hanging out with you
and your high school stories

verse 3
but you sure know how to get right to me
with all those facebook statuses
about relationships and such
poor grammar is a must
but i trust that you can do it

bridge
but i couldnt give a fuck
whether you give a fuck or not
rip my eye sockets out
make me regret ever going out
but i know ill make it out of here alive
as long as i dont watch your life
unfold before my very eyes
you told this high school story
one too many times for me
you know id rather
you might also likeoutro
id rather spend my evening
talking to chloe on twitter
than having to look you right in your eyes1embed"
