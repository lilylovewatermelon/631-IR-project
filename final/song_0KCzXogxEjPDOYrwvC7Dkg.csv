ext gotham square  dusk

its finally happened  hells frozen over

christmas is two weeks off arid snow is falling in gotham
beneath its pristine white blanket the city looks
uncharacteristically serene  almost inviting  peace has
been miraculously restored strangers wave hello  salvation
army santas ring their bells on streetcorners  and now as
night falls an illuminated sign winks on above broad avenue
joyeux noel gotham  only 16 shopping days left till
christmas
the streets are bustling with jolly shoppers  at a souvenir
store we find an exasperated mom squabbling with her seven
year old  like many other storefronts in gotham this one is
overflowing with bootleg batman merchandise tshirts key
chains ceramic figurines  the kid is already wearing a
batman baseball cap and a little black cape but he obviously
wants more

mom drags him off past another store window this one full of
scrap metal with a sign reading authentic fragments of the
batwing  1995 and up  a panhandler is perched at the
entrance  beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt
with the familiar yellowandblack logo  in gotham this
winter batmania is everywhere

ext gotham square  later that night

two hours later the snowstorms grown into a fullfledged
blizzard  the drifts are two feet deep and the streets are
all but empty of cars  a massive snow plow the size of a
panzer tank rumbles past filling the frame

and revealing as it passes a group of carolers all
bundled up in mufflers and parkas  unbothered by the weather
they walk the street singing spreading cheer and goodwill to
the few passersby
theyve just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of silent
night when an oversized delivery truck outfitted with snow
chains clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow  its sides
are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice
cream snack  polar bars  oddly inappropriate for this time
of year

a streetcorner santa with bell and bucket waves at the truck
as it rounds a corner  the carolers carol  then 

 a violent explosion rocks the street  followed by the
sound of automatic gunfire and a high wailing security alarm

ext schrach and co  that moment  night

around the corner theres carnage on the streets  the windows
have blown out of gothams leading jewelry store  gutshot
security guards stagger and go face down in the snow as
robbers dressed in white camouflage gear clamber out through
the shattered glass with sackfuls of loot

carolers spill around the corner to see whats going on but a
spray of gunfire sends them scattering in panic  the polar
bar truck pulls even with the jewelry store and as it does

the rear doors open  a ramp slides down from the back of the
truck  the robbers scramble aboard and mere seconds later
slide out again  riding atop five skidoo snowmobiles

sirens howl  a police car appears taking the corner just a
trifle too fast  fishtailing on the icy street and plowing
into a drift

int squad car  that moment  night

the cops gun the engine but their wheels are spinning in the
snow  no traction  theyre about to climb out and give
chase on foot when through the windshield they see the
salvation army santa

hoisting an ak47 and firing directly at them  the
windshield disintegrates and the cops sink from view as santa
races off to the last of the snowmobiles which is already
burdened with loot

ext street  that moment  night

more squad cars converge on the jewelry store  but its
difficult to carry on a highspeed pursuit when the snows a
foot deep and the best you can do is 6 mph  the cop cars skid
to a halt blocked by the rumbling snowplow  by now of
course the looters are gone  scooting off on either side of
the plow sticking to the snowy sidewalks

ext streets  a moment later  night

snowmobiles glide across the sidewalks sending the few hardy
souls who are out on the streets diving for cover  a couple
of derelicts are cowering behind a fire hydrant trying to
avoid getting run over  every time they poke their heads out
another skidoo whizzes past missing them by inches

the robbers fan out in various directions  these guys are
obviously going to get away clean  unless

the derelict points up at the night sky where a beacon is
blazing in the darkness  the black silhouette of a bat

int police car  that moment  night

more sirens  a cop takes a radio call as he streaks down the
long wide avenue which borders gotham park  one of the few
streets which is relatively clear  the cop at the wheel goes
wideeyed and nudges his partner in disbelief

before their eyes five snowmobiles appear from the cross
streets up ahead and converge at the entrance to gotham park
bringing up the rear is santa claus

cop
what the hell  

ext entrance to park  that moment  night

brakes squeal  several squad cars are now massed at the
entrance to the park  but theres one problem  the citys
snow plows dont operate on the park roads  and the entrance
is blocked off with sawhorses reading closed to traffic  a
huge steep drift prevents them from entering  and so all
they can do is stand by helplessly watching as the
snowmobiles vanish into the trees

the cops race about like headless chickens trying to concoct
a plan  a couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls
of the park  another is at his car barking into a radio
mike

cop with mike
yeah you heard me  snowmobiles
pause
so what do we do  chase em on foot

all eyes turn at the blare of a horn  the cops peer down the
long corridor of the cross street  and see a strange black
vehicle barreling toward them at 90 mph with no intention of
stopping

the batmobile  cops dive left and right  a splitsecond
later

a fortyfoot jet of novaintensity flame erupts from the
front of the jetblack supercar  instantaneously dissolving
the drift that blocks the entrance to the park  turning the
ice and snow on the paths before it into water

the batmobile screams past in the wink of an eye  the cops
get to their feet cold as it is theyre sweating  one of
them mops his brow and announces dumfounded

cop i
that was batman

cop ii
no shit

cop ii yanks cop i into the nearest squad car and the others
follow suit  engines rev  as long as the batmobiles cleared
a path they might as well join in the chase

ext bridle path  that moment

two burly teenagers  both dressed in red berets and parkas
with black batman sweatshirts visible underneath  are
trudging along the path when theyre startled by a pair of
speeding skidoos  moments later they spot a red glow on the
horizon

and their jaws drop as the batmobile roars into view
burning off the snow in its path  thrilled beyond words they
whoop with glee slapping highfives as the car streaks past

int batmobile  on batman  that moment

his face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting
from the front of the car  cool as ever  approaching the
chase as a simple problem in logic  he checks a radar
display on his dashboard and sees five blips

ext park  on squad cars  that moment  night

the cops follow along in batmans path  the lead car loses
control and plows headlong into a drift  the driver jams the
pedal but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the
ice  he sits there cursing pumping the accelerator as other
cops race past him on foot

int batmobile  on batman

the various robbers have spread out their vehicles bounding
over the hilly terrain of the park  he spots two of them up
ahead as he draws closer they part ways veering off to the
left and right

angle on batmobile  moving

pods open on the front fenders and missile launchers rotate
into place  the batmobile fires a pair of heatseeking
torpedos which burrow into the snow on either side and
disappear

angle on left snowmobile  moving

the driver looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears
to be a black shark fin plowing through the snow behind him
gaining fast  he takes evasive action but the shark fin
always seems to follow  just as he approaches the crest of a
hill

the torpedo slams into the rear of the snowmobile  the
force of impact knocks the robber cleanly off  his loot lands
in the snow beside him but the snowmobile keeps going 
sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks
beyond with a deafening explosion

angle on right snowmobile  moving

this robbers a little smarter than his buddy  when he sees
the shark fin on his tail he noses his snowmobile off into a
grove of trees  the trees are too closely spaced for the
torpedo to maneuver it strikes the nearest tree trunk and
explodes harmlessly

the robber is feeling good about himself because the
batmobile cant follow either  but batman has a plan b  as
he drives alongside the grove he hits the accelerator
passing the snowmobile on its left  a steel spike attached to
a cable launches from the side of the batmobile and wedges
itself into a distant tree

the cable goes taut and the tree topples  directly into the
path of the second snowmobile  the vehicle crashes into the
trunk and the hapless robber goes cartwheeling headover
heels into a drift

in the distance cops appear  racing to the scene on foot
ready for mopup duty  batman kills the flamethrower hits
the brakes and fishtails doing a quick 180 on the snow
hes just spotted fresh quarry snowmobiles three and four
whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance

ext park  that moment

were at a makeshift campsite  where a cluster of homeless
people are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm  they
look on in puzzlement as the two snowmobiles whiz past and
disappear over a crest of a hill

ext lakefront  on snowmobiles 3 and 4

they bounce down the hillside and skid  arriving at the edge
of a frozenover lake  with the roar of the batmobile behind
them the two drivers get the same idea simultaneously
smiling they rev their engines and set out over the surface
of the lake

now the batmobile crests the ridge  the cars weight tips
suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake
batman sees whats happening and kills the flamethrower just
in time  but he cant brake the car on the snowy slope  the
prow of the batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake 

 and under its weight the ice begins to crack  the left
front tire takes a sudden dip  and worse yet the car is
sliding forward

int batmobile  on batman

he shifts frantically from drive to reverse trying to rock
the car out of its predicament but his rear wheels find no
purchase  he can hear the ice cracking beneath him
grimacing he throws a switch on the dashboard 

ext lake  on batmobile

 and the trunk pops open  an industrialstrength grappling
hook shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of
the hill and a concealed winch assembly begins to grind away
hauling the batmobile uphill out of danger

int batmobile  on batman

suspended just above the icy lake he sees the snowmobile
vanishing into the distance  he opens yet another panel on
the dashboard

ext lake  on snowmobiles 3 and 4

the robbers give each other a big thumbsup  theyre almost
halfway across the lake now and the batmobile is disabled
all at once they hear a strange whistling overhead

fireworks  no its a thermite bomb  rocketing past them
hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and exploding gaudily
jagged chunks of ice break free and shift in the frigid water
 and the robbers are skidding into the drink before they
know whats hit them

angle on snowmobile 5  moving

the last of the robbers is santa claus  his big sack filled
not with toys but precious stones  he approaches the edge of
the park negotiating his way through a maze of rocky
outcroppings  he squirts out from behind a boulder into a
clearing

and gasps in panic as a searing burst of flame erupts
behind him  the batmobile speeds out from the other side of
the boulder santa twists his accelerator desperately trying
to build up speed

as it is hes barely managing to stay ahead of the
flamethrower  but the jet of flame suddenly dies the hood of
the batmobile rises half a foot 

 and twin projectiles launch into the air  a heavy net is
strung between them  and it lands smack on top of santa
claus entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his
tracks

immobilized he watches through the net in horror as the
batmobile barrels down  when the great black machine is
almost atop him 

 it stops on a dime six inches from his heavilypadded
frame

ext entrance to park  a minute later  night

the cops are spread out near the entrance  theyve rounded up
the other robbers and returned most of the loot  they hear a
dull roar in the distance

and a few seconds later the batmobile streaks into view
dragging the net behind it  santa his loot and his
snowmobile all tied up in one tidy parcel

at the entrance to the park the net detaches itself from the
batmobile dumping santa into the hands of the waiting cops
without stopping the batmobile roars out of the park and
vanishes whence it came  a mildlyhumiliated cop turns to his
colleague and shrugs

cop i
merry christmas

the second cop points to santa still struggling in the net

cop ii
giftwrapped and everything

dissolve to

ext city hall  day

tv minicam crews are camped out on the steps of city hall
with a sizable crowd watching from the street  commissioner
gordon is reading from a prepared statement

gordon
after a highspeed chase  over 750000
in precious jewels were recovered intact
by the police force  working in concert
with batman

at the sound of batmans name a chanting goes up in the
crowd

voices in crowd
take back the streets  take back the
streets  take back the 

gordon winces and lets out a sigh  the chanters are a group
of pugnacious wellmuscled kids late teens and early
twenties all dressed in identical garb black batman
sweatshirts and little red guardianangel berets  theyre
obviously members of the same club  just like the guys we
saw in the park

gordon waits for them to shut up but they dont so he grabs
the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly trying to be heard
over the din

gordon
i would like to stress  that while this
city enjoys a special relationship with
batman 
louder
 we do not condone vigilantism 
practically screaming
 in any form

its no use  hes totally drowned out by the red berets who
continue to shout and shake their fists  giving up he
returns the mike to a reporter and marches up the steps in a
huff  the red berets cheer

cut to

insert  television screen

the evening news a live onthespot interview from gotham
square  a superimposed graphic identifies a surly kid in a
red beret as mike sekowsky  spokesperson  order of the
bat

sekowsky
and hey  where does this 
bleep expletive deleted

group of concerned citizens thats all

woman in crowd

sekowsky
hey lady  were out here on patrol
riskin our necks to protect old biddies
like you
into mike
if this lameo gordon could do his job 

more catcalls from the crowd  the picture jumps suddenly as a
minicam is jostled some sort of scuffle appears to be
breaking out  before it does camera pulls back from the tv
screen placing us in

int wayne manor  kitchen  night

where alfred the butler is watching the sekowsky interview
with extreme dismay  as he trims the crusts from a pair of
hearty watercress sandwiches he slices his finger open

alfred makes a pained face  its all sekowskys fault
onscreen the fracas continues sekowsky has recommandeered
the mike

sekowsky on tv
were provin that the spirit of batman is
alive in this city  were gonna take back
the streets

sekowsky raises a fist  behind him his cronies begin to
chant take back the streets  take back the streets
incensed sucking on his finger alfred moves to the tv and
flicks it off

he turns on the radio in search of something more soothing
good king wenceslas pipes through the manor smiling alfred
sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a
sterling silver tea service

int bruces library  that moment  night

the carol continues underneath as alfred white linen draped
over one forearm sets the tea tray down on his masters big
mahogany desk  he digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a
side drawer

the drawer contains a stack of yellowed aging newpaper
clippings  among them one which reads thomas wayne
murdered prominent doctor wife slain in robbery
unidentified gunman leaves child unharmed  alfred digs
around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed switch at
the rear of the drawer

gears grind and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the
wall  sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a stone
stairway which descends into darkness

int batcave  a moment later  night

descending the stone stairs alfred arrives in the batcave
good king wenceslas is on the speakers down here as well
across a catwalk the batmobile rests on its little plateau
wrapped in a tarp

alfred clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea
service down  he glances up at the bank of video monitors and
sees sekowsky still babbling on several channels
simultaneously  he scans the cave but theres no trace of
bruce

alfred
sir   master bruce

as if in response bats screech and flutter in the distant
recesses of the cavern  alfred turns suddenly and sees bruce
behind him suspended from a thin filament wire rising out of
a bottomless abyss

bruce
im not deaf alfred  i hear you

hes wearing his civvie  tweed pants and cashmere sweater 
but hes got the utility belt with its springaction reel
buckled about his waist  clutching a bundle he hangs in
midair for a moment dangling over the void  alfred slowly
regains his composure

alfred
i took the liberty of preparing tea
indicating tbe monitors
i take it youve been watching the news

bruce still dangling glances up at the sekowsky interview
and nods

bruce
yeahlot of crazy people in this world

bruce rocks back and forth to build up momentum  he kicks off
on the nearest stone outcropping lands gracefully on the
batcave floor and unbuckles his belt  preoccupied he drops
his mysterious bundle on the lab table a roll of black
fabric and a cluster of lightweight hollow aluminum rods
connected by what appears to be surgical tubing

alfred
i should inform youchristmas is
approaching and weve received our annual
solicitation from the firemans toy fund
eyeing the equipment
if i may inquire

bruce
oh yeah  watch this

bruce hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the
tubing  the tubing inflates and the rods spring erect 
stiffening winglike into something which looks remarkably
like the skeleton of an umbrella

alfred
most ingenious sir  what exactly  it

bruce
what does it look like

alfred
to the untrained eye sir it looks
remarkably likethe skeleton of an
umbrella

sounds good  bruce eyes his new invention thinks it over
smiles slyly

bruce
good guess alfred  thats exactly right

bruce hits the trigger and the rods wilt with a hiss  he
sits at his lab table alfred unfolds a napkin on his lap
pours a cup of tea

alfred
splendid sir and if i may say im glad
youre putting your time to such
productive use
beat
now  the toy fund  our contribution
last year was a halfmillion dollars

bruce
we can do better than that

alfred
then theres the fosterparents program
the gotham homeless crusade

bruce nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich  he seems
oddly preoccupied  not exactly melancholy but his thoughts
are obviously a million miles away  alfred looks on
concerned

alfred cont
is something troubling you sir

bruce
yeahthe holidays i guess  always gets
me thinking about
he changes the subject
and to tell you the truth im a little 
concerned about vicki

alfred
anxiously
miss vale sir

bruce
yeah  ive been thinking about it lately
thinking about it a lot
gravely shaking his head
and i still cant figure out what to
get her for christmas

bruce shoots alfred a solemn perplexed look  and alfred
heaves an audible sigh of relief as we

cut to

int prison cell  day

tight on a stack of coops and cages piled high against a bare
concrete wall  each cage  and there are at least two dozen
of them  contains a twittering bird starlings pigeons
cardinals titwillows

camera pulls back from the bars of the cages to reveal a very
odd figure in prison greys  a canary perched on his
shoulder sings happily as he stands in front of a grimy
cracked mirror plastering back his hair buffing his nails
with quick birdlike strokes

mr boniface is beaknosed epicene and so fat that it seems
his skin should burst the adjective that comes to mind is
obscene  despite his eccentric appearance he comports
himself with overblown theatrical dignity  fastidious and
preening he does not suffer insults lightly

camera pulls back further  through another set of bars 
and we realize that mr boniface is himself caged  a prison
guard arrives to slide back his cell door

guard
up and at em pengy   pengy

mr boniface pointedly ignores the guard refusing to
acknowledge the odious if wholly appropriate nickname

guard cont
boniface

mr boniface finally turns  with an expression of extreme
distaste he affixes a monocle over one eye returns the
canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out

int wardens office  day

mr boniface and his attorney sit at a long table across from
the warden and the members of the parole board

parole officer
you want to return the money you stole

boniface
intact  the map will show you where its
buried

the parole officer stares skeptically at a handscrawled map

parole officer
all of it  fortytwo million dollars

mr boniface stares down humbly at the table  as if he finds
the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to
bear

parole officer ii
why this sudden change of heart

mr boniface
gentlemen i want my debt to be repaid in
full  i want to be a part of civilized
society
oozing sincerity
prison life is not for me  the guilt the
fear the constant shameone meets a
disturbingly low class of people

parole officer ii
sure but  fortytwo million dollars

mr boniface nods plaintively  its quite a perfomlance  he
dabs at his face with a handkerchief its hot in here and
hes the delicate type

warden
his records clean  thirteen years
without an incident

attorney
id like to point out my clients put his
time to good use  a student of
ornithologyarticles published in
several respected journals

the parole officer thumbs through a stack of magazines bird
world ornithological review beaks and feathers nest egg

mr boniface
birds yes  my only source of solace

parole officer
in light of this rather extraordinary
gesture i see no reason not to endorse
your application for parole

boniface
thank you sir  you wont regret it

mr boniface shakes hands with the members of the parole
board  as the guards escort him out a black mynah bird
squawks loudly from its cage in the corner of the office

mynah
crime does not pay  aawwk  crime does
not pay

chuckles all around  on his way out the attorney gestures
toward the mynah  and beams at the parole board

attorney
personally trained by my client

int prison cell  day

free time  the cell doors are open and the convicts are
milling around in the common area  tbone 220 lbs of dumb
hulking beef saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate
mr boniface staring at a stack of empty cages  boniface
whirls on him suddenly his face beetred apoplectic with
rage

mr boniface
 where are my birds

tbone
shit pengy  i let em go

mr boniface
hermione  my canary  its the dead of
winter

tbone flops casually on his bunk obviously enjoying mr
bonifaces profound distress

tbone
they were all cooped up  with you leaving
and all  seemed like the humane thing to
do

bonifaces gaze falls on a corner of the cell  he spots a
scattering of yellow feathers  a patch of fresh blood  with
a supreme effort of restraint he turns and forces a smile

mr boniface
i see   you might as well have this  i
wont be needing it

he tosses a sony walkman to tbone who flicks it on  the dim
strains of classical music are audible through the
earphones

tbone
well thanks pengy  no hard feelings
chuckling to himself
yknow im gonna miss that pudgy little
ass of yours

tbone tunes the walkman to a rock station slips the headset
on grins from his bunk  two guards arrive  as they escort
him out mr boniface mutters

mr boniface
you wont miss it long

ext prison  main entrance  day

its fifteen degrees outside as mr boniface  aka the
penguin  waddles forth from the prison gates regally
attired in cutaway and pinstripes  he pauses to inhale a
deep lungful of the icy air then with a smile of
exhilaration he removes his coat and stretches  spreading
his wings reveling in the cold

a stretch limo pulls up  two identically gaunt and vulture
like dandies formally dressed with bowler hats and
umbrellas step out to meet him  these two gentlemen  frick
and frack  serve as the penguins general factoti and
business managers

frick
welcome back mr boniface

penguin
mr frick  mr frack  our years of
planning are about to pay off

int limo  moving  day

now that hes loose the penguins rapacious side is beginning
to show  his eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his
own ingenuity

penguin
i take it they found the money all right

frack
we buried it exactly as you specified
42271009

penguin
how much have we got left

frick reaches into his coat for a balance sheet

frick
lets see  an initial capitalization of
42 million and change compounded over
thirteen years at an annual return of
just under sixteen percent 

penguin
fine fine  how much

frick
seventynine million   excluding the
sum we buried

the penguin lets out a dry heaving chortle midway between a
normal laugh and a ducks quack  he checks his watch and
reaches into his pocket for a small electronic device

penguin
speaking of burials

ext prison yard  day

tbone on work detail  hes got the walkman on and hes
shoveling snow to the beat  he winces and removes the
headphones

the music he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie
highpitched whine  hes twisting the knob trying to find
the station he was tuned to when a pigeon dives down straight
at his head

tbone
hey  

he drops the shovel as the bird strikes glancing off his
head  before he can react three more pigeons have swooped
down at him pecking at his head and shoulders in a frenzy

he lets out a howl and staggers through the prison yard in a
frenzy  dozens of pigeons are pouring over the prison walls
shrieking hideously descending on him  he falls to the
ground screaming for help but the other prisoners run like
rabbits terrified

by the time the guards come racing across the courtyard
tbones no longer even visible  theres just a swarming
manshaped mass of pigeons pecking away flapping their wings
insanely  covering their faces as they move in the guards
blow their whistles  beat at the pigeons with billy clubs

all at once the pigeons take off en masse  leaving tbones
mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard  a guard notices the
walkman picks up the earphones to listen and hears nothing
but rock music  surfin bird by the trashmen  bird bird
bird bird is the word

ext road  on penguins limo  moving

an aerial view of the limo as it cruises down the deserted
road leading away from the prison  it disappears from view 
and all at once the frame is filled with pigeons great
squalling flocks of them dutifully following their master as
he makes his way back to gotham city

int wayne manor  entryway  night

alfred opens the front door and finds a bundledup vicki out
on the portico redcheeked flushed and happy  she pulls
him forward gives him a quick peck on the cheek

vicki

present for bruce

shes got a long skinny gift box propped up against the
exterior wall  at first it doesnt want to fit through the

she gets it inside  the faithful butler stares curiously at
this oddshaped gift

vicki cont

she reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another
small gift  alfred stares at the tag  to alfred love
vicki  and tries to suppress a huge grin

alfred

alfred and vicki turn  its bruce dressed for dinner
marching down the long stairway in the entry hall  vicki

box 

bruce

vicki frowns and gives him a kiss  she nestles up against
him  whispers in his ear

vicki

still in the clinch bruce shoots a look at alfred  taking
the hint alfred clears his throat and bends to pick up one
end of the ski box  he backs out of the entry hall dragging
the box before him

ext gotham park  night

fires burn in garbage cans  tents and leantos dot the snowy
landscape  men women and children wander aimlessly
huddling against the cold

an army of the homeless has set up camp in gotham park  on
the nearby periphery picketers  half concerned citizens
half downandouters  are marching the sidewalks keeping a
candlelight vigil  handlettered placards read save the
park  parks are for people  this park is our home

the source of the protest  a towering sign posted in a corner
of the park announcing the imminent consuuction of a new
luxury highrise  the gotham park towers  a project of shaw
construction inc

the next intersection  turns the car right into the park

ext pubinthepark  night

despite the name its a tony little bistro catering to
gothams elite  a panhandler underdressed for the cold has
been hustling the customers as they come out a couple of
parking attendants are trying to drag him discreetly away as
bruces car pulls up

a valet opens the car for bruce and vicki who look on in
concern as the panhandler gets the bums rush  the liveried
doorman shrugs apolagetically  sorry for the inconvenience
 as they enter

int pubinthepark  night

postdinner  vickis got a sheaf of photos spread out on the
table in front of bruce  shots of gothams homeless being
forcibly evicted from slum dwellings erecting their
shantytowns in gotham park

vicki
theyre already razing the tenements and
sros downtown  these people dont have
anyplace else to go

huge windows open on a serene and picturesque view of the
park campfires flicker in the distance

bruce

distance off near the entrance to the park  two red berets

nearby vicki shoots a highly quizzical look at bruce who
responds with a mystified shrug  her professional curiosity
piqued she wanders over to introduce herself to the jogger

an exasperated cop leads the red berets away from the crime
site

ext waterfront district  night

snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming gotham harbor
foghorns blare in the distance as a pair of stiletto heels 
totally inappropriate for the weather  click across the
sidewalk and pause at midblock where a wide wooden plank
leads down from street level to a seedy holeinthewall bar
the wharf rat

int wharf rat  night

a roughneck joint about as trendy as the average bait shack
the clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving
up for their next tattoo  a tv over the bar is tuned to the
late news

anchorwoman
and tomorrow the citys power elite
will be turning out in force to greet
millionaire industrialist walter barrett
who returns to gotham after a fiveyear
stay in europe

the bartender switches to a hockey game because none of the
rowdies at the bar give a shit about walter barrett  none
that is except for a strapping young bruiser named ricky who
gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner

moments later the owner of the high heels enters she opens
her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler revealing exotic
vaguely eurasian features  shes dark and elegant fine
boned regal of bearing  and her name though we dont know
it yet is selina kyle

shes not the kind of girl who typically frequents the wharf
rat and so her entrance creates quite a stir  a longshoreman
at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the
felt  two blowsy whores size her up territorially as she
finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene
indifference

the regulars of course are all but licking their chops  the
only guy in the joint who hasnt noticed her yet is ricky
whos still on the phone

ricky
yo  ricky here  whats the haps

in midconversation he notices selina  she smiles invitingly
 right at him  mildly startled he smiles back

ricky cont
midnight  no sweat  see you then

he hangs up eagerly  then with a deep breath he hitches up
his pants and swaggers over to selinas end of the bar

selina
well  ricky is it

ricky
howd you know that

selina
i heard you on the phone  talking to your
girlfriend

ricky
girlfriend  no no  that was business

selina makes a big show of peeling off her gloves

selina
if youve got time for a little pleasure
maybe youd like to buy me a drink

she clasps his hand  his eyes bug out  three enormous rings
a diamond bracelet  there must be several thousand in rocks
on her left hand alone  ricky gapes at the sparklers
bedazzled

ricky
jeez  they look almost real

selina
why wouldnt they be

ricky is not the smoothest guy around and his line of thought
is all too evident  he swallows hard and tries not to stare

ricky
youd have to be crazy  nobodyd wear the
real thing to a dive like this

selina
oh theyre real all right  so are
these

she waves her fingernails  long polished and talonsharp
 in front of his eyes  with lightning speed before he can
react she pins his wrist to the bar  and with one quick
stroke carves a thin bloody stripe in the back of his hand

selinas eyes flash as he gasps in shock  he tries to jerk
his hand away but he cant break her grip  then  her
dominance firmly established  she releases his hand with a
coy cheshirecat smile

selina cont
werent we going to have a drink

he blinks forces a chuckle smiles unsteadily  she takes his
wounded hand lifts it slowly to her mouth and laps gently at
the blood  ricky is hypnotized

shes got an odd way of flirting but ricky finds it somehow
 intriguing  he dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals
to the bartender

ext waterfront  pier 31  night

just after midnight the snows still failing the waters are
icy and the wharfs are deserted  almost  a small steamboat
is docked at pier 31 and the deck is lined with thugs 
mean ugly and heavily armed

a similar contingent of guntoting goons is waiting to greet
them on the dock below  the boys on the dock hoist assault
rifles as the boat thugs extend a gangplank  something major
is about to happen

the chief dock goon gestures to his lieutenant who grabs a
black medical bag  hands raised the two of them start up the
gangplank

throughout all this the dock goons keep their guns trained on
the boat thugs covering their buddies  one of them turns to
a colleague

dock goon i
wheres that goddam ricky

dock goon ii
probably out gettin laid  and here we
are freezin our balls off

ext steamboat  on deck  that moment  night

the lieutenant unloads chemical testing gear from his doctors
bag  the lead boat thug gestures to a stack of shipping
crates which rest atop a large net spread out across the deck

boat thug i
you pick

the chief goon selects a crate at random  two boat thugs tip
it on its side and using a crowbar pry off a false bottom 
revealing a dozen packets of white powder

pov shot  high angle  that moment

were now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a
ramshackle boathouse at waters edge  down on the deck of the
steamboat the lieutenant goes to work testing the
merchandise

lieutenant
its pure

reverse angle  that moment

a black silhouette is peering down from the boathouse roof
the mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight the only
details that register are a pair of ominously familiar pointy
ears

chief goon os
lets do it

he gestures to his boys on the dock a craneandwinch
assembly rotates into place over the deck  and the boat
thugs gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to
the big hook

boat thug i
hold it  lets see the money

down on the wharf a dock goon kneels beside a metal suitcase
and opens it  lots of long green inside  the boat thug
signals thumbs up and the crates rise into the air as the
goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank

low angle  on gangplank  that moment

the goon with the suitcase marches up  beyond him in the
distance a lithe black shadow vaults off the boathouse roof
and makes a silent graceful landing on the long shaft of the
crane

another angle  that moment

the moment of maximum tension grim faces all around everyone
holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck
and crane swings over the pier

angle on crane  that moment

razorsharp chromesteel talons slash suddenly through the
air

on dock  low angle  that moment

the netting gives way and two dozen shipping crates rain down
onto the pier crushing two dock goons underneath  the crates
explode into splinters littering the dock with drugs and
random art objects as the other dock goons scatter in panic

on steamboat  that moment

nobody knows quite whats going on  panicking the goon with
the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the
gangplank  boat thug i sees him and squeezes off a quick
shot  winged the goon topples off the gangplank and hits the
drink suitcase and all

pandemonium  all at once everyones opening fire  thinking
hes been doublecrossed boat thug i turns on the chief goon
and shoots him twice at pointblank range

boat thug i
you son of a bitch
to another boat thug
go after it  get the money  go

he raises his gun and the second boat thug dutifully obeys 
diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire  everyones
ducking for cover  boat thug i barks orders at the
pilothouse

boat thug i
soltar las amarras   cast off

another boat thug
look

boat thug i whirls just in time to see a shadowy figure
landing catlike on the deck mere yards away  clad in inky
black leather from head to toe the intruders face is
concealed by what appears to be a bondage mask  studded with
openings for the eyes and mouth it spans one incongruous
touch a pair of pointed cat ears

she bares her teeth and hisses

its a woman

boat thug i is momentarily mesmerized  in the time it takes
him to lift his gun shes produced a catoninetails  she
snaps it at him reels him in and with one lethal stroke
rakes her steel talons across his face and throat  he slumps
to the deck lifeless

the other boat thug rushes her she catches him under the jaw
with a sudden upthrust lifts him into the air and sends him
toppling into the water

the gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the
pier  she hoists an abandoned assault rifle scatters the
dock goons with a round of automatic fire and vaults off the
boat  landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier

most of the dock goons have taken flight but a few unlucky
specimens remain behind  she somersaults forward takes one
goon off his feet with a crack of the whip knocks another off
the dock with a twirling highkick to the jaw sends two more
reeling with swift talonslashes  the whole frenzied mopup
action takes just under ten seconds  alone at last she
stands back to survey the scene

counting the stiffs on the boat  which is now receding in
the harbor  there must be well over a dozen dead  the snow
is speckled with red  a halfdozen bodies lie sprawled in
their own blood one of them the lone survivor is facedown
and softly moaning

retracting her steel claws the masked woman crouches amid the
wreckage of the smashed shipping crates  bindles of white
powder  millions of dollars worth  are scattered all
about the pier but she couldnt seem less interested
instead shes checking the manifest numbers stamped on the
sides of the crates

she finds crate 18396bb and rummages among its contents
until she comes up with a carefullywrapped parcel  she opens
it carefully and holds it up for inspection  the statuette of
a raven  carved from solid onyx  glistens in the
moonlight

the woman pauses long enough to slip a small card in the
moaning punks back pocket  then cradling the raven under
one arm she dashes off on silent cat feet

a lantern approaches  its an old salt  some kind of
hapless night watchman  and his face goes bonewhite at the
sight of the carnage on the docks  he kneels beside the
moaning punk turns the body over and gasps  because the
punks face has been clawed to shreds

int penguins lair  night

the unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with
the flutter and song of coldweather birds  dozens of them
all chirping flitting about in the rafters alighting on
special perches mounted in the walls

at the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken pool
arctic terns loll on the surrounding rocks as a lackey with a
wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the alreadyfrigid water
carefully landscaped it looks like the penguin exhibit at the
gotham zoological gardens

a massive indistinct shape glides beneath the surface  its
not a whale its too pink  it is instead the penguin 
and as he breaks the surface sputtering he sees frick
standing in the open doorway

frick
mr boniface  yourvisitor has arrived

penguin
thank you mr frick  show her in

the penguin moves to the edge of the sunken pool  two of his
lackeys swivel a crossbar which hangs from the ceiling by a
long chain into place over his head  he grasps it with both
hands  and the crossbar rises hoisting his formidable bulk
out of the water

int highrise  corridor  that moment

frick leads the visitor down a long corridor lined on either
side with bird cages  exotic songbirds with brilliantlyhued
plumage  camera tracks along behind her and although we
cant see her face there must be something distinctively
feline about her  because the birds are shrieking and
fluttering in their cages recoiling instinctively as she
strolls past

frick opens a door and ushers her into

our visitor  selina kyle  enters the penguinpool room
her teeth begin to chatter  the big bay windows have been
thrown open and snow is blowing in from outside its

she sees the penguin  wearing a thin dressing gown and an
apron outfitted with seed pouches  scattering birdseed on
the window ledge for the pigeons totally oblivious to the
cold  he turns throws his arms wide in greeting kisses the
back of selinas hand

penguin

selina

seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal at the

tries to sit up she pushes him back down with a single
finger

sitting on the edge of the bed she peels off her stockings
twisting them around into tight cords  with a coy smile she
runs her finger in a circle around shaws hairy chest  and
then abruptly knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and
ties it off on the bedpost

shaw
hey what are you doing  

he tries to break her grip  she backhands him sharply across
the face

selina
youre very inquisitive  youll just have
to be disciplined

an edgy smile spreads across his face as she binds his other

 and reemerges wearing her catwoman maskwhich seems
perfectly appropriate in this context

the street like a human hangglider as the cop cars cruise
past far below

int shaws bedroom  night

theres an awful banging at the front door  shaw lies under
the bloody sheets hands folded staring lifelessly up at the
ceiling  selina now dressed in full catwoman regalia slings
a lightweight knapsack over her shoulders  she picks up the
nearest chair rams it through shaws plateglass window and
clambers out onto the ledge outside

ten seconds later the cops burst in  they rush to the bedroom
 spot the shattered window the inert gory mass on the
bed 

 but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall
painted there in bloodis a big red dripping bat

cop

ext rooftop  shaws building  night

forty stories up  the catwoman in a surefooted crouch she
scurries along the ledge  springs at a cornice  and in one
lithe motion vaults up onto the roof  she scampers across the
rooftops dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle
like a mountain climber 

 until she reaches the building at the end of the block
here she pauses to dig in her knapsack  she pulls out a
retractable hook at the end of a rope swings it around
heaves it at the rooftop across the street

ext street below  low angle  that moment

police pile out of cars and race for the entrance totally
oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead  where the
small barelyvisible figure of a woman clad entirely in
black leather is doing a tightrope walk across the
intersection

ext rooftop  a minute later  night

the catwoman bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides
shes out of danger  then weary and exhilarated she drops
to her knees bathed in moonlight she preens stretches
emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure  shes just
made a kill and her blood is running high so shes stopped
for a moment of quality time

she hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over  her whole
body tenses and  though her head doesnt move  her eyes
dart left

a caped shadow has just touched down at the end of a line
the gold batemblem on his chest is visible for the briefest
of seconds before he steps back into the shadows  she acts
like she hasnt noticed

but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same

tight on batman  that moment

his eyes widen  his lips part as he watches her  if its
possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask were
seeing it now

his pov  on catwoman  that moment

she still doesnt let on that shes seen him  instead she
goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to strut like a
gymnast on the balance beam  posing for him in a little
private show  a strange selfinfatuated autoerotic dance
routine for batmans benefit

ext rooftop  that moment

his jaw is down around his knees  whoa  he edges forward
slightly as if hypnotically drawn to her

she hears a noise  stops  makes a big show of looking left
and right  somehow afraid shell see him watching batman
jumps back into the shadows  she gathers her things a small
white card flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof and
she vanishes over the edge

snapping back to reality he bolts across the roof just in
time to see 

ext side of building  on catwoman  that moment  night

shes rapidly working her way down the side of the building
flipping down from one fire escape to tile next  a master
gymnast  three stories up she lands on a railing then stops
 launching herself out over the street making a perfect
landing on the roof of a passing bus

ext rooftop  on batman  that moment  night

batman turns  and his eyes fall on the white card  he
kneels to pick it up a brief threeword message is scrawled
upon it

looking for love

he goes goggleeyed with astonishment  he rushes back to the
edge of the roof and sees the bus just turning toward the
entrance to gotham park  hes reaching for his grapplinggun
figuring to follow when a floodlight catches him full in the
face

ext streets below  that moment  night

down below the cops are sweeping their beams across the
rooftops  two of them catch a quick glimpse of batman just as
he ducks back behind the cornice out of view

cop
hey  you see what i saw

this sends the astounded cops rushing to their radios  right
on cue commissioner gordons car pulls up  lt bullock
whos already on the scene fills him in as he climbs out

bullock
its randall shaw  torn to ribbons  
we just made batman up on the roof

gordon
oh god

ext gotham park  that moment  night

the bus rumbles deeper into the snowy park  a black
silhouette springs off the roof into the trees disappearing
among the branches

we track with the bus as it moves through the park arriving
finally at

ext clearing in park  shantytown  night

the little colony of homeless people in their cardboard shacks
and leantos still occupying the future site of the park
towers  marchers and picketers are continuing their protest
nearby and some charitable organizations set up a makeshift
soup kitchen on folding tables  hot coffee and sandwiches

vickis on the periphery of the camp camera in hand  shes
trying to persuade a homeless man to let his picture be taken

vicki
please just one  its important for
people to see whats happening

homeless man
they dont want to see us lady  they
just want us gone  out of sight and out
of mind
mumbling as he wanders off
get worse before it gets better  it
always does

vicki turns  in the distance the picketers are shrieking and
wailing  a vans just pulled up to the edge of the park and
a dozen hardhats are elbowing their way through the crowd
all at once theyre swarming through shantytown with tire
irons and baseball bats overturning the sandwich tables
ripping down the shabby tents and leantos

some of the homeless people run  those who resist meet with
swift and sudden violence  a marcher jumps a hardhat and
gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble

vicki waits for the police sirens but they dont come  she
backs off toward the trees she begins snapping photos
frantically capturing the carnage on film

a hardhat is dismantling a leanto with his tire iron 
sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the
snow  when he glances up and sees vicki taking his picture
he points her out to a colleague

and suddenly the two of them are rushing toward her with
pure cold malice in their eyes  vicki turns to run but its
slow going in the snow  she slips and falls her attackers
are almost upon her

when a shadowy figure dives out of the trees and tackles
one of the hardhats  the figure lands a powerhouse blow to
the fallen hardhats jaw knocking him out cold

the second hardhat turns and lifts his tire iron  but the
figure with surprising agility is already rolling out of the
way  as he rolls he grabs the first guys hardhat off his
head and brings it up in front of him  blocking the blow
from the second guys tire iron

in the same motion he plants a foot in the second hardhats
belly and sends him reeling backward hardhat ii drops the
tire iron and the figure snatches it out of midair as he gets
to his feet  he moves in on the second hardhat brandishing
the iron 

 and while hardhat ii is staring at it the figure high
kicks him in the face  hop kick  hop kick  the figure has
nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit
the ground

the figure turns toward vicki  her eyes go wide with
astonishment

its a kid thirteen or fourteen at the outside sunkeneyed
grimylooking in a tornandtattered raincoat  she stares at
him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the
aid of his fellow homeless

she cant believe what shes seeing  the kid wades smack into
the midst of the remaining hardhats and kicks ass 
spinning pirouetting kicking clawing in a furious display
of pure athleticism  it seems like hes everywhere at once
theres only one other guy in gotham city who can handle
himself like this

rallying behind him the marchers and homeless people snatch
bats and tire irons from the fallen hardhats  and the tide
turns  the invasion is being repelled  faced with renewed
resistance the few hardhats still left standing turn tail and
race off to their van

triumph in shantytown  the marchers and homeless cluster
together to lick their wounds  and the kid satisfied that
everything is under control turns and sprints off toward the
trees

but one prostrate hardhat is only playing dead  as the kid
runs past the hardhat extends a tire iron into his path 
tripping him sending him sprawling in the snow  the kid
throws up his hands as the hardhat prepares to smash down at
him

clang  the hardhat drops his tire iron and topples over
boardlike  the kid looks up and sees vicki standing there
with a baseball bat

he gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his
feet  thanks for returning the favor  hes about to light
out again when 

vicki
wait  dont be afraid  i wanted to thank
you  i 

kid
cautiously
twenty

vicki
what

kid
twenty bucks

vickis mildly taken aback but she reaches for her purse just
the same  shes barely gotten her wallet open when the kid
snatches the bill out of her hands  they stare at each other
for a long moment 

vicki
who are you

kid
dick

 and then hes bounding off like a shot  vaulting up into a
tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches  vicki starts to
follow but theres no way she can keep up  instead she digs
into her camera bag

her pov  through telephoto lens

using the long lens she tracks the kids progress through the
treetops  she cant actually see him but occasional chunks
of snow and ice are falling to the ground as he jumps from
limb to limb

for a moment it seems like shes lost him  as she sweeps the
lens back and forth scanning the trees she catches sight of
an equestrian statue in the distance  she ups the
magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal  the
stone figure on the horse is union war hero gen oliver wayne
 bruces greatgrandfather

as luck would have it the kid drops to earth not ten feet
from the statue  vickis got him in her sights again  he
looks around cautiously to make sure no ones following then
races toward a stone bridge which arches between two small
hillocks over a frozen creek

theres a drainage tunnel four or five feet in diameter
mounted in the bridge abutment the kid pries off a wire grate
and clambers inside then pulls the grate back into place
behind him  home sweet home

ext park  on vicki  night

as she lowers the lens  her face is full of conflicting
emotions  shed love to corner this boy vigilante and find
out what his story is  but on the other hand  even the
homeless are entitled to their privacy

a canary sings in its cage as a black cat watches transfixed
from a nearby chair  the cat arches its back  waits  and
springs at the cage batting at it in midair  the canary
shrieks the cat yowls a woman snatches it up off the floor
cradles it in her arms

womans voice

ensemble  at the desk behind her is the penguin in his

she strokes the cat in a reverie  the penguin drops his
polishing cloth startled

penguin

sputtering wildly
are you sure it was him  what did he do

selina
he stood on a roof and watched me  he
didnt realize id seen him  i dont
think he knew quite what to make of me
smiling
but he was definitely interested

this sends the penguin into a frantic round of pacing  or
waddling

penguin
this scheme of yours is backfiring  we
dont need him on our tails  do you know
how much money is at stake here

selina
money isnt everything

whats the point if we cant enjoy

the owner is in the store window hastily removing all of his
batman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to
teenage mutant ninja turtles and the simpsons  a mother drags
her squirming toddler past the entrance  the kid smells
heavy markdowns on batshit but mom clearly doesnt
approve

vicki pulls him off toward the entrance of the globe

vicki

bruce
hey it wasnt me remember  i am rich

as hes talking bruce glances back at the newsstand  he sees

it in the gotham globe personals

looking for love  eyes widening he digs in his pocket for a
quarter and races back to the newsstand  vicki keeps
walking

vicki

i mean shaw and barrett  if people
like that were really scared maybe

she suddenly realizes shes talking to herself  she turns
around and sees bruce back at the newsstand hurriedly
unfolding a copy of the globe  she marches back and tugs at
his sleeve

vicki

barks at him

and evening gowns making small talk  an open sarcophagus has
been set up as a wet bar

on a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall
rimmed by a decorative moat sits an ancient egyptian shrine

reconstructed in the fluegelheim sandstone walls fountains

tiny kittens romp at her feet  bruce whos just arrived is

pointing to each jar in turn

bruce withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder

bruce
youre in a gruesome line of work

selina

to do

bruces attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd
beast a winged lion with the head of a falcon

bruce
this one i know  its a gryphon right

selina
very good  a mythical demon halfbird
halflionsweeping down from the sky to
deliver retribution and justice

bruce nods  he can dig it  he regards the gryphon for a long
moment and chuckles

bruce
poor guy  birds and cats  you wouldnt
think the two halves would cooperate

selina
only under certain circumstances
beat

afraid id given you the wrong impression
or maybe it was the right impression

bruce
what was it you wanted to talk to me
about

selina

fabulous 

she breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself  she toys
demurely with her equipment  she looks up at bruce and
switches tactics  going for the direct approach  bruce
braces himself

selina cont

bruce
shrugging

selina

power and money  never really knowing

bruce

selina
i think youre a little bit nuts
beat
i think youre a little  bored with your
life  having everything you want  no
variety nodanger  and every once in a
while you need to take a risk  shake it
all up

bruce

selina

she leans back against a crate moistens her lips  shes
letting him have it with both barrels

selina cont
thats one thing i can give you bruce 
danger  a little something you cant get
at home

bruce hesitates  but the lure is irresistible  he moves
forward slowly selinas eyes close their lips draw slowly
closer

and he sneezes in her face  she backs off in shock as he
covers his face  his eyes are watering and hes wheezing
she rushes over 

selina
are you okay

bruce
is there a cat in here

right on cue selinas black cat hecate lets out a loud meow
 and stretches against bruces pants leg  he brushes the
animal aside and it leaps into selinas arms  bruce sniffles
uncontrollably

bruce cont

she drops the cat which scampers off  bruce rubs his eyes

selina
poor thing  youre allergic

bruce
yeah catsever since i was a kid
snorting and weeping
look id better get some fresh air
maybe another time okay

he heads for the door before selina can stop him  hes gone
but she knows shes left a dent in his armor  she smiles in
bemusement as hecate jumps into her arms and purrs

ext fluegelheim  a moment later  day

bruce stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated
he marches down the front steps past a newsstand  where he
stops to buy a copy of the afternoon globe

he opens it to the personal ads and finds what hes been
waiting for

tall dark and handsome  christmas is coming
why dont we trim the tree together

this puzzles him for a moment  until he looks up the street
in the distance at the very center of gotham square workmen
are stringing lights around an enormous christmas tree almost
fifty feet tall

the lighting ceremony is an annual event in gotham  bruce
smiles slightly tucks the paper under one arm and walks to
his car

dissolve to

ext gotham square  night

snow falls on a huge crowd gathered around the big tree  the
tree wont be lit for another twenty minutes or so and so the
onlookers are singing christmas carols from printed lyric
sheets

a band is playing on a makeshift orchestra platform erected in
front of the tree leading the crowd in a spirited rendition
of god rest ye merry gentlemen  the square is rocking with
good will toward men  when they get to the part about saving
us all from satans power 

ext rooftop overlooking square  that moment  night

 the camera tilts upward to batman watching the action from
his usual gargoyles perch  hes scanning the streets and the
rooftops waiting tor the catwoman to make her move 
whatever it is

he glances at the building directly across the square from
him  on the roof is a neon sign reading gotham city globe in
ornate oldenglish letters  and above that a rotating metal
sculpture of the world turning  his eyes rove downward along
the facade of the building

ext gotham globe  that moment

at street level an armored car has pulled up in front of the
globe offices  three security guards with rifles climb out of
the armored car followed by a fourth  who has an oblong box
handcuffed to his wrist  of course we cant see whats
inside but to those of us in the know the box looks just
about the right size for a raven statuette

the guards scan the street and enter the building without
incident  as they do a newspaper delivery van crosses the
frame mounted on its side is an advertising placard which
reads

batman hero or menace
read all about it in the gotham globe

ext rooftop  on batman

he watches with some curiosity  an armored car is this some
part of the catwomans scheme  but nothe guards are safely
inside the building and the car is leaving  he settles back
to wait

int newspaper delivery van  that moment

the innocuouslooking van rounds the corner of the globe
building  frick is at the wheel frack is riding shotgun and
the penguin is between them peering out eagerly through the
windshield

they turn into the globes basement garage  where dozens of
similar vans are parked at the loading bays  just part of the
fleet

int provosts office  a moment later

the quartet of security guards arrive at provosts office
the publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy
getaway  the lead guard  the one cuffed to the raven box 
sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at
arms length while provost unlocks it and checks its contents

satisfied he slams it shut  he reaches into his top drawer
for an envelope which he hands to his personal secretary

provost
open this in an hour  phone my wife and
tell her where to meet me
to the guards edgily
no trouble on the way i take it

lead guard
no sir mr provost  we came straight
from the bank vault

guard ii
copter should be just touching down
well have you safely out of here in no
time

ext rooftop  on batman

here comes santa claus echoes up from the streets  batman
watches as a copter descends toward the helipad on the roof of
the globe

int corridor outside office  a moment later

provost and the lead guard with the raven box are at an
elevator bank  the other guards head for a stairwell

guard ii
well check the stairs  see you on the
roof

the lead guard starts to press the up button but provost
pulls a key from his pocket instead

provost
no  my private elevator  its safer

int elevator shaft  that moment

shooting down on the car as it rises  the shaft above it is
filled with birds  starlings crows pigeons and the like
swooping and gliding among the gears and cables

ext roof of globe building  that moment

in bg the helicopter on its pad idling noisily the rotors
still spinning  in fg the small dormerlike structure that
houses the stairway  the metal access door opens and the
first of the guards steps warily out rifle at the ready  he
smiles back at his pal

guard
no way  they dont pay us enough to
tangle with batm

a blackgloved chrometaloned hand snakes around the edge of
the dormer and rakes across his throat

int elevator car  that moment

sweat beads up on provosts lip as the guard hits the up
button and the car begins to rise  suddenly the lights go
out  the car stops with a lurch

provost
what is it  whats happening

suddenly there in the darkness they hear a series of loud
popping soundswhich could be gunfire

ext gotham square  that moment  on crowd

singing here comes santa claus at the top of their lungs
happy faces beam  no one hears anything unusual over the
music

ext rooftop  across street  on batman

batman straining to listen  we get another faint series of
pops  barely audible over the caroling from below and the
loud puttputtputt of the helicopter blades

he cant really be sure hes heard anything at all  he scans
the roof of the globe building but he cant see whats
happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon
sign

ext globe building  rooftop  that moment

the catwoman lets fly with another burst of automatic fire
from the dead guards rifle  the helicopter is still idling
but no ones left to fly it  the rooftop is littered with
stiffs

int elevator car  that moment

pitch black  preverbal groans and murmurings of fear issue
from the darkness  an eerie red light kicks on  the
emergency generators  and we see provost backed up in a
corner of the car twitching and jumping like a crazed
spastic  the guard in a futile effort to placate him points
up at the light

guard
there  mr provost  see  the
generators kicked in  its just an
electrical problem

provost is only marginally consoled  they hear a strange
twittering noise in the shaft above them

provost starts babbling again  the guard slaps him across the
face  but the twittering has him a bit concerned as well  he
stares up at the ceiling of the car as he punches buttons on
the panel with another lurch the car begins to move

guard
there  see  its moving  were fine

provost
its going down  were going down

int elevator shaft  that moment

the birds in the shaft have all roosted on the top of the car
theyre patiently riding it down as it descends

int elevator car  that moment

the car stops again  provost is totally losing it  the
exasperated guard grabs him and shakes him

guard
okay mr provost  im gonna have a look
through the trap door  but i need you to
help me  okay  you have to help

provost nods and tries to get a grip on himself  the guard
looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car  he cant
reach it

he uncuffs the box containing provosts raven from his wrist
 and stands on it  still short  unholstering his gun and
using it as a prod he can almost reach the trap door  he
jumps up and poking with the gun manages to dislodge the
panel slightly

more twittering  provost and the guard look up through the
tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness

guard
probably just some bird thats gotten in
the shaft  now calm down  youll have to
give me a boost

the guard climbs back atop the raven box  provost gives him a
boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap
door

guard cont
okay help me outsteady

provost wraps both arms around the guards wriggling legs and
tries to hoist him upward

int shaft  on roof of car  that moment

from a vantage level with the roof of the car we see the
guards fingers clinging to the lip of the trap door  now
his head rises into view pushing the panel aside as he pulls
himself upward

he peers around  his brow wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight
 passels of squawking birds walking back and forth in front
of him strutting and preening mere inches from his face

int elevator car  that moment

the bottom half of the guard dangles from the ceiling
provost still has his arms wrapped around the guards knees
all at once the guard begins to scream  his body jerks and
his legs kick wildly  still provost struggles to hang on 
even as blood spatters across the top of his bald dome

finally the guards violent spasms are too much  provost
trips over the raven box stumbles backward and lands on his
ass in a corner of the car  the guard tumbles in a heap to
the elevator floor his face pecked and clawed beyond
recognition his eyes gone altogether

provost lets out a series of shrieks  he peers at the open
trap door sees the birds staring curiously down at him and
shrieks again

the emergency telephone rings  he stares at it  it rings
again  shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage
provost crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver

wwho is this

int globe  basement loading bay  that moment

newspaper delivery vans are parked in neat rows  all
driverless  frick is sitting with a boxful of electrical
equipment next to a bank of elevators all the cars have been
locked open here in the basement except for one  provosts
private elevator the doors to which are still closed  the
penguin stands beside it speaking into a red phone

penguin
mr provost  if you want to get out of
that car alive i suggest you follow my
instructions to the letter

as he talks we see various newspaper employees sprawled on
the concrete nearby dead  a corrugated metal door has been
lowered over the loading bay separating the newspaper
production staff from the van pool  theyre trapped on the
other side  banging away loudly on the door

penguin cont
shut up in there
calmly into phone
you should see a cord hanging just behind
you

int elevator car  that moment

provost looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned
cord descending through the trap door

provost
yes  yes i see it 

penguin vo filter
tie the cord to the handle of your box

provost lets the phone drop  he grits his teeth but hastens
to obey  as hes knotting the cord around the handle of the
box a dinky bird flutters down through the trap and sends him
into a panic  practically weeping he reaches for the phone

penguin vo filter
when youre done i want you to give two
sharp yanks on the cord

cowering in terror provost reaches for the cord and yanks it
twice

provost
who are you  why are you doing this

int loading bay  on penguin

behind him frick and frack are pulling on red berets and
batman sweatshirts  order of the bat gear  frick climbs
into a newspaper delivery van and starts the engine

penguin
well mr provost i guess you could call
me an irate reader  and to be perfectly
frank  im doing this because i hate
garfield

chuckling the penguin holds a sonic device up to the
mouthpiece of the phone

int elevator car  that moment

a shrill whine emanates from the receiver  all at once the
elevator car is full of birds  squawking wildly flinging
themselves against the wall going insane in the tiny confined
space

provost is screaming like a madman  the birds are in his
hair his face  everywhere  he fights his way over to the
panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy

all at once the car plunges downward  its as if the floor
has drops away beneath provosts feet  hes in freefall

int loading bay  on penguin

he hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from
the elevator doors

int elevator shaft  that moment

the raven box dangles from its cord in fg as the car rockets
uncontrollably downward  a steady stream ot birds are making
a quick exit from the trap door in the roof

int topfloor landing  that moment

the catwomans on a landing near the stairwell just below the
dormer that leads to the roof  she pries open a pair of
elevator doors

and a flock of birds pours out of the empty shaft making
for the open access door a halfstory above  she reaches
inside finds the cord attached to the raven box and reels it
in

she rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at
her trophy  its there all right  another raven just like
the first two  an awful crash from twentyfive stories down
rattles the shaft

she makes a disgusted face grabs the raven and bolts for the
roof

ext rooftop across street  on batman

he watches in puzzlement as a vast flock of birds takes flight
from the globe roof across the square  something weird is
definitely going on  hes about to abandon his post 

 but down below the carolers have stopped caroling  the
big trees about to be lit and theyre counting off the
seconds

ext gotham square  corner newstand

a ramshackle kiosk at street level  the news vendor has
stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities
a globe delivery van its side bearing the batman  hero or
menace advertisement cruises past and dumps a bundle of
papers on the curb

ext gotham square  on crowd at tree

excitement is building as the seconds tick off

crowd
three  two  one

the christmas lights come on and the crowd breaks into
cheers  the orchestra strikes up a sprightly version of
jingle bells

ext gotham square  on newstand

the news vendor is applauding and singing along like everyone
else when a second newspaper van rumbles past

news vendor
hey  no  i aleady got a 

he spots two masked men in the doorway of the van  wearing
red berets and batshirts  they shove a body out the door 

the mutilated corpse of harrison provost lands on the sidewalk
with a thud  right beside a bundle of newspapers which read
batman murder spree baffles police

ext gotham square  on van  moving

the news vendor chases after the van but its already rounded
a corner and is cruising along the periphery of gotham square
the crowd is still singing merrily unaware of its presence 

 until the back doors fly open  and a swarm of rabid
chittering bats screech out into the midst of the crowd

ext gotham square  on crowd at tree

the carolers break into mass hysteria as hideous bats swoop
down from above clawing at their heads and shoulders
orchestra members drop their instruments and stagger off the
band platform falling into the branches of the giant
christmas tree

ext gotham square  on sidewalks

christmas shoppers are teeming in and out of nearby stores
they drop their shopping bags and race about in utter chaos as
the bats attack  women scream  children scream  men scream
too

a man staggers backward through a glass storefront and lands
on his butt in a window display  a big mechanical santa
claus on his northpole throne chuckling merrily in a
prerecorded voice ho ho ho  the man struggles wildly as
the bats converge on him

int department store  that moment

horrified shoppers scatter through the aisles as the bats pour
in through the broken window  women lined up for a free
makeover squeal in panic as bats arrive to rearrange their
hairdos

ext rooftop  on batman

he stares down stunned at the pandemonium raging below  he
glances across the streetand sees the tiny silhouette of a
woman standing atop the castiron globe sculpture laughing at
the chaos taunting him

ext streets  overhead angle  that moment

a few blocks away from gotham square  sirens howl  theres a
steady stream of cop cars speeding toward the site of the
disturbance  one vehicle is moving in the opposite direction
against traffic  a newspaper delivery van

ext globe building  rooftop  a moment later

batman touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the
corpses strewn across the helipad  a dying guard raises a
shaky hand

batman crouches beside him  a gurgle comes up from his throat
and a bubble of blood swells on his lips  all at once he
hears a womans voice from the shadows of the globe
sculpture

catwoman os
some people just cant take discipline
beat
go ahead  finish em off

his head jerks up  he cant see anything  a sudden whooshing
noise and now the voice is coming from the other side of the
roof

catwoman os
you might as well  youre going to get
blamed for it anyway

he stands  he gets a quick glimpse of a feline shadow
springing past a skylight shes jumping all around the roof
clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures  he reaches for a
batarang

catwoman os
oh come on angel  you know you want to
purring loudly
besides  i want to see how you do it

batman
who are you

hes barely gotten it out when she slams into him from behind
feet first knocking him to the rooftop  he tries to get up
but she comes at him with a couple of cartwheeling kicks
knocking him back into a cornice  he ducks right just as a
sharp spiked heel strikes the exposed brick a mere three
inches from his throat

he catches her leg upends her  but she somersaults away and
lands on her feet  cats always do

catwoman
my arent we frisky tonight

he flings the batarang  it clangs into the big neon sign as
she springs up into the darkness out of reach  glass tubing
shatters and sparks fly as she calls down from the shadows 

catwoman
i should tell you  ive got nine lives
to play with  and youve only got one

he turns  she drops directly onto him  and locked in a
death grip they stagger backwards across the roof directly
toward the helicopter  the huge rotor blades are still
turning

batman ducks instinctively and the catwoman breaks free 
falling backward onto the roof  its a strategic move when
he rushes at her she braces herself against the ground and
kicks upward with startling force

this time the spiked heel connects  lifting batman off his
feet knocking him backward into the tail of the helicopter
he slumps there stunned  and before he knows it shes on
him

she grabs his throat with one hand and clamps the other around
his crotch  he tries to break her grip but shes just as
strong as he is  and shes lifting him  forcing him upward
toward the rear stabilizing rotor on the tail of the
helicopter

the rear rotor blades whine like a buzzsaw as his head rises
perilously closer  at the last possible instant he grabs a
handful of her hair  yanks it as hard as he can 

with a yowl she releases him  they tumble to the roof and
she dives atop him  her talons click into place  he sees
them poised directly above his eyes 

 but manages to slam an elbow under her chin before she can
strike  now theyre disentangled they get up groggily and
circle each other

someone is banging on the metal door that leads up to the
roof trying to break it down  batman turns for an instant 
a sudden crack 

 and he finds himself all wrapped up in the catwomans cat
oninetailswhich is also outfitted with a taser  she
sends a paralyzing electric charge through his body and he
collapses to the roof in a jittering heap  the banging on the
door is louder

catwoman
did i tell you i invited company   keep
em busy angel ive gotta scat

she kneels down and plants a big wet kiss on his twitching
face  then she scurries to the edge of the roof
disappearing 

 just as the door gives way  and an armed swat team comes
crashing out onto the roof

just coming around batman tries to roll out of sight  but
the cops are swarming the place  they spot the bodies on the
tar and gravel see batman scuttling for cover and draw the
obvious conclusion  pulling guns they open fire  bullets
ricochet off the big metal globe

batman as is customary in these situations shoots a
grappling hook at the roof of the next building over  which
is a couple of stories taller than the globe  and reels
himself upward along the side wall  the swat cops score a
couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum
but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough
to reach the roof

someones obviously tipped the cops about the source of all
the ruckus 

 because a pair of police cars are on their tail and gaining
fast  still hanging in the doorway the penguin raises his
umbrella peers down its length like a rifle sight and pulls
a trigger

itself in the grille of the foremost police car

the cops in the car react in astonishment as pigeons begin
hurling themselves at the windshields  a dozen kamikaze birds
bounce off in rapid succession  cracks begin to spread across

the cops cant see where theyre driving  the car swerves
wildly  and still the pigeons keep coming  covering the
windshield  totally obscuring the streets from view

unmolested

ambulances are pouring into the square as the bat attack
continues  cops are firing their guns blindly into the skies
as they try to evacuate the citizenry  paramedics drop the
stretcher theyre carrying when bats swoop down at their
heads

ext rooftops  night

batman is still pursuing the catwoman whos perched one roof
over in a squat wiggling a finger for him to follow  the
roofs are icy and treacherous but he matches her step for
step leap for leap as she vaults from one building to the
next leading him on  finally she reaches the edge of a
building on the corner of the block theres no place to go
but down  she squats on the ledge and smiles beckoning to
him 

catwoman
ooh  where have you been all my life

he edges closer  suddenly she does a backflip  directly
off the edge of the roof

batman hears glass shattering  he hesitates a second  moves
closer to the edge of the roof  peers over the icy cornice

batmans pov  that moment

staring down he sees a narrow ledge running around the facade
of the building some ten or twelve feet below  the window of
a corner apartment has been smashed the curtains are flapping
in the chill wind

ext roof  on batman  a moment later  night

shes obviously making her getaway through the apartment
batman climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop
to the ledge below  cautiously because its a long way
down  a sudden crack 

the catwoman hasnt entered the apartment  instead shes
followed the ledge around the corner of the building silently
doubling back onto the roof behind batman  he turns just as
her whip wraps itself around his left leg  she gives it a
sharp tug  his feet skid on the ice  and he topples over
the edge of the roof

ext facade of building  on batman

he plunges downward for the briefest of seconds  then jerks
up short slamming into the wall of the building  the whip
has coiled itself around his leg and for now its holding
tight  hes dangling upside down batlike he bounces away
from the wall he spins in midair as one loop of the whip
unravels dropping him another foot or so

he manages to brace his left foot against the wall  its a
massive strain but hes momentarily safe if he can keep from
moving  the alternative is a twelvestory drop straight down
to the pavement

ext roof  on catwoman  that moment

shes wrapped the handleend of the whip around an exposed
pipe on the roof anchoring batman in place  with a cheshire
cat grin she removes the raven from her knapsack and holds it
on the edge of the cornice

ext facade  that moment

batman hanging immobile  craning his neck he can just see
the

raven statuette on the ledge above him  bouncing slightly
and apparently talking to him

catwoman os
nevermore  nevermore

now the catwoman appears beside it  elbows on the cornice
chin propped up on her folded hands like a chatty girl at a
fern bar

catwoman
cute huh  i think itll look nice over
the fireplace  maybe you can drop by and
see it sometime
demurely
i hope you wont think im too
aggressive or anything but i find you
very attractive

she toys aimlessly with the whipcord batting at it like a cat
with a piece of yarn  batman grimaces  she speaks in a low
soothing seductive tone  almost a purr  behind the bondage
mask she bats her eyelashes

catwoman cont
its just so hard to meet interesting men
these days  dont you think so
sighing
i have trouble with relationships  men
find me intimidatingkind of predatory
you know  really im not  really im
just playful

batman huffs and puffs trying to bend at the waist so he can
grab hold of the whip  she frowns and yanks on it  his foot
flies free of the wall and another loop of the whip uncoils
before he can stabilize himself

catwoman cont
dont laugh  im trying to open up to
you

angrily she holds a steel claw to the whip  ready to cut
him loose

angle on batman

hes palmed the grapplinghook launcher from his belt
holding it close to his body out of view he works it around
into firing position  hell shoot it right through her if he
has to

catwoman cont
i always seem to fall for the wrong guys
you knowmost men are rats

angle on catwoman

she withdraws her hand from the whip reverts to her
philosphical mode

catwoman
mice really  its disgusting  they beg
you to walk all over them and then they
whine when you do it  once youve had
your fun theres not much you can do but
kill them
beat
but you seem different  i mean you
obviously understand about dressing up
that saves a lot of explaining  i think
people should indulge their fantasies
dont you

batman is sweating profusely  he cant hold his position much
longer  and the catwoman is dragging this insane flirtation
out endlessly

catwoman
so i think ill let you live  cute boys
like you are hard to find
standing up
bye angel  ill be thinking about you

and just like that she vanishes  moving silently off with
her raven leaving batman to dangle  he hangs there a moment
tries to twist himself around without moving his foot  he
braces one hand against the wall with the other he lifts his
grappling gun and fires

the hook snags somewhere on the roof  batman yanks the line
taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when 

 the catwoman reappears over the edge of the cornice

catwoman
geeim so fickle

a quick swipe of her steel talons and the whipcord is neatly
severed  batmans foot slips out from under him  but hes
still got hold of the grappling gun  he drops eight or ten
feet

ext roof  on catwoman

watching with amusement as batmans weight causes the hook to
dislodge  it skitters across the gravel surface of the roof
and catches at the last instant on the edge of the
cornice 

 which promptly crumbles and gives way  fascinated the
catwoman leans over the edge of the roof and peers down

angle on batman  as he falls

he flails wildly tangled in his cape as the ground rushes up
toward him  he gets a lastditch inspiration  finds the gas
cylinder on his belt and hits the switch  the rods in his
cape begin to inflate

six stories up his batwings spring erect slowing his plunge
five stories up an updraft hits him and he suddenly inverts
four stories up he rights himself  three stories up he goes
into a downward spiral out of control gliding in great wide
arcs over the street

and a moment later there are no stories left  with an ugly
crunch he smacks into the slushcovered pavement and bounces
face down he skids some twenty feet to a halt  right in the
middle of a busy intersection

ext intersection  that moment  night

a delivery truck hits the brakes and screeches to a stop two
feet away from batmans head  he doesnt move  pedestrians
are already gawking and pointing as the driver climbs out and
peers down at the inert caped figure lying facedown in the
street

driver
what the hell is this

cars are backed up due to the panic in gotham square a few
blocks over  horns are honking  a traffic cop marches
over 

traffic cop
awright whats the problem here
spotting batman
jesus

he tries to clear the crowd away  a fullfledged gridlock is
forming around the prostrate batman  the cop blows his
whistle tries to maintain order as two unifonned patrolmen
rush up to join him

they manage to roll the unconscious batman over on his back
the assembled cops stare down at the mask the scuffed body
armor  still waxy they finger the guns in their holsters

patrolman
good god  cowan  get to the car 
radio the commissioner

by now there must be two hundred people in the intersection
all surging forward to get a look  more cops are arriving to
beat them back

traffic cop
is he dead  what do we do

patrolman
the mask  get the mask off

they hunker down over batman  one of them tugs at his mask 
but the helmetlike cowl doesnt want to give way  he feels
around 

traffic cop
some kinda seam here on the neck

the patrolman nods okay and the cop tugs at a velcrolike
fastening under batmans chin  the instant it comes open 

 a burst of fine green mist spews forth from concealed jets
in the goldandblack batemblem and the cops reel backward
shrieking gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes
boobytrap  theyve just been maced

one of the onlooking cops steps back in horror and confusion
on impulse he draws his gun and fires twice at batman  the
body jerks and the bullets ricochet off 

traffic cop
dont shoot you idiot  the crowd 

before he can finish a black boot kicks the gun out of the
onlooking cops hand  batman is back among the living
sirens blare as he spins and rolls into a crouch  lashing
out with elbows and knees  driving the cops back 

fuck the crowd  two more cops pull their guns and open fire
in absolute panic  batman slams backward into the delivery
truck and crumples to the ground  as he falls he grabs a
couple of smoke capsules from his belt and flings them to the
pavement

seconds later a thick cloud of black smoke is spreading
through the intersection  batman emerges into the midst of
the crowd  weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles 

ext intersection  another angle  night

a mounted cop rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam
drawn by all the confusion  he rears the horse back turns it
in a circle blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute
the incoming cars

suddenly a wire wraps itself around his chest and arms  he
looks down  he sees a batarang in the instant before a sudden
jerk pulls him cleanly off his mount

batman climbs up on the hood of the nearest car  vaults over
to the next  and the next  then hops into the saddle of
the mounted cops waiting horse  he digs in his heels
maneuvering through traffic

ext police car  a moment later  night

lt eddie bullock and another plainclothesman are a few blocks
off trying to get through the jam  their siren is on but the
cars blocking their path have no room to pull over  bullock
grabs the radio mike

bullock
hell of a mess up here commissioner
well have to go in on foot

as they wait for a response they see a horse charging past in
the opposite direction  on the back of the horseis batman

gaping bullock nudges his partner  who throws the car
immediately into reverse  as they watch batman kicks the
horses flanks and turns right  toward gotham park

int gotham park  a moment later  night

two red berets members of the order of the bat are on night
patrol strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to
the park

red beret i
this is wack man  nothing ever happens
around here anymore

the other red beret lets out a whoop of fear and yanks his
partner out of the way  they tumble into a snowdrift as
batmans horse vaults over the stone wall of the park and
gallops past nearly trampling them in the process  by now
squad cars are roaring into the park

int park  another section  a moment later

sirens blare and red lights flash in the distance as the cop
cars spread out along the winding roads that run through the
park  batman reins the horse in suddenly as a blackandwhite
whips past on an access road just ahead of him no more than
twenty yards away

he turns the horse in a circle  more red lights appear in the
distance another contingent of squad cars has just entered
from the opposite side of the park  its going to be tough
getting out of here

then his eyes fall on the statue of his greatgrandfather
general wayne  two waynes on horseback not twenty feet
apart  he thinks back to his earlier conversation with vicki
and gets an inspiration

he rides past general wayne to the stone bridge which spans
the little frozen creek  there he finds the drainage tunnel
vicki described obscured by the wiremesh grate  this must
be where the boy vigilante holes up

he dismounts ties his cape to the pommel of the horses
saddle and sends it off with a slap  he pries the grate loose
and crawls inside

int drainage tunnel  that moment

a dank but cozy hideout warm steam hisses from a grate in
the floor

rumbling sounds fill the little chamber as a subway train
passes directly underneath  a little farther back theres an
access shaft with a jacobs ladder leading to the train
tracks below

poking around he finds a couple of cardboard boxes  the boy
vigilantes stash  the first contains tins of food plus
various odds and ends  the seconds more in line with what he
needs  its full of old clothing

a train rumbles past underneath  bruce removes his cowl and
sets about putting together a civilian disguise thatll get
him out of the park  a wool hat and a long motheaten
topcoat perfect  as hes pulling them out of the box he
spies something extremely odd 

its a costume  a spangled redandgreen gymnasts outfit
with a little yellow cape  neatly folded and in pristine
condition  he removes it carefully from the box and holds it
up in front of him  stitched on the vest is a single initial
r in a black circle  he stares at the whole mystifying
ensemble in complete befuddlement

the roar of the train subsides and he hears a scuffling
noise  someones in the tunnel with him  he lowers the
costume abruptly 

 revealing dick the boy vigilante whos crouched in front
of him not three feet away  the kids just crawled up through
the access shaft and hes not at all happy to see an intruder
messing with his stuff

dick
its mine

he lunges furiously at bruce  the two of them tumble back
into the grate at the tunnel entrance knocking it loose 

ext park  mouth of tunnel  that moment  night

a police car streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds
before bruce and dick roll out into the snow still grappling
bruce flings the kid into the bridge abutment  dick lands
hard when he looks up his eyes widen and a weird crooked
smile comes to his face

out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent  the body
armor  the goldandblack emblem on the breastplate  and
above it all the face of bruce wayne exposed to view

as a siren howls nearby bruce flattens himself against the
bridge  like it or not his fate rests entirely in a strange
little boys hands

the kid sizes up the situation immediately  he nods his head
up and down  then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws
it to bruce

bruce is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth  he
pulls on the coat gives dick a nod of acknowledgement and
starts to move off

dick
no  wait

bruce turns uncertainly  dick throws him his woolen ski cap

the kid giggles  oddly uncontrollably  then he sprints off
into the woods dancing leaping  as he disappears from view
he lets out a shrill piercing almost feral shriek 

 which is obviously intended to divert the cops  bruce
makes haste in the opposite direction

ext park  another section  a moment later

bruces horse gallops through the trees the black batcape
still attached to its saddle and billowing behind it

int squad car  moving  that moment  night

two cops scanning the park  the caped horse charges past in
front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the
headlights  from a distance it looks like batman is still in
the saddle

the cop at the wheel makes a sudden turn  a moment later he
slams on the brakes

a man has just stepped out onto the road directly in the
squad cars path  a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen
ski cap obviously one of the homeless  a cop leans on the
horn and shouts out the window

cop
dumb son of a bitch

the man  bruce  steps back out of the squad cars path
the cops take off  in hot pursuit of a riderless horse

int wayne manor  kitchen  predawn

a doctors bag rests on the kitchen table  alfred in robe
and slippers rummages inside it and comes up with an ace
bandage

alfred
commissioner gordon called  he wants to
install a full contingent of police guards
here at the manor  in roundtheclock
shifts  to protect you from batman

bruce is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair  his shirt
is open and hes holding his arms aloft while alfred wraps a
full roll of adhesive tape around his battered ribs

bruce
great  whatd you tell him

alfred
i told him that since you were batman
youd require no protection from batman

bruce makes a face how droll  alfred tears off the tape with
a brisk yank  and bruce lets out an involuntary yelp of
pain

bruce
jesus alfred  

alfred
in future siri strongly advise against
trying to fly off twentystory buildings

bruce
its just a few bruises

alfred
one bruise sir  which covers your entire
body

bruce gets up  stiffly  and buttons his shirt in gingerly
fashion while alfred packs his firstaid gear in the doctors
bag

bruce
im getting too old for this line of work
beat
cops placed me at the scene of the crime
 that weird kid of vickis saw my
face 

alfred
i shouldnt worry overmuch  i doubt the
two of you move in the same circles

bruce
 and i got the living shit knocked out
of me by a woman

alfred
sir  such outmoded sexist attitudes are
quite unbecoming

int upstairs bedroom  day

in a lavishlyappointed guest room on gothams upper east side
or equivalent thereof we find a pair of plainclothes cops
settled in for a stakeout rumpled topcoats thrown across
antique chairs frenchfry bags and greasy burger wrappings
littering the carpet  highpowered rifles propped against one
wall

they peer through venetian blinds at an elegant old brownstone
across the street

his pov  roof of brownstone  that moment

a uniformed cop also carrying a walkietalkie is keeping
watch on the roof of the brownstone  he signals all clear
to his counterpart watching from the house opposite

int unmarked car  that moment

two more plainclothesmen are parked at the end of the block
munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone  they
spot a postman lugging his sack up the treelined street on
his way to the brownstone  one of the plainclothesmen picks
up his radio mike

plainclothesman
mailmans coming

ext brownstone  a minute later

the postman marches up the front steps of the brownstone
sorting through letters and packages  he hasnt even rung the
bell when the door is opened by another cop  who snatches
the mail delivery from his hands and slams the door in his
face

int brownstone  that moment

more cops at least half a dozen are milling about inside 
unshaven ties loosened shirtsleeves rolled up  theyre in
for the long haul

the first cop gives a handful of letters to a couple of
colleagues  then hands over a parcel wrapped in brown
paper to a pair of bombdisposal experts  they carry it
gingerly into the kitchen  into the midst of all this
bustling activity strides commissioner gordon

gordon
anything suspicious

in the parlor where all the shades are drawn two cops are
examining each letter in turn holding them up to a light
bulb creasing them carefully before slitting them open

cop
nothing yet  christmas cards and bills

he anxiously watches their progress  a voice calls from the
kitchen

bombdisposal expert vo
commissioner  

int kitchen  a moment later

gordon enters  the bombdisposal boys have their equipment
scattered all over the kitchen table  theyve slit the brown
paper wrapping of the package exposing a round decorative
tin

bombdisposal expert
its a fruitcake

he lifts the lid for gordon to have a look

gordon

int brownstone  entry hall  that moment

a blearyeyed elliott tiptree marches down the stairs carrying
a pair of oversized suitcases  his wife and two kids are
behind him  all bundled up preparing to embark on an
extended vacation

policeman

tiptree fighting back tears embraces his wife for a long
wordless moment  their little girl aged six tugs at mommys
sleeve

mrs tiptree

he gestures toward the gifts piled high around the tree in the
parlor

tiptree

tiptree forces a smile for the kids  he clutches his wifes
hand

gordon
sorry folks but wed better move along

mrs tiptree

tearful hugs all around then a cadre of uniformed cops escort
mrs tiptree and the kids to the door  tiptree pulls gordon
aside

tiptree
theyll be safe wont they

gordon
as safe as we can make em
beat sternly
it would help if you could give us some
small hint what this is all about

tiptree
i told you  i

tiptree shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes  gordon is
convinced hes holding something back

gordon
you have no idea what was in that box that
provost had delivered from the bank

tiptree shakes his head wearily  gordon glowers as he turns
to go

gordon cont
all right mr tiptree  merry christmas

gordon exits  tiptree wanders listlessly into the living
room pulls back the drapes and watches as his wife and kids
ride off in a convoy of police cars  one of the cops tries to
pull him away from the window but he refuses to move

until a phone rings  everyone jumps at once  a technician
hits a switch on a loudspeakerandtaperecorder assembly
then gestures for tiptree to pick up the receiver

tiptree
hello

voice on loudspeaker
mr tiptree  andy here  listen  weve
got a chance to grab a goodsized block of
atlantic teledyne at twentysix and an
eighth 

the cops heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment

tiptree
not today andy  lets talk after new
years

tiptree hangs up and starts to bawl right there in the middle
of the room  the cops turn away in sympathetic embarrassment
as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff
jolt

int tiptrees bedroom  day

wallowing in despair tiptree sits at an antique secretary
composing a letter  he takes a long pull on a glass of
scotch signs his name and inserts the letter into an
envelope  he opens the desk drawer  takes a long look at a
38 automatic stashed inside  then finds a stamp and affixes
it to the envelope  he addresses it to bruce wayne

a moment later he hears a noise at the window tink tink tink
he peers through the blinds and sees a carrier pigeon on the
ledge outside  pecking at the glass asking to come in

he raises the window and the pigeon hops fearlessly inside
onto the sill  the bird welltrained struggles only
slightly as he unties a tiny capsule from its leg and removes
a folded note  scrawled across it is a handwritten message

if police see this your family is dead

he opens the note and begins to read as the pigeon takes wing

slinks over and takes bruce by the arm  shes on him like a
barnacle

selina

gesturing toward alfred

int hallway  a moment later  day

bruce leads selina down a hallway to the armory  he glances
back over his shoulder and sees alfred peering snoopily around
the corner

bruce

worried

aroused

bruce

alfred

stuffing inside it  his head turns suddenly at the sound of
the doorbell

int upstairs hallway  a moment later

tiptree emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister
into the entryway below  standing there is an unexpected
visitor  bruce wayne  holding his arms aloft while a
battery of cops pat him down

bruce
what are you looking for  batarangs

tiptree
bruce  come on up

int tiptrees library  a moment later

tiptree lets bruce inside and shuts the door behind him
bruce hands him a gift box

bruce
i brought you a christmas present  sorry
about the wrapping  the police made me
open it

tiptree opens the box and pulls out a diamondstudded tie
clasp  he looks up at bruce with an odd mixture of
bewilderment and gratitude  bruce nods for him to try it on
and he obliges

tiptree
im afraid i dont have anything for
you

bruce
i think you may have something that
belonged to my father

tiptree

he stares at bruce astonished  his head sinks into his
hands

in 1880 the gotham city treasury was
looted  it was a fantastic operation 
perfect military precision  the robbers
made off with milllons in gold and silver
bullion

a horsedrawn cart weighted down with gold bricks careens
around a corner  atop it are two men in masks firing a
gatling gun into the crowd  police and onlookers tumble to
the pavement shot dead as another cart emerges from the
wreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite
direction

passed down through generations  father

to hand it over  hes right you know

soul of gotham

bruce stares at him stonyfaced  theres one part of the
story that doesnt quite add up

i dont believe you elliott  my father
was a decent man  an honorable man  he
would never have taken part in a scheme
like this

fortune was based on a crime  a crime
against the city

reputation or not he wouldve tried to 

tiptree
christ bruce  do you want me to spell it
out for you

bruce backs off  an awful shiver of anticipation runs down
his spine

tiptree cont
he was a decent man  he was an honorable
man  thats why they had him killed

adult bruce is wearing as he relives it all thirty years

its late and the house is dark as tiptree treeds silently
downstairs carrying an oversized suitcase  the lights are on
in the kitchen where the cops are playing poker and watching
tv

int parlor  a moment later  night

christmas tree lights twinkle in the darkness  tiptree kneels
beside the tree and digs around among the packages  he pulls
out an oblong gift box with a tag addressed to daddy  from
santa

with a glance back at the kitchen he soundlessly unwraps the
package  and opens it to reveal a matched set of raven
statuettes  he transfers them to the big suitcase  then
slinks into the hallway

int bedroom across street  that moment  night

the two stakeout cops are chuckling at a charlie brown
christmas special on a portable tv  one of them glances out
the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the
brownstone suitcase in hand

stakeout cop i
shit  thats tiptree

the cop grabs for his walkietalkie

ext street outside brownstone  that moment  night

tiptree is halfway down the block when two cops burst out of
the brownstone

cop
mr tiptree  what the hell are you 

headlights flash on as the surveillance car revs its engine
tiptree breaks into a run  and the cops from the brownstone
follow suit  at the end of the block he vanishes down a
subway entrance

int subway station  that moment

a violinist is panhandling outside the token booth as the cops
come racing down the stairs  the cops trip over his open
violin case scattering small change across the conrete floor
they flash their badges at the booth and vault over the
turnstile 

 just in time to see tiptree with his suitcase scuttling
down a stairway which leads to the train platform below

int subway platform  a moment later

tiptree steps onto an express train  the doors slide shut
behind him  and the hapless cops curse under their breath as
he rolls off

cop
weve gotta get back to the radio

int subway car  a moment later  moving

tiptree takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively
being fabulously rich bes probably ridden the subway twice
in his life  and at this time of night every face in the
sparselypopulated car looks vaguely menacing  derelicts
prostitutes teengang members  all of them eye this well
heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his
suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor

an odd gaunt figure enters at the end of the car  its a
deafmute  he shambles down the aisle passing out little white
cards  one side is a guide to international sign language
the other reads

deaf and dumb
please help  100

two young toughs take a card and tear it in half chuckling
shining the deafmute on  a hooker the heartofgold type
stuffs a buck in his tin cup  he reaches tiptree and extends
a card tiptree ignores him refusing to make eye contact 

 but the deafmute shoves the card insistently into his face
now tiptree looks up  this card bears a personalized message

gotham central station
btrain west to riverview

tiptrees eyes widen  the deafmute  who is in fact frick 
glowers down and holds out his cup  tiptree digs in his
pocket the smallest bill hes got is a twenty but he hands
it over anyway

smiling at this act of generosity frick moves on to the next
car  tiptree stares down tremulously at the card  he fidgets
with his tie clasp  the one bruce gave him earlier

int gotham central station  that moment

its slightly more crowded here in the hub of gotham  tiptree
emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of transit cops
thirty or forty feet away  speaking into walkietalkies as
they scan the crowd

sticking close to the tracks he turns swiftly toward the
nearest stairway  blending in with the crowd trying to hold
the suitcase out of view

int lower platform  a minute later

tiptree is running for the btrain just as the doors begin to
close  he manages to thrust the suitcase inside  but the
doors slide shut on his hand and he drops it  he stands
there on the platform his face turning bone white as the
train lurches forward

false alarm  the train stops and the doors hiss open again

int subway car  moving  a moment later

tiptree clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations
as the train pulls out a couple of roughlooking but helpful
street types show him to a seat and hand him his precious
suitcase  he sits there panting

moments later a deafmute enters the car  tiptree does a
take its the exact same guy who was riding the other line
of course he doesnt know about fricks malignant twin

tiptree watches as she approaches on her way to the stairwell
stilleto heels clicking across the floor  theres something
familiar about her  but shes wearing a big broadbrimmed
hat and she tilts it down as she passes obscuring her face
it is of course selina

tiptree stands there expectantly with his suitcase awaiting
further instructions  they arent long in coming  a black
mynah bird swoops out of the tunnel lands on the platform
and struts in front of him

mynah
follow me  awwwkk  follow me

the bird flutters its wings and takes off again  into the
tunnel  tiptree stares after it in disbelief  then the bird
caws again  its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of
the tunnel

mynah os
follow me  awwwkk

tiptree clambers over the edge of the platform dropping
awkwardly to the tracks below  suitcase in hand he begins to
walk

int limo  moving  night

alfred tearing up the streets as bruce consults his tracer

bruce
hes slowed down  looks like hes under
the park

alfred
how do you propose to get down there sir
we cant have batman strolling up to buy a
token

bruce
i know another way in
beat
step on it  theyre down there waiting
for him

alfred turns the limo hard right  into gotham park  past
the statue of general wayne atop his horse

int subway tunnel  that moment

a local train roars by filling the screen  when it passes
we see tiptree with his suitcase walking along the express
tracks at the far wall of the tunnel  more frightened with
each step  its dark and eerie down here in the tunnels the
only illumination comes from dim lanterns spaced at fiftyfoot
intervals

he sees the lights of an express train behind him and quickly
switches to the local tracks  the train rumbles past with a
deafening blare and the car lights briefly illuminate his
surroundings  tiptree glances over at the inside wall of the
tunnel

where he sees huddled in an alcove just off the tracks a
small gathering of homeless people  theyve set up camp down
here in the tunnels away from the elements  surrounded by
bags full of old clothes dining on canned food and cheap
wine they stare curiously at the wellheeled stranger with
the suitcase whos invaded their domain

tiptree eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace hastening
down the tunnel  the homeless make no move to follow  with
one exception  a kid thirteen or fourteen in a ratty
topcoat climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively
as tiptree vanishes into the shadows

his face is familiar  its dick  the boy vigilante from the
park

int tunnel  farther down tracks  a moment later

in this stretch of the tunnel the lanterns dont seem to be
working  and the mynah is completely invisible  when he
comes to a fork in the tracks he has to wait for the sound of
the birds shrill voice to guide him

mynah
awwrrk  follow me

tiptree stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness  he trips on
the tracks and drops the suitcase  as hes getting to his
feet a flashlight shines directly in his face

voice
stop there

the mynah bird flutters through the beam of light and perches
on the shoulder of an unseen figure  tiptree cowers and
squints trying to make him out but the figure who stands
before him is shielding his face with an open umbrella

tiptree
ive cooperated  ive done everything you
said

penguin
open the case

tiptree lifts the lid revealirig two ravens in the suitcase
a cackling laugh echoes in the darkness

penguin cont
two ravens

tiptree
the other one is bruce waynes
trembling
he doesnt know anything about this
youve got what you want  theres no need
to 

penguin
thank you mr tiptree  you may go

tiptree stands  he backs away from the suitcase warily

tiptree
my family  you wont 

penguin
well certainly take your unexpected
generosity into consideration

tiptree
we  
shielding his eyes
youre not batman

penguin
no  im his brotherinlaw  birdman
now move out

int tunnel  high angle  that moment

tiptree marches slowly down the tracks toward camera
silhouetted in the flashlight beam  the beam shifts slightly
as the penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light
down 

 and we catch sight of the catwoman perched on a steel
crossgirder above the rails her chromesteel talons glinting
as she waits for tiptree to pass underneath

int tunnel  on tiptree

looking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross
girder  he slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat
whirls suddenly 

 and brings up his 38 automatic firing three quick shots
at the penguin  the shots ricochet loudly off the umbrella 
which happens to be a bulletproof job  the penguin lifts his
brolly fire spits out of the shaft 

 and tiptree staggers backward  shot in the chest  he
spins into a steel upright and topples faceforward onto the
electrified third rail  frying himself in a shower of
sparks

the smoke is still clearing when the catwoman drops to the
tracks  the penguin rushes to her side to check tiptree for
signs of life

catwoman
that idiot  another six feet 

penguin
so sorry to spoil your fun   he brought
two ravens  weve got a complete set

catwoman
what

penguin
yeah  theyre in the suitcase 

an awful rumbling fills the tunnel  they see the lights of a
train approaching on the center track  the same one theyre
standing on the one tiptrees body is slumped across  the
penguins first impulse is to run back toward the inner track
where the ravens lie but the catwoman is trying to drag
tiptree out of the trains path

catwoman
give me a hand

they pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the
train arrives  they stand against the outer wall waiting for
the train to pass

and when it does they see dick  the boy vigilante 
standing on the inner track directly across from them
holding the suitcase  the kid takes off like a shot  the
catwoman and the penguin exchange quick looks of utter
disbelief  and bolt after dick

int tunnel  on dick

the bulky suitcase is slowing his progress  he looks back
over his shoulder although the stubbylegged penguin has
fallen well behind the catwoman is gaining fast

int tunnel  on dick

watching in the light from the train as the two costumed
figures grapple in the distance  he races back toward the
scene of the melee

int tunnel  outter express track  that moment

where batman and the catwoman are trading punches blow for
blow  he knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook
and she sprawls on the track dazed and bleeding  she lifts a
hand no mas

he looks back toward the suitcase on the center track  before
he can make a move toward it he spots another train
approaching on the outer tracks  right on the heels of the
last one  he crouches to pull the catwomans limp frame out
of its path

but as he does so a horn blares  and a second train
comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite
direction  now hes got trains approaching on either side
and theres no place to go 

the catwoman is groggily getting to her feet  he lunges at
her  thrusts her backward toward an alcove in the outer
tunnel wall

int tunnel  on dick  that moment

the outer train is already speeding past obscuring batman and
the catwoman from view  the center train is bearing down
fast  a splitsecond before it arrives dicks hand snatches
the suitcase out of its path  and he tumbles to safety on
the innermost local track

he stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite
directions  he doesnt know if batman is alive or dead

int alcove  that moment

batman and catwoman are flattened in the tiny alcove 
theres not two inches of breathing space between them and the
passing train  shes come around now and shes flailing and
clawing at him trying to push him out

her hand closes around his utility belt  as they struggle
she hits the trigger of a small gas cylinder

its bruces hydraulic batwing device  the one that saved
him when he fell off the roof  but this time the results are
altogether different  he gasps in horror as the wings of his
cape stiffen and inflate  forcing him away from the wall of
the tunnel

his outer wing strikes the train  flapping wildly against
the passing cars  snagging finally on the ralling of the
rearmost car 

 and batman is suddenly ripped out of the alcove  dragged
off down the tracks by the passing train

int tunnel  innermost track  on dick

hes still there with the suitcase  waiting apprehensively
to see whats become of batman  finally the center train
passes 

 and he sees catwoman standing alone in the alcove 
smiling at him  advancing menacingly  dick turns to run

a gunshot rings out  and the last thing he sees as he slumps
to the tracks is a whiff of smoke pluming from the shaft of
the penguins umbrella

the penguins panting  soaked with sweat  the catwoman
snatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him  she
peers off into the tunnels after batman exhilarated

catwoman
god  did you see him isnt he hot

penguin
havent you got anything else to think
about
mopping sweat from his brow
im hot  that was exhausting

catwoman
no pain no gain   suck it up  were
not out of here yet

she sprints off down the tracks  squawking he waddles along
behind her as fast as his fat little legs will carry him

as they vanish into the darkness the camera tracks back 
past dick who lies unconscious on the tracks bleeding
heavily from his shoulder wound  deeper into the maze of
tunnels 

 arriving finally on the ragged black figure of batman as he
staggers forth from the shadows dazed and bloody  he scans
the tunnel finding no trace of his enemies  and then his
gaze falls on dick

he limps over and kneels at the boys side  cradling his
head protectively staring helplessly into the blackness all
around him

dissolve to

ext gotham city skyline  night

the stark outlines of the city bathed in moonlight  camera
zeroes in on the glowing ornamental dome of city hall

int city hall  that moment  night

a pentagonal balcony girds the interior of the dome  we tilt
down to ground level  where two aged security guards lie
sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor fatally shot

the penguin closes his gunumbrella and waddles across the
atrium of city hall past a statue of blind justice to a
point directly under the dome  there encased in a plexiglass
case is a scale model of gotham city  circa 1885 when city
hall was erected  he shouts up

penguin
lets do it

int city hall  balcony under dome  that moment

the catwoman frick and frack are already up on the balcony
lining its periphery are various display cases of historical
interest and positioned along the wall at each point of the
pentagon are five arched niches  each one containing a
bronze bust  the patriarchs of gothams five families

the catwoman and co go to work quickly  she removes the five
ravens from a gunny sack as frick and frack work their way
around the balcony yanking the busts from their recessed
bases  she follows along behind them replacing each bust
with a raven

when theyre done the penguin yells up

penguin
now  give each raven a quarterturn

his pals in the dome oblige  twisting each raven in its
recessed socket in quick succession

int city hall  atrium  on penguin

the moment of maximum tension  he stands there frothing at
the mouth with anticipation  seconds tick off and nothing
happens

catwoman
what happens now

penguin
i dont know  thats all

he looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him
from above  he really doesnt know whats supposed to happen
next  suspecting the worst he throws his umbrella to the
floor and begins stamping about in a rage sputtering
flapping his arms like wings

penguin cont
weve been tricked  its a hoax  its
a 

he shuts up suddenly at the sound of a loud chunk  somewhere
behind him ancient gears are beginning to grind  he spins
and stares at the scale model of gotham in its plexiglass
case

the city model is trembling slightly  as he watches the dome
of the miniature city hall  in the dead center of the model
city  pops off on a hinge  a metal strongbox rises into
view

int dome  on balcony  that moment

the catwoman frick and frack stare down at the little metal
box  the penguin is already clambering atop the plexiglass
case of the model smashing at it with his umbrella trying to
get at the box

frick
thats the treasure

catwoman
no  its a map

she affixes a rope to the balcony railing and climbs over

int city hall  atrium  on penguin

the plexiglass case finally shatters  and the penguin falls
through landing atop gotham city  he snatches at the
strongbox and gets to his feet bestriding the city like a
colossus  hes climbing down off the tabletop when the
catwoman on her rope touches down behind him

he hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off
the box  he opens it and stares greedily at the contents  a
map and a bunch of old crumbling photos  the catwoman creeps
over to his side

penguin
bruce wayne  so he doesnt know a thing
about the treasure eh
handing her the map
look at this  its right under wayne
manor  its been there all along

now the catwoman snatches at the photos  they show
progressively closer views of ancient gnarled stalactites 
an odd distinctive subterranean rock formation

penguin cont
looks like some kind of cave

fade through to

int wayne manor  guest bedroom  day

tight on the face of dick  he lies unconscious in a big soft
frilly bed a womans hand wipes his feverish brow with a damp
cloth he moans slightly

his eyes snap open suddenly  he sits bolt upright with a
yelp

vicki
no no  dont try to get up  youre
hurt

he pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway  his
shoulder is bandaged his arm in a sling  the pajamas hes
wearing are three sizes too large  he paces about staring at
his unfamiliar surroundings

vicki cont
its all right  youre safe  you can
stay here as long as you need to

dick
i dont belong here  you cant keep me
here

vaguely unnerved he goes to a window pulls back the shades
looks out at the grounds

vicki
its dick isnt it  or do you prefer
richard

he stares at her as if shes nuts  vicki opens a closet door
all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside  including
the redandgreen gymnasts suit with the r insigne on the
breast

vicki
r  for richard right  see all your
things are here
staring at the costume
what is it some kind of gymnasts outfit

dick
its none of your business  what is this
some kind of home

vicki
no not that kind  theres a swimming
pool  tennis court  you can have
anything you want

dick
tennis court   lady youre rich  how
the hell would you know what i want

vicki tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder  he bats it
away pushes her aside and turns toward the door in
agitation 

dick
im not staying  you cant make me 

 and sees bruce standing in the doorway looking at him

bruce
i can make you

dick freezes  as if bruces mere presence has mesmerized
him  the hint of a smile plays across his face ohhhhh  im
in batmans house

bruce cont
come on  wanna go at it
no response
look kid  like it or not youre my
guest  and long as youre here you might
as well enjoy it

alfred appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a
bedside table  dick edges toward it and sits down  he waits
for alfred to leave and then tucks in hungrily  eyeing bruce
all the while

bruce cont
will you two be okay in here

vicki nods yes  bruce backs out of the room

int wayne manor  outside guest room  day

bruce pulls the door shut  alfred follows him down the hall

alfred

life

bruce

stuff to worry about

alfred
the child is hurt sir  at the very least
we should attempt to locate his parents

bruce
he hasnt got any parents

alfred

bruce turns and fixes alfred with a steely gaze

bruce
i know

the phone rings as bruce starts down the long stairway
alfred picks up a hallway extension  he covers the
mouthpiece

alfred
sir  its miss kyle

bruce rushes back upstairs to take the call

int penguins lair  that moment  day

arctic birds chirping all around in the penguinpool room  a
snow owl struts across the penguins desk as selina makes a
phone call  with the penguin frick and frack hovering over
her

selina
well  tall dark and handsome  are we
still on for tonight

int wayne manor  on bruce

he covers the receiver and stares intensely at alfred  on his
look we

dissolve to

int wayne manor  front parlor  night

christmas carols playing  vickis got dick helping her trim
the tree

int bruces bedroom  night

bruce is getting dressed for his date with selina

alfred
is this necessary sir  after allit is
christmas eve

bruce reaches for his utility belt  he empties the contents
of one packet onto a dresser a dozen tiny red glassine
capsules  he scoops up a handful of the capsules and deposits
them in his jacket pocket

bruce

cat

alfred
i dont like to see you going out on a
dateunprotected sir

bruce

turning to go
its the only way alfred  ive got to
take her out tonight

int entry hall  five minutes later dicks pov

dick watches from the front parlor as vicki meets bruce at the
bottom of the stairs  the two of them exchange a few brief
words he embraces her strokes her hair gently  then glumly
sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door

vicki reenters the parlor trying to force an expression of
cheer as dick turns discreetly away  this is one weird
household hes landed in

int selinas loft  night

soft music plays in the background as selina preens in front
of a vanity doing her eye makeup taking great pleasure in
her own reflection  shes looking especially sultry tonight
in a glittering lowcut gown  she lowers one shoulder strap
and strikes a pose in the mirror better  she runs a hand
through her hair tousling it for that recentlyravished look

the doorbell rings and by the time selina crosses over to
answer it shes lowered the other strap as well  which
means she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand
bruce finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in  she pulls
up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly

selina
youre early  im afraid im not quite
dressed

bruce enters and takes a long look around  its a big open
loft only partly finished filled with egyptian artifacts
the walls feature modern paintings with cat motifs  the
finished section is dominated by a huge bed on a raised
platform  three or four cats are walking around on it
yowling at bruce  selina chuckles as he scopes it all out

selina cont
if youre looking for my bondage gear
its at the cleaners

bruce
christmas eve  no tree

selina
no presents  ive been a bad girl this
year

bruce takes a seat on the sofa while selina goes to a nearby
wet bar

bruce
im surprised you kept this date  i
thought you wouldve lost interest by now

selina
what makes you say that

bruce
youve got what you want dont you

selina
i do now
smiling
weve had this date for a long long time

with that she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in
to kiss him  a long slow wet kiss  but bruce seems
strangely unresponsive  she breaks free and gives him a funny
look

bruce
how much is it going to cost me

selina
what

bruce
to get the ravens back

he watches her closely for a reaction  selinas shocked but
she conceals it well  chuckling in apparent confusion

selina
youre the oddest man ive ever met
moving in on him
lets talk later bruce  ive got kind of
a short fuse

bruce tenses slightly as she kisses him again  leaving a
crimson lipstick smear on his cheek  she works her way
downward kissing him around his neck and throat

his hand reaches into his jacket pocket  he withdraws a tiny
glassine capsule  but before he can use it 

he jerks back suddenly  pushes her away  his free hand goes
to his neck where a thin trickle of blood is oozing from
between two bright red lipstick lips  shes bitten him

now she shushes him  reaches over to the tiny wound and
massages it gently with one hand

selina
did i hurt you  just relax  youll
start to enjoy it

bruce pulls away again  his eyes are strangely glazed  he
tries to speak but his tongue feels thick and swollen

selina cont
bruce you look faint  it must be the
cats

bruce stands suddenly  its as if hes mired in a slomo
nightmare  his legs give way beneath him and he topples to
the floor inert  his fingers go slack and the capsule rolls
out he tries to reach into his pocket but his arm wont seem
to work

selinas cat hecate strolls across his prostrate form 
purring and stretching

bruces pov

a wormseye view  selina looms over him with a predatory
smile on her face shifting in and out of focus

bruce
what di what did you d

she runs a finger across her lips and holds it up  bright
red

selina
i guess ivegotten under your skin

back to scene  on bruce

his hand goes to the bite on his neck  and he realizes
selinas lipstick is spiked with a fastacting paralytic drug
he writhes helplessly on the carpet his whole body gradually
going slack

the penguin frick and frack stroll through the doorway and
stand over him  all laughing

dissolve to

ext wayne manor  night

a county sheriffs car cruises past the manor right on
schedule

int wayne manor  parlor  night

alfred on the telephone checking in with the county sheriffs
boys

alfred
everythings fine thank you  well talk
in an hour

behind him vicki is waiting up for bruce  shes curled up on
the sofa reading a book throwing the occasional anxious
glance at a big grandfather clock  which strikes eleven
oclock

int wayne manor  guest bedroom  night

dick opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall  hes got
all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed he opens a
window and throws the bundle outside

theres a nice strong tree branch some ten or twelve feet from
the window  just close enough that he should be able to make
it  he climbs up onto the windowsill crouches and springs

int car  outside  that moment  night

a car full of trouble selina wearing a fur coat over her
catwoman garb at the wheel the penguin riding shotgun and
frick in the back seat  next to bruce whos semiconscious
and stone limp  the car idles outside the wroughtiron gates
of wayne manor

penguin
try his mag card

frick digs in bruces pockets and finds a bunch of red
capsules

frick
look at this  hes a pillhead

now frick finds a magstriped card and inserts it into an
electronic device at the edge of the drive  the gates
magically part  theres a large van just behind the car 
driven by frack and carrying two random goons  both vehicles
pull in before the gates slide shut

int wayne manor  a moment later

vicki hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen
announcing what should be bruces arrival  she heaves a huge
sigh of relief  then rushes to the door and flings it open

she sees bruce standing there and her face lights up

vicki
ohh  am i glad to 

to her horror bruce topples forward  and lands on the
floor flat as a board  vicki shrieks as the penguin enters
throwing his arms wide

penguin
merrrry christmas

ext wayne manor  that moment  night

dick has shimmied down to a lower branch  he lets go and
drops to the snow wincing his shoulder wound is bleeding
again  as he grabs his bundle he hears raucous laughter
coming from around the house

he races over to peer around the corner  he sees the two cars
out front  he sees the last of the goon squad barging in
through the front door

his face full of confusion and conflict he moves to a window
in the entry hall he sees bruce on the floor  and vicki
surrounded by guntoting intruders  one of them grabs her and
twists her arm behind her back

int wayne manor  entry  that moment

vicki shrieking and struggling as she stares down at bruce

vicki
what did you do to him

selina gives her a catty little smile

selina
firsttime jitters i guess  everything
was going great and thenhe just went
limp as a noodle

int wayne manor  on stairway

drawn by the commotion alfred rushes down the stairs to the
entry hall pulling a robe around him  he freezes in his
tracks when he sees frick dragging vicki into the front
parlor holding a gun to her head

penguin
youd be the butler  why dont you come
on down and attend to your guests

alfred hesitates until the penguin pulls a gun on him  he
marches down the stairs slowly pausing by bruces prostrate
form

alfred
mr wayne  is he  

penguin
you know how it is  some guys just cant
hold their egg nog

int front parlor  a moment later

the penguin marches alfred in where the rest of the gangs
already assembled  frick throws vicki down roughly on a sofa
just next to the christmas tree while the goons drag bruce
inside

penguin
i should explain the occasion of our
visit  theres a treasure underneath this
house  and i dont plan to leave until
you tell me how to find it  now whos

vicki
i dont know what youre talking about

penguin

the penguin gestures  frick holds the gun to her head

vicki cont

penguin
turning to alfred
then maybe youd like to tell me

alfred
youre no more than a common thief

penguin

very uncommon thief
beat

frick cocks the gun  vicki stares aghast at alfred who scans
the room weighing his options  trembling he shuts his
eyes 

alfred
idontknow

penguin
then go ahead mr frickdecorate the
tree

fricks finger tightens on the trigger  vicki winces  alfred
starts to blurt something out  but a splitsecond before he
can speak 

selina
wait
crossing over to vicki
we dont know how to get down there yet
we may need her when bruce wakes up

the penguin sighs and waves frick off  alfred and vicki heave
simultaneous sighs of relief  he throws her a shamefaced look
 but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement you made
the right play

selina cont
besides  i want this one for myself  so
prettyim going to give her a brand new
face for christmas

the penguin throws a look at bruce whos still out cold on
the floor  he turns to frick and frack

penguin
why dont you two tie up our host

alfred sits beside vicki while selina wanders off to tour the
premises  frick and frack meanwhile drag bruce into a back
parlor which opens off the room theyre in

int back parlor  that moment

they dump bruce face down on a sofa  then rip the telephone
cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands
and feet

int front parlor  on mr boniface

still holding his gun on vicki and alfred he wanders about
the room admiring the various furnishings and expensive
objects

penguin
its all so plush and tasteful isnt it
just the sort of setting in which ive
always imagined myself

alfred on the sofa cant resist letting out a snort of
disgust

penguin cont
i see  you think im vulgar  you think
imnouveau

alfred
i think youre a dirty little man with
a 

the penguin silences him by sweeping one arm across a
tabletop sending a bunch of priceless china figurines
crashing to the floor  he points to alfred as frick and frack
reappear

penguin
see boys thats old money talking
after a while they actually start to
believe theyve earned all this
smirking
i dont mind  someday ill be old money
too  when the statute of limitations
runs out

selina os
hey   guess what i just found

face full of anticipation he turns  just in time to see
selina returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of

selina cont
christmas cookies

the penguin is crestfallen but that doesnt stop him from
cramming a handful of cookies down his gullet  selina
graciously serves vicki and alfred who munch away with
limited enthusiasm

penguin
lets spread out and see what we can find
to frick and frack
you two  keep an eye on our friends
here  give me a yell the minute wayne
comes to

frick and frack post themselves at the doors to the front
parlor as selina the penguin and the goons fan out through
the house  camera tracks with them as they move past bruce 

 and in a quick closeup we see his eyes open  his hands
struggling against his bonds

series of shots

quick glimpses of the intruders enacting their depredations as
they search for the entrance to the cave  selina and the
penguin are flinging open doors moving clocks looking for
secret panels as they go they systematically tear the house
apart  smashing bruces possessions ripping paintings out
of frames etc

meanwhile the two goons are outside prowling around the
grounds looking for an exterior entrance  and back in the
parlor frick and frack are keeping their guns trained on
alfred and vicki

int wayne manor  corridor off kitchen  night

camera tracks down a long empty hallway  arriving at a
locked door with curtainedoff glass panels  suddenly an
elbow smashes through the glass  a hand reaches inside and
fumbles for the lock 

int front parlor  that moment

frick and frack start at the sound of a security alarm blaring
from the kitchen  vicki looks at alfred

frick
better check it out

frick stays behind as frack rushes out into the entryway and
down a long hall to the kitchen  he tosses a glance back at
vicki and alfred then steps out into the entryway himself

frick cont
what is it  whats going on

vicki and alfred look into the back parlor  dick grayson has
sneaked in behind the sofa  and hes busy sawing away at
bruces bonds with a letter opener  both of them stiffen
simultaneously  if frick steps back inside hell have a
clear view of dick and bruce

int kitchen  that moment

frack has opened a panel on the kitchen wall revealing the
security system from which the alarm emanates  a red light is
blinking indicating dicks breakin  frack throws switches
frantically trying to kill the sound  finally he succeeds 
and shouts

frack
some kind of security system 

int back parlor  that moment

dicks gotten bruce free  but bruce still under the effects
of the drug isnt much use  he tries to get off the sofa and
crumples in a heap

dick
can you move man

bruce
library  got to get me to the library 

dick slings an arm around bruce and drags him to a door
opening onto the hallway  theyre just about to step outside
when frack comes marching back on his way from the kitchen

int front parlor  on vicki and alfred

 faces wracked with utter desperate tension as they watch
the situation develop

int entry hall  that moment

frick and frack conferring ignoring vicki and alfred for the
moment  by now the penguin is waddling in from a hallway

penguin
what is that ungodly racket

frack
a security alarm  it went off in the
kitchen

penguin
my god  is someone in here

he struts over to huddle with his cronies  bruce and dick are
still poised in the doorway  it looks bad

int front parlor  that moment

alfred looks at bruce and dick  then at frick and frack
bickering with the penguin in the entryway  he pats vickis
knee  gestures for her to keep her seat 

 and lunges at frick making a play for his gun  a moment
of confusion ensues  giving dick and bruce just enough time
to dart out into the hallway duck around a corner and
vanish 

 but alfred is a frail old gent and he cant keep it up for
long a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor
frick instinctively pulls the trigger and shoots him at point
blank range

vicki rushes into the hallway  screaming crying

int library  that moment

the rooms a mess books all over the floor  the groggy bruce
props himself up against his desk  he manages to pull the
bottom drawer open  gropes frantically for the secret
switch  hes crying

bruce
alfred

dick
ill go back

bruce
i cantget down therewithout you

dick turns  to his amazement the sectional bookcase is
swinging open  revealing the secret passage to the batcave

int entry hallfront parlor  that moment

we will all be pleased to know that alfred has only suffered a
superficial wound to the arm  vicki is on her knees beside
him the penguin is watching them with utter contempt

penguin
what an extraordinarily stupid thing to
do

vicki
shut up  help me with him

the penguin rolls his eyes and orders frick and frack to give
vicki a hand without him  they carry him into the parlor lay
him out on the sofa  vicki reaches into her purse for a
handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the penguin pulls
frack aside

penguin
you and i had better check the ground
floor and see whats going on  mr frick
 do you think youll be able to manage
this pair

frick
yes sir

penguin
oh good  that does relieve my mind 

he turns glances into the back parlor and sees a pile of cut
cords on the love seat  the blood drains out of his face

penguin cont
wheres wayne

int batcave  that moment

dick has just entered another world  and hes looking around
him in pure unalloyed amazement  bruce is fumbling with a
packet on a spare utility belt he shakes out a fistful of
pills and swallows them dry

then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping
switches  they blink on one by one dick moves up behind
bruce and looks on dazzled

insert  monitor

the screen shows the penguin in a sun room shouting to his
two armed goons through a pair of french doors

penguin
check the grounds  the shape hes in he
cant have gotten far

back to scene  on bruce

he turns to his main control panel reaches for a switch and
waits

ext wayne manor  that moment  night

the two goons outside with guns and flashlights roaming
cautiously around the grounds  they turn suddenly 

 as corrugatedsteel security panels slam into place over
every groundfloor door and window in wayne manor

int sun room  that moment

the penguin sees the same thing happening only from inside
he listens helplessly as his goons pound on the steel panels
from outside  its just occurred to him that hes trapped in
here

int batcave  a moment later

dick is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of wayne
manor  bruce shouts up to him from the control console down
below

bruce
 as soon as he gets to the east wing
wait for my signal  you know what to do

dick nods yes and bolts off

int front parlor  a moment later

vicki and alfred are still sitting at gunpoint  with the
commotion going on all around them frick is getting itchy
fingered

suddenly the stereo begins blaring at top volwne  santa
bring my baby back to me  frick turns and stares at it in
confusion  goes over to fiddle with the controls 

 and suddenly bruces voice is coming through the
loudspeakers

bruce os filter
vicki  run  now

shes off the sofa like a shot diving for the entry hall
frick turns and takes aim 

 but before he can squeeze the trigger dicks come out of
nowhere to highkick him in the face  the shot goes wild and
the two of them tumble into the christmas tree knocking it
over

int entry hall  that moment

vicki hits the floor of the entry hall  huge oaken sliding
doors are already slamming shut behind her  the same thing is
happening all down the hall  the east wing of the house is
sealing itself off

int front parlor  that moment

dick cartwheels across the carpet  catching frick high on
the chest and ramming him backward into the hearth  before
frick can regain his balance dicks beaned him across the
back of the skull with a fireplace poker

he bends and picks up fricks gun  which he tosses to
alfred whos been watching all this with some fascination
from the sofa

dick
here  you might need it

alfred
thank you master dick  andbravo

int kitchen  that moment

vicki has made it to the wall phone  she cant seem to get a
dial tone 

voice from behind
do you really think were that stupid

vicki turns and realizes to her horror that the voice is
selinas

selina cont
i tawt i taw a puddy tat

with that she raises a hand  and her claws pop out  vicki
turns grabs a carving knife from a wooden block  but before
she can do anything with it a whip cracks and wraps around
her wrist jerking the knife loose  selina tugs on the other
end reeling her closer

selina
you know ive got a great recipe for
sliced bitch 

vicki lunges forward suddenly causing the whip to slacken and
throwing selina offbalance into the center island  while
theyre tangled up vicki grabs a meat cleaver and tries to
bring it down on selina but selina rolls effortlessly out of
the way and returns the favor swiping at vicki with her
claws  vicki brings a calphalon skillet up just in time to
block the blow clang

vicki sweeps her arm across the countertop showering selina
with knives and appliances  it buys her enough time to make
for the door  but selina comes flying after her  another
downswipe with the claws  but vicki shoves a butchers block
into selinas path and her talons wedge a halfinch deep in
the wood

vicki rushes out while shes trying to pry herself loose

int dining hall  a moment later

selina enters but finds no trace of vicki

selina
i love a good oldfashioned catfight 
but this is pissing me off

vicki charges out from behind a sideboard pushing a wheeled
cocktail cart before her  it slams fullforce into selina
who lands on her back on the great long dining table  vicki
is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up

int entry hall  stairway  a moment later

vicki races up the stairs  she has a good lead but selina
makes up the difference in a hurry  she takes the stairway in
three giant bounds  reaches the landing just as vicki ducks
down the hall and into a bedroom slamming the door behind her
and locking it

selina
here kitty kitty kittyhere kitty
kitty

she kicks the door open

int bedroom  that moment

selina enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door
behind her  vicki has opened a pair of french doors leading
to a balcony but its too long a drop  she stands there
paralyzed as selina advances

selina
so this is where you earn your keep

she grabs vicki  holds her out at arms length and shoves
her roughly back onto the bed  vicki flails wildly as selina
kneels atop her

selinas claws shred vickis blouse revealing a frilly
section of bra 

selina
mmm  fredericks of gotham

she plants a talon against vickis sternum and rakes it
downward drawing a red stripe on the exposed flesh of vickis
belly  now vicki just loses it  she begins to shriek
uncontrollably

selina
not so loud honey  the neighborsll get
the wrong idea
laughing
santas coming  time for all good girls
to go to sleep

she raises her clawhand and prepares to slash down at vickis
neck  but an instant before she can strike  vicki goes
wideeyed and shuts up  a black shadow falls across the
moonlit bed  selina tenses 

 as a blackgloved hand grabs a fistful of her hair 

batman
miss me angel

he yanks her bodily off the bed  before she knows whats
happening he delivers a powerhouse uppercut  she flies into
the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges

int hallwaystaircase  a moment later

batman steps out after selina whos only now picking herself
up

selina
okay  lets do it huh  you and me
all the way this time

she hisses and jumps him  they grapple  a quick flurry of
fists  and he knocks her assoverteakettle down the long
stairway

she gets to her feet limping and darts around a corner
batman marches implacably down the stairs taking his time

int hallway  a moment later

vicki rushes out of the bedroom  she looks down the hall and
sees frack flying out of the guest room upside down 
slamming into the wall opposite  he slumps to the carpet out
cold

a moment later dick strolls out  vicki rushes to his side 

vicki
come on  well be safe in the cave

int downstairs hallwayarmory  a moment later

batman pauses outside the door to the armory which is
slightly ajar  he pushes it in cautiously

and a halberd smashes through the wood frame  slicing
down mere inches from his face  its the penguin wielding the
ax he backs off in seeming terror as batman advances on him
but then 

 selina springs down from a perch above the doors  landing
on his back  and the two of them are going at it again
its a room full of exotic weaponry and most of it gets a
good workout in the next thirty seconds

batman dodges a lance  which embeds itself into the wall
behind him quivering  and swings a mace squarely into
selinas ribs  its a crippling blow she flies backward
knocking over a suit of exotic armor  which topples
knocking over another  and another 

 until the various suits of armor have all fallen over
dominostyle  the last of them landing squarely atop the
cowering penguin

selina is badly hurt now  she makes it out of a rear door to
the armory  batman pauses to check on the penguin  he seems
to be out for the count  and sets off in pursuit of selina

several moments pass before the groaning penguin comes around
enough to dig himself out

int hallway  a moment later

as the penguin stumbles around a corner he peers into the
library  vicki is crouched by bruces desk reaching into a
bottom drawer  a hidden panel in the bookcase pops open

int library  that moment

as she helps alfred into the secret passageway vicki turns to
dick

vicki
come on  come with us

dick
no  i can still help

int hallway  a moment later

the penguin flattens against the wall as dick sprints out of
the library and heads off in the opposite direction  theres
a flabbergasted look on his face  he recognizes this kid

wipe to

int batcave  a minute later

at the monitor bank watching batmans pursuit of selina are
vicki and alfred  they pivot suddenly at the sound of a
voice

penguin
such primitive entertainment

hes holding a gun on the two of them  he stares about
delightedly taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave
his eyes light up at the sight of the batmobile parked on its
little plateau

penguin cont
so bruce equals batman  it seems ive
discovered two treasures
an evil smile
dont move  id be only too happy to
shoot you both

he pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave
he spots the distinctive rock formation in an upper vault of
the cavern  its a couple of plateaus over a long narrow
catwalk runs past it some ten or twelve feet below

penguin
the gotham city treasury  its about to
be stolen twice

alfred
dont be absurd youll never be able to
get it out of here

penguin
oh ill manage somehow  you two are my
guarantee of that
nudging vicki with the gun
lets have a look shall we  you go
first

he shoves her  she starts across the catwalk his gun at her
head

int upstairs hallway  that moment

selinas made it back upstairs but shes moving at quarter
speed favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes
down the hallway  shes just passed the balcony overlooking
the entry hall when batman appears dead ahead in her path

hes ready to rumble  but instead of responding she packs
it in  she stops slumps against a wall and begins to laugh

selina
it couldve been so nice  you and me 
if only you werent so screwed up

batman
its over  i dont want to hurt you any
more

selina
tell me something  one thing  if you
dont enjoy all thiswhy do you do it

he just looks at her  he doesnt have an especially good
answer  she sighs

selina cont
ill never understand men

she spins suddenly delivering a highkick to batmans throat
as he reels backward into a wall she leaps up onto the
narrow bannister railing some thirty feet above the entry hall
floor and goes into a crouch  preparing to spring at the
enormous crystal chandelier mounted to the ceiling 

 but just as she launches off batman rolls  and brings up
a gun from his belt  he fires a razorsharp disk which sails
past her head cleanly slicing through the chain which
suspends the chandelier

the chandelier falls just as catwoman catches hold of it 
and she finds herself plummeting to the floor of the entry
hall  on impact the chandelier explodes into a thousand
fragments the catwoman lands hard on her back and lies
sprawled in the midst of the wreckage unmoving

batman advances slowly down the stairs  her arms and legs jut
out at unnatural angles she lets out an eerie whimpering
yowl of pain  a cri du chat  he stands over her she glares
up at him

batman
nine lives

catwoman
i cant move  i cant move

her face is cut and bleeding  she tries to lift an arm and
cant quite manage it  he crouches down beside her still
cautious

catwoman cont
dont look at me
pleading
do me babydo me nowthats what i
want  please

batman looks up  dick is standing on the balcony overlooking
them highly curious as to what hell do

batman
no

batman slowly rises to his feet  she lets out another
gruesome whine

catwoman
come on  dont stop now  finish me off
almost weeping with pain
son of a bitch  youre all alike

her steel claws snick into place  with an agonizing effort
she lifts her forearm  bends her wrist  shes trying to
slit her own throat

he reaches for his belt extracts a glassine capsule and
breaks it open with his thumb  he drops it amid the shattered
glass around her face  a tiny cloud of green gas plumes out
and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into
unconsciousness

batman stands over her for a minute as dick marches down to
join him

dick
you shouldve done it man  you shouldve
killed her

batman gives him a long hard look  but says nothing

batman
theres a radio in the cave  well send
for help

int batcave  a moment later

the penguin and vicki are on a catwalk just below the rock
formation  a stone outcropping extends toward the catwalk
and he forces her to jump for it  now he has to follow the
prospect makes him nervous but its a short hop and he
clears it okay  finding his footing on the rocky slope

theyre cautiously making their way up toward the rock
formation when batman appears suddenly at the far end of the
catwalk  sizes up the situation and freezes in his tracks

penguin
ah the illustrious mr wayne  look at
you now  whatever would your friends say
smiling
youve been an exceptionally congenial
host  but i must ask you to back off

the penguin grabs hold of vicki and holds her close as they
climb the last few feet toward the grotto  batman swings his
cape around concealing his hands from view  he takes a
cautious step backward

closeup  batmans hand

his free hand closes around a batarang  flicks it open

angle on rocks  penguin and vicki

theyve pulled almost even with the rock formation  a large
dank grotto is visible through a small gap in the rocks

penguin
no sudden moves  its a long way down

gun at her head he peers into the grotto

his pov  inside the grotto

a vast fortune in gold and silver bullion undisturbed in all
these years  glinting in the darkness  hanging upsidedown
above it like silent guardians are bats  dozens of them 
their tiny wet red eyes glimmering at the penguin

he dislodges a rock  it tumbles into the grotto

and a startled bat comes screeching out of the gap in the
rocks  flying directly at his face

angle on rocks  penguin and vicki

he backs away in horror as the bat streaks past him  he fires
his gun wildly  the sound of it rouses more bats and they
come flying out of the hole  a vast chittering swarm
vicki shrieks the penguin stumbles  and the two of them
fall back onto the rocks hanging on for dear life

batman
vicki

an instant later batman lets fly with the batarang  clean
hit the penguin staggers back and his gun skitters down
across the rocks

with bats screaming all around her vicki takes a deep breath
and vaults toward the catwalk  shes a foot short she grabs
hold of the railing and hangs there over the abyss trying to
pull herself up  batman races toward her 

 but the penguin clambering down across the rocky
outcropping has managed to grab hold of his gun  the bats
have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the
cavern and hes able to draw a clean bead on batman

thunderous echoes reverberate through the cave as the first
shot strikes batman and knocks him backward  as the second
spins him around  as the third sends him toppling over the
railing

vicki screams  batman manages to grab the rail with one hand
now two of them are hanging from the catwalk  sitting ducks
 and the penguin is determined to empty the clip

the echoes are cacophanous  ancient stalactites drop from the
vaulted roof of the cavern plummeting downward like deadly
projectiles shattering agaist the cave floor  and then 

batman pulls a tiny device from his utility belt and flings
it  it lands in the rocks at the penguins feet  he stares
down at it and two beats later 

 it begins to emit an eerie electronic whine  within
moments every bat in the cave is in a frenzy  homing in on
the signal  the penguin looks up sees them coming  a choked
wail emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands
there paralyzed

hes just been beaten at his own game  he lets out a last
awful howl as hundreds of bats engulf him 

 and he plunges down into the pit  his hideous scream
dwindling to a faint echo then vanishing altogether

batman manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk  he rushes
over to vicki pulls her up drapes his cape around her
protectively  gradually as the bats recede to their distant
perches he stands and helps vicki to her feet  they embrace
on the edge of the abyss

on the far plateau dick has hooked up with alfred  the
butler is slumped against a lab table weary and exhausted
clutching his wounded arm  dick slings an arm around him and
helps him to the stairway

cut to

ext wayne manor  night

squad cars everywhere  frick and frack emerge in handcuffs
flanked by cops  paramedics carry the stillunconscious
selina past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an
ambulance

int wayne manor  entry hall  night

the place is an utter mess  amid the carnage we find bruce
conferring with commissioner gordon and lt bullock  in bg
a police doctor is dressing alfreds gunshot wound

gordon
and then batman showed up

bruce
he saved all our lives jim  i cant say
for sure but id bet shes the one behind
the murders

gordon
god  i pray youre right
beat
one thing before we go bruce  whos the
kid

bruce looks into the front parlor where vicki and dick are
righting the fallen christmas tree

bruce
oh thats vickis little cousin  hes in
town for the holidays

gordon
well he picked a hell of a time to visit
turning to go
merry christmas bruce  good luck
cleaning this place up

gordon and bullock file out followed by the police doctor
bruce smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front
parlor

int front parlor  night

alfred loads silent night on the cd  vicki ambles up to
bruce

vicki
what are you going to do with all that
gold

bruce
i dunno  might be a good start on a place
to live  for some people who dont have
one

she hugs him  dick plugs in the christmastree lights they
blink to life just as the grandfather clock strikes twelve

vicki
its christmas

bruce
yeah  maybe you should  open your
present

she runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly

vicki
oh bruce presents doesnt matter  none
of it matters  were all safe  were
together

bruce
you might as well

he digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny gift
box which he hands to vicki  she unwraps it opens it slowly
 and sees a diamond ring inside

she gazes up at him speechless  he gazes back

camera pulls up and away until we can see the whole of the
devastated room and all the people in it  vicki falling
into bruces arms dick off to one side watching them
alfred tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace
and on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit we

fade out



the end
