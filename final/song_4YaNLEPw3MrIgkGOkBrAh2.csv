long hair across the room baby she got that glow
i know you see me over here so dance on me real slow
weve been goin for about two hours
and i dont even know your name
so baby please reveal reveal

chorus
your friends are calling you baby stay with me instead
i know youre sayin that youre tired
theres a little dance in ya left
even if i go ill still think of you in my bed
of the good time good time good time we had 

instrumental

the scent of your perfume has got me lost in a haze
and oh this moment depends on the records that the dj plays
baby move a lil bit closer cause i wanna feel you babe
i wanna feel you babe 

your friends are calling you baby stay with me instead
i know youre sayin that youre tired
theres a little dance in ya left
even if i go ill still think of you in my bed
of the good time good time good time we hadsee odesza liveget tickets as low as 60you might also like2embed"
