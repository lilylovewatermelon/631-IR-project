everything that keeps me together is falling apart
i got this thing that i consider my only art
of fucking people over

verse 2
my boss just quit the job
says hes going out to find blind spots
and hell do it

verse 3
the third planet is sure that theyre being watched
by an eye in the sky that cant be stopped
when you get to the promised land
youre gonna shake the eyes hand

chorus
your heart felt good
it was drippin pitch and made of wood
and your hands and knees
felt cold and wet on the grass beneath
well outside naked shivering looking blue
from the cold sunlight thats reflecting off the moon
and baby cum angels fly around you
reminding you we used to be three and not just two
and thats how the world began
and thats how the world will end

well a third had just been made
and we were swimming in the water
didnt know then was it a son was it a daughter
and it occurred to me that the animals are swimming
around in the water in the oceans in our bodies
and another had been found another ocean on the planet
given that our blood is just like the atlantic and how

well the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
if you go straight long enough youll end up where you were
and the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
if you go straight long enough youll end up where you were
the universe is shaped exactly like the earth

chorus
your heart felt good

well outside naked shivering looking blue
from the cold sunlight thats reflecting off the moon
and baby cum angels fly around you
reminding you we used to be three and not just two
and thats how the world began
and thats how the world will end

well a third had just been made
