are we all we are
are we all we are

verse 1
cut to now holy wow
when did everything become such a hell of a mess
maybe now maybe now
can somebody come and take this off my chest
i know you think its not your problem
i know you think that god will solve them
but if your shit is not together itll never be you and me
plant the seed open up and let it be

chorus
we are the people that youll never get the best of
not forget the rest of rest of ohoh
weve had our fill weve had enough weve had it up to here
are we all we are are we all we are
we are the people that youll never get the best of
not forget the rest of rest of ohoh
just sing it loud until the kids will sing it right back
are we all we are are we all we are ohoh
are we all we are are we all we are

verse 2
seven seconds seven seconds
that is all the time you got to make your point
my attention my attentions like an infant tryna crawl around this joint
i know were better than the masses
but were all following our asses
and if our shit is not together itll never be you and me
plant the seed open and let it be

bridge
four thats how many years it took me to get through the lesson
that i had to do it all on my own
three thats how many hail marys they would pray for me
thinking i was gonna end up all alone
two for second chances that youve given me
can it be lucky me lucky me now lets go
one its what we are its what we are
are we all we are are we all we are

chorus
