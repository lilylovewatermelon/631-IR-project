verse 1 erreon lee

i done been there done that leave the city then run back
slept there where them slums at i slept there where them guns at
they napped on me overslept nigga i’m the one they don’t know it yet
i gave my city that facelift brought difference to em but they didn’t notice that

when my niggas had beef who they go and get me nigga e lee nigga
plenty fish in that water but i’m a shark out in that sea nigga
real niggas they fuck with me real bitches put trust in me
tried to leave that fast life it’s like damn man see that rush in me

wanna make my momma proud but im sorry momma that thug in me
man i be feelin like fuck the world when that blue dream and that mud in me
the family nigga all day till the death of me i scream that
right in texas down in florida nigga that’s where my team at

the baddest chicks slim short or tall excuse my french i done fucked em all
got a real bitch but she down with me started from the bottom on the ground with me
i seen shit they can’t fathom these snake niggas aint gettin shit passed em
he learned not to let shit gas em the people’s choice just ask em

verse 2 erreon lee

boy i turn up when them lights on like lebron james when them nikes on
like mayweather when that bell ding i snap off when that mic on
i took flight that flight gone something that you cant put a price on
bitches can’t even get a smile from me all they getting is this python

these beats im nice on i done killed plenty automatic i’m semi
gotta keep it with me for the niggas out to get me
i be sippin on the henny while my bitches on the remy
playin with the bands but i started with the pennies
walk inside the club i got a lot of niggas with me
bottle after bottle nigga probably bout 50
niggas probably hate but they probably still feel me

hate it or not this the real me came from my pops he a real g
will i eva see the top nigga we’ll see i take that back i will be
sitting on the thrown with a steel key the game on lock nigga real d
one thing about me i will eat and that’s as long as i still breathe
still sipping that ole e boy i’m really outchea no sleep
we both rap but we don’t rap alike we are not the same we don’t act alike
my niggas in the pen this song is for em i’m outside of the gate putting on for em
i’m the underdog so they going for em if they don’t know em yet they gon know em

chorus ashley falgout

they don’t really know they don’t really know what it takes to win

they don’t really know they don’t really know what it takes to win
they don’t really know they don’t really know what it takes to win
they don’t knowembed"
