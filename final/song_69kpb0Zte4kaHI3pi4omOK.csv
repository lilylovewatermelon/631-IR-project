i dont need this conversation
cause i dont need to see you cry
you need one more confirmation
like i need one more reason why

verse 2
i know this might not be the answer
oh that you came here to get
we both know that girl is something
that im still not over yet

chorus
i cant go on using you
girl it feels like im losing you
a love like yours is hard to find
but you caught me at a bad time

verse 3
i knew that youd be waiting
the night i made that desperate call
you werent everything i needed
just the softest place to fall

chorus
i cant go on using you
girl it feels like im losing you
a love like yours is hard to find
but you caught me at a bad time
