met a man sailor man
with an island tan down in mexico
sittin there fish are everywhere
biggest one this year couldnt let em go
i said hey man whats your secret
he said ill tell you if youll say youll keep it
you can throw out a line but you cant make em bite
you can drop a lime in your corona light

chorus
but you cant drink all day
if you dont start in the mornin
get to sipping on the dock of the bay
just watching that tide roll in yeah
well lifes sweeter than a margarita
so you better get to pourin
cause you cant drink all day
if you dont start in the mornin
oh start in the mornin

verse 2
yeah you can build you a big ol castle in the sand
do a back flip off a catamaran
you can bust your ass for a couple hundred grand
but that aint gonna make you rich
you can get you a hammock you can swing on
between two palm trees
se√±orita you can lean ons all you need
