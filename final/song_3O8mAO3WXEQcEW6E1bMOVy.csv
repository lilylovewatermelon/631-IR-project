has it been ten years since we said i do
ive always heard marriage made one seem like two
but youre looking better than you did back then
you still make this old heart give in

chorus
and if i had it to do all over
id do it all over again
if tomorrow i found one more chance to begin
id love you all over again

verse 2
the preacher man said til death do us part
that seemed like forever to a young mans heart
now the days seem much shorter the longer we love
and the memories just keep adding up

chorus
and if i had it to do all over
id do it all over again
if tomorrow i found one more chance to begin
id love you all over again

outro
if tomorrow i found one more chance to begin
id love you all over againsee alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also like1embed"
