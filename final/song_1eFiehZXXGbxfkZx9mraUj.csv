honey suckle in the air breeze blowing through your hair
hundred stars hanging high under your still tide
up in every move you make baby im your dj
youre my favorite song wont you let me sing along

chorus
sittin right here out here in the middle of nowhere
i swear ive never seen ever seen nothing like you anywhere
i got the key turned back windows down
im turning it up and youre spinnin around
takin a sip swingin your hips
girl youre looking so fine with your beer in the headlights

verse 2
heart beating like a drum call me the lucky one
shining these hibeams on you baby
boots stiring up the dirt cottonfield concert
you got the beautiful i got the cooler full

chorus
sittin right here out here in the middle of nowhere
i swear ive never seen ever seen nothing like you anywhere
i got the key turned back windows down
im turning it up and youre spinnin around
takin a sip swingin your hips
girl youre looking so fine with your beer in the headlights
with your beer in the headlights
