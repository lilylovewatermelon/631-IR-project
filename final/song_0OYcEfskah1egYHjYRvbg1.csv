i close both locks below the window
i close both blinds and turn away
sometimes solutions arent so simple
sometimes goodbyes the only way oh

prechorus
and the sun will set for you
the sun will set for you

chorus
and the shadow of the day
will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you

verse 2
in cards and flowers on your window
your friends all plead for you to stay
sometimes beginnings arent so simple
sometimes goodbyes the only way oh

prechorus
and the sun will set for you
the sun will set for you

chorus
and the shadow of the day
will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you

chorus
and the shadow of the day
will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you
and the shadow of the day
will embrace the world in grey
and the sun will set for you34embed"
