a hundred miles an hour only me at the wheel
i want it to shine to be only mine
the engine has to be just one of a kind

how many dollars do i need sir
you know i sure dont have a lot
there must be something we can work out
well ill take it anyway

i guess i could make room for one a bottle of rum
you and me together riding into the sun
live without care with the wind in my hair
im driving through the desert yeah ill go anywhere

take me where the wheels take me far away
wheels take me i cant stay
wheels take me any place today

imagine myself in an automobile
a hundred miles an hour if you know how i feel
alone with my mind leave my worries behind
i might even reach the border its just a matter of time

i said take me where the wheels take me far away
wheels take me i cant stay
wheels take me any place today
