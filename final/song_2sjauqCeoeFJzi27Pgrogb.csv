it takes two

verse 1 link
they say its a mans world well that cannot be denied
but what goods a mans world without a woman by his side
and so i will wait until that moment you decide

chorus 1 link  male council members
that im your man and youre my girl
that im the sea and youre the pearl
it takes two baby
it takes two

verse 2 link
a king aint a king without the power behind the throne
a prince is a pauper babe without a chick to call his own
so please darling choose me i dont wanna rule alone

chorus 2 link  male council members
tell me im your king and youre my queen
that no one else can come between
it takes two baby
it takes two dont you know

so take me to the dance floor and well twist the night away

so come closer baby oh and whisper in my ear

that youre my pride and im your joy
that im the sand and youre the tide
and ill be the groom if youll be my bride

it takes two
