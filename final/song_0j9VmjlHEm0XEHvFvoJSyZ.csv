some nights i wonder when the world will end
some nights i wonder what you think
i give my best though your heart is made of plaster
throw me snowballs from the guys who left you cold
and i say who left you shattered
and you said that you dont matter
make it clear when things feel so misunderstood

chorus jomie  powfu
some nights i wonder when the world will end
some nights i wonder what you think
i try to satisfy but nothings budging
just tell me what you want from me tell me what you want from me

verse 2 powfu
tell me what you want from me
feel like im on your bad side like constantly
and obvious is nothing like you think it is
its going down every night like a sinking ship
i got problems that im facing but i tackle it
and when you get a papercut call the ambulance
always make a big deal when nothing happens
cant talk or chain reaction might start

chorus powfu
some nights i wonder when the world will end
some nights i wonder what you think
i try to satisfy but nothings budging
just tell me what you want from me

you good no cool
sky fall i fall every night still
when i call you make everything a big deal
airpods in got the noise reduction
upstairs i always fear you up to something
take a chill pill know you bad at handling stress
when your life snowballs throw it at me i guess
or maybe take a step back recognize the pattern
so one day youll get a big ring like saturn

chorus jomie  powfu  rxseboy
some nights i wonder when the world will end when will it end
some nights i wonder what you think what do you think
i try to satisfy but nothings budging never does
just tell me what you want from me
tell me what you want from me1embed"
