dementia youre driving me crazy
this is driving me crazy
dementia oh dementia

verse 1 owl city
every light in the night flickered in and out
every bone in my back shivered up and down
keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
cause this is driving me crazy
every voice in my head shouted yes and no
every freight train of thought fought to stop and go
keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
cause this is driving me crazy

chorus owl city
big surprise im a ghost keeping out of sight
rub your eyes youre a star in a summer night
this is love this is war its insanity
dementia youre driving me crazy

every tear in my eyes dripped and wouldnt drop
every disc in my spine shook and couldnt stop

every warmhearted love left me freezing cold
keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
cause this is driving me crazy
