verse 2 fleshnbone

hell yeah they can dig it while im sitting on my throne
steady laughing at you niggas trying to get it get it get it

verse 3 bizzy bone
man im runnin til the end of this and i dont give a fuck if i was 86d
a muthafucka play me like im canibus
im ready for the battle like im takin diz
im never gonna take it in and nobody can break it in
assalamu alaykum for the bacon and a little bit of coke
i put the cake in and its certified dope
having anything to do with it we selling every rock that they can smoke
so take a toke and ima rake it in pillsbury the dough
to the dome like im seeking through the soul
like im peeking through the soul
but im reekin like our reefer rather keep up with her go straight to the dro
creeping on em peeping on em leave em in the zone
they dont even really know
looking on em keeping on em taking every foe
for the love of the money i gotta reap in what i sow
but i keep it what i know for the ending of the row gotta go will i go
when i get it ima know to follow my known foe
know cali and know coe my caliber lock and load
alabaster box when i cock and i crow
got a glock and im bone thug where you wanna flow
to the clock and the time zone
spirit gon fly all yall niggas dead to the life force cyclones
right now when they hydro
what about the well known cairo
verse 4 layzie bone
got em stuck in the grave
im on the grind full time never rest to get paid
a little hustling mothafucka put the brush to the face
i cut the braids hit the stage now they looking amazed
i went from cooking the yay to hundred thousand dollar shows
got a booking today and ima split it with my bros
gotta get it how we go come meet me with the pros
no im never gonna fold watch the bank account grow
if it aint about dough then it aint about jack
and ima take it like i want it i aint giving it back
i get us in with a stack and then i get on attack
im like the tasmanian devil nigga bigger than shaq
call the reaper get the shovel im a certified rebel
in a league of my own and thats a whole nother level
nothings free i never settle keep the pedal to the metal
when them haters in my rearview hello hello

verse 5 krayzie bone
burn baby let it burn now its my turn
i get in a niggas system like a hundred vials of sherm
and then i kill em with two thousand words in two minutes
you never heard another nigga spit it like my niggas
yeah but you heard em try to get it but they couldn’t get it quicker than the realest
man they thinking they can deal with this and knock me out my rhythm
but i’m never gonna be the fuckin victim
cause i’d rather be the suspect havent i given them enough yet
cant they understand they aint dealing with a punk bitch
one quick move and its murder
and ima serve a nigga exactly what he deserving
aap but wait a minute
im prolly one of the sickest niggas that ever did it im in it cause ima win it
ima mothafuckin lyrical tyrant pivotal giant of this shit
and i do way more than just twist the words
you better listen and observe how i rip the verb
niggas get the nerve to run up on me but my shits superb
i’ll probably hit a nigga once fore he hit the curb
so get at me im kinda trigger happy
when it come to shootin my gift im like a 44 magnum stag one
backin em up body bag full of niggas wack raps
that’s wack so im stacking em up
kray jack in the cut still got a little bit of murder for em
murderous poet i create a bloody murder poem
so when they run up on me nigga be ready to show em
redrum redrum redrum redrum rum rum rum rum
outro bizzy bone
yo before this project
we’d like to thank the most high
on behalf of the aap mob bone thug and all in attendance
knowing that all things belong to those
for the cleanliness and the power the first in the nation
to prove who they are
through infinity through eternity through time span
standing one man if you hold my hand hold my hand
make sure its a hand
with all things around me i will never win
i won’t win with angels i won’t win with the brothers
i won’t win with rome i won’t win with sodom and egypt
i keep a corpse close to my home
let us roll tell them why we did what we did if we did
in jesus name amen18embed"
