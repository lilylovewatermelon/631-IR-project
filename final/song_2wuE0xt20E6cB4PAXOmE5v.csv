jonny who was it that said
a white wall may seem empty
but its ready to be filled
and in its readiness needs nothing
it stands complete
was it you
i dont remember
but it makes me wonder
jonny why couldnt you be ready too
i was ready ready to be happy
ready for that long look that never ends
and now i dont know what to do
yes jonny ill say it
this is a love song isnt it
yes well i guess this is how it ends
a strange poem about a plain and ready white wall
one with many questions
and a dog as speechless as that same wall
and the sorrows of loves slow passing
