yeah i heard this story from an old man about this girl from tennessee
like a trailer park in a tornado
but hits twice as hard and is twice as mean
yeah them brown eyes just like bourbon
yeah way more than a hundred proof
so keep your guard up all you want
but shell always find a way to break through

prechorus
yeah shes the big bad wolf
and your hearts the straw hut
shell leave you fools in pieces
when she huffs and when she puffs

chorus
yeah shell eat your heart for breakfast
while shes walking out the door
just another off hеr checklist
drinkin poison that she pours
shes a long black train acomin
so you bеst get out the way
save ya self cause she leaves hell beggin for water
the devil dont even bother

verse 2
yeah i know somewhere tonight
shes slippin on that dress
and shes hellbent on a heartbreak
in them fire engine red
high heels shes stepping out on
while shes stepping on some floor
and some fools dont have a clue
about the burn shes got in store
see kane brown liveget tickets as low as 19you might also likechorus
yeah shell eat your heart for breakfast
while shes walking out the door
just another off her checklist
drinkin poison that she pours
shes a long black train acomin
so you best get out the way
save ya self cause she leaves hell beggin for water
the devil dont even bother

postchorus
no he dont
no he dont

prechorus
yeah shes the big bad wolf
and your hearts the straw hut
shell leave you fools in pieces
when she huffs and when she puffs

chorus
yeah shell eat your heart for breakfast
while shes walking out the door
just another off her checklist
drinkin poison that she pours
shes a long black train acomin
so you best get out the way
save ya self cause she leaves hell beggin for water
