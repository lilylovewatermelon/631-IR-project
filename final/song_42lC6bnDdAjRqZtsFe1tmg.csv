imprisoned inside this mind
hiding behind the empty smiles
so simple the anguish
as it mocks me
crawling back into the dark
running always running into the distance
stop me before i bleed again

prechorus
the echoes of my voice
follow me down
the shadows i cast
follow me down

chorus
deeper im falling
into the arms of sorrow
blindly descending
into the arms of sorrow

postchorus 1
there must be serenity

the echoes of my voice

into the arms of sorrow
blindly descending
into the arms of sorrow

the demons of my own design
this horror must not remain

chorus
deeper im falling
into the arms of sorrow
blindly descending
into the arms of sorrow

postchorus 2
there must be serenity
there must be deliverance
