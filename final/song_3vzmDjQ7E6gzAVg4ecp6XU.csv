under an old brass paperweight
is my list of things to do today
go to the bank and the hardware store
put a new lock on the cellar door
i cross em off as i get em done but when the sun is set
theres still more than a few things left i havent got to yet

chorus
go for a walk say a little prayer
take a deep breath of mountain air
put on my glove and play some catch
its time that i make time for that
wade the shore and cast a line
look up a long lost friend of mine
sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
start living thats the next thing on my list

verse 2
wouldnt change the course of fate
but cutting the grass just had to wait
cause ive got more important things
like pushing my kid on the backyard swing
i wont break my back for a million bucks
i cant take to my grave
so why put off for tomorrow what i could get done today

like go for a walk say a little prayer
take a deep breath of mountain air
put on my glove and play some catch
its time that i make time for that
wade the shore and cast a line
look up a long lost friend of mine
sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
start living thats the next thing on my list

chorus 2
raise a little hell laugh till it hurts
put an extra five in the plate at church
call up my folks just to chat
its time that i make time for that
stay up late then oversleep
show her what she means to me
catch up on all the things ive always missed
just start living thats the next thing on my list

outro
under an old brass paperweight
is my list of things to do todayembed"
