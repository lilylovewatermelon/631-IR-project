i know when my day will come
go back to the place that i came from
lookin back will i think that i did it right
i still dont sleep at night
i got these symphonies stuck in my head
and they dont leave
fillin up the silence with these notes
i dont want them to go

prechorus
ghosts follow me around these days
haunting my head and house
my mind is crazy loud
but i wont give in to it
take it all in stride

chorus
this life is such a ride
i live until i die
i walk into the fire
im searching for the higher ground
what a life
i live until i die
wont fail unless i try
im searching for the highеr ground

ive got that golden gun
i was born as the sеventh son
everything comes with conditions
everyones got their dirty dishes
ive got these memories
stuck in my head and they wont leave
filling up my treetops with these crows
i wish that they would go

chorus
this life is such a ride
i live until i die
i walk into the fire
im searching for the higher ground
what a life
i live until i die
wont fail unless i try
im searching for the higher
this life is such a ride
i live until i die
i walk into the fire
im searching for the higher ground
what a life
i live until i die
wont fail unless i try
im searching for the higher ground

tell me what to do and im on it
i am the witness

get it got it want it
tell me what to do and im on it
i am the witness the witness the witness

chorus
this life is such a ride
i live until i die
i walk into the fire
im searching for the higher ground
what a life
i live until i die
wont fail unless i try
bleeding keep on breathing
