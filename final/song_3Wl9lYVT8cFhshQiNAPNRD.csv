the third was very significant and i will touch on it later but it was a call from tommy john encouraging me to continue with my career at the age of thirtyfour the fourth call is not something i ever dreamed about i dont know i cant speak for the rest of the hall of famers but on january sixth when i got the call letting me know that i had been inducted into the hall of fame well words and emotions could not describe the phone rang i was just thankful that greg maddux had not put up the ultimate prank in letting me know that this was not for real thankfully they told me quickly that i had made it

so i truly want to thank the hall of fame jane forbes clark and jeff idelson for what theyve done in preserve the character of this great hall for brad horn for whitney  all the people behind the scenes making this like the perfect wedding orchestrating it to the fullest and of course the baseball writers of america your votes obviously got me to this point i cannot thank you enough

to randy pedro and craig i will never forget this class it is a class that i have had the utmost respect for each and every one of them of course craig ive competed the most against its hard to believe that ive never competed against randy johnson i cant say that im sorry but i dont think we ever hooked up

i had a seat in the bullpen when he pitched his perfect game as i was the closer for the braves and actually halfheartedly started to warm up in the ninth cause it was only a two to nothing game knowing full well i didnt think i was gonna get in that game but at 6 10 he is truly the freak that mastered a game in a way that no other could and in a weird way with pedro martinez being on the opposite end of the spectrum and me kinda fit in the middle at sixfootthree it shows why baseball is a game of all sizes and shapes and why it is truly americas pastime

craigs the teammate that you always wanted and the guy you never wanted to play against and pedro you got me in a lot of trouble facing you in my career you were the most dominant pitcher id ever seen it was bugs bunny and in todays world it was basically nintendo or any kind of game you watch  thats the kind of stuff you had i got fined a hundred dollars for checkswinging and hurting my wrist against you and thanks a lot

well im gonna try to do it backwards im gonna do the tough part first and i never thought id ever read a speech but for the sake of time im going to i want you to know that the best way to describe my career is unique i cant think of another word its unique in every way and i have fingerprints all over my career by those whove touched me and impacted me and have helped me along the way it is a huge army that got john smoltz from lansing michigan to where i am today

im not gonna touch on all of them im gonna do that in a personal way theres too many people to thank and i know that i will forget  somebody but i will take care of you on the back end i promise but i will be talking about some who made it possible to reach this dream

to my wife kathryn the hardest thing to do is when we met six years ago is transition from a baseball career to retirement as craig mentioned this life is a great life but a cruel life a tough one and you made that transition so seamless i cant even thank you enough you took a blended family and you made them seem like your own you love my kids as if they were your own you saw me at my worst trying to make a comeback with the boston red sox after major shoulder surgery and i truly could not have made it without you everything you did for this event its not possible im letting you know right now theres too many moving parts i love you so much youre where my place of comfort and peace really is and i look forward to the future as a retired well  broadcaster for the mlb network as we transition our career

to my kids andrew rachel carly and kelly i cant tell you what its like for the journey of a major league player you sacrifice so much i love you very much youve adjusted and adapted to the challenges in our life its not the perfect road we knew it wouldnt be and ive always tried to give you the best of what i had i cant wait to see what god has for each and every one of you as you pursue your passions although be unique they are your own and i cant wait to see the families that you are able to raise as well

to sarah catherine and ashley my two stepdaughters cant imagine what you two were thinking when your mom and i got married and you were starting a whole new journey your willingness to adapt under twists and turns and your ability to just go with the flow it seems like weve been meant to be together our whole lives i cant thank you and know how much i love you guys

to my mom and dad this is where the story gets interesting you did so much for me to get me to this point you didnt know much about sports or baseball you pretty much knew what you knew and that was playing the accordion cause thats how you guys met you were accordion teachers and im thankful for the opportunity that you started me on my quest to be the next lawrence welk at the age of four i played till the age of seven and then i hit you with the ultimate whopper of all whoppers at the age of seven i said i know what im gonna be in life and im gonna be a major league baseball player

you loved me enough to give me room to go after my dream you didnt discourage me from leaving the accordion for major league baseball you just told me to have a backup dream and i did that as well even though it was a gas station attendant at the time i thought that was pretty cool i cannot imagine the odds and the way you must have felt when i told you that i was going to play in major league baseball these things might have caused you to sway me in a different direction but you not only allowed me to pursue this newfound passion of mine you went on a mission to provide opportunities to give me an opportunity to play this great game of baseball
you served as a great example for me and all future parents that when your kid has a dream no matter how outrageous or outlandish it might be giving them a chance to pursue that is the greatest thing in life and you put aside your own what you knew and what you thought would fall in the family line of tradition of great accordion players and i cant thank you enough

im proud im proud of the way i grew up the heritage in which we grew up the polka music on the 8track tapes i enjoyed it all you taught me so much to not be afraid of who i am to live in the moment to learn to laugh to cry you gave me the characteristics and the morals by which today i live by and i am so thankful

dad you caught me my competitiveness your unwillingness to let me win at the age of four and five was relentless but i thought it was great cause i could return the favor when i had a chance to you taught me to honor god first family second school third and sports fourth you put the priorities where they needed to be and you stood by them i thank you for that

to my brother and sister i cant thank you enough for sacrificing your summers thankfully we didnt grow up in florida or warm weather where you fall prey to playing every day or all year two months in michigans long enough but you sacrificed a lot more and your love for me one year apart a closeknit family following my twentyone year career you there there at every turn and every time i needed you the most

my extended family is the biggest army in the world and i cant thank them enough because of everything we did it was closeknit we had a blast yes it always involved playing the accordion and dancing one of the things i didnt ever do was dance but i played the accordion and i cant thank you enough for the love that you have and i could not possibly repay you all

to my extended family again to my inlaws for just jumping on this ride and not knowing exactly what youre gonna get this is a pretty cool ending so far in the midst of my journey

now my baseball journey began outside our home in lansing michigan i got a unique story i already told you about the accordion but i had a wild imagination and before i go any further jeff foxworthy im not gonna tell any corny jokes so relax i could see you tense up as we speak right now relax no jokes

i started with a rubber ball and a brick wall for those who know me this will not come as a surprise i was the gm the manager the pitching coach the grounds crew the playbyplay you name it in my mind i did it and i would stand outside that wall in a generous strike zone and i would pitch the greatest games ever known to mankind im a selftaught baseball player im a tiger fanatic growing up and so i would watch somebody and emulate them immediately outdoors thankfully i did not have the technology that exists today that kinda distracts our attention to get outside and do that which we love

im also happy to say that in all those big games that i pitched in my life i won them all i truly believed that if the moment were to get there i would be a little kid on the mound relishing in the fact that i get to do this cause ive already done it in my mind so many different times

growing up in lansing was incredible its where my baseball career kinda took off i had my best friend chuck catsparella who we did everything together we thought of games we went outside we were constantly doing whatever it took for a lot of you in the stands that are not old enough you might not know what strikeout is but we played a lot of strikeout and pickup baseball and games that ill never forget

aside from my family and chuck a guy that i call my second dad and i owe just a great gratitude to could not make it today hes at home in lansing michigan hopefully watching carl wagner dedicated over fifty years of his baseball life teaching and honoring kids over fifty years he provided the opportunity for kids to go out and play the great game of baseball he taught me to never be complacent never think youve arrived cause theres always somebody working harder and trying to take your job and be better than you are i cant thank you enough carl and i love you

two other significant people from lansing real quick javier cavazos same thing dedicates his life to teaching youths all over lansing and he has been a big influence on me putting me in situations and he may be one of the few people that i have been as a coach will understand pedro martinez

because he told me at a game in brooklyn new york facing brooklyn new york where i gave up four tworun homers in a row in the fourth inning one of the greatest moments in my life of learning im not afraid to fail and i learned from some of the greatest failure moments in my life in brooklyn new york they were all yelling at me in spanish he came out and he said you wanna know what they said i said yeah you might as well tell me as youre taking me out he said they were yelling to get  for your neck cause every time you threw a pitch you turned around and it was over the fence thank you javier for your humility as well as your ability to teach kids
for phil odlum my high school and basketball coach i had the two greatest years of my life what youre gonna know about me is that i loved every minute of my life of where i grew up and where it ends and where its going and phil odlum you gave me the keys to lead a basketball or baseball team that i would take later and pursue that in my big league quest to be the best baseball player but the best teammate i possibly can

to start with the draft i gotta thank the tigers for drafting me in the twentysecond round i think im the latest draft pick to ever be in the hall of fame and if it were not for the scouts theyre the backbone of our game for seeing what i had and the motor that was ticking inside the 6 3 180pound skinny kid this all would not be possible

drafted by my hometown team was a dream come true as i said i had a unique situation where i got drafted the last day before you go to college imagine getting drafted and going to the team you idolize and staying with them for 35 days in the big leagues i got a chance to see what big leaguer life was instead of going to rookie ball i went right with the big club and got a chance to see what the heroes of my generation were doing in their locker room in their home

and i gotta say this as odd and as in awe as i was of these guys i remember sitting in the locker room at tiger stadium a fish out of water scared to death and a hall of famer in my mind a guy that i will never forget in making the first impression in my big league career alan trammell came up to me and said hi i am alan trammell anything i can do for you dont hesitate to ask this house is your house and i will never forget i thank you alan trammell for teaching me what a professional baseball player is all about

it was as if he had introduced and gave me a baton and said now pay this forward every chance you can because this game has a chance to impact a lot of people and i have done that to the best of my ability thanks to alan trammells imprint in my life just that five to twenty second time of his day he took to welcome a newcomer to the game

i also want to thank a good friend of mine bruce fields taking me into an instructional league right after big leagues i went into an instructional league and i worked 6 3 185 i went into the home of three veterans and they helped nurture me for the big leagues that i was about to take on that quest and thanks to his wife julie they put twenty pounds on me that instructional league that i desperately needed

now onto the trade the trade the most infamous trade i guess in atlanta braves history i cant spend enough time talking about this gentleman i will hear about it later i know from the fellow hall of famers that i respect but bobby cox is every single thing to me on why i stand up here today

he was the general manager that took the chance and made the trade and got me over to atlanta and yes they were the worst team in baseball at the time it was the most devastating time in my life but i realized that i would have an opportunity to pitch at a young age in an organization that desperately needed pitching

i also used to only think about that trade as myself and what it did for me and tom glavine reminded me that that trade opened up a spot for him in the big leagues and he never looked back so im thankful that twoforone worked out really well

bobby became my manager hes the reason that i stayed in the organization for twenty years i would rather go nowhere else as i said time does not permit to tell you what an incredible manager the history that i was able to watch he empowered people he gave you confidence when you didnt have it he was a tremendous leader and i owe a great amount of my career to this man

because of the faith that he had in me was the reason that i was able to make the transition from starter to closer and then back to starter he believed in everything that i did he knew my personality he allowed me to play golf which always puts a smile on my face and its the reason that the three of us were able to play for as long as we did

the starting rotation will be talked about for the rest of time and maybe always compared to things but to do something and to make it come full circle to talk about the two greatest teammates the two greatest pitchers who got inducted as i was sitting at the mlb network watching them absolutely rip me a new one and enjoying every second of it i thought we would go back in time and just do this for a second

puts on a wig
glav maddux back when i had hair we had the time of our lives its the only time greg youre not going to be able to talk about my bald head so what i want to talk about is the time that we had both playing golf and pitching what you dont know about greg and tom is that you know that all the statistics got him here and they got them here for the hall of fame but they did things behind the scenes for me that i will never ever forget

when i lost my changeup they were there helping me to find it when i lost my golf book which was the prized treasure of what i had because i was the golf concierge they looked tirelessly and helped me find it recently ive lost twenty pounds and they helped me find it thank you guys

takes off wig

i cannot say enough about them and as time permits obviously you know how much we have been together tommy for fifteen years and greg for ten to chipper jones soon to be inducted in the hall of fame another one of the atlanta braves im not gonna say anything about him because hell have the mic last would somebody please steal his twitter account please that would help

thanks to all the trainers who worked so hard im a miracle im a medical miracle that stands before you today i spent more time in the training room i cant thank them for their patience i know i drove them crazy dave pursley jeff porter jim lovell and everybody else that had a hand in my career i cant thank you all enough and like i said i hope to one day be able to give you something special

to chris burnham peter hughes you were invaluable in my career and crucial for the daytoday what it took to get to the mound to all the doctors in atlanta i spent a lot of time counseling with you and seeing how it was gonna be possible to throw another pitch

but one doctor i spent the most time and the most passionate doctor as tommy said last year and even greg dr joe chandler there is no possible way that i could have done this without you i cant thank you enough you are everything that i could ask for in your profession you watched the medical miracle keep existing we had many times at your house in your office and i cant thank you enough for the time that you spent with me its invaluable

to all the pitching coaches that i had i had roving pitching coaches in detroit john hiller and ralph treuel thank you for bearing with the wild stallion thank you to bruce dal canton my first pitching coach and then roger mcdowell of course but my first encounter of leo mazzone was when i came over from the detroit tigers in the trade he helped simplify my mechanics simplify my ability to pitch and with the throwing program that we were able to use over the last fifteen years of our career is the reason why we stayed so healthy thank you leo for your patience and for your diligence in seeing something through and making it work

to my good friend greg olson whos here today we hit it off right away on the field and off his upbeat attitude helped me get through so many of my tough games ill never forget him jumping in my arms against the astros sorry greg and the first time we were able to get to the playoffs and he jumped into my arms i never anticipated after going nine innings and he was pretty heavy but at that time he felt pretty light

we got a chance to do it again in game 7 after the unbelievable game of steve avery 1nothing gem in pittsburgh he jumped in my arms again and we were on to the world series this all happening after a 211 first start and then bobbys patience and faith of a 122 second half allowed this all to be possible we never planned it but however we were working on the trifecta in game 7 against jack morris we were one run away from that happening it didnt happen my idol growing up jack morris ruined that incredible opportunity to have three times you jumping in my arms thank you oley for all that you did and what we continue to do in our friendship

and all the catchers that ive had i was not an easy person to catch i cant thank them enough for their willingness to get me through a game to brian mccann breaking him in and now with the new york yankees it truly was a privilege to teach him what i had learned from a lot of the other catchers in our game

to all my teammates i cant name you enough i thank you for what it was that we had in an incredible run my goal in life was to be the teammate that i possibly can that meant caring for you on and off the field being their for you doing my best to be prepared laughing joking golfing whatever it took i cared about each and every one of them that was our family away from our family and we spent a lot of times and good times together

a special thanks to the greatest center fielder that ive ever seen in andruw jones andruw jones caught more fly balls that i threw than probably anybody else and he was truly a pleasure to play behind

to the atlanta braves organization to wear this great uniform and represent the great state of georgia i never took one day for granted wearing this uniform i played every game as if it was my last the braves uniform became such a platform for not only your foundation but my later foundation that i formed in the charities that we are able to touch i cant wait to represent these organizations in the future as now representing the greatest team behind me in the hall of fame

a special thank you to the boston red sox for taking a chance on a brokendown guy recovering from a shoulder surgery i cant thank you for that experience giving me another opportunity although i did not do very well i am so sorry for that but giving me that opportunity you showed me what another organizations view is like and the rich history that you had

to the saint louis cardinals i will never thank you for giving me that chance after being released by the boston red sox and deservingly so by the way for giving me an opportunity to end my career in what was an improbable and unbelievable fifteenth playoff season for tony la russa  i cant thank you for making me feel like one of your own and entrusting me with the ball in some of the big moments i will never forget these two organizations because i would retire after wearing the cardinals uniform in 2009

last but not least i want to steal a little bit of what i think craig biggio saw my speech i wanted to thank the clubhouse guys they are the heart and soul of our team they are the heart and soul of every junk that we bring to them and i watch these kids grow up from kids to adults to now having families it started with casey stevenson chris vanzant ben acree to name a few bill acree for all the things you did away from the game the game consumes you and you need things to be in the proper order and the right way i cant thank you enough

john schuerholz terry mcguirk and the whole braves organization you treated me with the family that i now have in atlanta and will forever live there lord willing john holland fred stone on the visiting side and the spring training i had so much fun with the guys behind the scenes because they never get enough time to be noticed or even know that theyre there and sometimes get treated in a way that doesnt represent what the game is

before i hand it over to the next inductee i would be remiss if i did not talk about tommy john ive been given an opportunity as one of the only players the only one right now to be inducted into the hall of fame with tommy john surgery its an epidemic its something that is affecting our game its something that i thought would cost me my career but thanks to dr james andrews and all those before him performing the surgery with such precision has caused it to be almost a false read like a bandaid you put on your arm

i want to encourage the families and parents that are out there to understand that this is not normal to have a surgery at fourteen and fifteen years old that you have time that baseballs not a yearround sport that you have an opportunity to be athletic and play other sports dont let the institutions that are out there running before you guaranteeing scholarship dollars and signing bonuses that this is the way

we have such great dynamic arms in our game that its a shame that were having one and two and three tommy john recipients so i want to encourage you if nothing else know that your childrens passion and desire to play baseball is something that they can do without a competitive pitch every throw a kid makes today is a competitive pitch they dont go outside they dont have fun they dont throw enough but theyre competing in maxing out too hard too early and thats why were having these problems so please take care of those great future arms

to tommy john i cant thank you enough for the phone call whether you were coerced or not the phone call at the age of thirtyfour meant the world to me emotionally id given up i had thought that no one would last and wait for a pitcher of my age on the last year of my contract thank you for encouraging me that was pivotal part of my career to push through what i thought might be a career ending

at thirtyfour and fourteen postseason years and twohundred postseason innings is one of the reasons i believe that tommy john besides genetics had happened to me but because of dr andrews and his brilliance and the team that had been before him i had the confidence that the surgery would work and the rest would write its story

last but not least or close to last but not least i want to thank mike nixon and scott runyon for taking our family up here in a plane that was an absolute gift and as you can see my familys huge it takes an army thank you for your generosity

being inducted into the hall of fame is one of the greatest honors that i could have here on earth however i know theres another one coming the ultimate hall of fame i want to thank god for the talent he has given me and the support system that i have i would not be the man i am today if it were not for a couple people who sowed seeds into my life telling me about christ and challenging me to take a deeper look into my faith

jose alvarez marty clary sid bream terry pendleton the list could go on they took the time to not care not so much about my talent but about the heart in the man that i would become jacky and ken kendall mike and kia mccoy walt and patti wiley and last tim cash and barb

these are the people through the toughest times in my life the intimacy of knowing what life has challenged you with theyve been in my every corner and theyve allowed me to know that i have more to live for than just the uniform that i was wearing they gave me the greatest gift to find my salvation in christ and i cant thank you enough for caring so much to invest your time and your heart in me

i have a unique group of men that meets every thursday in jrs jeff foxworthy and the likes of so many men who have through those days taught me the impact that i can make just beyond wearing a uniform

im so humbled to be a member of the national baseball hall of fame im honored by so many of my family members to be here in cooperstown is not something i ever dreamt i know along the way i forgot some people but in my baseball career ive been around two men that i would entrust my children with i would leave my children with who have represented me in baseball with the first class and dignity that i always wanted my parents to be proud of myles shoda and lonnie cooper i cannot thank you for taking care of my needs away from the game and representing my intentions and not yours it is so vital

to the guys that introduced me in transition to broadcasting thank you for taking the time to take a simpleminded novocabulary accordionplaying player into transition to baseball thank you to the mlb network it started with tbs and i cant thank them think of another home that id rather be and take the abuse when i get back from a great organization like the mlb network

i think ive covered it all i am thankful and honored and blessed thank you very very much6embed"
