back on that chain gang strumming along
hammering nails so i can sing my song
the devil done this to me
i drive the spikes down profound
building the cages that all broke us down
boy get back down on your knees

chorus
so take these chains from me
well break these bastards theres no masters here
in the end
well break these bastards theres no masters here

verse 2
a thousand boots down on the ground
beating a drum under a marching sound
you better fucking believe
theyre screaming left right left right
fist in the air you better pick a side
against the plutocracy

chorus
so take these chains from me
well break these bastards theres no masters here
in the end
well break these bastards theres no masters here

save the world
we never wanted we never wanted
to save the world
we never wanted to have to save ourselves

chorus
so take these chains from me
well break these bastards theres no masters here

no masters here
no masters here
no masters here
