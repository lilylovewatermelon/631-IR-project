all of your street light eyes wide on my plastic toys
then when the cops closed the fair i cut my long baby hair
stole me a dogeared map and called for you everywhere

have i found you flightless bird
jealous weeping
or lost you american mouth
big pill looming

now im a fat house cat nursing my sore blunt tongue
watching the warm poison rats curl through the wide fence cracks
kissing on magazine photos those fishing lures
thrown in the cold and clean blood of christ mountain stream

have i found you flightless bird
grounded bleeding
or lost you american mouth
big pill stuck going downsee iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeembed"
