end all of our promises
the truth we know we cant save

verse 1
somethings gotta get through
if you wanna stay you
need to find a place for me
youre always sayin were through
then turn around and say you
cant see no one else but me

prechorus
fought my way out
ive been here before
its a long way down this cold dead end road
stretch my wings out
break away before
strike these lonely days before they grow

chorus
just end all of our promises
the truth we know we cant save
end all of our promises
the reckless games that we play

if i was to treat her
like them other sneakers
surely i would rule as king
but no matter how i treat her
she always gonna linger
on all the other boys but me

prechorus
fought my way out
ive been here before
its a long way down this cold dead end road
stretch my wings out
break away before
strike these lonely days before they grow

chorus
just end all of our promises
the truth we know we cant save
end all of our promises
the reckless games that we play

end all of our promises
the truth we know we cant save
end all of our promises
the reckless games that we play
bridge
theres nowhere to go just hanging round
when everything we do keeps crashing down
sings the song this songs gone out of style
were twisting our words when we know we have to

chorus
end all of our promises
the truth we know we cant save
end all of our promises
the reckless games that we play

end all of our promises
the truth we know we cant save
end all of our promises
the reckless games that we play1embed"
