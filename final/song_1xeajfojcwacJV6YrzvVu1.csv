there you go messing with my mind
i am usually better when i lie
there i go stuck inside a shell
and youre living on the other side a lovers carousel

prechorus
if you only knew

chorus
oh i lose control
when i hear your body move
through the walls
in the next room
oh i lose control
when i hear your body move
and im dying to break through
to the next room

verse 2
you make love to everything you touch
its a natural reaction its a sexual attraction
you play me like i am made of strings
im a violin a melody i want your lips to sing

prechorus
if you only knew
how hard it is to handle
how bad i want this scandal
