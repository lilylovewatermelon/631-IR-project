in 85 tuesday morning
came alive i didnt know ya
route 66 is gone
reagans here it wont be long
nintendo comes live aid too
back to the future where were you
while i spent all my days in catholic school
in 89 the dream begins
first in line to california
pete rose is banned for good
the simpsons come to hollywood
russia leaves afghanistan flight 103 ends pan am
bush is here this is the year
that i feel most alone

chorus
no more
countin down the hours
no more
wishin you were here
i stopped believin although journey told me dont
before i call it a day
maybe thisll be my year
maybe thisll be my year
maybe thisll be my year
maybe thisll be my year
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likeverse 2
in 92 a boy is born
the skies were blue in ohio
boris yeltsin chills
freddie dies but queen is still
barcelona has the games
lady di is single again
clinton wins and i still dream
that ill find you someday
in 97 a baby girl
adds some heaven to the world
tony blair tips the scales
elton sings for the princess of wales
microsoft buys into mac
my dad has a second heart attack
and train leaves san francisco
in a thousanddollar van

chorus
no more
countin down the hours
no more
wishin you were here
i stopped believin although journey told me dont
before i call it a day
maybe thisll be my year
maybe thisll be my year
maybe thisll be my year
maybe thisll be my year
verse 3
2001 the towers fell
the world is stunned i wish i knew ya
i was on a plane the world would never be the same
the artificial heart is born
ironic when new yorks is torn out woahohoh
2004 began in may
on tour when i met ya
facebook joins the internet
oldsmobile joins the cassette
i met your family
it took a while til you kissed me
but when you did i finally felt at home

chorus
i stopped believin although journey told me dont
before i call it a day
maybe thisll be my year
maybe thisll be my year
maybe thisll be my year
maybe thisll be my year

outro
2012 and all i know
is everybody comes and goes
everybody sings and cries
makes the grade and takes the prize
in something nothing i dont care
because i always know that youll be here
with me1embed"
