sweet potato pie and i shut my mouth
gone gone with the wind
there aint no body looking back again
cotton on roadside cotton on the ditch
we all picked the cotton but we never got rich
daddy was a veteran a southern democrat
they oughta get rich man to vote like that

singing
song song of the south
sweet potato pie and i shut my mouth
gone gone with the wind
there aint no body looking back again

well somebody told us wall street fell
but we were so poor that we couldnt tell
the cotton was short and the weeds was tall
but mr roosevelts a gonna save us all

well momma got sick and daddy got down
the county got the farm and we moved to town
poppa got a job with the tva
we bought a washing machine and then a chevrolet
see alabama liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likeoutro x 6
singing song song of the south
sweet potato pie and i shut my mouth
gone gone with the wind
there aint nobody looking back againembed"
