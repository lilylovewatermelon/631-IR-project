taytay made the beat
money gon hurt you i know you dont feel me
niggas talkin crazy boy i swear that shit kill me
forever forever
as long as you real we gon always be together

verse 1
label tryna tell me to switch my style
say im in the hood too much and im too wild
long as yall get yours ima get mine
old lawyer taking xan probably gotta sit down
gotti just called hope they free my dawg
when shit aint going right wish it was me and not yall
fuck paying the lawyer bro i wanna come get you
wish you had a bond you know money aint the issue the issue

chorus

merey just wrote me doggy bone you got it
keep making us proud or all of this shit dont matter

keep my music to myself really dont wanna do no features
i cant wait til i see you fill you in on whats happenin
niggas hating on me prolly mad that im a rapper
i had to check the luggage cant be traveling too much baggage
i thought niggas was happy real talk i seen it all
rip to rece you the one i see in all us
