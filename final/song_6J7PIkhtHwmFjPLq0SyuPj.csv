this aint the right time for you to fall in love with me
well baby im just being honest
and i know my lies could not make you believe
were running in circles thats why

in my dark time ill be going back to the street
promising everything i do not mean
in my dark time baby this is all i could be
and only my mother can love me for me
in my dark time
in my dark time
