as soon as my eyes shut the slide show begins
yesterday is gone now and panic sets in
with a weight upon my chest and a ghost upon my back
and the numbing sensation of everything i lack that leaves me
dreaming dreaming dreaming
your real world away

chorus
and beautiful beautiful bright eyes lie
only beautiful o beautiful bright eyes cry
singing late morning lullaby

verse
the first sign of morning is gray and alarming
its so disappointing the day has come so soon
while the rest of the world greets the day and feels new
i will push it away just like i always do i will be
dreaming dreaming dreaming
your real world away

chorus
and beautiful o beautiful bright eyes lie
only beautiful o beautiful bright eyes cry
singing late morning lullaby
late morning lullaby
see brandi carlile liveget tickets as low as 189you might also likeoutro
i would darken my window so i can fall asleep
while the critics frown down on the hours i keep that leave me
dreaming dreaming dreaming
your real world away1embed"
