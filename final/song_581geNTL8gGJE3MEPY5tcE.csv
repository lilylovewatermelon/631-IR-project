woke up and you wasnt next to me this mornin
saw a yellow cab drive you down the street on broadway
wish i could erase the mistakes that i made im sorry
wanted me to chase you inside but the house too haunted

chorus machine gun kelly
i tried to get away with the worst this time you caught me
tried to find a place for the words so i can say sorry
its so shitty how i waste love
i know its shitty how i waste love
come home every night
im wasted wasted wasted wasted wasted

verse 2 machine gun kelly
its gettin hard to fake how i feel when your face still taunts me
i know its hard to fake how you feel do you not still want me
howd you run away from the place you brought me
i did it to myself though go ahead and blame this on me

chorus madison love  machine gun kelly
you tried to get away with the worst this time i caught you
i tried to make you stay with my words but this time i lost you
so shitty how you waste love its shitty how i waste love
its so shitty how you waste love i know its shitty how i waste love
get home every night
youre wasted wasted wasted wasted wasted
