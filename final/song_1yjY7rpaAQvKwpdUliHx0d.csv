cant count the years on one hand
that weve been together
i need the other one to hold you
make you feel make you feel better
its not a walk in the park
to love each other
but when our fingers interlock
cant deny cant deny youre worth it

prechorus
cause after all this time im still into you

chorus
i should be over all the butterflies
but im into you im into you
and baby even on our worst nights
im into you im into you
let em wonder how we got this far
cause i dont really need to wonder at all
yeah after all this time im still into you

verse 2
recount the night that i first met your mother
and on the drive back to my house
i told you that i told you that i loved ya
you felt the weight of the world
fall off your shoulder
and to your favorite song
we sang along to the start of forever
prechorus
and after all this time im still into you

chorus
