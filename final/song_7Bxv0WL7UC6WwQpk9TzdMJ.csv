there are so many things that i dont understand
theres a world within me that i cannot explain
many rooms to explore but the doors look the same
i am lost i cant even remember my name

chorus
ive been for some time
looking for someone
i need to know now
please tell me who i am
ive been for some time
looking for someone
i need to know now
please tell me who i am

verse 2
there are so many things that i dont understand
theres a world within me that i cannot explain
many rooms to explore but the doors look the same
where are the locks to try the key
i am lost i cant even remember my name
and i wonder why

chorus
ive been for some time
looking for someone
i need to know now
please tell me who i am
ive been for some time
looking for someone
i need to know now
please tell me who i am
ive been for some time
looking for someone
i need to know now
please tell me who i am
ive been for some time
looking for someone
i need to know now
please tell me who i amyou might also like22embed"
