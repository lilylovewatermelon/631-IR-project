thousand dollars worth of dimes in the trap with rockstars
we putting fear in cowards hearts when they see us on the block
swerving in the deuce and quarter busting shots just because

make that money turn bright just look at my piece and my grill
swerving off church street the pimp god gave me skills

riding down simpson bout to waste my purple lean on me
purple linen clean on me the whole zone three on me
