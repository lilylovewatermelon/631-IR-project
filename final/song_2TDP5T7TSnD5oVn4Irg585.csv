forty minutes after i left then them niggas let shots off
nother thirty minutes down get a call that them niggas killed my dog
stayin fresh to death through the pain cause the envy i dont talk bout
tryna stay the same yearround i aint tryna let a nigga come walk down
so im walkin im strapped with that sentence
intelligent but make the poorest decisions
when my life on the line gotta know that im with it
she the one i wan be with til the ending
but i see she dont want me like in the beginning
one got hit with the drac saw the look in her eye
blood flew out her body right then felt the love
the one got my son who you feel that im missin
aint killed behind her killed cause kay was my girl

chorus
ridin in that motherfuckin bentley
thinkin bout benjis i know what she like
know a whole lotta bad bitches
real slatt business wanna be my wife
layin round with my mistress
while im thinkin is you holdin me down

verse 3
she really into that nigga
but she steady sitting round me for only for sex and some money
kept it real since a lil bitty nigga
but more loyal than him aint confessing about me for nothin
just let me be dont turn me down
i aint never once now asked you for nothin
im the one up early im the one who hustlin
barely not show money and i was stuntin
got a trenchcoat on and im ridin through the thunder
waitin for it go down got a stick for the puntin
know ill take a nigga life i aint doin no runnin
gettin high all night when my brain on a hundred
tryna be on time doin onetwenty
know whats on my mind get straight to it
left the whip on outside
long gone off lean ima need more fluids
stop the car hop out and we skate from the jakes
shit gon pop off its a risk that i take
fore we knock a block down we gon change out the plates
i dont wanna leave home ima raise up the rate
ima make em pay me double for to go out on stage
superstar burn rubber hit the corner while i leave these hoes in amaze skrrt skrrt skrrt
refrain
can you help me out
i dont wanna explain how i feel i dont wanna explain i dont even wan talk i dont wan do nothin
i dont wan talk right now tryna tell you
i just wanna get from round here i just wanna get from round here i wanna go far

chorus
