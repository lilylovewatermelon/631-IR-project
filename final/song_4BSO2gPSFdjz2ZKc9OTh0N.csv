i lost all of my vanity
when i peered into the pool
i lost all of my innocence
when i fell in love with you
i never knew a man could fall so far until i landed here
where all of my wounds they turned into gold
when i kissed your hair

chorus
now come to me hannah
hannah wont you to come home to me
and ill lay down this bottle of wine
if youll just be kind to me

verse 2
ask her why she cries so loud
will not say a word
eyes like ice and hands that shake
she takes what she deserves
to celebrate the emptiness
of a cold and lonely room
sweep the floor with your long flowered dress
if you cannot find a broom

chorus
now come to me hannah
hannah wont you to come home to me
and ill lay down this bottle of wine
if youll just be kind to me

shes got hair that flows right down right down
to the backs of her knees
her papa he was a preaching man
and the lord is hard to please
so she comes down from the ozark hills to these
very streets to roam
with a banjo and a bible
and a fine tooth comb

chorus
now come to me hannah
hannah wont you to come home to me
and ill lay down this bottle of wine
if youll just be kind to me

verse 4
now id walk one mile on just broken glass
to fall down at your feet
mmmm my hannah
youre the queen of the street

i climbed the tree with my hannah lee
my intentions they were pure
but the breeze did whip and i lost my grip
and i tumbled towards the earth
where you never would guess who it was that stood below
his name i will never tell
but his eyes were clear
his arms were strong
he caught me as i fell
chorus
now come to me hannah
hannah wont you to come home to me
and ill lay down this bottle of wine
if youll just be kind to me

reprise
now id walk one mile on broken glass
to fall down at your feet
mmmm my hannah youre the queen of the street
the queen of the streetembed"
