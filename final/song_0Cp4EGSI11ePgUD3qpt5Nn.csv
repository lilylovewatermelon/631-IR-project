the distance and my hearts to sand
flowing through the hourglass
time to let go of all we know
break our hearts in stride

verse 1 jt woodruff
i need you now more like yesterday
the last day i could see you smile
for the last time turn out the lights
my life on standby
so standby and watch this fall away and fall apart

chorus jt woodruff casey calvert
just say that its over
its over and shes gone
now shes gone
“dont worry” he said
and shes not coming home
shes not coming home
its over and shes gone

verse 2 jt woodruff matt ridenour
the distance and my hearts to sand
flowing through the hourglass
i fall to pieces
i cant let go of all the times i never said goodbye of all the times i never said goodbye

just say that its over
its over and shes gone
now shes gone
“dont worry” he said
and shes not coming home
shes not coming home
its over and shes gone
