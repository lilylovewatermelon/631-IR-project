im in like with you
not in love with you quite yet
my hearts beginning to
slightly overrule my head

prechorus
ohno ohno
my selfcontrol
it wont hold up
for very long
ohno ohno
you touch my soul
i cant help falling too fast for you

chorus
can you hold on a bit
stop before we go
cause i might need a moment
and i wouldnt wanna spoil it
who knows
if i am
ready or not ready or not
only time will tell
who knows
if we are
ready to make this something
who knows
