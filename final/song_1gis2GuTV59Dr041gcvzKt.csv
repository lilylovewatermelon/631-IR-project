cmon

verse 1
yes youre the one that i want
but we need you to say its alright
cause every time we hang out
we all flirt and it ends up in a fight

you fall for my best friend
the same time that i fall in love with you
hes always hitting on my girl
why dont we do the ol switcheroo

prechorus
you cant stop this feeling
oh you cant keep our hearts from beating

chorus
cause i want what hes got
and he wants what ive got
and i know what you want
so lets trade what weve got

hell be with her ill be with you
and nobodys blue
how times have changed theres nothing wrong
with the ol switcheroo
