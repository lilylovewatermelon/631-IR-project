the only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself 

ariel spoken
can you do that

ursula spoken
my dear sweet child thats what i do its what i live for to help unfortunate merfolk like yourself poor souls with no one else to turn to 

sung
i admit that in the past ive been a nasty
they werent kidding when they called me well a witch
but youll find that nowadays
ive mended all my ways
repented seen the light and made a switch

spoken
true yes 

sung
and i fortunately know a little magic
its a talent that i always have possessed
and here lately please dont laugh
i use it on behalf of the miserable lonely and depressed

spoken
pathetic 
you might also likesung
poor unfortunate souls
in pain in need
this one longing to be thinner
that one wants to get the girl
and do i help them yes indeed
those poor unfortunate souls
so sad so true
they come flocking to my cauldron
crying spells ursula please
and i help them yes i do

now its happened once or twice
someone couldnt pay the price
and im afraid i had to rake em cross the coals
yes ive had the odd complaint
but on the whole ive been a saint
to those poor unfortunate souls

spoken

sebastian spoken

flotsam and jetsam the eels gag sebastian muffling his cries
ursula spoken

ariel spoken

ursula spoken
thats right but youll have your man lifes full of tough choices isnt it oh and there is onemorething we havent discussed the subject of payment

ariel spoken
but i dont have any—

ursula spoken
im not asking much just a token really a trifle youll never even miss it what i want from you is your voice

ariel spoken
my voice

ursula spoken
youve got it sweet cakes no more talking singing zip

ariel spoken
but without my voice how can i—

ursula spoken
youll have your looks your pretty face and dont underestimate the importance of body language ha
sung
the men up there dont like a lot of blabber
they think a girl who gossips is a bore
yes on land its much preferred
for ladies not to say a word
and after all dear what is idle prattle for
come on theyre not all that impressed with conversation
true gentlemen avoid it when they can
but they dote and swoon and fawn
on a lady whos withdrawn
its she who holds her tongue who gets a man

come on you poor unfortunate soul
go ahead make your choice
im a very busy woman
and i havent got all day
it wont cost much
just your voice
you poor unfortunate soul
its sad but true
if you want to cross a bridge my sweet
youve got to pay the toll
take a gulp and take a breath
and go ahead and sign the scroll
flotsam jetsam now ive got her boys
the boss is on a roll
this poor unfortunate soul
beluga sevruga
come winds of the caspian sea
larengix glaucitis
et max laryngitis
la voce to me

spoken
now sing 

ariel

ah ah
ah ah

ursula spoken
keep singing

ariel
ah ah ah ah9embed"
