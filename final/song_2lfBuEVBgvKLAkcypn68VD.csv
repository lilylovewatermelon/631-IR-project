there aint nothing that cant be done
by me and god
aint nobody gonna come in between me and god
one day well live together
where the angels trod
me and god
early in the morning talking it over
me and god
late at night talking it over
me and god
you could say were like two peas in a pod
me and god

chorus
hes my father
hes my friend
the beginning
and the end
he rules the world
with a staff and rod
were a team
me and god

verse 2
i am weak and he is strong
me and god
he forgives me when im wrong
me and god
hes the one i lean on
when life gets hard
me and god

outro
he rules the world
with a staff and rod
were a team
me and god
were a team
