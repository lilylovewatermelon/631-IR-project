well now stage right enter jimmy just a counterfeit james dean
with a pocket full of delta blues and cheap amphetamines
her feet up on the dashboard like a burnedout betty paige
she might have been pretty if she were half her age
but together they were something just aclosing down the bars
headed down to okie city in a slightly stolen car

verse 2
well their folks were decent people but they didnt like their kind
when the car pulled in the driveway they were starin through the blinds
the preacher in the kitchen oh hes eatin apple pie
oh and mamas in the bedroom lord she couldnt help but cry
and daddy looked so natural like hed just gone to sleep
and the preacher looked through jimmy and prayed his soul to keep

chrous
and its comin home comin home
aint nothin like a family to make you feel so damned alone
he shouldve brought flowers shoulda got daddys gun
aint nobody waitin on the prodigal son

verse 3
well they pulled out into traffic nosed in behind the hearse
and that awful empty feeling well it went from bad to worse
the preacher read from scripture and they put him in the ground
ah well everybody loaded up and headed back to town
but jimmy got his whiskey out once everyone was gone
felt he should say somethin starin down at the stone
see turnpike troubadours liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likechrous
and its comin home comin home
aint nothin like a family to make you feel so damned alone
he shouldve brought flowers shoulda got daddys gun
aint nobody waitin on the prodigal son

verse 4
well the menfolk folded tables and the ladies cleaned the plates
the cousins asked about the car locked behind the gates
jimmy knew his daddys 38 was in that trunk buried deep
and itd find its rightful owner once its mama was asleep
but jimmy looked at mama mama just looked down
she said whys it take a funeral boy to bring you back to townembed"
