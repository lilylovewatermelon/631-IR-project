when im nervous i have this thing yeah i talk too much
sometimes i just cant shut the hell up
its like i need to tell someone
anyone wholl listen
and thats where i seem to fuck up
yeah i forget about the consequences
for a minute there i lose my senses
and in the heat of the moment my mouth starts going
the words start flowing oh

prechorus
but i never meant to hurt you
i know its time that i learnt to
treat the people i love like i wanna be loved
this is a lesson learned

chorus
i hate that i let you down
and i feel so bad about it
