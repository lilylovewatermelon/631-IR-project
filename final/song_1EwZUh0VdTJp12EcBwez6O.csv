here i am
and i been thinkin about you lately
hold my hand
cause ive been missin you like crazy

dont wanna go through life every single night
wishing we could do it oh but do it right
come and hold me tight we dont need to fight
rather spend my life with you every night

dont wanna hold my pillow i wanna hold you
please be beside me

need more than just a queen in between em
this bed is too lonely without you too lonely
