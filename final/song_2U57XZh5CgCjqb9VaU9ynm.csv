ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh

verse 1
busy working hard wrapped up in my job we got bills to pay
lately when we talk it feels like i dont hear a single word you say
can we get back to the basics
and find that young love and make it
and tear down all these walls ignore all of our calls and just stay in

chorus
kiss me like a stranger
baby hold me like we never met
every touch a little danger
like you aint gotten used to me yet
strike a match light the fuse
you and i we could use some reckless behavior
so baby kiss me like a stranger

postchorus
ooh ooh ooh

verse 2
lightning on my skin every touch remembering what you mean to me oh
let me reminisce my lips on your lips like a symphony
playing on my heartstrings

come on over my way and lay it on me

chorus
and kiss me like a stranger
baby hold me like we never met
every touch a little danger
like you aint gotten used to me yet
strike a match strike a match light the fuse light the fuse
you and i we could use some reckless behavior
so baby kiss me like a stranger
