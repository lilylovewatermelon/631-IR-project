al geno on the track
g just bounced back from a headshot
trappin by the roadblock
i only give until my legs out
been a real nigga til my legs stop
real trapper my legs tired
real trapper my legs tired
yeah yeah

chorus nocap
my life was hard it just had to be yeah
watch me turn my dreams to reality yeah
im runnin outfield them demons after me yeah
when i pop these percs i dont do it happily
got a little fame all of a sudden they change
feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
i was so blind i just couldnt see the hate
forgave all them niggas im still ray

verse 1 lil baby
would have never started rappin if i knew this shit had came with this
if i had never made a hit would they be on my dick
i just been sittin back and pushin pounds just gettin fit
and i got a 60 on my right wrist im movin fast like lightnin
these other rappers tryna bite me your baby mama wanna bite me
i swear to god she triflin i pass her on cause im righteous
i run the jungle like tarzan that codeine was like poison
i cut back i feel awesome no playoffs but im ballin
had a good day i scored 40 and i aint talkin points
i close my eyes i still have flashbacks when i was in the joint
i hit my knees im thankin god im prayin every mornin
i check the schedule and im booked up im finally tourin
im goin where i wanna go doin what i wanna do
i can screw who i wanna screw i came from nothin i can never lose
turned my dreams into reality i thought that youd be glad for me
i cant believe that you mad at me damn dawg im proud of you
my life was garbage too but i did what i posed to do
and i went and bought the latest coupe told my young nigga stay in school
but he aint listen now he got a 45 in the kitchen with a biscuit ready to flip it

verse 2 nocap
would have never started rappin if i knew this shit had came with this
im on top of all these niggas i can see when all these angels piss
the way my nigga crossed me up i thought his name was chris
dont wanna fuck around and kill my dawg they gon do me like im vick
yeah they gon really hate me if i sign a deal
ima go buy a wraith crash it on purpose blame it on the pills
when lil joe be slidin it be look like he headed to second base
i see the hate it look like makeup its all on their face
i cant see fred no more so i be talkin to his headstone
sometimes i wanna catch a body but i put my head on
crawford finna touch down he in the red zone
i sure got tired of sendin him naked pictures of my red bone
yeah g just bounced right back off a headshot
yeah i wont fuck that bitch if she aint got no ass shots
put them choppers on the jet we gon air it out
25 hundred on some trap gear we gon weigh it out
too much dirty money wont put that shit in the shower
even when lights out boy that money still bring power
cant serve a lot of white but that shit look like baby powder
got my gun at every show i dont care if it aint crowded
i barely sleep but when i do i just be dreamin
they know i came from the bottom like bikinis
when i cant get hold to them percs i be fiendin
why would you tell me that you love me and you dont mean it
chorus nocap
my life was hard it just had to be yeah
watch me turn my dreams to reality yeah
im runnin outfield them demons after me yeah
when i pop these percs i dont do it happily
got a little fame all of a sudden they change
feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
i was so blind i just couldnt see the hate
forgave all them niggas im still ray

would have never started rappin if i knew this shit had came with this

the way my nigga crossed me up i thought his name was chris
dont wanna fuck around and kill my dawg they gon do me like im vick
yeah they gon really hate me if i sign a deal
ima go buy a range crash it on purpose blame it on the pills
