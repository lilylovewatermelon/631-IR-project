i got up and started walking
down to the end of my street
and on into town

well i had no one to meet
and i had no taste for talking
seems im talking my whole life
its time i listen now

well i walk passed the late night boys
with their bottles in their doorways
and i walk passed the business men
sleeping like babies in their cars
and i thought to myself oh son
you may be lost in more ways than one
but ive a feeling that its more fun
than knowing exactly where you are

like a stone
carried on the river
like a boat
sailing on the sea
ill keep on walking
oh ill keep on walking
until i find that old love or that old love comes to find me
see passenger liveget tickets as low as 36you might also likewell i walked into the morning and felt the warm sunlight forming on my shoulders
cos it hit me with no warning like a summer sky storming in my lungs
aint it funny how the kids walk by
theyll do anything to make themselves look older
while the women spend their money on anything that makes them look young

like a stone
carried on the river
like a boat
sailing on the sea
oh ill keep on walking
well ill keep on walking
til i find that old love or that old love comes to find me

oh lo lo
oh oh oh
oh lo lo
oh oh oh

well im like a stone
and im carried on the river
like a boat
sailing on the sea
oh well ill keep on walking
well i said ill keep on walking oh
til i find that old love or that old love comes to find me
til i find that old love or that old love comes to find me1embed"
