ahem rhetorical rhetorical
uh

verse 1
forever life been never nice we expedite the process yeah
and every night i get advice cause life is way too complex yep
heavens lights are hella bright ironic how that came to be
but cant you see this angel speaks
shes sayin the place is safe for me
i told her wait for me the makebeliever normally disguise
transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs
the morning rises and im fast asleep
somewhere off in the master suite
havin dreams of latin queens and nasty freaks
my mind it wanders to places yonder and even farther
when im sleep walkin im steven jobs or im peter parker
a genius author a jesus preachin just to feed his daughter
the weed to spark up yeah hes a goner fuck these primadonnas woah
ill always wonder what happened three thousand years ago
i like to toy with the idea that we really know
is what i do important in the grand scheme of things
in my head these dreams are dreamt trust me we are kings
you might also likechorus
im wearin a blindfold like where did the time go
i know you hear me up there give me a sign though
ima follow you wherever your mind go
baby ima follow you wherever your mind go
take me away girl somewhere they wont be
hold me closely look at me dont speak
will you follow me wherever my mind go
said will you follow me wherever my mind go ho

interlude
im just tryin to make it all make sense
uh

verse 2
as you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of
all the time we fall behind get lost in this aquarium gone
america the standard of vanity when the cameras up
we become celebrities distract from the hysteria
confessions that i have the curiosity about life and death
most of us will never understand it we just like the quest
read about the meanings of dreaming and all its messages
sedatives that take me to god witness his fetishes uhhuh
we all in search for substance substance
that drugs your pain and numbness numbness
circumstances advancin the second chance for this beloved
i wish i could tell you that i didnt see this comin comin
but im ready for it all to end die before tomorrows trend not again
your life it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
darkness on the brain lost inside forgotten days forgotten days
life it works in such mysterious ways ways
all these years that i pray hope you hear what i say ayy
chorus
im wearin a blindfold like where did the time go
i know you hear me up there give me a sign though
ima follow you wherever your mind go
baby ima follow you wherever your mind go
take me away girl somewhere they wont be
hold me closely look at me dont speak
will you follow me wherever my mind go
said will you follow me wherever my mind go ho

outro
wherever my mind goes
ima follow you wherever your mind go
wherever your mind goes
will you follow me wherever my mind go ho

ima follow you wherever your mind go
ima follow you wherever your mind go

will you follow me wherever my mind go ho
will you follow me wherever my mind go ho
ima follow you wherever your mind go
ima follow you wherever your mind go
will you follow me wherever my mind go ho
will you follow me wherever my mind go ho
