every space man knows you just gotta have space hos
even space girls know it
you get a big delight in every bite
delicious creamfilled space hos taste out of this world
with luscious creamy inside soft cake outside
you get a big delight in every bite
yup smart space men always have plenty of good hos
wherever they go hos

verse
how they gave his own show to tad ghostal
any given second he could go mad postal
stay wavin that power band space cannon
and have the nerve to jump in the face of race bannon
and punked out luckily he deaded it
and guess whos the schmuck whos credited with editing it
your man moltar the cop out
aint have no other career choice he dropped out
since when the wayouts included zorak
way back he used to rub his thorax in borax
im not the one that sold him to it
if he wont admit it im not gonna hold him to it
its all love and no hate though
for all that the villain need to get his own late show
do a monologue and jest with the guests
madlib switch the beat and walk him to the desk
with danger holding down the control room
late again returning from commercial i told you doom
early hes on bpt
catch him on public access free tv
and were back live on the air with brak
so brak how your man got a show thats so whack
have you ever thought to work with err and ignignokt an them
and do you got enough oxygen from this toxic phlegm
another sec his neck woulda got flames
mouse switched the screen to some hot dames
tonights audience will receive miscreant video games
and fifteen seconds of fame pitiful lames
its just a shame im zonin
competin for the same prime time slot as conan
no dummy edogawa
announcement free lunch to any stunt who lets me plow her
in the shower for an hour the kids sposed to be asleep
or else to join it sound like road runner beep beep
later this week big ben klingon
after him theres no one else we could afford to bring on
keep it ghetto
and let em know byob from the get go
id like to propose a toast
to the grossest host space hos coast to coast
that destructo rays a played out gag
and the cape and the pants suit lookin like a straight out
dag dont mean to sound crunchy
hit a honey from the back and crumpled up her scrunchie
a light snack hungry munchie
felt a funny hunch then she told him donkey punch me
tomorrow its father guido sarducci
father mc and charo coochie coochie
with her new best seller who you call a hoochie
a proud sponsor of the snoochie boochie noochies
look leela eyeball to eyeballs
and find out how to get inside them sugar pie walls
our next guest a real cutie specimen
and shes startin to get a little booty miss judy jetson
so judy boxers briefs or fig leaf
as you know i wear my boxers so my big
oh cue the rapper tell him bring what little he got
up against the villy its really not diddlysquat
until they head hurts when it come to wreck
crews is like them dudes in red shirts off star trek
he kirk he spock he mccoy
been b boy since you jerks first squeezed toys
born to be the host with the most
when its on its on space hos coast to coastyou might also like1embed"
