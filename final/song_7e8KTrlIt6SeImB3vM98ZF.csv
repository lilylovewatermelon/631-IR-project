when its dark and the sky is pouring acid like a fountain
and the memories like coal dust stain the window of my eyes
so ask them no more questions they cant sell you no more lies
i hear voices all around me in societys depression
over and over they recite their first impression
and the rivers are all crying but the ocean cannot speak
til her waters crash into uncharted shores so dark and bleak

how i wish somebodyd make them voices go away
seems theyre always talking but they aint got much to say
a pictures worth a thousand words but a word aint worth a dime
we all know theyll go on talking til the end of time

dont call it a sign of the times when its always been this way
forked tongues and voices behind curtains with no name
well they plot their wicked schemes setting fate for all mankind
with evil that can fill gods pretty skies with clouds that burn and blind

how i wish somebodyd make them voices go away
seems theyre always talking but they aint got much to say
a pictures worth a thousand words but a word aint worth a dime
we all know theyll go on talking til the end of timeyou might also like3embed"
