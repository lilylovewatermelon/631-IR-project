mr sandman showing his beam
when he walks into the room the walls lean in to listen
surfedout brain waves flick back and forth
like old headlights sniffing model glue again
head like a steel trap wish i didnt i didnt
i didnt i didnt i didnt i didnt i didnt i dont
just want to be a footnote
in someone elses happiness

prechorus
does your husband know the way that
the sunshine gleams from your wedding band
does he know the way does he know the way
of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night

chorus
but i will never end up like him
behind my back i already am
keep a calendar this way you will always know
the last time you came through
oh darling i know what youre goin through
the last time you came through
oh darling oh darling oh darling

verse 2

and does your husband know the way
that the sunshine gleams from your wedding band

chorus
