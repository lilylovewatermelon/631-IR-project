darling it seems like the whole worlds just turning so fast
everythings changing and were just trying to keep up
but weve got something special here
something worth waiting for
yeah were right on the edge of falling
falling in love

chorus
no rush no rush aint this world turning baby
fast enough
lets slow it on down to just the two of us
no rush

verse 2
walking walking and talking talking
dreaming with you wondering wondering
and tell me baby ive been wondering
are you feeling it too
