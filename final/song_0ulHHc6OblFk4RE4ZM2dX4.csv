i come from the bottom
i aint ever had the upper hand
i will put it all on the line
i have no other plan
i am at war with myself
do you really understand
would you love me if you really knew just how fucked up i am
some days i wonder if i disappear would anybody care
some days i wish that somebody was here but theres nobody there
ask me where id rather be than here ill say anywhere
i just roll another stick of gas and put it in the air
come on lets have a conversation ill show you how pain feels
i can take you to a place where everyones on pain pills
and the kind of pain we feel is something pills cant heal
you wont feel me if you aint never struggled to pay bills
lord strike me dead if im lying
been in the belly of the beast
went head to head with the lion
ever heard a baby cryin cause its hungry and its tired
ever seen a single mother that struggles to buy diapers

hook jelly roll
sit alone in a dark room
sayin prayers to the lord

verse 2 brianna harness
does a stars light die if theres no one looking
a recipe for disaster my demons are cooking
drink of regret ive been left by some car keys
celebrate my pay with my name on the markings

hook jelly roll
sit alone in a dark room
sayin prayers to the lord
i keep seein the signals
but dont know what theyre for
in my mind im a prisoner
sittin on death row
i keep hearin the whispers
sayin dont let go

posthook brianna harness
if i said im afraid
would you love me
would you love me
if i showed you my pain
would you love me
would you love me
hook jelly roll and brianna harness
sit alone in a dark room sit alone in a dark room
sayin prayers to the lord sayin prayers to the lord
i keep seein the signals i keep seein the signals
but dont know what theyre for but dont know what theyre for
in my mind im a prisoner in my mind im a prisoner
sittin on death row sittin on death row
i keep hearin the whispers i keep hearin the whispers
