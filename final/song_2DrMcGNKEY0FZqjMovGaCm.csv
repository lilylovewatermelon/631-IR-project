nothin ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them
sometimes i wonder why this is happenin
its like nothin i could do will distract me when
i think of how i shot myself in the back again
cause from the infinite words i could say
i put all the pain you gave to me on display
but didnt realize instead of settin it free
i took what i hated and made it a part of me

prechorus mike shinoda
never goes away
never goes away

chorus chester bennington
and now youve become a part of me youll always be right here
youve become a part of me youll always be my fear
i cant separate myself from what ive done
giving up a part of me ive let myself become you

verse 2 mike shinoda
hearin your name the memories come back again
i remember when it started happenin
id see you in every thought i had and then
the thoughts slowly found words attached to them
and i knew as they escaped away
i was committin myself to em and every day
i regret sayin those things cause now i see that i
took what i hated and made it a part of me
