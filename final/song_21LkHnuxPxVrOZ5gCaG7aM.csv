she said how could you joke at a time like this
i know why cause this is what you wanted all along now isnt it
i think that all you ever really ever wanted was a reason to complain
that never stopped you before dont let it get in your way
those are her words not mine
as far as im concerned we couldve had a good time
so if you walk out that door in disgust
i guess theres nothing more to discuss

chorus
birds dont sing they just fall from the sky
girls dont call and they never tell you why
thats just how they say goodbye
goodbye

samples from dangerously yours
over and over again
well umyes
youd do that to a woman
you dont sound a little sick to me

verse 2
dont listen to my music dont lie in my bed
dont listen to the references to things that you might have actually said
cause those are my words not yours
as far as im concerned it could have been a lot worse
i wasnt trying to avoid the confrontation
she isn’t crying she’s just making conversation

birds dont sing they just fall from the sky
girls dont call and they never tell you why
thats just how they say goodbye
goodbye
