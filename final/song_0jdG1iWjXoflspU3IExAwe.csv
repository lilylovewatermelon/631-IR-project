uh
everybody know juicy always turnt up
tour bus smoked out everybody purped up
ninetofive grind and got the whole hood worked up
aint getting money then you better get your work up
pull up in a porsche drunk backseat chauffeur
taylor gang in here everybody know us
hundred bottles and theres more coming
same shit tomorrow night all i know is stunting
twenty shots of jager i dont do chasers
white boy wasted smoking out the vaper
party with your girl sweating out my pores
becky so good i had to thank the lord
she won my heart in the club she go hard
shake her ass and titties i threw my card

no changing us
ball so hard its not a game to us
pull up in the club throwing taylors up
spending cause money aint a thing to us
but for the famous stuff
i wasnt the one to play with
party all night getting drunk and ragin
ball so hard i think im gon be sick
wake up roll a joint and do it all again
yeah i like to party
got a cute face and i like your body
you leave sober and you might be sorry
pour another shot then light the marley
and what goes down dont bring it up
tell them broke niggas they can hang it up
take six shots feels like were dying
hit this once feels like youre flying
