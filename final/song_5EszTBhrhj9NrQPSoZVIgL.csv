i get high out the window
and i dont tell my mom
i mix you with my vodka
and it turns me on

chorus
theres a hole in my heart and i cant find the bullet
but you sleep with the firearm
i shouldve pulled it on you
what a shame i can see it all
now that were through

verse 2
i get drunk with my friends
your name never comes up
i tell strangers online
that we broke up

chorus
theres a hole in my heart and i hate that its there
cause i liked to act like i really dont care
but i do
what a shame that i put up with you

bridge
what a joke was it all just an act
i hate that it took me so long to react
you had me convinced that you loved me
what a fucked up reality show
was it fame or the lack thereof
i just dont know
you had me convinced that you loved me oh
you might also likeverse 3
im not sure you realize
the pain that you caused
i dont feel like talking
but everyone else does

chorus
theres a hole in my heart and i cant find the bullet
but you sleep with the firearm
i shouldve pulled it on you
now i dont have the energy to1embed"
