if i aint got nothing i got you
if i aint got something i dont give a damn
cause i got it with you
i dont know much about algebra
but i know one plus one equals two
and its me and you
thats all well have when the world is through

prechorus
cause baby we aint got nothing without love
darling you got enough for the both of us
so come on baby

make love to me when my days look low
pull me in close and dont let me go
make love to me so when the worlds at war
let our love heal us all right now baby
