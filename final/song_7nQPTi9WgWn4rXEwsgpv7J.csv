verse 2
oh im so happy that im living my life
i never knew what i went through but hoped everythingd turn out right
im remembering the days that i was holding my head down
when people came around i always pretended to smile
but i knew deep in my heart
that i was slowly falling apart
some days all i wanted was to hold my mothers hand
and hear her say baby youre gonna make it
over and over again

and im so glad so glad i made it this far
and nothing gonna bring me back down
and nothing gonna turn me around

dont want nobody to think it was easy for me
it took a while just to get down and too many people just didnt believe
im remembering the sacrifices that i had to make
i would cry myself to sleep and say that it would be okay
but i knew that if i prayed
that i would be on my way someday
sometimes all i wanted was to hear my father say
he would say baby youre gonna make it and i dont care what people say
so i

chorus

and nothing gonna turn me around turn me around
and i been living my life for quite some time oh
and im so glad so glad i made it this far
and nothing gonna bring me back down
and nothing gonna turn me around
