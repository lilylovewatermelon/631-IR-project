haha
ooh im back back the fog is lifted
the earth has shifted and raise the gifted
you knew id be back so pack your bone
and hit the road jack because daddys home
wit the funky hot grits thick like al rocker
pumping out hits getting chips like oprah
bitch i told ya do not hate
or question the music i make ugh

chorus
i make punk rock and i mix it wit the hiphop
i get you higher than a tree top
you want to roll wit the kid rock yeeaah
i make southern rock and i mix it wit the hiphop
got money like fort knox ill forever be the kid rock
forever

verse 2
the junkys are still cigar smoking
still the same cause i aint change nutting
huffing and puffing i got two rookies
all in check doing the redneck boogie
the king is back to retract the wack
repack my sack wit the double fat back
forget all that im still singing yeeaah
and like kids on monkey bars im still swingingg
thought i got dusty thought id get rusty
thought id get rich and quit oh he must be
fat and ugly broke black and blue
but im trim fit rich and back for round two
red white and the pabst blue ribbon
dead right thats how im living
giving you more that the fauds and fakes
they cant make the kinda music i make ehhuh
see kid rock liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
i make punk rock and i mix it wit the hiphop
i get you higher than a tree top
you want to roll wit the kid rock yeeaah
i make southern rock and i mix it wit the hiphop
got money like fort knox ill forever be the kid rock
forever

verse 3
the black cat is back in original form
the legible credible inevitable storm
way past the normal still misbehaving
finger in the air and the flag still waving
dont come dont test the boss
because i got this sewn like betsy ross
you can floss and front you can taunt and tease
but you cant fuck wit rhymes like these
thumping like a drum kit wit wrists that slit picks
bumping for the kids who twist splif and sips fifth
i got the gift im about to unravel
eight ball side pocket eight ball in my jacket
pussy and blow you know how i live
you cant say that kid fuck off i just did
watch me twirl the earl the pearl
or just keep on kid rocking in the free world
chorus
punk rock and i mix it wit the hiphop
i get you higher than a tree top
you want to roll wit the kid rock yeeaah
i make southern rock and i mix it wit the hiphop
got money like fort knox ill forever be the kid rock
forever

outro
punk rock  forever hiphop  forever
tree top  forever kid rock yeahembed"
