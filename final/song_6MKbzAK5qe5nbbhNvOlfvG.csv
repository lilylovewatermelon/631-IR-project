driving my fist down deep inside it
oh yeah gonna take it to a whole new level
in spite of your bullshit baby
tasting sweet anxiety
breaking through another day
maybe i just dont care anymore
what you think of me

chorus
ill take it to the edge
ill take it to the other side
i hear it screaming
its coming alive
ill take it to the edge
ill take it to the other side
i feel it breathing
deep down inside
deep down inside

verse 2
tearing through shards of broken glass
oh yeah getting one step closer to the edge
and taking it all back baby
surging through my blackened veins
uncontrolled in a different way
i cant wait to get away
from everything

deep down inside
