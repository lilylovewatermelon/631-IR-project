the sun is filling up the room and i can hear you dreaming
do you feel the way i do right now
i wish we would just give up
cause the best part is falling call it anything but love

chorus
and i will make sure to keep my distance
say i love you when youre not listening
and how long can we keep this up up up

verse 2
please dont stand so close to me im having trouble breathing
im afraid of what youll see right now
ill give you everything i am
all my broken heartbeats until i know youll understand

chorus
and i will make sure to keep my distance
say i love you when youre not listening
and how long can we keep this up up up

bridge
and i keep waiting
for you to take me
you keep waiting
to save what we have

so ill make sure to keep my distance
say i love you when youre not listening
and how long can we keep this up up up

outro
make sure to keep my distance
say i love you when youre not listening
how long til we call this love love love11embed"
