do you like remember the stuff that you do with me
yes
okay i dont know cause youre so high or like you get really drunk so i dont know if you remember it
of course i do
okay
i cherish it
i burn other memories just to make room for those ones
that was four months ago that we were right here and i met you
thats not possible
like you just got my initials tattooed on you
i got your nickname tattooed on me
