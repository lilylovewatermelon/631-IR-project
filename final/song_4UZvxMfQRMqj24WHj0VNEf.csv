i been watching you get ready messing with your makeup fighting with your hair
six or seven outfits sayin how you dont got anything to wear
must be something wrong with your mirror like it aint reflecting right
cause girl from over here
you look perfect tonight

chorus
i wish you could see you like i do
hair down all wrapped up in my arms
if you saw you from my point of view
youd know how beautiful you are
sometimes i swear you must be blind
dont know how you aint got a clue
wish you could see it through my eyes
cause then you could see you like i do

verse 2
i could see you on a billboard beverly or sunset looking fine as hell
i could see you on the runway walking with your wings with gigi and giselle
but you aint gotta be in paris rockin some designer brand
baby anything youre wearing is gonna leave me sayin damn

chorus
wish you could see you like i do
hair down all wrapped up in my arms
if you saw you from my point of view
youd know how beautiful you are
sometimes i swear you must be blind
dont know how you aint got a clue
wish you could see it through my eyes
cause then you could see you like i do
