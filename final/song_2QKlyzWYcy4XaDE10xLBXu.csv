you warned me that you were gonna leave
i never thought you would really go
i was blind but baby now i see
broke your heart but now i know

prechorus
that i was bein such a fool
and that i didnt deserve you

chorus
i dont wanna fall asleep
cause i dont know if ill get up
and i dont wanna cause a scene
but im dyin without your love
begging to hear your voice
tell me you love me too
cause id rather just be alone
if i know that i cant have you

verse 2
lookin at the letter that you left
the letter that you left will i ever get you back
wondering if ill ever get you back
dreaming about when ill see you next
when will i see you next will i ever get you back
knowing that i never will forget
i wont forget i wont forget
