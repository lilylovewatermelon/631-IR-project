hello i’m dean stockton of eastern state university in america and i am prepared to offer you a full science scholarship
viktor used the college used its modern scientific equipment to conduct strange forbidden experiments

verse
somewheres out in copkiller queens
where bo deans stop limousines and niggas flee the scene
somebody on his back bleeding vest all cracked up
freeze clown officer down request for back up
listen dude dont get me misconstrued as a sniper
its v vaughn not to be confused with v la viper
or either peter parker or either peter piper
a seed the type to pee the diaper blame it on the wiper
its really not your concern why i got the knife sir
he suggest remain calm lets not get  no
slash his windpipe he had them type of eyes
he might be still alive how you get this thing to hyper drive
oh give my props to the shooter
prices at a all time low in the future
something like fourteen they must be on horse pills
ot and zerothree to reup on force fields
at that cost deal he plotted the coordinates
two thousand three winter time upper west side more or less
this thing be buggin like a celly frontin
who the hell is honey with the slug in her belly stuntin
you aint have to tell v nuthin
trust him it really aint no time for discussion
hed be back in 93 press of a button and they busted in
his first impulse was to smack the dirt
all four wore plain clothes and lumberjack shirt
recognize one face from school six degrees ago
hed snuff him in his braces just to switch the station to bgo
he kept a punch line every lunch break lunch time
and this is no time to pump fake its crunch time
the same split second they let off the toast
thats when he hit the speed dial and sped off ghost
i know those cats dont like v
and if they took my head off theyd get off most likely
and probably thought the time gizmo was my wallet
and hit the hills no forty more times on some foul shit
pick a crime he was out in the nick of time
to get paid another day and live to kick a sicker rhyme
for iller its like miller malt liquor time
up town finery where its probably not best to flaunt
everyones your best friend v steps into the restaurant
my friend he said you must be psychic
whats the price of fourteen it’s good you like it
huh be back tonight
the fourteen g pack was really packed tight
but back at the lab he found the sleestak was right
not only was it three cracks light but too white
the test show lactose anbesol lecithin
five types of aspirin and other kinds of medicines
next time ill bring my men who speak mexican
and let the techs spin make em contact the next of kin
the whole thing is mostly lactose lecithin
and some type of aspirin
anbesol medicine
damn mothafucka
lets go get em menyou might also like5embed"
