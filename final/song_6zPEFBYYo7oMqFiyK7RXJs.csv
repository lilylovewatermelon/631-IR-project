this one came from looking
this one opened twice
these two seem as smooth as silk
flush against my eyes
this one needed stitches and
this one came from rings
this one isnt even there
but i feel it more because you dont care

chorus
yeah cut right into me
yeah because i am made of scars
yes i am made of scars

verse 2
this one had it coming
this one found a vein
this one was an accident
but never gave me pain
this one was my fathers and
this one you cant see
this one had me scared to death
but i guess i should be glad im not dead

chorus
yeah cut right into me
yeah because i am made of scars
yes i am made of scars

god dont you believe the hype
god dont you believe the hype
god dont you believe the hype
no more dont believe the hype
and i will find a way
everything you are i will betray
oh i swear that i will find a way
everything you ares inside me

verse 3
this one was the first one
this one had a vice
this one here i like to rub
on dark and stormy nights
this one was the last one
i dont remember how
but i remember blood and rain
and i never saw it coming again

chorus
yeah cut right into me
yeah because i am made of scars
yes i am made of scars
yes i am made of scars
yes i am made of scars
outro
thats what im made ofembed"
