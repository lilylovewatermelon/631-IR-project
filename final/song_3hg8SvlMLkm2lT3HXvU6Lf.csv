chorus
i shot to the top just like im a rocket like im a rocket
i aint have a dollar inside of my pocket inside of my pocket
put that on my gang i swear i aint stoppin i aint stoppin
strapped up and im vest up im a astronaut kid
they say pain like meteorites
i got the world in my eyes
the chosen one i got the prize
i got my niggas on my side

verse 1
feel like i need some space im sippin on act in space
lot of blue money in the bank old hundreds in the case
im in a high speed chase on the way i cant be late
corvette lets do a race hope i see another day
sip drank thats every day gave a check to kk
you know i love you i was talkin to taytay
whenever you call me you know that im comin
get that backend and i stack up that money
up with that chopper you know ima dump it
i wont let a nigga take nothin from me
tell me your secret it stay on the under
i swear to god that i wont say nothin
just had sex with my baby mama
you better not tell my girl nothin
spent a half a mil and i aint go broke yet
spent eighty thousand dollars on a brand new vette
i told that ho she a dog ima take you to the vet
suck on your blood like a tick let her come suck on this dick
i dont give a fuck what they say im already rich
all my diamonds glist ten thousand on my bitch letâ€™s go

verse 2
diamonds for my bro these people would never know
everything that we been through that money did nothin but grow
got a styrofoam full of dope im in the ufo
got a penthouse full of hoes and they dont want to go
walk in the club and im strapped with that pole
laugh and i live it up with baby joe
im not from earth im from out of the globe
me and my niggas take over your turf
walkin on stage with nba merch
gone off the drank and i need me a nurse
blast off im a astronaut
came from nothin dont belong on earth

strapped up and im vest up im a astronaut kid
they say pain like meteorites
i got the world in my eyes
the chosen one i got the prize
