is that supposed to be your poker face
or was someone run over by a train
youre minding your own business
but youre begging for forgiveness just the same
and its running back and forth inside your mind
just how that town defined you
dressed you up painted on your face

chorus
and now youre leaving new york
for no better place

verse 2
youre awake and trying not to be
wrapped around your pillow like a prawn
the nighttimes wrapped around you
will be until it drops you on the dawn
from the c train to the shiny tower
kicked around till happy hour found you
where you can drink that smirk right off your face

chorus
and now youre leaving new york
for no better place

and here is your reflection
in a building uptown
a ghost inside some madison avenue display
like water under bridges
youre slowly passing by
so you sail between the rooftops and the sky

verse 3
the bourbon sits inside me
right now im a puppet in its sway
and it may be the whiskey talking
but the whiskey says i miss you every day
so i taxi to an allnight party
park me in the corner in an old chair
sip my drink and stare out into space

chorus
and now youre leaving new york
for no better place
and now youre leaving new york
for no better placeembed"
