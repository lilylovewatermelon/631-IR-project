can you see me
floating above your head
as you lay in bed
thinking about everything
that you did not do
cause saying i love you
has nothing to do with meaning it

verse 2
and i dont trust you
cause every time youre here
your intentions are unclear
i spend every hour waiting for a phone call
that i know will never come
i used to think you were the one
now im sick of thinking anything at all

chorus
you aint ever coming back to me
and thats not how things were supposed to be
you take my hand just to give it back
no other lover has ever done that

verse 3
do you remember the way we used to melt
do you remember how it felt when i touched you
oh cause i remember very well
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likebridge
and how long has it been
since someone you let in
has given what i gave to you
and at night when you sleep
do you dream i would be there
just for a minute or two do you

chorus
you aint ever coming back to me
thats not how things were supposed to be
you take my hand just to give it back
no other lover has ever done that

chorus
heartache heartache i just have so much
a simple love with a complex touch
and there is nothing you can say or do
i called to let you know im through with you
you aint ever coming back to me
and thats not how things were supposed to be
you take my hand just to give it back
no other lover has ever done that
heartache heartache i just have so much
a simple love with a complex touch
and there is nothing you can say or do
i called to let you know im through
i called to let you know im through
i called to let you know im through with you
outro
i aint ever coming back to youembed"
