ive seen that darkness on the edge of town
the sun comes up and the rain fall down
and ive been a fool yeah ive been around
and when the world got too much for me
i took off and left a memory
thinking id find something better for me somehow
oh but now

chorus
whenever i run
instead of running into the blue
i follow my heart
and there in your arms
is where i find the love i need
and the best is yet to come
baby youre the one i run to

interlude
i used to quit when it got too tough
throw in my cards when i was down on my luck
but baby you mean too much to me
so now

chorus
whenever i run
instead of running into the blue
i follow my heart
and there in your arms
is where i find the love i need
and the best is yet to come
baby youre the one i run to

i never could stay in one place too long
i never could stand that still
ah but you changed so much in me
and now i know i will
im going to stay where the love is right
im so tired of being a bird in flight
good love takes work
ah but thats alright
thats alright

chorus
whenever i run
instead of running into the blue
i follow my heart
and there in your arms
is where i find the love i need
and the best is yet to come
baby youre the one i run to

outro
instead of running into the blue
i follow my heart
and there in your arms
thats where i find the love i need
and the best is yet to come
baby youre the one i run to
the one i run to
the one i run toembed"
