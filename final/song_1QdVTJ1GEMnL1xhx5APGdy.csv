threes a crowd one mores a fight
four good ways to wreck your life
guitars whiskey guns and knives

before i got this martin box
before i put my guns in hock
every night was on the rocks
before i got this martin box

guitars whiskey guns and knives
threes a crowd one mores a fight
four good ways to wreck your life
guitars whiskey guns and knives

a shot of brown and a glass of ice
will loosen up your fingers nice
songs that give the girls a thrill
son thats a kind can get you killed

guitars whiskey guns and knives
threes a crowd one mores a fight
four good ways to wreck your life
guitars whiskey guns and knives

well guitars whiskey guns and knives
threes a crowd one mores a fight
four good ways to wreck your life
