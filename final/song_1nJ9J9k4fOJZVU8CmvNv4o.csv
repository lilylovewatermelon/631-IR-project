i know my way to your place
like the back of my hand
theres a key on this chain
thatll spin your lock and let me in
and im thinkin bout us again
im thinkin bout cavin in when

chorus
i should stop right now and go back home
turn on that tv stare at the wall and just sleep alone
never turn down your block
i know i need to not
get too close cause you know that ill cross that line
you say you miss me your kiss hits me one more time
dont wanna give us one more shot
i know i need to not
i need to not i need to not

red light means im two turns from your street
the one goin off in my head
