i talk about twitter with almost the same affection as i talk about my children it’s had that much of an impact on my life since i started using it to reach out to customers in 2007 as an extrovert who can get to know a room full of people in just a few hours i felt at home in twitter’s 140word cocktail party environment it was the platform that came most naturally to me because it was perfectly suited for small bursts of quickfire conversation and idea exchanges if the only platformi’d had at my disposal in 2006 when i first started trying to story tell about my family business wine library had demanded longform writing like a magazine column or a written blog the business would not be what it is today twitter’s restrictions played directly to my strengths i owe it my career

yet discussing twitter poses a problem for a book dedicated to improving social media content because on this platform and this platform alone content often has far less value than context how can i say that when twitter is one of this generation’s primary sources for news and information because with few exceptions like the microcontent gold that is grumpy cat a brand’s success on twitter is rarely predicated on the actual content it produces rather it correlates with how much valuable context you add to the content—your own and that produced by others

before i explain it’s necessary to acknowledge that at the time of this writing there are changes afoot at twitter until now thanks to its origins as a mobile textmessaging service the beauty of twitter has been its simplicity—two or three lines of text a link and maybe a hashtag but in late 2012 the company bought vine the sixsecond looping video service and innovations such as twitter cards now allows people to attach photos videos and music directly to their tweets thus incorporating the advantages of other more visually exciting platforms like facebook and pinterest these visual enhancements will pave the way for businesses to deliver content in ways that are fresh and unique to twitter for example you could tweet out a puzzle piece and announce that if one thousand people retweet it you’ll tweet another piece of the puzzle once all the pieces are tweeted the puzzle would reveal where people could go to get a twentyfive dollar gift certificate it will be fun to explore new ways to creatively execute jabs and right hooks in such a mobile friendly colorful medium

but that’s all still in the works and i’m not even sure the facebookification of twitter will make that much difference to those brands who haven’t already gained traction there because the additional bells and whistles won’t force marketers to change how they actually use the platform hopefully this chapter will though

the main mistake most marketers make is to use twitter primarily as an extension of their blog a place to push a link to content they have posted elsewhere they’ll also often use it as a place to brag especially by retweeting favorable things people say about them there is a time and place for both of these types of right hooks but not to the extent that most companies rely on them twitter primarily rewards people who listen and give not those who ask and take much of the time to read a twitter feed is to read a mind numbing number of right hooks yet if there has ever been a platform where engagement and community management have power it’s this one there’s a lot of talking and selling on twitter but not enough engagement and that’s a travesty because twitter is the cocktail party of the internet—a place where listening well  has tremendous benefits

spin your story
if facebook’s main currency is friendship twitter’s is news and information go on twitter and you’ll see eightyfive people and brands at one time announcing that brangelina is pregnant again or there’s been another tornado in oklahoma anyone can present news and on their own your tweets about your product or service are tiny drops in the deluge of information that hits people when they come to the site the only way to differentiate yourself and pique people’s interest through your unique context breaking out on twitter isn’t about breaking the news or spreading information—it’s about dj’ing it news has little value on its own but the marketer that can skillfully spin interpret and remix it in his or her own signature style can often tell a story that is more powerful and memorable than the actual news itself

for example if you’re a movie theater in minneapolis you could tweet “just in—a great review of bradley cooper’s newest movie from the star tribune” this is a common way to tweet—a little content a link to a website and you’re done but what if you put a little more than the bare minimum of effort into that jab  what if instead of offering the boring facts you offered something fresh how much more interesting would it be if you tweeted “the star tribune has lost its mind this movie stinks” and then add the link now that jab has some muscle behind it is it possible that panning something you sell will hurt sales on wine library tv i gave poor reviews to plenty of wines that were on sale in my store and all it did was give people more reason to trust me but if you were that worried about it you could turn your negative review into a positive opportunity with a tweet like “the star tribune loves the new bradley cooper thriller we think this movie stinks read watch debate” you’d then link to your blog where you would not only have a copy of the review but information on where and when your movie club meets every month that’s a terrific right hook you’ve now positioned yourself as the opinionated provocative movie theater that offers a unique filmwatching experience and that’s a story that people will be interested in following

today entertainment and escapism are prized above almost anything else consumers want infotainment not information information is cheap and plentiful information wrapped in a story however is special brands need to storytell around their content to make it enticing not just put it out for passive consumption like a boring platter of cubed cheese
expand your universe
make a statement stake out a position establish a voice—this is how you successfully jab your twitter followers but what about all those people who have never heard of you how are you jabbing them

other than the easy mobile experience it offers twitter stands in a class apart from other social media because of the open invitation it gives us to talk to the world at large on facebook tumblr or instagram you have only two options if you want to meet new fans and potential customers first someone might find you offline through a class a book an ad or a brickandmortar store and decide to follow you second a customer might share a piece of your content and his or her friend might see it and become intrigued enough to follow you either way you’re stuck waiting outside until that person decides to let you in even facebook’s search engine open graph only allows you access to stories and conversations that have been publicly shared everyone else is off limits
twitter users however have an opendoor policy except for a very limited number of private profiles—they use the platform knowing their tweets are public in fact that’s the draw people on twitter are looking for attention they welcome the spontaneous conversations that can ensue from a tweet strangers from around the world many of whom will never meet in person have been able to build robust online communities based on nothing more than a mutually shared interest in seahorses or marmalade and people love how twitter has allowed companies to enhance their customer service if they want to get any brand’s attention all they have to do is mention its name and they’ll get a response because that brand is out there using twitter to help it communicate with its customers and build community

actually that last bit is wishful thinking many companies are still only halfheartedly paying attention to the online conversations people have about them thus relinquishing control over how their brand is perceived and allowing the competition to step in and shape the conversation in its favor fortunately there’s a book available that offers detailed explanations of why and how twitter can be one of a business’s most powerful customer service tool it’s my last book the thank you economy read it it’s good

all half kidding aside twitter is a marketer’s dream come true because it allows you to initiate a relationship with your customer it’s still the only platform where you can jump into a conversation unannounced and no one thinks you’re a stalker here you don’t have to wait for anyone to give you permission to show how much you care at any time you can use the powerful twitter search engine to find people who are talking about topics related to your business even if only tangentially and respond adding your perspective and humor—and context to the conversation

it wouldn’t take much imagination for an office furniture retailer to engage with people who mention the company name or words like “work” “employee” “employer” “office” “desk” “printer” “scanner” and other officerelated terms think of all the interesting ways it could engage with people with these words on their mind however “deadline” “backache” “fluorescent” “happy hour” “raise” “promotion” “weekend” “swivel” or “clutter”

using twittersearch this way helps you find storytelling opportunities with people who either already know about you or who have expressed interest in topics related to your product or service but what about all those consumers out there that would love you if they only knew you existed twitter makes it possible to reach them too you just have to know how to ride the cultural zeitgeist

trendjacking
in this chatty 247 online culture there is no better resource than twitter trends for creating the realtime context as well as the uptodate content so imperative to staying relevant twitter’s trend tracking ability is one of social media’s most powerful yet underused tools you can set your account to track worldwide national or even regional trends  learning to jab with trends gives you tremendous power you can tailor content to any situation or demographic you can spark interest in your product or service among people outside your core group of followers and you can scale your caring best of all you can piggyback on other people’s content giving you a reprieve from having to think up fresh creative day after day you’ll still put out original content but in this case your content is the context you use to tell your story

the night before i began writing this chapter the television show 30 rock aired its series finale when i went to twitter the next day as i expected there it was in the list of top ten trending topics for the us it seemed to me that if consumers felt like talking about 30 rock marketers should be scrambling to tell their story within the context of 30 rock too could talking about a defunct television show really help you sell more candy crowbars or cheese puffs it could if you’re creative enough if you were a brand trying to ride the 30 rock wave the trick would be to look for the unexpected connections not the obvious ones here’s one seven the show aired for seven years has your company been in business for seven years do you hope to do something for seven years do you have seven in your company name one brand does 7 for all mankind maker of premium denim clothing—sometimes nicknamed “sevens”—often worn by hollywood celebrities curious to see how the brand capitalized on the twittersphere’s free gift to their marketing department i decided to check out their recent tweets

a look on the 7 for all mankind 7fam twitter page the day after the end of 30 rock revealed some light customer engagement—which is more than some companies manage so kudos to them—a number of retweets sharing the nice things people have said about them or their clothing line—not so great because that’s bragging and too many brands are doing itand a stream of traditional right hooks such as “love a good leather tee” with a link to their product page but nowhere was there any indication that the brand had a clue about what was going on outside the world of fashion it was a little ironicis there any other industry that lives for trends like fashion one of the most successful television shows of the decade just finished a sevenyear run and 7 for all mankind didn’t even mention it what a waste they can talk to denim lovers every day but on this day they had a perfect opportunity to tell their story to people who weren’t even thinking about denim and they let it pass more distressingly they seem to be letting all of these opportunities go by they didn’t just opt not to ride 30 rock their twitter stream revealed that they weren’t riding any news or current events except the ones they created themselves through sweepstakes giveaways and sales

7 for all mankind is a booming company that sells a great product or it wouldn’t have the cult following it has garnered in the decade it’s been in business and although its twitter profile is lacking in cultural relevance the brand does make a serious effort to engage with its followers and stay on top of the conversation around its product but that’s twitter 101 2008 by now they should be doing much much more it’s fortunate that the company is such a fashion powerhouse which is also why i thought they could handle a little constructive criticism if it were smaller and just starting out a habit of ignoring all the opportunities to tell its story outside the parameters of denim or fashion could hurt it consumers don’t live in a fashion bubble why should a clothing company

promoted tweets
creating context around trending hashtags only requires an investment of time but buying a promoted tweet can be a great investment too on the same day that 30 rock trended so did gored because the american heart association sponsored national wear red day to raise awareness around the fight against heart disease above the hashtag there was an ad for tide laundry detergent saying “it’s crazy how tide gets rid of tough stains but what about the stains you want to save” aha color with gored tide saw an opportunity to bring attention to its color saving capabilities that’s a clever use of a hashtag it was micro it was inexpensive and it made an impression think about that consumers are spending ten percent of their time on mobile and there is no more mobile platform than twitter yet for all the consumer attention twitter attracts placing an ad there still only costs lunch money compared to the price of a television ad that was a smart use of tide’s media dollars so many companies could have taken advantage of that opportunity where was crayola what about target with its big red bullseye or red envelope
using trends to throw right hooks
trending topics can be names or current events but they can also be memes—words and phrases that have gone viral in the public sphere these are low hanging fruit perfect storytelling fodder for any brand or business especially local companies looking for a fun creative way to differentiate themselves from their competitor

on one of the days i was working on this chapter the fifth trending topic on twitter was sometimesyouhaveto you can’t get a better leadin for a right hook literally anyone could adapt it to his or her needs

a cheese shop could say “sometimesyouhaveto eat a slice of cabot clothbound cheddar”

a fitness club could say “sometimesyouhaveto use the sauna as incentive”

a lawyer could say “sometimesyouhaveto call a lawyer to make your problem go away”

taking advantage of hashtags is a great way for small businesses to get attention that trending hashtag is getting clicked by tens of thousands of people there is no reason why someone won’t spot your version like it and go to your profile page to see what else you have to say once he’s there he can see the whole story you’ve been telling about yourself with your steady stream of jabs and occasional right hooks he decides to follow you maybe he needs a lawyer maybe he has reason to believe that one day he will need a lawyer regardless you are now that much closer to gaining a new customer when the time is right

it could happen for a dj in miami named dj monte carlo while i was clicking on this trending hashtag i spotted his tweet “sometimesyouhaveto forgive those who hurt you but never forget what it taught you”

i liked that it hit my emotional center i decided to follow him and he wound up in my twitter steam where my colleague sam could see it i’m not a big club goer but sam is maybe sam decided to follow dj monte carlo too and maybe in six months sam will be scrolling through his twitter feed and he’ll see monte carlo throw a right hook announcing that he’s spinning at a club in new york city that night and maybe sam will decide to go too

get it this is not a farfetched scenario it’s how twitter culture works every day so get creative have fun and start experimenting with creating content on the spot because the trending topics you see one minute will be gone the next they have short life spans

something else to realize is that just because a topic is not one of the top ten trends on twitter doesn’t mean it’s not worth paying attention to the twitter demographic skews hip and urban but it doesn’t represent the only people talking online you want to pay attention to what the rest of the world is interested in too look for clues on google trends it skews young as well just like all online data but it reflects a broader population during the 2013 us open golf tournament the hashtag usopen was unsurprisingly trending on twitter in response kpmg mickelson the “official twitter account for phil mickelson’s hat” promoted a tweet to followers of the hashtag suggesting that golf fans honor their dads on father’s day by donating to a charitable antiilliteracy campaign by buying a blue phil michelson hat kpmg michelson didnt actually use the hashtag usopen in fact if theyre not an official event sponsor their legal department may not have let them use the hashtag and yet through strategic sponsoring they came up as the top result for anyone checking that hashtag they were smart about the hashtag they did use toofathersday

this example shows that kpmg mickelson did something too many businesses don’t do on twitter they listened it’s extremely hard to create a trending hashtag and bring people to you it’s far better to listen find out whats trending and bring yourself to the people in this case golf fans were already having the conversation promoting the tweet ensured that kpmg michelson’s message became part of that conversation it was doubly smart to include it in the father’s day stream as well

this praise comes with two caveats

1 amazingly even while kpmg michelson correctly joined trending conversations they also unnecessarily included the hashtag philsbluehat in their tweet how did their own invented hashtag do
a total of three people used it in the three days following kpmg’s original tweet that’s embarrassing

2 the link in the tweet doesnt actually take consumers to make a purchase it goes to kpmg’s  phil’s blue hat website where it takes yet another click to buy the hat adding extra steps after a call to action wastes the consumer’s time

whether you jab or right hook marketing moves like that prove that you’re uptodate that you’ve got a sense of humor and most of all that you’re paying attention you’d be amazed at how far that goes when customers are looking for someone with whom to do business

choose hashtags carefully
there’s a skill to choosing hashtags you can’t just cover all your bases by tacking a bunch of hashtags on to a sentence they won’t work if they don’t feel native to twitter and natural to your brand for example twitter is a hotbed of irony but if your natural tone is generally serious and thoughtful going ironic with your hashtags or suddenly adopting hipster vocabulary is just going to make you look like a poser being cool has nothing to do with age it has to do with how solid your identity is do not pretend to be anyone other than you are that said don’t take yourself too seriously either be human if you’re not comfortable talking pop culture find someone in your organization or partner with an agency that is whatever you do however stay true to yourself do not pretend to be cooler than you are do not be the guy who hollered out “raise the roof” a year too late that’s how it sounds when you use hashtags and trending topics as indiscriminate marketing tactics instead of incorporating select ones into your conversation listen entertain through humor or provocation

entrepreneurs and small businesses may see the amount of work that has to go into keeping up on twitter and wonder if they shouldn’t just give up and go home there’s no way they can compete with larger companies that have extensive budgets and staff a person has to sleep sometime yes creating realtime micro content is an enormous job yes startups and small businesses will have to be selective about which trends are worth their time and money but putting your effort into that kind of thinking will do a heck of a lot more for your bottom line than sitting around like a dope waiting for customers to come to you and it’s way better than tweeting content that no one sees or cares about

as a small business you can gain an edge over larger companies when it comes to being nimble and authentic two imperatives to successful twitter marketing because you haven’t let your personality get squashed by a pr or legal department you have more freedom to say what you think to look for humor in unexpected places and to be selfdeprecating that last one works like a charm i just admitted in an interview for inc magazine that i peed in my bed until i was twelve years old can you imagine anyone in a fortune 500 company getting that personal or irreverent neither can i people love it when you acknowledge your humanity and vulnerability you may be a lightweight up against a heavyweight but you can be the lightweight who wakes up at 3 am drinks a few raw eggs and puts in two hours at the gym before the competition’s alarm clock goes off people will notice your effort and it will make a difference

scaling the unscaleable
to see what that kind of effort looks like take a look at the conversation levi lentz had with green mountain coffee full disclosure green mountain coffee is a vaynermedia client green mountain coffee was poking its nose far beyond its comfortable coffee burrow or it never would have seen lentz’s tweet all lentz tweeted was ’say hey’ by michael franti is one of my favorite songs”

to his surprise he received a reply from the verified green mountain coffee twitter account saying “we love that song isn’t it motivational”

on the surface there is no connection between the topic of coffee and the bouncy love song lentz was listening to green mountain’s jab is pure storytelling context—we’re a brand that likes the same music you do now what lentz didn’t know was that michael franti was working on a fair trade campaign with green mountain coffee so there was in fact a reason why green mountain was so interested in engaging with his tweet however the fact that he wasn’t weirded out by the fact that a brand would contact him to talk about music proves how receptive people are to brands that reach out to consumers

coffee was not mentioned until lentz brought it up politely telling green mountain that he was just learning to like coffee so he had never tried their product but that he would definitely do so now green mountain made some inquiries into his coffee tastes and followed up with a few recommendations the conversation ended with green mountain asking lentz to dm his mailing address so they could send him a michael franti cd just because

lentz knew he was being marketed to but he didn’t care out of the blue a brand had struck up an engaging conversation given him some information he was looking for and offered to send him a gift of course he wrote about it on his blog then he wrote about it again a few days later when he received the cd in the mail as well as another package containing a handwritten thankyou note for writing about the company on his blog a coffee mug and a sample of coffee

by watching out for opportunities to introduce itself green mountain coffee garnered extensive earned media and gained a lifelong customer by being personable charming generous and above all real with a perfect stranger like any good matchmaker knows when two people are reticent to meet you sometimes need to find a way to firmly nudge them into the same room so they can realize how compatible they are with one another for those companies who learn to spin compelling stories from the threads of news and information floating through the twittersphere this social media platform is the most indefatigable consumertobrand connector that ever existed


color commentary

lacoste

lacoste is a brand with a tremendous amount of staying power i loved lacoste’s alligator on my shirts when i was a little kid and recently i’ve rediscovered the brand and started wearing it again reinventing yourself to your fans is no small feat so kudos to lacoste for pulling it off unfortunately that’s the only praise they’re going to get from me because below is one of the worst examples of a poorly thrown right hook in this book it’s laughably bad i know this because i laughed my face off when i saw it

•treats the consumer like an idiot in the text lacoste asks “if you could do one thing today what would it be” that’s a great way to invite fans to engage in a parallel universe fans are posting comments like “sleep” “ride a paddle boat” “travel to mars” promote whirled peas” and in all likelihood “shop”—which would be an ideal moment for the brand to respond directly to that consumer and build a relationship  it would be a great opportunity for the brand to show off the personality of its fans which in turn should reflect favorably on its own persona but in this universe where someone at lacoste isn’t thinking the brand halts the conversation before it even starts by answering its own question  it’s as if lacoste didn’t trust that its fans would answer the way it wanted them to remember it’s “give give give give give…ask” not “give give give give give…demand”

•pointless link like zara mentioned in the facebook chapter lacoste seems to think that its website should be the hub of all its media outreach if there’s anything that brands should take away from this book it’s that there is no central hub anymore consumers are going to be coming through all kinds of portals and forcing them to enter through the same door every time is going to make them tire of you when customers click on this twitter link they’re not taken to a special sale or even a promotion for the seasonal trends they’re just taken straight to the general website which at the time of this writing features a blankfaced preteen

lacoste has over 370000 followers at the time of this writing of those followers two saw fit to retweet this post the link itself only received eightyeight clicks that’s as bad as it gets it’s posts like this that are responsible for all the pointless noise on twitter that makes it harder for the great content to get noticed i can’t even bring myself to say “see you later alligator” because if i see more of these kind of tweets later i may abandon the brand altogether

dunkin’ donuts

this is a charming lightweight jab to sell iced coffee the copy is the appropriate length the tone is right and the image is clever but i have to question why the creatives at dunkin’ donuts decided to turn their iced coffee cup into a midcentury relic

anachronistic image they would have come across as a much more modern brand if they had depicted the cup with an iphone charger coming out of it instead of a twopronged plug that could belong to an elderly uncle’s bedside table lamp it’s possible that dunkin’ donuts purposely used an oldfashioned plug to speak to the older demographic that frequents its stores but if that’s the case they’re speaking the right language in the wrong country because the demographic that grew up living in twopronged plug homes doesn’t have a particularly strong showing on twitter threepronged grounded outlets became a required safety feature for new homes in the early 1960s if it is possible for “who is paul mccartney” to be a trending topic on twitter during the 2012 grammys then it is equally possible that half the audience that follows dunkin’ donuts on twitter might not know what the heck that thing is sticking out of the cup

one more criticism the tweet is signed “jg” i understand that dunkin’ donuts is trying to humanize their brand but this is the wrong way to do it no one except celebrities should be signing their tweets you’re putting your business at risk when you let anyone except your logo or brand build equity on these public platforms what happens when jg moves on to starbucks or mcdonald’s and people start asking “hey where’s jg” your brand needs a unified front and voice this doesn’t mean you don’t appreciate the efforts of the people who work for you it means that you have to ensure that everyone is working to build up your brand equity not their own

adidas

this adidas originals right hook is tremendous yeah the shoes are kind of whack but… i love where adidas went with this for a few reasons

cool picture they used a terrific picture of their product clean but exploding with vibrant color it’s the kind of picture that will make a consumer scrolling through their stream stop in his tracks and take the right hook

correct tonethe copy is strong and builds up the story it’s written in the voice of the brand and target demo even when they hit with the direct right hook “get ‘em here” often brands will write their copy with all the right slang and swag for a strong delivery but when they go for the formal ask that right hook they switch to more formal corporatespeak “you can buy them here” i love how adidas carried the appropriate tone all the way through the right hook with “get ‘em here” then they got right to the point linking straight to the product page not their home page or some other secondary page that would have required more hunting and clicking

you want to be gentle and subtle when you’re jabbing but when it’s time to ask for business go for it don’t be bashful own it

good job adidas very very very well executed

hollister

this is a really interesting case study because it represents a lot of smart strategy and a lot of awful execution all in one place

brave creative hollister deserves credit for understanding the power of internet memes to reach a young demographic in response to the huge popularity of planking—choosing a random location in which to lie face flat on the ground with your arms at your side—and its little brother owling—choosing a random location in which to perch like you guessed it an owl—hollister decided to try to spawn a movement toward “guarding”—holding your hands up in front of your eyes like you’re holding binoculars they went for a big right hook in asking their community to tag and engage with their meme it’s a bold move the problem is though that it’s ridiculously hard for a brand to create a meme it’s not a particularly authentic move and consumers don’t tend to follow it in general brands should be following memes not creating them but hollister tried which is admirable

clumsy hashtag where they really went wrong is in choosing their hashtag at the time that i first reviewed this tweet a click on guarding showed that security guards use it and so do sixteenyear old basketball players hollister doesn’t own the “guarding” concept and so they should have chosen a more distinct hashtag to bring attention to the meme

busy visuals then there’s the photo they used it’s colorful but small and cluttered there are too many things vying for your eye and the text is cramped hollister’s story could have been told through a tweet in a shorter more streamlined way with a single upclose picture of a pair of pretty boys’ faces with the hashtag beneath  

surf tacos

this isn’t the greatest jab of all time but i thought it would be a good idea to show some lightweight moves that won’t revolutionize the social media world but do provide some examples of easy things you can do so you don’t feel pressured to create masterpiece after masterpiece

good crosspollination surf taco has a respectable following on twitter of about 6400 followers they have about 500 on instagram by pushing an instagram picture on twitter they’re wisely using their bigger pool of followers to increase the size of their smaller one this is a strategy more people need to follow although pushing instagram to twitter worked better before competition between the two meant that twitter cut off seamless instagram integration so that it would no longer load natively however when you are trying to develop a following on a new platform whether it’s pinterest instagram snapchat or whatever we’ll see in the future it’s important to use the platform where you have the most data to drive traffic to the new one three years ago i was telling people to use their email service to drive traffic to facebook siphoning data from place to place is an excellent strategic move to build awareness of your presence on a new platform

appropriate aesthetic surf taco also clearly understand the aesthetic of instagram this isn’t a particularly artistic or exciting shot but at least they’re not using a stock photo or a glossy product picture it’s casual natural scene from a real place and based on the solid engagement it received even from a relatively small community it resonated with followers

they also knew enough about twitter users to include a hash tag and a good one too though it might have been smart to include one or two broad hashtags like “baseball” to try to earn even greater visibility

all in all not a bad play by a small new jersey business

chubbies shorts

ultimately success in social media boils down to three things understanding the nuances of your platform using a distinct voice and driving your business goals chubbies does all three in this one of my favorite pieces of microcontent in this book

the most powerful thing about this piece is the voice which carries through this content from beginning to end it’s young wry irreverent and entertaining—exactly what the demo is looking for when it comes to twitter the tweet itself shows that the brand understands the nuances of this platform it is brief and spare nothing but two hashtags that link to a meme which offers humorous suggestions of things that are superior in this case a cat named pablo picatso to their competitor’s product cargo shorts it’s a ridiculous and funny comparison now why did this meme work when hollister couldn’t get much traction with guarding the hashtag no one but chubbies has any reason to create hashtags like cargoembargo or soto—skies out thighs out so they have complete ownership  the hashtags are distinct enough to gain cachet to those people who decide to run with them chubbies didn’t blow it by linking out to a product page either

you want to see roi on social media tell a story that’s good enough to get people to buy stuff my creative team and i were impressed with this brand’s commitment to upholding a strong voice and its attention to the nuances of the platform that raised our brand awareness which got us talking about the shorts which made us a little obsessed which led me to buying eleven pairs one for each member of the team the vaynermedia team’s thighs will be out in chubbies style

bulgari us

when my parents came to this country in the late 1970s they became obsessed with elizabeth taylor in fact i’m confident that my grandmother’s first two words in english were “elizabeth taylor” so i have an affection for the icon which is why i hate to see her poorly treated this was surely a great event melding two highend luxury brands unfortunately bulgari didn’t commit to honoring ms taylor online as much as they did off line

live tweeting events can get obnoxious when the only value they bring are to the pr company trying to get impressions that’s what’s going on with this tweet the picture is so weak it could have been taken by an intern hiding behind a potted plant we could have chosen to criticize any of the 23 tweets they put out in x amount of hours but this one deserves special attention for being particularly terrible it’s hard to even see what’s going on try this turn this page back then quickly return to this page can you tell what you’re looking at in a splitsecond you have to click on the link and look on a big pc screen and then stick your nose close to that screen to get an idea of what the sumptuous flower arrangements on the table looked like but no one is going to make that effort nor should they because the picture holds zero value either to the consumer or to the brand

i do give bulgari credit for mentioning the catering company it shows heart for an international brand to publicly acknowledge a company with a 200 person twitter following

netflix

this is perfectly executed jab launched just days after netflix announced that fifteen episodes of the longawaited fourth season of the cult television show hit arrested development would air exclusively on their platform its success lies in packing a lot of power into a very simple package

the picture is a clear reference to the show’s season three finale when a character quits the family company and the copy is timely and clever “hey brother” a line frequently heard on the show gave netflix the perfect way to ride the hashtag wave of national sibling day for the record almost every day of the year has been designated an unofficial national day of somethingorotheruse this knowledge well

amc

this tweet feels schizophrenic“retweet if you love the rocknowatch this videonobuy tickets” in a hundred and forty characters amc managed to make three calls to actions that’s an accomplishment but not one to be proud of when you’re asking for three calls to action you’re asking for no calls to action the customer spotting this mishmash of links and short text coming through a mobile screen had to have been extremely confused there’s just no way to know where to focus our attention first amc often makes some strong social media moves but unfortunately much like the gi joe movies this one sucked

the nba threw a great right hook here to raise awareness of their partnership with kia and their joint mvp awards every decision shows finesse from keeping the tweet streamlined and clear to capitalizing the word “you” to help connect with their community they repeatedly reinforced the kia brand beginning with the inclusion of the kia twitter handle in the tweet to framing the nbacom landing page—which opens with an article and photo announcing lebron james as the winner of the mvp kia awards in bold red with the kia logo i don’t know for sure that kia paid the nba for this fully integrated social media drive but if they did it was money well spent

golf pigeon

if you’re just starting out or you have a small consumer base and you want to trend jack to amplify your reach one strategic and valuable way to do it is to use twitter’s ad platform and buy a key word that will turn your tweet into the first or second result when a consumer searches a term on twitter but one thing i’m always stressing is that it’s not the quantity of impressions that counts it is the quality you can tweet out to a million people but if your tweet stinks or is irrelevant to them it’s entirely possible that of that million people who saw your tweet a half million of them now hate your product or your brand the day this tweet went out lionel messi the best soccer player in the world must have scored his seven thousandth spectacular goal of the season and his name was trending golf pigeon must have thought that if soccer fans were talking about messi they might like to talk about golf too wait that doesn’t even make sense theoretically soccer and golf can sometimes overlap i guess i mean sure they’re both sports one explanation for this strange pairing might be that sometimes twitter pushes promoted tweets into related hashtags to deliver more impressions golf pigeon might not have chosent to promote against messi in which case they’re off the hook but if they did they didn’t do themselves any favors it might have been a smart move to try to garner some crossover awareness this way back in the 1980s when there were a limited number of channels on which to reach sports fans but in today’s targeted world there’s no reason to waste dollars marketing to a soccer community about golf the company would have seen a lot more upside had they waited for the masters and tripled down on trending topics that were more aligned with their brand and their community

holiday inn

so many public replies so little value retweeting nice things said about you to your entire consumer base has only one name it’s called bragging doing it nonstop is called obnoxious from april 21april 23 2013 holiday inn spent most of its time retweeting the nice things people said about them to all 30000 of their fans when instead they should have been spent five minutes forming a deeper relationship with the fans that took the time to praise them by the way any time a brand of this size is following more people than follow it back speaks to just how severely they are misusing their twitter account it’s a sign that they’re gaming the system—following people in hopes that they will follow back it’s a cheap tactic

poor holiday inn is taking the heat in this book but retweeting fan praise is a mistake that thousands of brands make every day probably because pr companies love to tell their clients that it’s a smart move i’m telling you it isn’t retweets of this nature little to no value to anyone who follows you it’s truly poor form not to mention incredibly boring for your followers

fifa

as i’ve said businesses that want to compete in social media today need to embrace a dual identity they will of course be the purveyor of a product or service but they must also learn to act like a media company this post illustrates exactly what that looks like ea sports fifa is a video game for soccer lovers but with this post the brand shows that it understands that if it is to compete it must become much more

the tweet went out to announce that the teams for the champions league semifinals had just been confirmed five or six years ago soccer fans would have found this news out when it appeared at the bottom of the espn screen and anyone who missed it would have read about it the next day in the newspaper but on this day a video game broke the news if not to the world then at least to anyone who follows it on twitter what did this jab do for the brand look at the number of retweets anyone who got their news here first turned right around and retweeted it to all of their followers all those fans and their followers gave ea sports fifa the news credit in addition the brand reaped the rewards of nice levels of engagement brand awareness brand affinity and probably tens if not hundreds of new followers—all by leading the media conversation around their genre those new followers represent many people who might be receptive when ea sports fifa throws a right hook in the form of an offer coupon or other call to action

taco bell

this one is impressive a truly awesome example of skillful trend jacking thoughtsinbed was trending taco bell jumped in and offered their answer in their typical snarky cheeky edgy voice obviously their efforts resonated because out of only about 430000 followers they received almost 13000 retweets why did the tweet perform so well because taco bell did exactly what they were supposed to do—they respected the platform and they talked in the same voice as their consumer they understand that the twitter demo is a youth demo and if you look at their stream you can see that day in day out they’re reaching out to their followers and consistently making contact building enormous brand affinity in the process they deserve the highest level of praise i can offer they get it

skittles

a lot of examples in this book make me want to cry but this one made me smile it probably made you smile too it’s cute it’s funny it sounds like a skittles lover the really smart thing they did though was to link their microcontent to an evergreen hashtag it’s a hashtag that never dies its jokey effervescent content ensuring that it remains relevant to anyone looking for a little humor if skittles keeps tweeting out microcontent like this it has a long exciting social media life ahead of it
