i dont know whats been goin on inside that head of yours
but lately youve been lookin out that window more
that gypsy soul inside of you is what i fell in love with
i wonder if its comin back to haunt me
and im so afraid that

chorus
maybe theres a star somewhere in another sky
those california colors are easy on the eyes
if you think the world looks better on that side of the fence
ill paint the grass green like a technicolor dream
if our love has faded babe ill brighten up the scene
ill paint the grass green

verse 2
they say that if you love someone dont hold em back
but i cant quite convince myself im cool with that
ill change the way i kiss you or the way i take my coffee
however big or small ill fight for it all

chorus
maybe theres a star somewhere in another sky
those california colors are easy on the eyes
ill get down on my knees if youre still up on the fence
ill paint the grass green like a technicolor dream
if our love has faded babe ill brighten up the scene
ill paint the grass green
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likebridge
ill make the roses red
give you a gold sunset
tell me its not over yet

chorus
oh maybe theres a star somewhere in another sky
those california colors are easy on the eyes
ill get down on my knees if youre still up on the fence
ill paint the grass green like a technicolor dream
if our love has faded babe ill brighten up the scene
ill paint the grass green

outro
if thats what you need
ill paint the grass greenembed"
