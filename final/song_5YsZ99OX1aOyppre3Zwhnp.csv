theres a still tension in the swell
of dreamt debris afloat amidst the waves and then dispel

verse 2
aimless thoughts and papers blown around
a million moments meant remembered rest in deep dark sound
game the mess

chorus
id like to know why you are all alone while im lost at sea
maybe well be there when you want

verse 3
anchorless and unmoored set amiss
awake would only prove the fantasy made lucid sense
sail on sail on

chorus
id like to know why you are all alone while im lost at sea
maybe well be there when you want

verse 4
theres a still tension in the swell
so give in to the vast receiving emptiness of time
beyond beyond
you might also likeoutro
id like to know why you are all alone while i
youre unsure if i am a loose end or a strand
that waits for you to mend or understand15embed"
