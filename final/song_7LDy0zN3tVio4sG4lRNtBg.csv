all the kids are throwing sticks
politics
nights on the wire
everybody wants to get by
its a test of the times
a test of my rights
its on pretty lady

verse 2
born to be angry
grip of the vice
click on the trigger girl
sip wine on ice
its about time
best to rewind
you better blow
pistols pistols pistols

chorus
lights low
go on baby go
its about time
im on a tightrope
dont go go
its about time its about time
you might also likeverse 3
everybody come on
lights on the beaches
everybody come on delight
close the front door
i dont wanna go
like im on the truman show
best to let go
you dont wanna know
ya better blow
pistols pistols pistols

chorus
lights low
go on baby go
its about time
im on a tightrope
dont go go
its about time its about

bridge
all the years of paradise
paradigms
paralyze us
youre crazy
all the cards youve organized
shuffled twice in front of my eyes
everybody has
needs wants a cold gun
chorus
lights low
go on baby go
its about time
im on a tightrope
dont go go
its about time its about
pistols pistols7embed"
