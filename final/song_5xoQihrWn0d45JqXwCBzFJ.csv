as you sailed into the fog
like a dog i smelled your fear
lord knows you should have been here with me
but you were gone
these days roll sleepily by
i can hear the old trains cry
there will always be be a moon
pulling me away from you

youre gone gone gone gone

gone are the days when the wind would brush my face
gone are the days when youre the wind
and gone are the days when my heavy heart is worn on my sleeve

ooooo ooo ooo ooo ooo continued through background until the end

take back your pictures
take back your letters
dont send me send postcards
telling me you miss me
cause im trying here
im trying here
see the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likefuck what theyre saying
my mind is made up
theyre all just starving
like the rest of us
and im trying here
ohhh im trying here

gone are the days when the wind would brush my face
gone are the days when youre the wind
and gone are the days when my heavy heart is worn on your sleeve

whether its your head or your heart
and youre too damn scared to start
its in your mind and your soul
but you just dont know where to go
its in your head and your heart
and youre too damn scared to start
its in your mind and your soul
but you just dont know where to go
now youre gone3embed"
