ladies and gentlemen you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight but you’re here with us in new york city are you ready for a cabinet meeting
the issue on the table secretary hamilton’s plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank secretary jefferson you have the floor sir

jefferson
‘life liberty and the pursuit of happiness’
we fought for these ideals we shouldn’t settle for less
these are wise words enterprising men quote ‘em
don’t act surprised you guys cuz i wrote ‘em

jeffersonmadison
oww

jefferson
but hamilton forgets
his plan would have the government assume state’s debts
now place your bets as to who that benefits
the very seat of government where hamilton sits

hamilton
not true

jefferson
ooh if the shoe fits wear it
if new york’s in debt—
why should virginia bear it uh our debts are paid i’m afraid
don’t tax the south cuz we got it made in the shade
in virginia we plant seeds in the ground
we create you just wanna move our money around
this financial plan is an outrageous demand
and it’s too many damn pages for any man to understand
stand with me in the land of the free
and pray to god we never see hamilton’s candidacy
look when britain taxed our tea we got frisky
imagine what gon’ happen when you try to tax our whisky
you might also likewashington  crowd
thank you secretary jefferson
thats my alcohol
secretary hamilton your response

hamilton
thomas that was a real nice declaration
welcome to the present we’re running a real nation
would you like to join us or stay mellow
doin’ whatever the hell it is you do in monticello
if we assume the debts the union gets
a new line of credit a financial diuretic
how do you not get it if we’re aggressive and competitive
the union gets a boost you’d rather give it a sedative
a civics lesson from a slaver hey neighbor
your debts are paid cuz you don’t pay for labor
“we plant seeds in the south we create”
yeah keep ranting
we know who’s really doing the planting
and another thing mr age of enlightenment
don’t lecture me about the war you didn’t fight in it
you think i’m frightened of you man
we almost died in the trench
while you were off getting high with the french
thomas jefferson always hesitant with the president
reticent—there isn’t a plan he doesn’t jettison
madison you’re mad as a hatter son take your medicine
damn you’re in worse shape than the national debt is in
sittin’ there useless as two shits
hey turn around bend over i’ll show you
where my shoe fits
washington
