all we are is entertainment caught up in our own derangement
tell us what to say and what to do
all we are are pretty faces picture perfect bottled rage
packaged synthesized versions of you

chorus
weve all made petty fortunes but we cant afford a life
confined to pull out quotes in hotel rooms
they all scream california and its toppling empire
but cant you see the end is coming soon

verse 2
come one come all the new sensation guarantees then obligations
spotlights follow every single move
basking here on ten foot stages pouty lips and oh so jaded
all as if we have something to prove

chorus 2
despite these petty fortunes we still cant afford a life
confined to pull out quotes in hotel rooms
they all scream california and its toppling empire
but cant you see the end is here

bridge
and if we cared at all about this unknown plight
then wed do something more to finally make this right

is this only entertainment pull the curtains places please
weve learned to sing and dance and cry on cue
but this is more than entertainment in a world so sick with pain
this is the only thing thats real or true

chorus 3
weve all made petty fortunes but we cant afford a life
confined to pull out quotes in hotel rooms
they all scream bloody murder over graves already dug
but cant you see the end3embed"
