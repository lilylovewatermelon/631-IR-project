it always seemed that i was sorry for the things that i did
but never did a thing about it til i let you in
its kinda funny bout the time that i was fallin apart
you came and put me back together now

chorus
cause what i want and what i need
has now become the same things youve been offering
as days go by ive finally become what you want me to be

verse 2
i still remember all the stupid things that ive said and done
but still you stuck around with me when all your friends said run
youve given me a name i found myself inside all the flames
becoming everything for you again

chorus
cause what i want and what i need
has now become the same things youve been offering
as days go by ive finally become what you want me to be

bridge
dont tell me you saw it all along
god help me i never knew i belonged
guess i was wrong

cause what i want and what i need
has now become the same things youve been offering
as days go by ive finally become what you want me to be
cause what i want and what i need
has now become the same things youve been offering
as days go by ive finally become what you want me to beembed"
