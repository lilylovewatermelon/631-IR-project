im sorry that i did this
the blood is on my hands
i stare at my reflection
i dont know who i am
practice my confession
in case i take the stand
ill say i learned my lesson
ill be a better man
im packing up my things and
im wiping down the walls
im rinsing off my clothes and
im walking through the halls
i did it all for her
so i felt nothing at all
i dont know what shell say
so ill ask her when she calls

chorus
would you love me more would you love me more
if i killed someone for you
would you hold my hand would you hold my hand
theyre the same ones that i used
when i killed someone for you
would you turn me in would you turn me in
when they say im on the loose
would you hide me when would you hide me when
my face is on the news
cause i killed someone for you

i hear the sirens coming
i see the flashing lights
im driving through the suburbs
wearing my disguise
i show up at her doorstep
to look her in the eyes
i tell her that its me
but she doesnt recognize
cant you see im running
said i need a place to hide
ive gotta ask you something
could you please let me inside
just let me explain
no i wouldnt tell you lies
i know youll understand
if you let me stay the night

chorus
would you love me more would you love me more
if i killed someone for you
would you hold my hand would you hold my hand
theyre the same ones that i used
when i killed someone for you
would you turn me in would you turn me in
when they say im on the loose
would you hide me when would you hide me when
my face is on the news
cause i killed someone for you
bridge
you have to understand that
the one i killed is me
changing what i was
for what you wanted me to be
i followed your direction
did everything you asked
i hope it makes you happy
cause theres just no turning back

chorus
would you love me more would you love me more
if i killed someone for you
would you hold my hand would you hold my hand
theyre the same ones that i used
when i killed someone for you
would you turn me in would you turn me in
when they say im on the loose
would you hide me when would you hide me when
my face is on the news
cause i killed someone for you33embed"
