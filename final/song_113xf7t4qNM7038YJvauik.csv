maybe i shouldnt try to be perfect
i confess im obsessed with the surface
in the end if i fall or if i get it all
i just hope that its worth it
last year i fell flat on my face
and last month i knew somethin should change
last week i started over again
ask me and ill tell you how ive been
mhm dont get me started

chorus
youve got me nervous to speak
so i just wont say anything at all
ive got an urge to release
and you keep tellin me to hold on
youve got me nervous to move
so i just wont give anything to you
you got me turnin all around to be who you need me to

verse 2
should i be quiet
uh come on be silent
uh you know im tryin
so dont say nothin
uh tell me you trust me and
kiss me and hug me yeah
well i would do anything for ya
you just gotta love me and
i got an itch in my throat
i dont know which way to go
i keep on switchin i know
i need a different approach
its all because i wanna
show you that im so capable

its not like the days have never felt so short
my nerves they give me a sign
tell me im not fine mhm
