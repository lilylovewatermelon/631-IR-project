glamorous indie rock and roll is what i want
its in my soul its what i need
indie rock and roll its time
two of us flipping through a thrift store magazine
she plays the drums im on tambourine
bet your your bottom dollar on me

chorus
its indie rock and roll for me
its indie rock and roll for me
its all i need
its indie rock and roll for me

verse 2
in a clutch im talking every word for all the boys
electric girls with worndown toys
make it up break it up what do you care
oh what do you care
i take my twist with a shout
a coffee shop with a cause then ill freak you out
no sex no drugs no life no love
when it comes to today

bridge
stay if you want to love me stay
oh dont be shy lets cause a scene
like lovers do on silver screens
lets make it yeah well cause a scene
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likechorus
its indie rock and roll for me
its indie rock and roll for me
its all i need
its indie rock and roll for me

outro
in a clutch im talking every word for all the boys
its indie rock and roll for me
its all i need
make it up break it up what do you care
its indie rock and roll for me
