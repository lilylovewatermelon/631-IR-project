could it be you calling me down down down down down
my foolish heart turns at the stars
all that i am is all that you see
you dont need nobody else and youre putting this all on me forgive me
verse 1
theres a time and a place for all this
this is not the place for all this
is there a reason why youre saying all this
and can we talk bout it later
ive gotta right my wrongs
with you is where i belong
youve been down from the go recognition is what you want
and its something that i should know

prechorus
