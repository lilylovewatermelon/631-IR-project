stop na na na youd better save it
stop stop stop youd better save it

verse 1
when we played tag in grade school
you wanted to be it
but chasing boys was just a fad
you crossed your heart youd quit

when we grew up you traded
your promise for my ring
now just like back to grade school
youre doing the same old thing

chorus
stop the love you save may be your own
darling take it slow
or someday youll be all alone
youd better stop the love you save may be your own
darling look both ways before you cross me
youre headed for a danger zone

postchorus
im the one who loves you
im the one you need
those other guys will put you down
as soon as they succeed
you might also liketheyll ruin your reputation
theyll label you a flirt
the way they talk about you
theyll turn your name to dirt oh

verse 2
isaac said he kissed you
beneath the apple tree
when benji held your hand he felt
electricity

when alexander called you
he said he rang your chime
christopher discovered
youre way ahead of your time

chorus
stop the love you save may be your own
darling take it slow
or someday youll be all alone
youd better stop the love you save may be your own
darling look both ways before you cross me
youre headed for a danger zone
