garden shed garden shed garden shed garden shed
for the garden
that is where i was hidin
that was real love i was in
aint no reason to pretend
garden shed garden shed garden shed
garden shed for the garçons
them feelings that i was guardin
heavy on my mind
all my friends lost
they couldnt read the signs
i didnt wanna talk and tell em my location
and they aint wanna walk
truth is since a youth kid thought it was a phase
thought itd be like the phrase poof gone
but its still goin on
big fan of the beige tan
polka dot nose how it goes
had to keep it on the subwoofer
a couple butterflies wanna float
but i was always like eh
barely interested but bagged just to brag to my boys like bruh
this is a crucial subject matter
sensitive like cookin batter
til the temperature thats risin
steppin on that ladder tryna
grab the rings of saturn ima
planet by the time you hear this
shit and chatter bout the heat
it will not fuckin matter85embed"
