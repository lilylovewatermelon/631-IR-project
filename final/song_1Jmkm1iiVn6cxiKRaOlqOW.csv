some day im gonna be famous
do i have talent well no
these days you dont really need it
thanks to reality shows
cant wait to date a supermodel
cant wait to sue my dad
cant wait to wreck a ferrari
on my way to rehab

chorus
cause when youre a celebrity
its adiós reality
you can act just like a fool
people think youre cool
just cause youre on tv
i can throw a major fit
when my latte isnt just how i like it
when they say ive gone insane
ill blame it on the fame
and the pressures that go with
being a celebrity
uhhuh

verse 2
ill get to cry to barbara walters
when things dont go my way
and ill get community service
no matter which law i break
ill make the supermarket tabloids
theyll write some awful stuff
but the more they run my name down
the more my price goes up

cause when youre a celebrity
its adiós reality
no matter what you do
people think youre cool
just cause youre on tv
i can fall in and out of love
have marriages that barely last a month
when they go down the drain
ill blame it on the fame
and say its just so tough
being a celebrity

bridge
so lets hitch up the wagons and head out west
to the land of fun and the sun
well be real world bachelor jackass millionaires
hey hey hollywood here we come

chorus
yeah when youre a celebrity
its adiós reality
no matter what you do
people think youre cool
just cause youre on tv
being a celebrity
outro
yeah celebrity
oh
oh wheres my coffeeembed"
