listen to me this time
were just whores on a fucking assembly line
believe me i was there
take what i want get the fuck outta here

chorus
but trains wont
stop me
trains wont
stop me

refrain
jonnys been a very bad boy
jonnys been a very bad boy
jonnys been a very bad boy
jonnys been a very bad

verse 2
this door is so high
my life is oblivious to you and
the sun hurts my eyes but
remember you are not god

chorus
trains wont
stop me
trains wont
stop

ooh and you look at me
see through me i am nothing to you
you look at me
see through me i am nothing to you

outro
what do you want to be you love you not me
meanwhile i wave goodbye as i take it in
destroy this in me but if you want someone
i will come down fighting for youembed"
