i remember hearing hank on the radio
the first time it felt like falling in love
i bought a cassette stole some reds from dad
and me and old junior just burned it up
i was hooked like a fish
every birthday wish was guitars and records
now honey i know you miss me
i feel it when you kiss me
trust me when i say every goodbye hurts

chorus
well damn these dreams
playing my heart just like a guitar string
pull me away from you and everything i really need
well damn these dreams
chasing that same old whiskey melody
all up and down these nashville streets
its hard to look true love in the eye and leave
well damn these dreams

verse 2
well i remember hearing my song on the radio
the first time it felt like some kinda drug
out there on the road playing show after show
me and the boys just burning it up
it was all fun and games til the little ones came
cause it makes my heart bleed
when i gotta drive away and listen to em say
hey daddy why you gotta go please dont leave
see dierks bentley liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likechorus
well damn these dreams
playing my heart just like a guitar string
pulling me away from you and everything i really need
well damn these dreams
chasing that same old whiskey melody
all up and down every small town street
its hard to look true love in the eye and leave
well damn these dreams
well damn these dreams

outro
well its in my heart and its in my soul
and just like you i never can let go
these wheels just gotta roll
cause i remember hearing hank on the radio
the first time it felt like falling in loveembed"
