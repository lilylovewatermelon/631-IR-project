burnt wood has bared witness to many songs sung
warmed up the hands
and the hearts of the young
and the old gather round
till the flames are all done
passing down their words of wisdom

verse 2
talking about a schoolyard crush
and two wheeled bikes
a few rolling papers on those friday nights
drink with good people
get high as a kite
before they drift away
out of mind and out of sight

verse 3
well that’s not to say you lose
everything and everyone
hear me out take your time
and watch the setting sun
take your hands out of your pockets
feel the water run
don’t worry about tomorrow and yesterday
is gone

and the words that he said
still echoing in my head
don’t sell your soul for money son
means nothing when youre dead
we all walk the same round here
our blood is pumpin’ red
feels struggle feel pain
keep a level head

verse 5
find a beautiful love
look straight into their eyes
make sure they know
they’re your morning light
and that you’ll never let go
till the day that you die

outro
this here is love
this here is life1embed"
