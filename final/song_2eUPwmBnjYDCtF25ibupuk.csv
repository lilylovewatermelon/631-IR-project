got up at dawn just to be out on the water
weather man said hot and getting hotter
but he didnt say nothing bout it raining like hell oh well
a bad day of fishing beats a good day of anything else
had a big one on and man i would a got them
but he took my pole straight down to the bottom
leaving me with nothing but a big ole story to tell oh well
a bad day of fishing beats a good day of anything else

chorus 1
we should proly go to work i mean everybody does
instead of sitting out here in the middle of nowhere working on a pretty good buzz

chorus 2
didnt catch a damn thing guess you could say we took a licking
tonights fish fry is going to taste like chicken
but we did just fine if i do say so myself
a bad day of fishing beats a good day of anything else
