suddenly i realize everything i thought was impossible is here
and my heart sings in a world so incredible
and everything burns much brighter

chorus
i i want to fly fly into this beautiful life i think itd be nice with you
i want to fly fly into this beautiful life i think itd be nice with you with you with you with you

fingertips northern lights tracing colors right through the sky
underneath a lullaby i never felt as blissful as i do here
and my heart sings in a world so incredible
and everything shines much brighter

chorus
i i want to fly fly into this beautiful life i think itd be nice with you
i want to fly fly into this beautiful life i think itd be nice with you with you with you with you

set the night on fire if we want to
hanging out with the stars and the big moon
im very well thank you how do you do
set the night on fire if we want to
hanging out with the stars and the big moon
pull them down for a dance with your lasso

i think itd be nice with you with you x4you might also likeembed"
