ive been up to my neck working six days a week
wearing holes in the soles of the shoes on my feet
been dreaming of gettin away since i dont know
aint no better time than now for mexico

chorus
no shoes no shirt and no problems
blues what blues hey i forgot em
the sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
and no shoes no shirt and no problems
no problems

verse 2
want a towel on a chair in the sand by the sea
wanna look through my shades and see you there with me
wanna soak up life for a while in laid back mode
no boss no polite no stress no dress code

chorus
no shoes no shirt and no problems
blues what blues hey i forgot em
the sun and the sand and a drink in my hand with no bottom
and no shoes and no shirt and no problems
babe lets get packed tank tops and flipflops if you got em
no shoes and no shirt and no problems
no problemssee kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also like1embed"
