verse 2 busta rhymes
and leave a mark until its deep in the floor
yall niggas fucked up yall shouldve never let me get my feet in the door
and then i step through fuck wipin my feet at the door
i be the deacon im beatin niggas and speakin the raw
strictly raw shit is what niggas be seekin me for
testin my strength thats what the devils try to weaken me for
cmon yes and yall off to the next step for sure
rep and make you wanna accept more
niggas analyse the jewel that i reveal in a rhyme
im like somethin that has evolved about a million times
peep the display with all the new features
the way we really doin it
these muhfuckas probably wouldnt believe us
flipmode squad by all means a pledge of allegiance
with the great feelin of people like the coming of jesus
while a lot of other niggas dont be tellin you nothin
that be the same bullshit thats always pushin my buttons
godly is how we rep this undeniable force
you like a weak preacher swearin smacked dead on a cross
kick niggas like the two back legs of a horse
chop ya fingers for tryin to put your hands in the sauce
sometimes i think that it be best if you run
and do yourself a favour
cause you got your whole life ahead of you son
a whole new thing startin for me
smell so much ass in the spot the beat got the world fartin for me
when i spit you know i always love to garnish it hard
while you loveit hateit niggas try to tarnish the god
i know some dudes thatd love to bring the hatred to yall
while i continue to bless you with shit thats sacred to yall
even if i had to bend you in place
i always put it down and rep my niggas from the most genuine place
from my street corner niggas to my live niggas everywhere
too late for turnin back we takin it there
