sick of being innocent
sick of being ignorant too
i was in it for the thrill of it
til i started feelin the truth

chorus
whyd you ever make me choose
i dont wanna be like you
i thought i knew you but
i never knew you would turn us into animals
i dont wanna be like you

verse 2
realized im living in hell when i was given the news
whyd you let the evil win
howd you let him sell it to you
i remember growing up mama used to sing me the blues
and now the kids are making noise
just because its something to do to do yeah

extended chorus
whyd you ever make me choose
i dont wanna be like you
i thought i knew you but i never knew
you would turn us into animals
i dont wanna be like you
i dont wanna be like you
i dont wanna be like you
you might also likeoutro
so now im second guessin real life ahh
and if you left i still wouldnt feel right35embed"
