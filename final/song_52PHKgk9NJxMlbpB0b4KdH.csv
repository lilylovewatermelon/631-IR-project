ill come out of this out of this
everywhere i turn there seems to be another war
well come out of this out of this

nothings gone right
im at my wits end
i swear ill come out of this out of this
youre losing your mind
no hope in sight
promise you out of this

like the wind in the trees
a cool summer breeze
like the curls in your hair
everyone stares at
the hole in the wall
its all in your head
theres a memory there
all through night
tried being cruel
its just not in me its just not in you
oh tried being cruel
its just not in me its just not in you
its just not in me
see the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likenow that weve come to the end
find that were right where we began

now that weve come to the end
find that were right where we began

now that weve come to the end
find that were right where we began

now that weve come to the end
find that were right where we began

tried being cruel
its just not in me its just not in you
oh tried being cruel
its just not in me its just not in you
oh tried being cruel
its just not in me its just not in you
oh tried being cruel
its just not in me its just not in you
its just not in me1embed"
