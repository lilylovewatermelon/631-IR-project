crip niggas blood niggas eses asians
dominicans puerto ricans white boys jamaicans
latin kings disciples vice lords haitians

verse 1 the game
since the west coast fell off the streets been watching
the west coast never fell off—i was sleep in compton

nate dogg doin his thing dpg still poppin
i got california love fuckin bitches to that pac shit
and westside connection been had it locked bitch

im lowridin homie sixtrey impala
gold ds spinnin chrome hydraulics
run up on my lolo you stop breathing
hollow tips make niggas disappear like houdini
gangbangin is real homie—im living proof
like snoop dogg cwalkin on top of the devils roof
rap critics wanna converse about this and that
cause red strings in his converse and this a dre track
keep gibberin and jabbin i pull the 38 magnum
and get to clickin and clackin
your homies wanna know what happened
come to compton see thriller like mike jackson
i might be spike lee of this gunclappin
prior to rappin i was drug traffickin
in the dope spot playing john madden
homie i aint braggin i took five

verse 3 the game
new york new york big city of dreams
i got my la dodger fitted on im doin my thing
got me fucking with gunit—you know the drama that bring
i got niggas in westside compton and southside queens
and buck told me in cashville im good when i come through
so i aint gotta tuckin my chain like dj pooh
im gangsta—more like deebo when he was zeus
play bishop i paint that picture—now who got the juice
you niggas is nutso—ill take off your roof
leave your ass stretchedout like a cadillac coupe
god gotta let me in heaven all the shit ive been through
i was a og in the hood before i turned twentytwo
homie i let the 38 special rip through that vest
and i dont contemplate whether or not he left his shit on the dresser
got compton on my back im starting to feel the pressure
im lyrically kool g rap on these dre records

chorus 50 cent
