just me top down on the way to the beach
four bad chicks in the middle of the street
roll right up and they all hopped in
now we in the sand havin lunch on me

we about to grab some drinks and head to my condo you can be my weekend guest oh
im in her head so i know were bout to get started
one thing led to the next now she got her hands all over my body eh

prechorus
i aint tryna stop and i know she with it
i can see it in her eyes she been down from the beginning
and she cant leave me alone cause i drive her body crazy
i done gave her a little taste now she wanna have my babies

chorus
