back from the edge
back from the dead
back before demons took control of my head
back to the start
back to my heart
back to the boy who would reach for the stars
oh he would reach for the stars yeah

verse 1
you can take my home you can take my clothes
you can take the drugs i have that nobody knows
you can take my watch you can take my phone
you can take all ive got til im skin and bone
i dont want control i can dig my own hole
i can make my bed and i can lie in it cold

prechorus
cause i dont need heat ive been burnin in hell
but now im back with my own story to tell

chorus
back from the edge
back from the dead
back before demons took control of my head

back to the boy who would reach for the stars
oh back from the edge
back from the dead
back from the tears that were too easily shed
back to the start
back to my heart
back to the boy who would reach for the stars
who would reach for the stars yeah

they dont like my lines they dont like my songs
except in karaoke when theyre singing along
did you see them build me up watch me tear myself down
with a smile on my face i dug my grave in the ground
we all make mistakes were so quick to judge
its hard to forgive when we hold onto a grudge

prechorus

but now im back with my own story to tell

chorus
