tried to write a letter
to tell you how i feel
all i kept on writing
was slipping on the tears from the day
and i was young and brave
now all these hotel lobbies
are filled whats to me
lonely midnight drivers
drifting out to sea yea
and all those late night lovers
dont make things better to me

chorus
so let it roll in me
let it roll in you
let it roll in me
let it roll back into when i had you

verse 2
now i watch the snow come calling
and i celebrate the spring
i feel the falls keep falling
and when the summers come
i will pretend that i dont notice
this is when i notice most of all
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likechorus
let it roll in me
let it roll in you
let it roll in me
let it roll back into when i had you

bridge
is all you ever wanted from me
was the time to understand and
all i ever wanted from you
was to see me shining for you
and i wish that i could be back
in the day that i could say

chorus
let it roll
let it roll in me
let it roll
let it roll in you
let it roll back into when i had youembed"
