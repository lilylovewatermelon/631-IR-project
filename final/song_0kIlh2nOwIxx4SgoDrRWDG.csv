the phone lights up in the dark
asks where you are and i start driving
meet me for a drink
just an hour maybe two maybe three
baby im in
girl you cant take your eyes off me
and that first kiss is sweet relief
aint no one gotta know
just one more before you go

chorus both
i dont wanna be a liar
i dont wanna be a fool
i dont wanna be a secret
but i will if you want me to
you can leave me in the dark
if thats all i get from you
he can be the sun
ill be the moon
yeah he can be the sun
ill be the moon

verse 2 dierks bentley and maren morris
the phone lights up in the dark
gotta go i know but it still aint easy
tomorrow youll be waking up beside him
tell him that you love him
but you still see me
in my mind when im looking at him
and in my eyes
its the obvious elephant in the room
he cant see it but girl you do
