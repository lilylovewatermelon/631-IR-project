verse 1 jon bellion
you know that he trusts you and i know that he loves you
but somehow you convinced me again
my foundation rumbles and all my morals crumble
my fathers warnings run through my head

chorus jon bellion
your hearts a vine that ive bled trying to climb
yeah youre making a ruin of me
try to survive keep my spirit alive
but like a knife in the woods
yeah you hunt down the good in me

postchorus jon bellion
like a knife in the woods
yeah you hunt down the good in me
like a knife in the woods
yeah you hunt down the good in me

verse 2 jon bellion
one temptation sparked this
now i can feel the darkness
its my own fault but you had this planned
all of me you take now like criminals and shakedowns
yeah you make me forget who i am
