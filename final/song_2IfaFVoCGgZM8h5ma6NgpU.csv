im aching to believe
give me something real enough
give me somewhere to fall from

cause in the dark
i cant find my feet
built my world on promises
colorless and cold

im short of breath im sure
gone let it wash away the best i had
gone and when i disappear
dont expect me back dont expect me back

lost sweetest things get lost
in the static far away
painted pictures of you
i fold
dont want to be holy then
dont want to be sold again
the way i was with you

im short of breath im sure
gone let it wash away the best i had
you might also likegone and when i disappear
dont expect me back dont expect me back

im short of breath im sure
gone let it wash away
the best i had
gone and when i disappear
dont expect me back
dont expect me back

at its worse the heart is sober
at its worse the heart is cold cold cold

im short of breath im sure
gone let it wash away all the best i had
gone and when i disappear
dont expect me dont expect me back

gone let it wash away
the best i had
gone and when i disappear
dont expect me back
dont expect me back
dont expect me back1embed"
