whip bought it
crib got it
job on it
did i ever
ask you to take me to go
shopping in paris or go
sailing overseas and just
drape me in gucci no
all i ever asked was you to
pick up the phone when you alone
all i ever asked was you to
show me some love kisses and hugs
no i never had an issue
go to the club with your boys baby i
never wanted you to stay too long
just wanted you to show me off

chorus
so wont you say my name say my name
if you claim you want me it aint no thang
you acting kind of shady
you aint been calling me baby oh

verse 2
i know you said hit my line im on your mind and that
