sulking
walking round the city after dark
need protection
from street toughs
who clip the locks and rip the doors off rough
like cowards

chorus
and oh this life of glorified
robbing from the blind is not easy you see
dont think i dont know sympathy
my victims in my shadow staring back at me

verse 2
not me im knockin
tiptoe outside a strangers door
casually let myself in
fill pockets
with trinkets purses china antique armoire

chorus
and oh this life of glorified
robbing from the blind is not easy you see
dont think i dont know sympathy
my victims in my shadow staring back at me
see cold war kids liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likeoutro
theres robbers in my thoughts
they tell me what to think
theyre hiding in my clothes
crawling in the kitchen sink
