doo doo doo doo doo
doo
i just wish you knew doo doo
how much i still love you doo doo

verse 1
ive got to see you
wherever you are
and ive got to be there
im wishing on stars
ive got to reveal whats inside of my heart
but the words escape me
and im paralyzed
so helpless when i
look into your eyes

chorus
and how i wish you only knew
what i feel inside for you
you probably havent got a clue
but i wish you knew
how i love you baby
how i love you how i love you

verse 2
honestly i know its silly of me
to want you so badly
but keep it concealed
see my inferiority complex kicks in
and the words escape me
and im paralyzed
so helpless when i
look into your eyes
chorus
and how i wish you only knew
what i feel inside for you
you probably havent got a clue
but i wish you knew
how i love you baby
how i love you how i love you

spoken bridge
i dont know if anybody else outside there tonight
who knows what it feels like
to want somebody so bad
that nothing and nobody
can ever seem to fill that void
that is the situation that im talking about right now
and if you feel me
sing the song with me
come on

chorus
and how i wish you only knew
what i feel inside for you
you probably havent got a clue
but i wish you knew
how i love you baby
how i love you how i love you
i wish you only knew
what i feel inside for you
cause you probably havent got a clue
but i wish you knew
how i love you baby
how i love you how i love you
i still love yousee mariah carey liveget tickets as low as 104you might also like5embed"
