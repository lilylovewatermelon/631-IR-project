woah ooh
oh ohoh woah
oh

verse 1
he can only hold her for so long
the lights are on but no ones home
shes so vacant her soul is taken
he thinks whats she running from

chorus
now how can he have her heart
when it got stole
so he tries to pacify her
because whats inside her never dies

verse 2
even if shes content in his warmth
she is plagued with urgency
searching kisses the man she misses
the man that he longs to be

chorus
now how can he have her heart
when it got stole
so he tries to pacify her
because whats inside her never dies

so he tries to pacify her
because whats inside her it never dies
so he tries to pacify her
but whats inside her never dies20embed"
