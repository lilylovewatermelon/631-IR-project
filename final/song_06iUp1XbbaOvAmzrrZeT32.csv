kidnap mr sandy claws

lock
i wanna do it

barrel
lets draw straws

shock
jack said we should work together

barrel
three of a kind

lock
birds of a feather

lockshockbarrel
now and forever whee
lalalalalala lalalalala
lalalalalala lalalalala
kidnap the sandy claws lock him up real tight
throw away the key and then turn off all the lights

shock
first were going to set some bait
inside a nasty trap and wait
when he comes asniffing
we will snap the trap and close the gate
you might also likelock
wait ive got a better plan
to catch this big red lobster man
lets pop him in a boiling pot
and when hes done well butter him up

lockshockbarrel
kidnap the sandy claws throw him in a box
bury him for ninety years then see if he talks

shock
then mr oogie boogie man

lockshockbarrel
can take the whole thing over then
hell be so pleased i do declare
that he will cook him rare whee

lock
i say that we take a cannon
aim it at his door and then
knock three times and when he answers
sandy claws will be no more

shock
youre so stupid think now
if we blow him up into smithereens
we may lose some pieces
lockshockbarrel
and then jack will beat us black and green
kidnap the sandy claws tie him in a bag
throw him in the ocean then see if he is sad

lock  shock
because mr oogie boogie is the meanest guy around
if i were on his boogie list id get out of town

barrel
hell be so pleased by our success
that hell reward us too ill bet

lockshockbarrel
perhaps hell make his special brew
of snake and spider stew mmm
were his little henchmen and we take our job with pride
we do our best to please him
and stay on his good side

shock
i wish my cohorts werent so dumb

barrel
im not the dumb one
lock
youre no fun

shock
shut up

lock
make me

shock
ive got something listen up
this one is real good youll see
well send a present to his door
upon therell be a note to read
now in the box well wait and hide
until his curiousity

lockshockbarrel
entices him to look inside
and then well have him one two three
kidnap the sandy claws beat him with a stick
lock him up for ninety years see what makes him tick
kidnap the sandy claws chop him into bits
mr oogie boogie is sure to get his kicks
kidnap the sandy claws see what we will see
lock him in a cage and then throw away the key6embed"
