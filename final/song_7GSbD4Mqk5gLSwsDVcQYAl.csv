i walked across the crowded street
a sea of eyes they cut through me
and i saw you in the middle
your upset face you wear it well
you camouflage the way you feel
when everythings the matter

prechorus joe jonas
weve all been down that road before
searching for that something more

chorus nick jonas

theres no sign of slowing down
so wont you take a breath
just take a breath
people change and promises are broken
clouds can move and skies will be wide open
dont forget to take a breath

verse 2 joe jonas with nick jonas

hold on tight and brace for cold
and its only for a moment
