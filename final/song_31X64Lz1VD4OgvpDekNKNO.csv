just let me go im on my own a rolling stone and im in the zone
dont let me fall just let me know when well make it through

verse 1
i got that shit that you can bump in your car
steady lurking on my enemies to settle the score
i am never backing down until the day that i die
and i dont give a fuck about no hater on my life
i am the best at what i do and i will always prevail
and overcome all obstacles while walking through hell
and if you got a problem nows the time to speak up
cause im blowing up im never gonna stop

chorus
just let me go im on my own a rolling stone and im in the zone
dont let me fall just let me know when well make it through
no matter what the price may be for clarity ill make it home
just let me go im on my own a rolling stone

verse 2
i spit the fire and im killing the track
ambitious from how many knives are stabbed in my back
and if you think you know me then youre probably wrong
i spill my heart and soul so lock and load and keep bringing it on
i got an anger that runs deep in my blood
and im always staying true repping the city im from
and if you got a problem nows the time to speak up
cause im blowing up im never gonna stop

just let me go im on my own a rolling stone and im in the zone
dont let me fall just let me know when well make it through
no matter what the price may be for clarity ill make it home

verse 3
dont get it twisted ballistic characteristic when i rip shit
intricate visions of infinite wisdom empirical spiritual lyrical very cool synonyms
in laymans terms i am the best you must agree
i got that white boy swagger rapping right down to a t
i got my hand upon the throttle holding up a broken bottle
ready to cut you up and gut you like a fucking avocado
desperado on the track in fact if i am gone tomorrow
then my motto is no sorrow no apologies just karma
dont get it twisted and delete me off your friends list
staying busy tweeting hatred at me all up in my business
im getting kicks outta this shit like it was my sneakers
and the game fears me like a motherfucking wifebeater oh

drop

breakdown
just let me go on my own again
a rolling stone im in the zone yeah
chorus
just let me go im on my own a rolling stone and im in the zone
dont let me fall just let me know when well make it through
no matter what the price may be for clarity ill make it home
just let me go im on my own a rolling stone
just let me go im on my own a rolling stone and im in the zone
dont let me fall just let me know when well make it through
no matter what the price may be for clarity ill make it home
