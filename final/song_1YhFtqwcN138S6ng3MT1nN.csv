my daddy spent his life lookin up at the sky
hed cuss kick the dust sayin son its way too dry
it clouds up in the city the weatherman complains
but where i come from rain is a good thing

chorus
rain makes corn corn makes whiskey
whiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky
back roads are boggin up my buddies piled up in my truck
we hunt our hunnies down we take em into town
start washin all our worries down the drain
rain is a good thing

verse 2
aint nothing like a kiss out back in the barn
wringing out our soakin clothes ridin out a thunderstorm
when the tin roof gets to talkin thats the best love we make
yeah where i come from rain is a good thing

chorus
rain makes corn corn makes whiskey
whiskey makes my baby feel a little frisky
back roads are boggin up my buddies piled up in my truck
we hunt our hunnies down we take em into town
start washin all our worries down the drain
rain is a good thing
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likebridge
farmer johnson does a little dance
creeks on the rise roll up yo pants
country girls they want to cuddle
kids out playin in a big mud puddle

chorus
rain makes corn corn makes whiskey
whiskey makes my babyâ€” hahahaha
back roads are boggin up my buddies piled up in my truck
we hunt our hunnies down we take them into town
start washin all our worries down the drain
rain is a good thing

outro
rain is a good thing
rain is a good thing
rain is a good thing6embed"
