see the animal in his cage that you built
are you sure what side youre on
better not look him too closely in the eye
are you sure what side of the glass you are on
see the safety of the life you have built
everything where it belongs
feel the hollowness inside of your heart
and its all right where it belongs

chorus
what if everything around you
isnt quite as it seems
what if all the world you think you know
is an elaborate dream
and if you look at your reflection
is it all you want it to be
what if you could look right through the cracks
would you find yourself find yourself afraid to see

verse 2
what if all the worlds inside of your head
just creations of your own
your devils and your gods all the living and the dead
and youre really all alone
you can live in this illusion
you can choose to believe
you keep looking but you cant find the woods
while youre hiding in the trees

what if everything around you
isnt quite as it seems
what if all the world you used to know
is an elaborate dream
and if you look at your reflection
is that all you want it to be
what if you could look right through the cracks
would you find yourself find yourself afraid to see
