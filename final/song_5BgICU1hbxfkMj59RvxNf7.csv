ive been told by a friend
or at least i wish he was
that i should go and find the best
im not sure what that consists
chances are its not gonna find me first
gonna have to open my eyes
discover things i dont wanna find

chorus
but if youre the smartest man in the room
youre hanging with the wrong people
yeah youre hanging with the wrong people

verse 2
aint nothing wrong with knowin
way more than i should
that way when i get the words
ill know exactly where it hurts
even though the comfort here feels like a home
i just cant stop right here
still got a whole lot more years

chorus
but if youre the smartest man in the room
youre hanging with the wrong people
yeah youre hanging with the wrong people

maybe i took what you said just a little too far
maybe i took it just far enough
to help me find my way up

chorus
but if youre the smartest man in the room
youre hanging with the wrong people
yeah youre hanging with the wrong people
yeah youre hanging with the wrong
