verse 1 ashanti
because i never felt like this
i dont wanna be wrong cause i like it
thinking about you the way you kiss
i dont wanna be wrong but i like it
i think you stole my heart from me
see i dont wanna be wrong cause i like it
cause i belong to somebody
even though it seems wrong i cant fight it
it almost feels as if im not myself
under a spell from someone else
i think im falling for somebody else
and i cant control myself
its like some kind of hex on me
controlling who i love and how i speak
and when hes gone my heart wont beat
tell me whats come over me

verse 2 ashanti
because i never felt like this
i dont wanna be wrong cause i like it
thinking about the way you kiss
i dont wanna be wrong but i like it
you got me thinking i should leave
see i dont wanna be wrong cause i like it
but i belong to somebody
even though it seems wrong i cant fight it
i know that i already have a love
hes all i know and all i trust
but lately ive been falling out of love
i find myself so deep in love
and every time hes here with me
i look into his eyes so desperately
but now its not his face i see
