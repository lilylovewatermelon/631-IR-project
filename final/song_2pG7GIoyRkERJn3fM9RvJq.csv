driven to the fire
take it back to where we started
till we crash and burn again
now i got it to a science
all this sabotage between us
dancing on a razors edge

two nights ago my broken heart was on the mend
know i should go but its so hard when you walk in
im not myself when were apart i cant pretend

chorus
oh but i
im only human
how am i supposed to stop myself
from loving you loving you yeah
im only human
im about to do the thing i know

postchorus

but i know youre gonna break my heart again
im only human how am i supposed to stop myself
from loving you loving you yeah
