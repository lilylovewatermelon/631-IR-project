tell it like it is

verse 1
he gets up real early on his morning drive
down to the office for his 9 to 5
he drives a 94 2 ton economy car
loves to tell the local bands down at the bar that hes the critic
yea i can hook you up i know everybody in the business

verse 2
he flunked junior high band he couldnt march in time
he tried to write a song once he couldnt make it rhyme
he went two or three chords on a pawn shop guitar
he just never quite had what it took to be a star so hes a critic
i work for the gazette man i got a real job

verse 3
he did a 5star column on a band he never heard
he did a bluegrass review about an unkind word
he thought it was time to ask his boss for a raise
his boss said i cant even tell if anybodys even reading your page

break
yeah
you might also likeverse 4
so he thought and he thought a little more
he caught a young hot star heading into town
and then he hid behind his typewriter and gunned the boy down
here come the letters the emails the faxes
they raised him to 20000 dollars after taxes
hes a happy critic
hes rolling in the dough

verse 5
man i could do this forever this is easy everybodys reading my column
please dont tell my mom that i write the music column for the gazette
she still thinks i play piano down at the cathouse
lets get funky with this now boys play it on out

bridge

liams laying it down
come on shannon

verse 6
man my fingers are getting tired yall going to have to hurry
this snapping thing wearing me out
