you can taste the dishonesty
its all over your breath as you pass it off so cavalier
but even thats a test
constantly aware of it all
my lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world

chorus
pray to catch you whispering
i pray you catch me listening
im prayin to catch you whispering
i pray you catch me
im prayin to catch you whispering
i pray you catch me listening
i pray you catch me

verse 2
nothing else ever seems to hurt like the smile on your face
when its only in my memory it dont hit me quite the same
maybe its a cause for concern but im not at ease
keeping my head to the curb

chorus
pray to catch you whispering
i pray you catch me listening
i pray to catch you whispering whisper whisper
i pray you catch me whisper whisper
i pray you catch me
i pray you catch me pray you
im praying you catch me
