i stopped in thibodeaux roadhouse in louisiana
i wasnt staying long i was a wanted man
the air was thick with danger i watched the vixens dance
my six gun in my pocket my pistol in my pants
i let her walk up on me she pinned me to the door
she said she swore she knew me wed never met before
she pressed up hard against me i stared into her eyes
she grabbed my face and kissed me she had me hypnotized

chorus
im running down the road cant find the interstate
its like im being followed and i cant get away
the snakes and alligators they whisper in the wind
i hear her calling to me i turn around again
cry of a creole woman
woke up the devil down in me

verse 2
she took me to her bedroom smelled like a cheap hotel
never had a cajun queen im used to southern belles
but through the smoky billows of my tobacco leaves
i watched her in the mirror as she was loving me

chorus
im running down the road cant find the interstate
its like im being followed and i cant get away
the snakes and alligators they whisper in the wind
i hear her calling to me i turn around again
cry of a creole woman
woke up the devil down in me

whats this you wicked woman some kind of voodoo game
hell i havent slept since thursday dont even know your name
this spell you got me under got just one remedy
just like a poison potion that goes down smooth and sweet

chorus
im running down the road cant find the interstate
its like im being followed and i cant get away
the snakes and alligators they whisper in the wind
i hear her calling to me i turn around again
cry of a creole woman
woke up the devil down in meembed"
