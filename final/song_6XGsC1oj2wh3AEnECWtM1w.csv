verse 1 chris travis
smoked a thousand blunts
got a nigga feelin too straight
with a bad bitch and im givin her that bukkake
nigga fuck you mean i get a new bitch every tuesday
boy you niggas trippin better tie up that shoelace
chris fuckin travis boy you aint gotta like me
im steezin on yo main bitch or better yet yo wifey
no doubt that ima take her muthafucka more than likely
i slip back to my town and told that pretty bitch to skype me
i ride around my town my nigga blowin on that chronic
i hit the nearest mickey ds for my fuckin munchies
im laughin at you niggas cause yall so fuckin funny
bitch its a dark day even when its fuckin sunny
shoutout to the houston queen amber fuckin london
im slidin rollin solo and that pimp c bitch im bumpin
im lightin kush blunts cause a nigga feelin grumpy
while you textin yo bitch my nigga i hope you know she fuckin

verse 2 amber london
you aint fuckin with the realest trillest bitches on the rise
grippin the wheel and poppin the pill
we got to kill with no disguise
niggas think its all gravy where they stake to the fuckin snake
you cant escape we keepin it real my nigga it aint nothin fake
i aint dyin i aint cryin no lyin ima ride bitch
you side bitch the only time you on top is when you ride dick
you tryin this lil nigga shoe size size 6
smokin on exotic that narcotic make my eyes stick
dont act like you get it when you dont
cause yo wig they will split it and then sit it on the trunk
see them niggas aint no punks
see them niggas aint no lames
switchin lanes but aint no snitchin
bitch we come from different things
see them hoes dont know no pain
i aint never felt regret
so im strappin mackin the chrome
and im aimed at yo neck
naw amber aint no killer g
but i can do you lyrically
come fuck with me
ill gladly take you bitches where the spirits be
you hearin me3embed"
