you used to say when i was down
theres more to life outside this white trash midwestern town
you birthed the spark in my brain
said itd be sunny but that night it rained
wet shoes as i stepped on the plane
found my seat and closed the window shade
i fell asleep and then awoke to a shake
i overheard like they spoke my name
the captain said itll be a task to make it
to lax with a storm like this
well try our best he said with a nervous grin
you could hear the breath you could see the face
of a man whod cut the tension if his hands didnt shake
hes got a wife two girls and a home on the ground
and the most disturbing part is they dont know its going down
the most disturbing part is they dont know its going down
the most disturbing part is they dont know its going down

chorus maximilian hecker
up in the sky of lights
turn on earth of life
lowering my eyes to see you
telling all lies to be with you

verse 2 bones
but not in the fire and not in the crash
theyll weather the storm you say well land intact
its when he goes home that it becomes real
theres a small part of him that resents the wheels
he hates the wings and the bolts that hold them
together like promises they never told him
he thinks they deserve the same life that he had
he wished the fucking engine wouldve blown to piecesyou might also like18embed"
