verse 1 lil famine
smoke lines on my face from the cigarettes always burnin
combination of the drugs and the chronic got me slurrin
its that dont fear no busta
187 a sucka kill a motherfucker
climbin out of nothin
me love da gun me love to kill a rat
me smokin on a sack turn me into psychopath
chomp chomp eat another xan
me dont fear no man that can bleed like i can
rag on my face like i am taliban
this scene is the ocean and i am the sandman
hold up lemme glo up
ruby with the stance while my eyes steady rollin
oozing get the bands while i stick up and i hold em
screaming fuck the man while the middle fingers go up
that redrum that redrum written all on my bedroom

verse 2 the uicidal shepherd
i been pickin flies off the eyelids of sinners kids
coming to claim your religion opinion formed by television
never listen to the voices inside of your fucking head
i died and now im dead
what is life when you in debt to the reaper
fuck a hole dig deeper
whether it is in the ground or spread apart by bitches fingers
let me linger hook line and sinker
trained by the teacher raped by the preacher
not saved by the leader put a blade to his neck
told him run away and never look backâ€”thats a threat
then i turned to the flock said youre no longer oppressed
but they follow me anyway never taught to think for themselves
belt tied round my neck im the uicidal hepherd
now leopard bounced a check
hot boy bitch im peppered
never gave a fuck what a bitchboy gotta say
he can never levitate from out his motherfucking grave
