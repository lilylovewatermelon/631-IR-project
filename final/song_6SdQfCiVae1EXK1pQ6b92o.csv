verse
i became exactly what i wanted to
i became a millionaire at twentytwo
telling girls i love em and they love me too ooh
i dont question if they mean it cause i know they do
started being me when i realized it was okay to
middle school bumping waka flocka o lets do”
first album and i know just how its gon debut
track three is where i tell her we gon rendezvous
im signed to the gatekeepers
dont believe the gossip cause it aint true
half of the dreams i had already came true
and they never told me anything i couldnt do
i got a mirror in my room i like to look into
at seventeen i never thought that i would look this cute woo
classmates cant believe the place i took it to
if i didnt rap then i would be a good masseuse
fun fact but its a hidden talent cause she rubbing my back
all these different cities im becoming sidetracked
she leaving my hotel wearing something i packed
my wardrobes spread across a whole map
jwise used to book me for the open mics
kills me when they act like this was overnight
like we didnt do a tour in a tiny van
eight deep at the show it might be eight fans mm
that builds character something yall could probably use more of
if i told the truth to her i know shed be tore up
they love it when i rap and i dont even put a chorus
turkey on ciabatta from the deli shout to morris
thirty grand to show up we might as well pour up
fake handshakes we know you aint going for us ooh
its something bout your aura i knowyou might also like2embed"
