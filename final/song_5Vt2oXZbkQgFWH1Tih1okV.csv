i was lookin for a change of scene
you were lookin at a magazine
it was red carpets and limousines
and the grass seemed so much greener
all we wanted was to get there fast
so we packed up everything we had
runnin on hope and a tank of gas
like dreams aint just for dreamers

prechorus
we couldnt wait to leave that life behind
and try to find salvation in that city limit sign

chorus
and one of those la nights
when the stars come out
oh the stars come out
and shine
and they burn so bright
they drown the downtown lights
when the stars come out
oh when the stars come out

verse 2
everybodys somebody someday
everybodys got a part to play
everybodys tryin to find a way
to say what needs sayin
everybodys got a friend of a friend
somebody that can get you in
beggin angels for a sin
in a game that were all playin
see chris stapleton liveget tickets as low as 36you might also likeprechorus
you and i were gamblers holdin cards that we cant see
and im bettin on you and youre bettin on me

chorus
one of those la nights
when the stars come out
oh the stars come out
and shine
and they burn so bright
they drown the downtown lights
when the stars come out
oh when the stars come out

bridge
down on the freeway the sun is out of sight
and i got a feelin tonight might be the night
yeah tonight might be the night

chorus
one of those la nights
when the stars come out
oh the stars come out
and shine
and they burn so bright
they drown the downtown lights
when the stars come out
oh when the stars come out
outro
when the stars come out ohh
when the stars come outembed"
