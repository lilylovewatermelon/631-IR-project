you must be happy with yourself
you think youre so much better than me
why do you love to see me fail so much
cause on that day you crawl back on your knees
tell me who will save you

chorus
when theres no one else around
and you cant turn to me
tell me where will you be
when its over
and all this pride you hold inside
is gone
tell me where will you hide
when its over
and everything you know is said and done
when its over where will you run

verse 2
do your memories haunt your dreams
do they simply seem to have a mind of their own
tell me what the emptiness brings
when everything you know is everything but gone
tell me who will save you

when theres no one else around
and you cant turn to me
tell me where will you be
when its over
and all this pride you hold inside
is gone
tell me where will you hide
when its over
and everything you know is said and done
when its over where will you run

verse 3
you cant hold your world together now
everyone sees who you really are
when your castle crumbles at your feet
dont you run to me

outro
when its over
and all this pride you hold inside is dying
where will you hide
when its over
and all this pride you hold inside has died
tell me where will you hide
when its over
and everything you know is said and done
when its over where will you runembed"
