no billy i havent done that dance since my wife died
there’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do the scarn

verse 1
dont ask questions you dont wanna know
learned my lesson way too long ago
to be talkin’ to you belladonna
shoulda taken a break not an oxford comma
take what i want when i wanna
and i want ya

prechorus
bad bad news
one of us is gonna lose
im the powder youre the fuse
just add some friction

chorus
you are my strange addiction
you are my strange addiction
my doctors cant explain
my symptoms or my pain
but you are my strange addiction

interlude
im really really sorry i think i was just relieved
to see that michael scarn got his confidence back
yeah michael the movie is amazing
its like one of the best movies ive ever seen in my life
you might also likeverse 2
deadly fever please dont ever break
be my reliever ’cause i don’t self medicate
and it burns like a gin and i like it
put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
hurts but i know how to hide it kinda like it teh

prechorus
bad bad news
one of us is gonna lose
im the powder you’re the fuse
just add some friction

chorus
you are my strange addiction
you are my strange addiction
my doctors cant explain
my symptoms or my pain
but you are my strange addiction

bridge
bite my glass set myself on fire
cant you tell im crass can’t you tell im wired
tell me nothing lasts like i dont know
you could kiss my— asking about my motto
interlude
you should enter it in festivals or carnivals
thoughts pretty good reaction
pretty cool right

chorus
you are my strange addiction
you are my strange addiction
my doctors cant explain
my symptoms or my pain
but you are my strange addiction

outro
