run that back turbo

verse 1 lil baby
you can get the biggest chanel bag in the store if you want it
i gave em the drip they sucked it up i got em moanin
i bought a new patek i had the watch so i twotoned em
takin these drugs im gon be up until the mornin
that aint your car you just a leaser you dont own it
if im in the club i got that fire when im performin
the backend just came in in all hundreds
vibes galore cute shit they all on us
im from atlanta where young niggas run shit
i know they hatin on me but i dont read comments
whenever i tell her to come she comin
whenever its smoke we aint runnin

chorus lil baby
drip too hard dont stand too close
you gon fuck around and drown off this wave
doin all these shows ive been on the road
i dont care where i go long as i get paid
bad lil vibe she been on my mind
soon as i get back she gettin slayed
do this all the time this aint no surprise
every other night another movie gettin made
drip too hard dont stand too close
you gon fuck around and drown off this wave
doin all these shows ive been on the road
i dont care where i go long as i get paid
bad lil vibe she been on my mind
soon as i get back she gettin slayed
do this all the time this aint no surprise
every other night another movie gettin made
you might also likeverse 2 gunna
yeah every other night another dollar gettin made
every other night started with a good day
i feel like a child i got boogers in the face
diamonds dancin in the dial like this shit is a parade
i dont want your chain young gonwunna not a slave
i had to draw the line too many bitches gettin saved
tsa harass me so i took a private plane
these pussy niggas lackin why im workin on my aim
drip too hard too hard charge it to the card to the card
designer to the ground i can barely spell the names
drip too hard caution on the floor
you gon fuck around and drown tryna ride a nigga wave

chorus lil baby
drip too hard dont stand too close
you gon fuck around and drown off this wave
doin all these shows ive been on the road
i dont care where i go long as i get paid
bad lil vibe she been on my mind
soon as i get back she gettin slayed
do this all the time this aint no surprise
every other night another movie gettin made
drip too hard dont stand too close
you gon fuck around and drown off this wave
doin all these shows ive been on the road
i dont care where i go long as i get paid
bad lil vibe she been on my mind
soon as i get back she gettin slayed
do this all the time this aint no surprise
every other night another movie gettin made152embed"
