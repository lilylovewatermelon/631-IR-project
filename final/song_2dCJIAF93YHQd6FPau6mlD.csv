the whole week on the beach sunburns
held aboard up on the floor of a cheap hotel
give a rebel yell off the balcony heh
oh we were proud to be from
the dirty south yall keep it down
but we turn it up and they kicked us out
we might have left but we didnt leave no doubt
what we were all about

chorus
everybody knew we brought the party
we were always getting something started
werent worried bout the consequences
yeah we liked to run through the fences
each town learned to love and hate us
im pretty sure theyre still talking bout us
i cant tell you everything but ill tell you one
they wont forget about us

postchorus
all our friends
all the trouble we got in
and wed all do it all again

verse 2
hey yall remember that one time it was overtime
laid the heat on the quarterback
he dropped the ball we ran it back
then after that
we hotwired a team bus got her fired up
drove it round bout half the night
saw the blue lights they let us go
cause we brought the trophy home yeah
