if youre evil and youre on the rise
you can count on the four of us takin you down
cause were good and evil never beats us
well win the fight and then go out for pizzas

chorus zach callison
we are the crystal gems
we’ll always save the day
and if you think we can’t
we’ll always find a way
that’s why the people of this world believe in
garnet amethyst and pearl and steven

verse 2 deedee magno hall
if you could only know what we really are
when we arrived on earth from out beyond your star
we were amazed to find your beauty and your worth
and we will protect your kind and we will protect your earth
and we will protect your earth
and we will protect you

verse 3 estelle deedee magno hall michaela dietz  zach callison
i will fight for the place where i’m free
to live together and exist as me
i will fight in the name of rose quartz
and everything that she believed in
i will fight for the world i was made in
the earth is everything i’ve ever known
i will fight to be everything that everybody wants me to be when i’m grown
