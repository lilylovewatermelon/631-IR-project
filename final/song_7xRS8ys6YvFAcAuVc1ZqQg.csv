verse 1
not sayin you want to
not sayin’ you would
not sayin you have to
im just sayin’ you could
let it fall into motion
carve our names in the wood
oh id drink up an ocean
just to show you i could

chorus
fallin in love to a little tiny speaker
rained so hard that our tent started leakin on us
we aint got much what we got its enough
when the going gets tough
we make our own good luck

verse 2
not sayin you want to
not sayin you would
i’m not sayin’ you have to
just sayin we could
take all of the potion
take hold of my hand
ignore all the omens
’cause we know we can
you might also likechorus
fallin in love to a little tiny speaker
rained so hard that our tent started leakin on us
we aint got much what we got it’s enough
when the going gets tough
we make our own good luck
fallin in love to a little tiny speaker
rained so hard that our tent started leakin on us
we aint got much what we got its enough
when the going gets tough
we make our own good luck
