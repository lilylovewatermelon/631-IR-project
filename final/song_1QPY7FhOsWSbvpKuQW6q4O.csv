all right children
the lights are out and the partys over
its time for me doctor d to start running
and say goodbye for a little while

and i know youre gonna miss me
so ill leave you with this
you know that big ball of radiation we call the sun
well itll burst you into flames
if you stay in one place too long
that is if the static dont get you first
so remember even if youre dusted
you may be gone
but out here in the desert
your shadow lives on without you
this is dr death defying signing off
