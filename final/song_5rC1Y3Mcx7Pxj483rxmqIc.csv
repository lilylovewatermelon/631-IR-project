wont you stayayayayay
ayayayayayayayay
wont you stay

verse 1
you said it once said it twice
that it hurts but i do it again
i dont change i wont learn cause i cant let it end
said its gone let it be cause you dont need a friend
maybe i do
i pull and you push and we cry til we laugh again
i promise you you promise me back and then why
does it all fall apart in just a matter of time

prechorus
so im thinking maybe youve made up your mind
cause youre distant distant
and i cant stand to fight no more
so please dont make me hurt you like i do
i dont really trust myself to leave
even though i hear you saying baby no no

chorus
no no no no no no no
i cant take no more of this
and im knock knock knockin on your door
asking if you still let me in
wont you stayayayayay
ayayayayayayayay
wont you stay

memories of the fun that we had on photographs on the wall
now i cant make you smile or hear you laugh anymore
and i cant help but ask whats the point of it all
tell me baby
call it love call it lame call it joy call it pain but i fell
call it girl what you may but its painful as hell
to be here while youre there dont need nobody else

prechorus
so im thinking maybe youve made up your mind
cause youre distant distant
and i cant stand to fight no more
so please dont make me hurt you like i do
i dont really trust myself to leave even though youre telling me

i cant take no more of this
and im knock knock knockin on your door
