and i had a dream
about my old school
and she was there all pink and gold and glittering
i threw my arms around her legs
came to weeping came to weeping
came to weeping came to weeping

prechorus
and i heard your voice as clear as day
and you told me i should concentrate
it was all so strange and so surreal
that a ghost should be so practical
only if for a night

chorus
and the only solution was to stand and fight
and my body was bruised and i was set alight
but you came over me like some holy rite
and although i was burning youre the only light
only if for a night

verse 2
and the grass was so green against my new clothes
and i did cartwheels in your honor
dancing on tiptoes
my own secret ceremonials
before the service began
in the graveyard doing handstands

and i heard your voice as clear as day
and you told me i should concentrate
it was all so strange and so surreal
that a ghost should be so practical
only if for a night

chorus
and the only solution was to stand and fight
and my body was bruised and i was set alight
but you came over me like some holy rite
and although i was burning youre the only light
only if for a night

my doe my dear my darling
tell me what all the sighing is about
tell me what all the sighing is about

prechorus
and i heard your voice as clear as day
and you told me i should concentrate
it was all so strange and so surreal
that a ghost should be so practical
