verse
i think that we should listen to
all of the signs that this love provides
we know all is forgiven
once you hear the truth from me and not the lies
i wont put my pain on you
pain on me lets paint a view
imagination
vibrate with me cause i see what youre seein
know you see all of the colors
how bout you level me up
in the bedroom
come and get under the covers
so we can be one be one huh

rollin all around til you cant take it
aint goin nowhere girl just face it
you want the same thing love
