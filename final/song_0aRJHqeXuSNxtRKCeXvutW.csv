well its a long hot night
and the stars are shining kinda extra bright
sitting on the back porch gliding
whetting my appetite

well im a sixpack high
and start missing the light of my babys eyes
wasnt it beautiful the kind of a soul they said would never die

verse 2
well its muggy in the shack
and the backwoods are black
cause the clouds hid the moon away
the light from my cigarette flickers in the dark
the only way she knows im here
then suddenly the sounds of the fiddles and accordions
sweetly begin to play and i can almost hear her sweet voice say

chorus
come on joe just count to ten
pull yourself together again
and come on joe you gotta get hold of this mood youre in
come on joe you gotta be strong
youre still young and life goes on to carry on
till were together again
see george strait liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likeverse 3
hey i know shes right
but its hard to fight when youre hurting so
i tried to walk out of that door before but i just cant go
with the tears and the laughter in every rafter in every room
wasnt it beautiful
wasnt it the kind of happiness and glow

chorus

outro
come on joe
hey come on joe
to carry on till were together againembed"
