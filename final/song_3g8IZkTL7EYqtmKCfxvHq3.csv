verse 1 nicki minaj
how could it be little me
had the power to be the best b in the league
yeah inevitably but could it be little me
you was heckling me now its monotony winning regularly yo
i catch rec on recreation so i exceed all your expectations
bitches aint got it in em i kill em and then i skin em
the contract was signed but i am the addendum
soso where my dawgs at randy
mamamatter fact get off my dick bitch andy
cacacacacacause everything is fine and dandy
go against me now i dare you bambi
half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
i aint even detonate the bombs in the arsenal
before the storm comes the calm
hope you can take the heat like lebron
ah ahahahahah ahahah
im the best now
anybody with some money should invest now
soccer moms need to organize a pep rall
your game over bitch gatorade wet towel

verse 2 kanye west
this is the moment grab your kodak
while im flying with a flow that is
the greatest throwback since that nolan ryan
and the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
and the lights even brighter baby stand next to my fire
only higher is messiah or notes from mariah
rari six hundred horses thats my chariot of fire
where we flyin they cant find us all them broke days behind us
i just took your whole life and redesigned it uh
i think im marc jacobs i think im lagerfeld
i think without makeup you still bad as hell
ima grab your waist then ima grab your face and
then ima taste it then ima blaze it
hello all my bad girls this just in
yeezy hurt the beat like he fucked her best friend
and she let him back in and he just did it again
he crazy he blazin he off the deep end
im blazin im flagrant im crazy im sayin
too much for the world so they abbreviate him
his past is her fave his stats is amaze
her dress is just perf uh prada colored beige
its obvi we the ish and im rolling with my brits
so real you so trill baby everything legit
how you feel they say we crazed cause our styles so diff
theyll be jeal when we in the mag lookin magnif
as if i aint used magnums on your favorite bad bitch
fuck these background niggas i was tryna adlib
