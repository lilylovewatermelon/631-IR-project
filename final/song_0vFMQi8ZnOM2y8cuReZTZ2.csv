dry lightning cracks across the skies
those storm clouds gather in her eyes
her daddy was a mean old mister
mama was an angel in the ground
the weatherman called for a twister
she prayed blow it down

prechorus
theres not enough rain in oklahoma
to wash the sins out of that house
theres not enough wind in oklahoma
to rip the nails out of the past

chorus
shatter every window til its all blown away
every brick every board every slamming door blown away
til theres nothing left standing nothing left of yesterday
every tearsoaked whiskey memory blown away
blown away blown away

verse 2
she heard those sirens screamin out
her daddy laid there passed out on the couch
she locked herself in the cellar
listened to the screamin of the wind
some people called it taking shelter
she called it sweet revenge

every tearsoaked whiskey memory blown away
