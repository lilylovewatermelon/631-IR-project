lovin you forever cant be wrong
even though youre not here wont move on
ah thats how we played it

your face is like a melody

your soul is hauntin me
and tellin me that everything is fine
but i wish i was dead dead like you

im scared that you wont be waiting on the other side
every time i close my eyes
