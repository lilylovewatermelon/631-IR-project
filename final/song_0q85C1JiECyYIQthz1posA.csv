i love the taste of you in the morning
keep me warm and
nothin else nothin more important
makes me wanna believe in love mmm
i love the thought of us in the evening
crave the feeling
the way you feel somethin bout its healing
im praying we dont fuck this up ahahah babe

prechorus
others that ive had had to impress me before
but i knew you were the real thing
when you walked through the door
i didnt think that i would have to spell it out

chorus
dont put the bands put the bands on me
oh my love oh my love is free
aint no price on my loyalty
no shit got me right where you want me baby
could i be more obvious ooh
hard to think when im under you
tell you all of my dirty truths
no shit got me right where you want me baby
could i be more obvious
you might also likeverse 2
maybe if im lucky you might stay the afternoon
if you gotta work just promise me youll come back soon
maybe you should pack a suitcase too too
i love the thought of you never leavin no
days repeatin
gettin steps up on the treadmill while you sleepin
never thought id believe in love again

prechorus
others that ive had had to impress me before ooh
but i knew you were the real thing
when you walked through the door
i didnt think that i would have to spell it out

chorus
dont put the bands put the bands on me
oh my love oh my love is free
aint no price on my loyalty
no shit got me right where you want me baby
could i be more obvious ooh
hard to think when im under you
tell you all of my dirty truths
no shit got me right where you want me baby
could i be more obvious obvious39embed"
