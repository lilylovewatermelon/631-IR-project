a foreign beauty so exotic
when she smiled at me she took my breath away
shes reminiscent of a goddess
its a shame that we could not communicate
how do i say

chorus usher
how do i say hello i just wanna talk to you
how do i say youre beautiful when i cant take my eyes off you
i dont wanna say the wrong thing i wanna use the right words to impress you
my baby how do i say how do i say
how do i say

verse 2 usher
the room was filled with a sweet aroma
when she danced her hips moved oh so sensuous
she speaks with her body so hypnotic
in the language that i never will forget

prechorus usher
i hear her calling
spinning around in the crowd till she found me
then she started moving closer and closer
does she know that i want her i want her
i wanna be with her tonight
so i caressed her face kissed her lips
all my life ive never felt quite like this
ive never had a loss for words
one kiss from her has got me speechless

baby lets engage in a deep conversation
in the body language we speak wont need any translation
an odyssey of physical pleasure
