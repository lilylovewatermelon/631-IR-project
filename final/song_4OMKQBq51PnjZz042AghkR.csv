verse 1
uh yeah outside i can hear em bussin bussin
and the police they rushin
go to my head like concussion
id rather not have this discussion
my mind racing for the elevation of the toxic in my blood
where my mind don’t know now
but i know where it was
i need nikki where is nikki
baby girl please come and get me
now i’m old and shit is trippy but i know that god is with me
this that baby mama drama
give a fuck about a man i know ima
be there for my son talking with my sister it begun
end of the month that’s the worst of the month
but the first of the month put the weed in the blunt
that welfare check check
won’t ever bounce like my daddy did
but i’m glad he did cause it made me strong
made me help somebody with this song
paint the picture of my life
growing up what it was like
section 8 grab a plate
food for thought gravitate
food stamps social services tryna take me away
my mama locked up i pray to god that i see her today
maybe not maybe so west deer park that’s all i know
just me and my homies people that know me
only ones that know
around my way around my way
living day by day living day by day
corn rows and hang time automatics and gang signs
fiveo with them k9s
manhunt when its game time
they was robbing the ice cream man in broad day
now i’m running from the police
don’t know how but i got away
selling weed to my homies
and a girl in the building that know me
at 15 such a fiend for the shit that i seen
all my homies smoking green fucking bitches sipping lean
it was king it was cool seemed like something i should do
such a youngin such a fool
now i’m breaking into school
cause my homie told me to
what to do what would you
when will i lose my anonymity
and become one with the enemy
tell me would i be the enemy
feel like nobody in front of me
i can feel the vibe
you might also likeinterlude
bobby what are you thinking
what are you dreaming about
bobby what’s inside
what are you thinking right now
what are you thinking
go to sleep

verse 2
i guess maybe i was thinking things would be different now
cause when i wake up my dreams fade
everything cascade
in this vanilla sky i feel like david aames
why must i open my eyes
i wish i could stay asleep forever
attain every goal i wanted and watch it repeat forever
will it happen maybe never
maybe so i got to know—but tell me why uh
i picture myself at the top but i know that i’m dreaming
will i wake up before i finally confront all my demons
maybe not—all i know is this life i live
i can’t live it no longer
wish i was stronger wish that i could survive
turn on the tv let it wash my brain
pretend that family’s my family to avoid the pain
hello children how was school
it was good how bout you
i love you i love you son i love mama too
are you ready for dinner
i’m able to set the table
til i snap out the fable when that tv turn off
and i realize i’m back in hell
