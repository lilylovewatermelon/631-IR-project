spent the night with a friend of mine and a handle of good whiskey
we picked guitars and talked about how the glory days we missed them
and it didnt take too long to find the truth inside that bottle
cast a sea so long ago was a message from my father

chorus
you keep your heart above your head and your eyes wide open
so this world cant find a way to leave you cold
and know youre not the only ship out on the ocean
save your strength for things that you can change
forgive the ones you cant
youve got to let it go

verse 2
looking back now on my life i cant say i regret it
and all the places that i ended up not the way ma would have had it
but you only get one chance at life to leave your mark upon it
and when a pony he comes riding by you better set your sweet ass on it

chorus
you keep your heart above your head and your eyes wide open
so this world cant find a way to leave you cold
and know youre not the only ship out on the ocean
save your strength for things that you can change
forgive the ones you cant
youve got to let it go

like a sweet sunset in georgia let it go
and like the fear that grabs a hold of you let it go
let it go

chorus
but keep your heart above your head and your eyes wide open
so this world cant find a way to leave you cold
and know youre not the only ship out on the ocean
save your strength for things that you can change
forgive the ones you cant
youve got to let it go3embed"
