so lets go deadbolt your shed door
cram your paper money snug closer than before
chandeliers are falling in graveyard rows
and your eyes are shifting dials like am radios

verse 2
snowed over river melted more last night
still the same to shovel windshields of spidered ice
yes yes mother i mean to be baptized
seeds that make the higher ground grow and multiply

chorus
drive to rubidoux in the middle of the night
bourbon and a pistol in the dash out of sight
what did you expect romantic isle of wight
just empty desert light

verse 3
few feet float above these persian throw rugs
and tuck themselves in percussion as succession was
tonight as single simple folk played themselves low
just like talking city blues down in the hallway low

chorus
drive to rubidoux in the middle of the night
bourbon and a pistol in the dash out of sight
what did you expect romantic isle of wight
just empty desert light
see cold war kids liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likebridge
i suggest that you respect the deal
and keep your nose out of business of
priests and holy men the life you have chosen
is filled with dirty fingernails and
lost and founds and cancelled appointments

verse 4
10 more avenues time to choose
and theres rain thatll fall down on five
theres 50 doors to choose from and theres many more
many more inside inside inside
well the nighttimes going to come
the nighttimes going to come

chorus
drive to rubidoux in the middle of the night
bourbon and a pistol in the dash out of sight
what did you expect romantic isle of wight
just empty desert light

outro
drive to rubidoux in the middle of the night
drive to rubidoux in the middle of the night
drive to rubidoux in the middle of the night
just empty desert light
its just empty desert light
its just empty desert light
