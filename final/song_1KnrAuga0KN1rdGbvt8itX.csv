some girls go to church on sunday
live life by the golden rule
you got girls gonna graduate one day
summa cum laude from party school

chorus
some they walk the straight and narrow
some girls they just dont care
well good girls go to heaven
bad girls go everywhere

verse 2
some girls oh theyre into heavy metal
and dance with the devil everywhere they go
others of em cut a rug to the fiddle
and dance to the rhythm of a cottoneyed joe

chorus
some they walk the straight and narrow
some girls they just dont care
well good girls go to heaven
bad girls go everywhere

verse 3
miss highfalutin likes to sip fine champagne
prim and proper and drippin in diamond rings
little sister wears high heals and blue jeans
a long neck drinkin certified wild thing

some they walk the straight and narrow
some girls they just dont care
good girls go to heaven
bad girls go everywhere

good girls go to heaven
bad girls go everywhereembed"
