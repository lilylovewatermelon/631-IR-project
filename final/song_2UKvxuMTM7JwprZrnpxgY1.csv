saw you on the side of the road
i could see you were walkin slow
drinkin a slurpee
in a peach baseball cap
fallin in my lap
you were so thirsty

prechorus
could you love me instead
of all the boyfriends you get
know id make you forget
about all of those rich fuckboys

chorus
kiss it off me
if youre gonna break my heart
this is a good start
kiss it off me

verse 2
you always bite your lip
when youre feelin it
as we move slowly
and your peach baseball cap
is tossed under the rack
of clothes and your jewelry
you might also likeprechorus
and you beg for it
in the morning again
before you go to the gym
said its a bad habit you just cant quit

chorus
kiss it off me
if youre gonna break my heart
this is a good start
kiss it off me

bridge

chorus
kiss it off me
if youre gonna break my heart
this is a good start
kiss it off me
if youre gonna break my heart
this is a good start
kiss it off me3embed"
