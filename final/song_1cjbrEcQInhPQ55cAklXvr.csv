in real life im waking up alone
its one more night you didnt make it home
and one more time you wont pick up the phone
in real life you never bring me flowers
when youre here its only for an hour
im getting used to being on my own

prechorus
because in real life youre not what i thought
real life this isnt what i want
guess things arent always what they seem

chorus
but in my dreams im waking up to roses
champagne kisses
and i know its always always gonna be gonna be this way
in my dreams youre standing right beside me
two hearts finally colliding
then i wake up and realize realize this is real life

postchorus
real life this is real life
real life real life
real life whoaoh whoaoh whoaoh oh

in real life it doesnt always work out
people fall in love and then they fall out
hearts can break and never make a sound

prechorus
because in real life youre not what i thought
real life this isnt what i want
guess things arent always what they seem

chorus
but in my dreams im waking up to roses
champagne kisses
and i know its always always gonna be gonna be this way
in my dreams youre standing right beside me
two hearts finally colliding
then i wake up and realize realize this is real life

bridge
just when i thought this was all real life could be
yeah yeah yeah yeah
somebody came along and made my dream reality

chorus
and now in real life im waking up to roses
champagne kisses
and i know its always always gonna be gonna be this way
in my dreams hes standing right beside me
two hearts finally colliding
when i wake up i realize realize this is real life3embed"
