ayy ayy how you bangin back there
say it im in the studio right now tell em what it is
yeah yeah oh oh
slime yeah slime

verse 1
ima say im sorry for all of the shit that i had did
and im thankful for that shit that you had done while we was kids
been puttin my soul up in this music and im hopin that you hear it
im steady screamin 4k trey im tryna split a nigga wig
all these bitches tellin lies but if you know me dont think twice
instead of doin whats wrong lil bitch you do whats right
i feel like fuck livin disguised
i showed my wrong dont hide my right
you saw me down you tryna show off for the hype
hey dont do that lame ass shit
i fuck with you but you dont fuck with me
but somehow we still find a way to text each other fore we go to sleep
i dont know shit about no jodeci
but you gon suck me to his music while i sit back think and smoke my weed
these killers round me they look up to me
i got them bodies i wont say no names i hope it dont catch up to me
you really mad that you cant fuck with me
you xd me out you aint have to fuck with me
nigga why you came to fuck with me

told you that id do anything for you
i just dont know what they want
and i wasnt frontin when i told you i love you
girl you the only one that i want
these niggas be cappin
we pull up slangin that static
dont do no talkin have your shit together when we come
i got too many brothers that done died by the gun
i murder from the heart so you can say what you want

verse 2
they say she fucked with that nigga i wish i caught her
smokin on this cherry pie fuckin your favorite athlete daughter
they say that nigga that been trippin put that bitch in order
i just came through swervin nigga in a hellcat charger
jigga was swervin behind me turn up in a benz
studio session go in
tell em lil niggas i said for them not to walk in
up with the glock let off ten
poppin them bottles of lean with instagram models stayin at the drury inn
i know she dont drink she said that she drink i let her just sip what she can
i say lil ben you hear them talkin he say uhuh
i hit the gas and then we turn up on they ass
ran up my money and they hear it when i talk now
them bitches know its over with they in my past
cause you left ice on my heart
and i could say that ho wasnt wrong you wasnt right from the start
i wish you could exchange my time for that watch that i bought
really was tryna make you mine i dont know what i had thought
chorus
told you that id do anything for you
i just dont know what they want
and i wasnt frontin when i told you i love you
girl you the only one that i want
these niggas be cappin
we pull up slangin that static
dont do no talkin have your shit together when we come
i got too many brothers that done died by the gun
i murder from the heart so you can say what you want27embed"
