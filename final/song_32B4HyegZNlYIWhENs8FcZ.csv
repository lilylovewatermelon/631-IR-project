i am known

verse 1 yung carecrow
triple six serpents of death crawlin under your skin
if i take a bet you can guess who gon win
i walk in the jects without no protection
i function in hoods every city im in
im that greyborn gorilla out the concrete jungle
duckin from the dope cause i just shot a bundle
carecrow make the chopper drum shots rumble
carecrow got the dope game from my uncle
huh still prefer the drugs over bitches
better watch your side that you pickin
snakes start hissin heads go missing
rest in piss to the ones im killing
chief keef drilling codeine spilling
blood on my linen from the cuts never healing
hot boys out the crypt with a mouth full of scripts
body bags zip when the gun hammer click

verse 2 7th ward dragon
ruby leveled up
ruby leveled up
ruby gon global epidemic proportion
i got the torch and now im lighting up gas on the porch
kick back now im bored
lick asked for the short flick ash for the sport uh
ruby wrestles several devils in the 7th ward
but ruby cant afford to move towards the horde just yet
7th ward dragon with a fiery sword through the neck
engulfed in flames engulfed in blood
as it rains from the red heaven that yung plague has escaped
levitate over lake pontchartrain
set em straight no we are not the same
yeah its hard to remain when youre selfslain
yeah its all that remains when youre selfmade
ruby bout to take a second breath uh
embrace yourself because all that remains is the bloodstainssee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like92embed"
