oh were not on the same place
show me in the same light
feels right when we take flight
clothes off cause shes so soft
this aint a fair fight
i wanna shed light on the subject
ill get her wetter than ever
four letters are never the question
she likes when im messy
and i like when shes undressing

chorus zayn
youre looking in the wrong place for my love
dont think because youre with me this is real
youre looking in the wrong place for my love
dont stop what youre doing cause i like how youre doing it

verse 2 kehlani kehlani  zayn
here with you cause you got the right vibe
seems like you probably got a dope mind
but its gotta be the right time
were only good for the night time
i see through your demeanor baby im a pleaser
i go out my way to treat you but i cant be a teacher
cause im a problem with problems i know who i am and im not no good
you can have me tonight or never i thought you understood
baby some people are meant to be loved and others just make it
so take what im willing to give and love it or hate it oh
