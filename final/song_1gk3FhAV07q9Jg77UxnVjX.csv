alright come close
let me show you everything i know
a jungle slang
spinnin round my head and i stare
while my naked fool
fresh out of an icky gooey womb
a woozy youth
dopes up on her silky smooth perfume

prechorus
right my little pooh bear wanna take a chance
wanna sip the smooth air kick it in the sand
id say i told you so but you just gonna cry
you just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

chorus
my my simple sir this aint gonna work
mind my wicked words and tipsytopsy slurs
i cant take this place no i cant take this place
i just wanna go where i can get some space

verse 2
truth be told
ive been there ive done this all before
i take your gloom
i cut it up and puff it into plumes

right my little pooh bear wanna take a chance
wanna sip the smooth air kick it in the sand
id say i told you so but you just gonna cry
you just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

chorus
my my simple sir this aint gonna work
mind my wicked words and tipsytopsy slurs
i cant take this place no i cant take this place
i just wanna go where i can get some space
bridge
hold my hand and float back to the summer time
tangled in the willows now our tongues are tied
how can i believe you how can i be nice
trippin round the tree stumps in your summer smile

prechorus
right my little pooh bear wanna take a chance
wanna sip the smooth air kick it in the sand
id say i told you so but you just gonna cry
you just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

chorus
my my simple sir this aint gonna work
mind my wicked words and tipsytopsy slurs
i cant take this place no i cant take this place
i just wanna go where i can get some space111embed"
