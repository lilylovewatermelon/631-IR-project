lately im drowning my pain with a bottle and mary jane
no matter what i take i feel the same
ive been bound by these shackles and chains
a man of convictions damn these addictions
just cant be tamed
so lately im drowning my pain with a bottle and mary jane

verse 1
coming down a back road a cloud of fat smoke rolling out my window
even though im damaged im standing on all ten toes
im lost where i should go from here i dont know
eyes gloss but the pain on my face i wont show
a prisoner inside my mind i cant get out of here
i dont know why i ignore signs when theyre so loud and clear

chorus
lately im drowning my pain with a bottle and mary jane
no matter what i take i feel the same
ive been bound by these shackles and chains
a man of convictions damn these addictions
just cant be tamed
so lately im drowning my pain with a bottle and mary jane

verse 2
no one else to turn to so i burn through another bag of pine
courage is a virtue it refers to this life of mine
i could drink a fifth of liquor and feel like im fine
i know even then id never be satisfied
i cannot pay the bills pop a couple pills and just get by
wouldnt change the pain i feel
seeing tears spill out my daughters eyes
so i pop the top on this bottle and pour it on ice
when im wrong is the only time i feel right
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus
lately im drowning my pain with a bottle and mary jane
no matter what i take i feel the same
ive been bound by these shackles and chains
a man of convictions damn these addictions
just cant be tamed
so lately im drowning my pain with a bottle and mary jane1embed"
