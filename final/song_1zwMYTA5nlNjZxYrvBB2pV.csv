i heard that youre settled down
that you found a girl and youre married now
i heard that your dreams came true
guess she gave you things i didnt give to you
old friend why are you so shy
aint like you to hold back or hide from the light

prechorus
i hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
but i couldnt stay away i couldnt fight it
i had hoped youd see my face
and that youd be reminded that for me it isnt over

chorus
never mind ill find someone like you
i wish nothing but the best for you too
dont forget me i beg
i remember you said
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

verse 2
you know how the time flies
only yesterday was the time of our lives
we were born and raised in a summer haze
bound by the surprise of our glory days

bridge
nothing compares no worries or cares
regrets and mistakes theyre memories made
who would have known how bittersweet this would taste

sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
