wheezy outta here

verse 1
sitting behind five percent you can see the chinain
lil one going crazy ready to sprrt for the ginang
if it wasn’t for google man that bitch wouldnt know my nickname
dropped a maybach truck on a watch and it was plain jane
let the door swang swang the door open smell cocaine
trafficking drug money and trap out this one lane
stepped all in mud this bitch cant wait to tie my shoelace
oh she don’t like girls bet this money make a bitch so gay

chorus
money real long big as king kong when you make the trap go jump
yellow wrist stones canary yellow stones im putting on that stuff
digging in hеr back pull out my money make a bitch bust a nut
came out thе bando just to buy diapers had to hit me a lick
i bought the tahoe from the trap money havent even seen a brick
cocaine by the kilo these days put it right on my wrist
you can still see the chain lit up sitting behind five percent

verse 2
every time i reup they gotta advance at least twenty m
i been getting richer and richer my whole career
took the dope money went and record a mixtape its rappers way out
sitting on a bail toting a big k aint even got a couch
to australia im familiar spent two million on a jet
in that dualie doing the dash i let lil dawg he hold a tec
i got molly with the crystals but i been back doing x
got a rolex on my wrist this bitch cost bout a corvette
give these niggas a couple bands and hit your face and hit your chest
i was rolling off the pill i should’ve never fucked the bitch
i got hoes these niggas married i don’t let em go they come through
i got fentanyl in my diamonds i spend a nine on a pair of shoes
i don’t even care who these niggas shot at aint nan of em got murked
i got some real killers theyll kill a nigga then go and shoot up the hearse
you think a nigga like me give a fuck ’bout a nigga shooting up the church
i gotta take this shit up with god cause im a god on the earth
i got this motherfuckin new benz i aint even drove it since it came out
couple of bad bitches they twins walkin naked through my house
cook good dope up in the kitchen i could do that top chef
bitches still claiming me i aint fucked in over a year

cartier wrist cartier watch cartier diamond buff
money real long big as king kong when you make the trap go jump
yellow wrist stones canary yellow stones im putting on that stuff
digging in her back pull out my money make a bitch bust a nut
came out the bando just to buy diapers had to hit me a lick
i bought the tahoe from the trap money havent even seen a brick
cocaine by the kilo these days put it right on my wrist
you can still see the chain lit up sitting behind five percent

outro
sitting behind five percent you can see the chinain
lil one going crazy ready to sprrt for the ginang
stepped all in mud this bitch cant wait to tie my shoelace
oh she dont like girls bet this money make a bitch so gay16embed"
