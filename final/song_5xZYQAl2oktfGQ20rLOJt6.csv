cowboys aint easy to love
and theyre harder to hold
theyd rather give you a song
than diamonds or gold
lonestar belt buckles and old faded levis
and each night begins a new day
if you dont understand him and he dont die young
hell probably just ride away

chorus waylon jennings  willie nelson
mamas dont let your babies grow up to be cowboys
dont let em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
let em be doctors and lawyers and such
mamas dont let your babies grow up to be cowboys
cause theyll never stay home and theyre always alone
even with someone they love

verse 2 willie nelson waylon jennings  both
cowboys like smoky old pool rooms
and clear mountain mornings
little warm puppies and children
and girls of the night
them that dont know him
wont like him and them that do
sometimes wont know how to take him
he aint wrong hes just different
but his pride wont let him
do things to make you think hes right

mamas dont let your babies grow up to be cowboys
dont let em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
let em be doctors and lawyers and such
mamas dont let your babies grow up to be cowboys
cause theyll never stay home and theyre always alone
even with someone they love5embed"
