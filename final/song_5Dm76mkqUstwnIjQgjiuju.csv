the one who never gave you what you need
its true i wasnt always around
back when you were reaching out for me
i know you think i didnt care
you say im just the hurtin kind
i know you think my heart wasnt there
but im begging you to think it through one more time

cause you dont know a thing about me
if you dont know how much i miss you
and you dont know a thing about me
unless you know how much i need to be with you
well i see the mistakes i made
the way i acted carelessly
but if you dont know how much i need your forgiveness
then you dont know a thing about me

if i could just go back and make it right
and take the tears away you know i would
id come to you with no excuse tonight
just a prayer that ill be understood
you tell me that im never gonna change
how ill always be the same old guy
you think theres nothing left for us to say
before you write me off take a look in my eyes
see gary allan liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likecuz you dont know a thing about me
if you dont know how much i miss you
and you dont know a thing about me
unless you know how much i need to be with you
well i see the mistakes i made
the way i acted carelessly
but if you dont know how much i need your forgiveness
then you dont know a thing about me
if you dont know how much i need your forgiveness
then you dont know a thing about me
no you dont know a thing about me
you dont know a thing about me
you dont know a thing about meembed"
