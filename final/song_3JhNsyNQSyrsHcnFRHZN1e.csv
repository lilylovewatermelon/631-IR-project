black flies on the windowsill
that we are
that we are
that we are to know
winter stole summers thrill
and the rivers cracked and cold
see the sky is no mans land
a darkened plume to stay
hope here needs a humble hand
not a fox found in your place

chorus
and no man is an island oh this i know
but cant you see oh
maybe you were the ocean when i was just a stone

verse 2
black flies on the windowsill
that we are
that we are
that we are to hold
comfort came against my will
and every story must grow old
still ill be a traveler
a gypsys reins to face
but the road is wearier
with that fool found in your place

and no man is an island oh this i know
but cant you see oh
maybe you were the ocean when i was just a stone
and no man is an island oh this i know
but cant you see oh
maybe you were the ocean when i was just a stone

so here we are

outro
and i dont wanna beg your pardon
and i dont wanna ask you why
but if i was to go my own way
would i have to pass you by
