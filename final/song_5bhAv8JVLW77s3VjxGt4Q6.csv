verse 1 tory lanez
my shorty had an abortion for me like three times
as hard is that to say that to yall
i think its much harder to keep it silent
i hide emotion behind a face thats devoted
to only winnin this race and this pussy money and violence
how could i be so selfish and need this time for myself
needing time for your health to recover im on some other
im out there sellin soap to these fiends hopin for dough for myself
23 like is there hope for myself
cause if i never have a kid again ill be pissed but i deserve it
i been cursed with all these manmade ways
in this earth that i been livin in
sorry for the present problems that i put you on and get you in
father god take my soul if i cant play my role
cause i know what im doin it aint right it aint wrong but
in mid decisions takin life just aint the way of life
cause day and night i pray to christ
in all hopes that youll forgive me shawty

verse 2 tory lanez
hopped off the phone with my dad niggas barely do speak
but im sending western union wires every two weeks
i got a brand new brother and sister i never do see
he might call to send me a blessing and tell me do me
but shit i been doin me since 14
four court cases court scene four courses caught clean
corner boy fortune unfortunate dope fiends
that got a nigga cuffed in the court with these lawyer fees
and i just felt the game callin me a
felt like mitch in paid in full
in a world thats gon pay me full
dropped out of school them teachers just called me fool
packed the black bag up im back on my bull
you always told me these problems would soon catch up to me
and shit is catchin up and fuckin me up
fourth quarter hustlin im bout to sell a three up
if the ds come im gone
pop please forgive me for this song gotta understand

verse 3 tory lanez
i really contemplated killin you
grippin and cluthin on side this pistol in my hand
used to be my fam dawg you used to be my man
solely out respect for your mom i say your name but i cant look
niggas would say they love and wanna kill you
this feelings feelin familiar i felt it for way too long
feelin like the feelin you felt was just way too strong
it felt like jealousy was just weighin in on your dome
shouldve cut ties man i shouldve cut ties
lord please lord please forgive my young eyes
i was young and unwise i was just so naive
i was tryin just believe i was tryin just perceive
but them niggas they was greed they was livin outta greed
now im livin out a dream cookin kitchen outta steam
and you gotta feel me
yacht master on a yacht looking filthy
thats why they do not feel me
you dig
chorus brianna cash
question is can you forgive baby
can you forgive me for the way i love you

i love you from a distance
it becomes so persistent
i love you from a distance

i love you from a distance
it becomes so persistent
i love you from a distance
it becomes so persistent8embed"
