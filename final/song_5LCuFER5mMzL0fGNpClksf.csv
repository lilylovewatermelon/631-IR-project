wake up
youre gonna wake up to nothin
break up
the break up is comin
and when your heart is hollow
another pill to swallow

verse 2
shake up
gotta shake up you’re freezing
make up
im going to make up my reasons
i used to say i need you
but now i gotta leave you

chorus
sister sister
what did they do to you
sister sister
what did they do to you
did they take and try to break
a heart that long
it’s so wrong

verse 3
hung up
got me hung up in draft
rung up
got me rung up in bed
you took advantage of
the one who showed you love

sister sister
what did they do to you
sister sister
what did they do to you
did they take and try to break
a heart that long
it’s so wrong

outro
its so long
so long5embed"
