once a day i rise
once a day i fall asleep with you
once a day i try but i cant find a single word
i wonder what they know
i wonder if they ever even cared at all
i wonder do they see their own reflection in the rain
and look away

chorus
everybody keep rushin
why arent we taking our time
every now and again baby i get high

verse 2
dont ask me what i think
it never really mattered what i had to say
i just keep waiting for another open door
to come up soon
dont keep it all in your head
the only place that you know nobody ever can see
youre running low on regret
no tears thats keeping you wet
i think you gettin it now

chorus
but everybody keep rushin
why arent we taking our time
every now and again baby i get high
you might also likebridge
and everybody means something
when theyre stuck on your mind
but every now and again why cant we just be fine

outro
once a day i rise
once a day i fall asleep with you
once a day i try but i cant find a single word23embed"
