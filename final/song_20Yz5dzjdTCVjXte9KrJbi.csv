cant get no job so all i know is the hustle

verse 1
yeah bankroll gettin bigger nigga
empire gettin built up givin racks to the right nigga
i can get a pack overnight aint nothin like you niggas
sippin syrup til my body numb i aint tryna catch no feelings
i aint never bite no nigga
she give me brain now cause im famous
i got these chains on gettin tangled
im in the big benz not a wrangler
its still a jeep though it aint cheap ho
im just happy they gon free rico
dodgin stank hoes and rico
on a sprinter van with them dracos
probably ridin around with starlito
ima bust it down with my lil bros
buy cars for all of my kinfolk

right back after tour aint got time for no attitude
why i cannot lose feel like i had to do it
im in my savage mood put a lil back into it
treat me with gratitude i aint no average dude
need my rims offset like cardi b
this might be my hardest beat
put the blame on pee he started me
got the game from big he guarded me
coach threw me in took me out the streets
now i get racks to rap on beats
i still know plugs with packs for cheap
killers owe favors theyll whack for free
never did fraud i got cash receipts
lotta niggas get they swag from me
dont tell nobody bout bags from me
you were not in the street you wouldnt last a week
my bitch so bad i pass on freaks
im here cause my granny be prayin for me
none of these niggas aint playin with me
got hitters thatll sit in that can for me yeah
