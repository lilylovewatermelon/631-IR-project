im calling out
only echoes respond
but i scream til my voice is gone
crouching in corners and hiding your face
im sick and tired of playing your games
im not alone
i stand amongst the voiceless
millions in the unforgiving sun
here arminarm
we parade these streets
and sing our songs and sing our songs

chorus
weve had enough
is there even anything left to explain weve had enough
am i really someone you need to restrain weve had enough
cant you listen to what we have to say weve had enough

verse 2
unknowing we lie and wait for the rain
to wash away what they have made
face down in the dirt with your foot on my back
in the distance i hear thunder crack
come on stand up
this system of power and privilege is about to come to an end
here come the clouds
the first drop is falling down falling down

weve had enough
is there even anything left to explain weve had enough
am i really someone you need to restrain weve had enough
cant you listen to what we have to say weve had enough

bridge
our futures burn in red horizons
ashes scattered in winds of change
casualty numbers are rising
now its time to raise the stakes
were meant for something more than living
just to put food on our plates
i cant help but wonder
why should we participate

chorus
now weve had enough
is there even anything left to explain weve had enough
am i really someone you need to restrain weve had enough
cant you listen to what we have to say weve had enough1embed"
