i remember saying i dont care either way
just as long as he or she is healthy im okay
then the doctor pointed to the corner of the screen
and said you see that thing right there well you know what that means
and i started wondering who he was going to be
and i thought heaven help us if hes anything like me

prechorus
hell probably climb a tree too tall and ride his bike too fast
end up every summer wearing something in a cast
hes gonna to throw a ball and break some glass in a window down the street

chorus
hes gonna get in trouble hes going to get in fights
im gonna lose my temper and some sleep
its safe to say that im gonna to get my payback if hes anything like me

verse 2
i can see him right now knees all skinned up
with a magnifying glass tryna melt a tonka truck
wont he be a sight with his football helmet on
thatll be his first love til his first love comes along
hell get his heart broke by the time hes in his teens
and heaven help him if hes anything like me
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeprechorus
hell probably stay out too late and drive his car too fast
get a speeding ticket hell pay for mowing grass
hes gonna get caught skipping class and be grounded for a week

chorus
hes gonna get in trouble were gonna get in fights
im gonna lose my temper and some sleep
its safe to say that im gonna get my payback if hes anything like me

bridge
hes gonna love me and hate me along the way
years are gonna fly by i already dread the day

chorus
hes gonna hug his momma hes gonna shake my hand
hes going to act like he cant wait to leave
but as he drives out hell cry his eyes out
if hes anything like me

outro
theres worse folks to be like
aw hell be alright
if hes anything like me1embed"
