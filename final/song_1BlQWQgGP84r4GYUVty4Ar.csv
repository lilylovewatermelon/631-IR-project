if i could give this all back
i would be home in the morning
id wake up in a cold sweat
take a flight back to the city i was born in
and i would wipe myself clean
of what i knew was unimportant
id want typical things
id try to fit back into all my old clothing

prechorus
and i would prove myself wrong
that all along the problem was me
with all my bitterness gone
happy id be

chorus
ill move back home forever ill feed the dogs
and ill put all my pieces back together
where they belong and ill say
im a mess im a mess oh god im a mess
and ill take 89 to boston see my love
and ill help her set up her new apartment
and well get drunk and shell say
shit youre a mess youre a mess good god youre a mess
oh youre a mess youre a mess good god
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 104you might also likeverse 2
so i paid off my debts but i found the world boring
so i called my old friends but they only ever ask me how tour is
and theres still weight on my back i just try to ignore it
i guess the stage was my mask
i forgot the way i looked before i wore it

prechorus
and i would prove myself wrong
that all along the problem was me
with all my bitterness gone
happy ill be

chorus
ill move back home forever ill feed the dogs
and ill put all my pieces back together
where they belong and ill say
im a mess im a mess oh god im a mess
and ill take 89 to boston see my love
and ill help her set up her new apartment
and well get drunk and shell say
shit youre a mess youre a mess good god youre a mess
oh youre a mess youre a mess

bridge
thats not what i had hoped
now i find comfort in the cold
chorus
ill move back home forever ill feed the dogs
and ill put all my pieces back together
where they belong and ill say
im a mess im a mess oh god im a mess
and ill take 89 to boston see my love
and ill help her set up her new apartment
and well get drunk and shell say
shit youre a mess youre a mess good god youre a mess
oh youre a mess youre a mess good god2embed"
