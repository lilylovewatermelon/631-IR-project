i felt the rush of the rio grande
into yellowstone and ive seen firsthand
niagra falls and the lights of vegas
ive crisscrossed down to key biscayane
and chitown via bangor maine
think ive seen it all and all i can say is

chorus
how bout them cowgirls
boys aint they something
sure are some proud girls
and you cant tell them nothing
and i tell you right now girls
may just be seven wonders
of this big old round world
but how bout them cowgirls

verse 2
shes aridin colts in steamboat springs
bailing hay outside abilene
shes trying hard to fit in in some city
but her home is neath that big blue sky
and the northern plains and those other wide
open spaces nowadays there aint as many
see george strait liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likechorus
how bout them cowgirls
boys aint they something
sure are some proud girls
and you cant tell them nothing
and i tell you right now girls
may just be seven wonders
of this big old round world
but how bout them cowgirls

bridge
boy she dont need you and she dont need me
she can do just fine on her own two feet
but she wants a man who wants her to be herself
and shell never change dont know how to hide
her stubborn will or her fighting side
but you treat her right and shell love you like no one else

chorus
yeah how bout them cowgirls
boys aint they something
sure are some proud girls
but you cant beat their loving
and i tell you right now girls
may just be seven wonders
of this big old round world
but how bout them cowgirls
how bout em boys1embed"
