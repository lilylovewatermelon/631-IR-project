this foggy line this misty morning
this railroad sign keeps me falling
i sleep outside even if its raining
its a sign im leaving in the morning

chorus
i dont wanna talk you lost me yet again
somebody left all mighty my good friend
reptile mind the good thrilled parted game
i dont wanna ask your father or anything
i dont wanna talk you lost me yet again
somebody left all mighty my good friend
reptile mind the good thrilled parted game
i dont wanna ask your father or anything

verse 2
that cancer mind that old bats carpet
to realize​ what i am marking
and some old eyes that i am watching

chorus
i dont wanna talk you lost me yet again
somebody left all mighty my good friend
reptile mind the good thrilled parted game
i dont wanna ask your father or anything

reptile mind the good thrilled parted game
i dont wanna ask your father or anything
i dont wanna talk you lost me yet again
