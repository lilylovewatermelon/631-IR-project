intro billie joe armstrong
my heart is beatin from me
i am standin all alone
please call me only
if you are comin home
waste another year flies by
waste a night or two
you taught me how to live

verse 1 billie joe armstrong
in the streets of shame
where youve lost your dreams in the rain
theres no signs of hope
the stems and seeds of the last of the dope
theres a glow of light
the st jimmy is the spark in the night
bearin gifts and trust
a fixture in the city of lust

chorus billie joe armstrong
what the hells your name ooh oohooh
whats your pleasure what is your pain ooh oohooh
do ya dream too much ooh oohooh
do you think what you need is a crutch
see green day liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeverse 2 billie joe armstrong
in the crowd of pain
st jimmy comes without any shame
he says were fucked up but were not the same
and mom and dad are the ones you can blame
chorus billie joe armstrong
jimmy died today ooh oohooh
he blew his brains out into the bay ooh oohooh
in the state of mind ooh oohooh
its my own private suicide
part ii east 12th st

intro billie joe armstrong
well nobody cares well nobody cares
does anyone care if nobody cares
well nobody cares well nobody cares
does anyone care if nobody cares

verse 3 billie joe armstrong
jesus fillin out paperwork now
at the facility on east 12th street
hes not listening to a word now
hes in his own world and hes daydreaming
hed rather be doin somethin else now
like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly
his lifes on the line with anxiety now
she had enough and he had plenty

verse 6 billie joe armstrong
here they come marchin down the street ooh oohooh
like a desperation murmur of a heartbeat ooh oohooh
comin back from the edge of town
underneath their feet
their time has come and its goin nowhere ooh oohooh
nobody ever said that life was fair now ooh oohooh
gocarts and guns are treasures they will bare
in the summer heat

prechorus billie joe armstrong
the world is spinnin round and round out of control again
the 711 to the fear of breakin down
so send my love a letterbomb
and visit me in hell
