i hope for better in november
try the same losing lucky numbers
it could be a cold night for a lifetime

hey now
you cant keep saying endlessly
my darling
how long until this affects me

say hello to good times say hello
trade up for the fast ride close our eyes
we close our eyes while the nickel and dime
take the streets completely

i i always could count on futures
that things would look up and they look up
why so hard to find a balance
between living decent and the cold and real

hey now
what is it you think you see
my darling
nows the time to disagree

say hello to good times say hello
trade up for the fast ride close our eyes
we close our eyes while the nickel and dime
take the streets completely
see jimmy eat world liveget tickets as low as 249you might also likehey now the past is told by those who win
my darling what matters is what hasnt been
hey now were wide awake and were thinking
my darling believe your voice can mean something

say hello to good times say hello
trade up for the fast ride close our eyes
we close our eyes while the nickel and dime
take the streets completely

we close our eyes while the nickel and dime
take the streets completelyembed"
