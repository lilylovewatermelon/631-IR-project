at least thats what they all say
and ive lost my count of the seasons
i dont know whats been makin me stay

manys the time that youve hurt me
thats just the way that you live
many a time is forgotten
but i never said that i could forgive

chorus
baby dont cry cry me a river
and baby dont try to wash over me yeah
baby dont cry my ship is now sailin
and ive wasted all my time in your sea
and ive wasted all my time in your sea

now that your toys have been broken
i guess you want company
there is no point in you callin
cuz im headed for my own destiny

now everyone has a problem yeah
lord knows youve always been mine
the nights are always the hardest
but tonight some how i know ill be fine
