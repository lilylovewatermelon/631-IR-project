i just want the best for you girl
but i dont think i really know what that means
i know you bring the best out of me
and i know youre sick of abstract things

but time has been kind in a weird kind of way
cause ive been waiting for this feeling to leave
if i can hold onto this feeling this long
maybe i can get you to hold me

chorus
dont you believe girl youll change the world
at least you changed the world for me
dont you believe girl youll change the world
at least you changed the world for me

verse 2
i wont be sorry if you leave me girl
cause im the worlds biggest fan of clich√©s
ill set you free then ill love like im not
hurting in the worlds worst ways
but i dont know if i can make it alone
and i dont have much more left to lose
i cant say for sure just where ill end up
i just want to end up there with you

dont you believe girl youll change the world
at least you changed the world for me
dont you believe girl youll change the world
at least you changed the world for me

bridge
when the darkness never ends and my worlds crashing in
and it starts to turn again will you believe
when i wont get over you and my world splits in two
when i just cant make it through will you believe

chorus
dont you believe girl youll change the world
at least you changed the world for me
dont you believe girl youll change the world
at least you changed the world for me

dont you believe girl youll change the world
at least you changed the world for me
dont you believe girl youll change the world
at least you changed the world for meembed"
