third michelada
second adderall
to take the edge off the crazy
jumped out the window
a human cannonball
congratulations baby

chorus
break glass
dont you look back
in case of fire
escape plan
grab what you can
in case of fire
girl you know you got burned

verse
last flight to juarez
two frozen credit cards
another borrowed vacation
girl youre a day late
and twenty thousand short
belated realizations

chorus
break glass
dont you look back
in case of fire
escape plan
grab what you can
in case of fire

bad girl
with good moves
big dreams
but a little confused
you start fires
that you cant put out
just watch it burn
watch it burn

verse
lifetime of heartbreak
and out of cigarettes
a melancholy equation
sweet summer memories
of the day we met
please change the radio station

chorus
break glass
dont you look back
in case of fire

grab what you can

bad girl
with good moves
big dreams
but a little confused
you start fires
that you cant put out
just watch it burn
just watch it burn
just watch it burn
just watch it burn
watch it burn
just watch it burn
