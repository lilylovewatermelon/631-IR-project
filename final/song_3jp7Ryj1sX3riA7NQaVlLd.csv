well its a big big city and its always the same
can never be too pretty tell me your name
is it out of line if i were simply bold and say would you be mine
because i may be a beggar and you may be the queen
i know i may be on a downer im still ready to dream
though its three oclock the time is just the time it takes for you to talk

chorus 1
so if youre lonely whyd you say youre not lonely
oh youre a silly girl i know i heard it so
its just like you to come and go
and know me no you dont even know me
youre so sweet to try oh my you caught my eye
a girl like you is just irresistible

verse 2
well its a big big city and the lights are all out
but its as much as i can do you know to figure you out
and i must confess my hearts in broken pieces and my heads a mess
and its four in the morning and im walking along
beside the ghost of every drinker here whos ever done wrong
and its you woohoo thats got me going crazy for the things you do

chorus 2
so if youre crazy i dont care you amaze me
but youre a stupid girl oh me oh my you talk
i die you smile you laugh i cry
and only a girl like you could be lonely
and its a crying shame if you would think the same
a boy like me is just irresistible

chorus 1
so if youre lonely whyd you say youre not lonely
oh youre a silly girl i know i heard it so
its just like you to come and go
and know me no you dont even know me
youre so sweet to try oh my you caught my eye
a girl like you is just irresistible15embed"
