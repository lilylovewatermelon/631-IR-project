verse 3
let a nigga brag pitt
legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
now she hit the grocery shop lookin lavish
star trek roof in that wraith of khan
girls get loose when they hear this song
a hundred on the dash get me close to god
we dont pray for love we just pray for cars
prechorus
house so empty need a centerpiece
twenty racks a table cut from ebony
cut that ivory into skinny pieces
then she clean it with her face man i love my baby ah
you talkin money need a hearin aid
you talkin bout me i dont see the shade
switch up my style i take any lane
i switch up my cup i kill any pain
