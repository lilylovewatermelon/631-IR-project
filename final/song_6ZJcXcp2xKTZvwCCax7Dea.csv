i got a call from my baby said she fed up with me
said shes found another lover in another city
said shes doing fine in new orleans

verse 2
now she got me pacing huh wondering whered i go wrong
got me going in circles like the merrygoround
gonna take the west train to louisiana in the morning

verse 3
sweet little girl from the ninth ward of new orleans
the way she dancing you could see her from tennessee
up under that red dress are legs long as the bayou trees
she got a golden smile i know shes the one for me in the room

chorus
shes atwistin and agroovin shakin and amovin
she dont know what she doin to me i
love the way that you dance and honey ive got a question
baby would you be my queen
all right now

verse 4
her name was eartha was her name i could never forget
just like the way she dipped on the bronzetiled floor
honey was movin with ease each and every step
so good that baby had my eyes at her glow
no shiny jewelry still the brightest thing illuminatin the room
