why cant you ever back down
why cant you just shut your face
oh god the feelings i feel
would get me thrown in a cage

youre the one whos always screaming at me
im the one that keeps your life so care free
what the fuck more do you want me to be
why must you do this to me

run away
i cant see
lead the way
make them pay

chorus
counting on me
always hoping ill be
there for all of your problems
in turn youre never there for me

you sucked the life out of me
you hate everything you see
i cant take this anymore
i always stay when i should leave
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeverse 2
you see the pain in my face
while you keep putting me down
inside the rage starts to build
you push me i wont go down

youre the one whos always screaming at me
im the one that keeps your life so carefree
what the fuck more do you want me to be
why must you do this to me

run away
i cant see
lead the way
make them pay

chorus
counting on me
always hoping ill be
there for all of your problems
in turn youre never there for me

you sucked the life out of me
you hate everything you see
i cant take this anymore
i always stay when i should leave
bridge
could it really be the day today
could this really make the problems go away
im gonna hurt just not this time

right now im taking all i can now
right now youve torn us all apart
right now there is nothing you can do to stop me

right now
right now
right now
right now
right now
right now
right now
right now
right

chorus
counting on me
always hoping ill be
there for all of your problems
in turn youre never there for me

you sucked the life out of me
you hate everything you see
i cant take this anymore
i always stay when i should leave
counting on me
always hoping ill be
there for all of your problems
in turn youre never there for me

you sucked the life out of me
you hate everything you see
i cant take this anymore
i always stay when i should leave1embed"
