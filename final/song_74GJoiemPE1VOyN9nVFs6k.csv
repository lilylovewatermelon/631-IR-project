and the heart is hard to translate
it has a language of its own
it talks in tongues and quiet sighs
in prayers and proclamations
in the grand deeds of great men and the smallest of gestures
in short shallow gasps

prechorus
but with all my education i cant seem to command it
and the words are all escaping and coming back all damaged
and i would put them back in poetry if i only knew how
i cant seem to understand it

chorus
and i would give all this and heaven too
i would give it all if only for a moment
that i could just understand the meaning of the word you see
cause ive been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all

verse 2
and it talks to me in tiptoes
and it sings to me inside
it cries out in the darkest night and breaks in the morning light

prechorus
but with all my education i cant seem to command it
and the words are all escaping and coming back all damaged
and i would put them back in poetry if i only knew how
i cant seem to understand it

chorus
and i would give all this and heaven too
i would give it all if only for a moment
that i could just understand the meaning of the word you see
cause ive been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all

outro
no words
poor language
it doesnt deserve such treatment
and all my stumbling phrases never amounted
to anything worth this feeling
all this heaven never could describe such a feeling as im hearing
words were never so useful
so i was screaming out a language that i never knew existed before8embed"
