i called your number bout a hundred times
and i know that you know that its me
i sat and listened for hours and hours
when the world got you down on your knees

prechorus 1
all that i wanna do is to hold you tight
love you until youre back on your feet
but its hard when im laying my heart in your hands
and you dont hand yours back to me

chorus
just give me something
i dont need it all but youre giving nothin
ill take anything at all
just give me something
cause all that i need is you
and youre giving nothin
just give me somethin

verse 2
i left you flowers outside your door
i see em dyin its killing me
feel like a man on a walkin wire
cause every chance you get youre pushin me
