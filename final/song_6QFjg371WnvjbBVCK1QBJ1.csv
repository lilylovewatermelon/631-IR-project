this is the world that we live in
i feel myself get tired
this is the world that we live in

verse 1
well maybe i was mistaken
i heard a rumor that you quit this day and age
well maybe i was mistaken

chorus 2
bless your body bless your soul
pray for peace and selfcontrol

verse 2
i gotta believe its worth it
without a victory
im so sanctified and free
well maybe im just mistaken

lesson learned and the wheels keep turning

this is the world that we live in
i cant take blame for two
this is the world that we live in
and maybe well make it through
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likechorus 2
bless your body bless your soul
reel me in and cut my throat

underneath the waterfall
baby were still in this boat

chorus 1
this is the world that we live in
i feel myself get tired
this is the world that we live in

verse 3
i had a dream that i was falling down
theres no next time around
a storm wastes its water on me
but my life was free

chorus 3
i guess its the world that we live in
its not too late for that
this is the world that we live in
and no we cant go back

this is the world that we live in
i still want something real
this is the world that we live in
i know that we can heal over time
outro
this is the world that we live in3embed"
