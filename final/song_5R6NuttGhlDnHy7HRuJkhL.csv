pipe that shit up tnt

chorus
tryna take my pain but staying the same
fuck you you can die
tryna heal my soul with the smoke see my life in that fire
tell me i aint it you dont want me you aint gotta lie
all burners fn let him suffer he aint gotta die
huh drop your stupid ass off just me and my dawg
steady tellin him how the bitch get down while he steady telling me she aint love me at all
came from the street i was ready for the beef
me and ten strapped down when we walk through the mall
i mеmber every day you would ridе me around
i remember sneaking in and out papa house
trailblazer with a glock in a bag two pounds
they got dracs they send a case
new orleans lying to my face i left my heart in no place
i spilt some r in a wraith
tell em ten and i take it to another level
go and buy another bezel
oh oh oh oh

verse
they throw signs aint no treason
ima take that dive out the deep end
standin on that slime allegiance
fuck these hoes they can go
i dont need no setback just need you to sit back
point me where that check at
aint fucked up bout money
but its comin in comin in stackin on top of each other
i aint tellin them about nothin
come through dumpin and dumpin they flip em and step on another
startin to feel a nigga gettin dumber and dumber
im knowin that i should not trust her
scarred for real allout war in the field
im holdin fifteen in my llama
never give up and thats word to my mama
making em happy mistake me for donna
show us somethin different mistake me for daddy
im the one know where the place you can find em
im the one who set the african times
she knowin i miss her she knowin im wantin her
but everything she been making me go through i been holdin against her
