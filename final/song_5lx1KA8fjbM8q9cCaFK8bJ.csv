im here at the crossroad
where my life is heading man i dont know
should i stay or should i go
cause anythings better than what ive been through

what i would give to get a sign from up above
letting me know that everything would be okay
i wish someone would pull me off from out of the mud
will anyone out there say to me

prechorus
im here for you
dont worry cause i got you
dont trip dont stress
my life seems to be heading

chorus
over the edge
feels like im heading over the edge
feels like im heading over the edge
feels like im heading over the edge
the edge the edge

verse 2
now everyday that goes by
i see things thatll make another man cry
im sitting wondering why
i cant find that someone to fit in my life
see i was searching but am i worth it
and did they ever think im good enough for love
despite my suffering i felt the loving
the blessing came when i needed it the most

and thats the sign that i received from up above
letting me know that everything would be okay
and that was that something
that pulled me out of the mud
and also was the one that said to me

im here for you
dont worry cause i got you
dont trip dont stress
my life seems to be heading

chorus

feels like im heading over the edge
