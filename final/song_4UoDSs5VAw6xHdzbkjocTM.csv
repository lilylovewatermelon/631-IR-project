daytrip took it to ten hey
fine fine

chorus
say they wanna read my mind
they really wanna read my mind
telling you right now all youll find
is a lost soul rich and blind
they say they wanna read my mind
do you really wanna read my mind
i promise all that you will find
is a lost soul rich and blind

verse 1
i know i have a purpose but i dont see the purpose
they tell me the death of me gon be the perkys
i know they laced pills i bought them on purpose
lifes unreal when deaths uncertain
its funny how the blessed ones had the most curses
heart falling to the floor if we lose another person
take three more i swear its worth it
but it aint no world tour if im laying in a hearse
i remember losing lil bro he laying in the dirt
now im bound to drop a tear or two on every single verse
good terms bad terms when they die its the worst
sometimes when im high i feel high in reverse
i aint going out like that you fuck with me you get the work
you aint gon see me in no wooden box im gonna shoot em first
i promise yall im finna touch the world yeah ima touch the earth
but hold on your girl on my line i think i may just fuck her first
yeah gotta have some crude humor
just to keep a good vibe going keep the song grooving
so all my money longer shout out bro uzi
keep my eyes in the sky cause thats where im moving

verse 2
this is dedicated to you if you felt the lowest of the low
i know how it feels you dont wanna struggle anymore
used to ball hard aint no tripledoubles anymore
bitch im talking bout my tears
turned around and faced my fears
i havent felt this low in years
we die in three like musketeers
aint too many real niggas left in here
rip to all my peers
smoking loud pack what you say i cant hear
but i still hear the fallen ones in my ears
why why do we live to die die
when its my time time time
ill leave behind my end my thirteen reasons why
chorus
