another friday night kitchen on ten
spinning you around and you lean in
you whisper dont stop dancin with me
lookin in your eyes without missing a beat

chorus
when seven spanish angels come to carry me home
the steel stops cryin and the fiddles all gone
when texas runs outta strait and memphis aint playing the blues
thats the day i stop dancin with you

verse 2
till the record dont turn and the two dont step
ill be in your arms every chance i get
ill be hanging on you like a neon moon
till california skies run outta blue

chorus
when sevеn spanish angels come to carry me homе
the steel stops cryin and the fiddles all gone
when texas runs outta strait and memphis aint playing the blues
thats the day i stop dancin with you

bridge
baby all i wanna do
is dance through this life with you oh

when seven spanish angels come to carry me home
the steel stops cryin and the fiddles all gone
when texas runs outta strait and memphis aint playing the blues
thats the day i stop dancin with you

outro
when heaven gets another pair of boots
thats the day i stop dancin with you
the day i stop dancin babyembed"
