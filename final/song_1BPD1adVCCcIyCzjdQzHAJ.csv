baby since youve been gone
i leave the tv on
gotta hear somebodys voice
i just need some kind of noise
i lay some pillows down
to wrap my arms around
i pretend im holding you
i know its sad but it is what i do
to keep me from going crazy

chorus
i can get up and face the day
just fine all by myself
go out and take on the world
and get it done like nobody else
oh but i dont do lonely well

verse 2
i got some real good friends
who check on me now and then
try to get me out at night
they say i need to get a life
its easy to say alright
when youre not the one going crazy

i can get up and face the day
just fine all by myself
go out and take on the world
and get it done like nobody else
oh but i dont do lonely well

bridge
here comes another sunset
here comes another long night

chorus
i can get up and face the day
just fine all by myself
go out and take on the world
and get it done like nobody else
oh but i dont do dont do lonely well
