almost forgot started to say
rode into the sun past everyone
hallelujah pretty mary k

verse 2
i found faith in the infirmary
theres a soldier lying in bed
with a wound to the head
calling out to pretty mary k

heres what you get
for things that havent happened yet

verse 3
i happened upon pretty mary k
but a soldier to the fore waved you away
i walk round the dock
and talk to st james
though im already done

verse 4
and ask everyone
have you seen her
pretty mary k
have you seen her
pretty mary kyou might also likeembed"
