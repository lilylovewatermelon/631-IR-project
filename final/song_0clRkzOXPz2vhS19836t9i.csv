verse 1
it feel like im doing the most
i like you im letting you know
they been running from me they whole life
but i aint into chasing no hoes
see i cut this shit and just go
if i like you im fucking you slow
dont be scared cause i keep these guns round me
never know who might come through the door
see it started one day by the store
i was lurking you know how that go
they was lacking they know we at war
hit the corner im letting it blow
boom he fell cant get up no more
im running my forehead was soaked
i hear sirens boy they getting close
dont  know how much far i can go
told god forgive me im wrong
looked up saw a bitch at the door
she waved said boy come on
im so happy she dont even know
made it in then i hit the floor
looked up she was locking the door
asked me do i still got my pole
i looked down like you already know
look my name von i know
and im from the o i know
but i aint do shit i know
dont worry you good they gone
this bitch was bad for sure
i gave her some racks for a coat
asked her do she live alone
she say nah he on his way home
