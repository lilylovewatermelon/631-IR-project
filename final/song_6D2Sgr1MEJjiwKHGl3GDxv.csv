i used to think that wed run away
one lovely pretty summer day
i remember when you would say
wed be okay come what may
i never knew you would lie to me
took everything from inside of me
your silhouette in the doorway
but before you walk away

chorus
dont say goodbye look in my eyes
so that i always will remember
frozen in time always be mine
baby boy youll be young forever
ill be over here youll be over there
ima shed a tear but i really dont care
frozen in time always be mine
baby boy youll be young forever

verse 2
i used to think that wed reunite
id be your wife in the real life
i thought that youd come back for me
and you would take me away
i never knew only as a teen
youd reappear only in my dream
your silhouette in the doorway
but before you walk away
