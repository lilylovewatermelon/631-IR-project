rushing in a small town
i forgot to call you
running low on knowhow
this beats made for two

prechorus
cause i remember that i like you
no matter what i found
she said its nice to have your friends round
were watching the television with no sound

chorus
its just you and i tonight
why dont you figure my heart out
its just you and i tonight
why dont you figure my heart out

verse 2
push your lack of chest out
look at my hair
gotta love the way you love yourself
your obsession with rocks and brown
and fucking the whole towns a reflection on your mental health

prechorus
cause i remember when i found you
much younger than you are now
and once we started having friends round
you created a television of your mouth
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likechorus
its just you and i tonight
why dont you figure my heart out
its just you and i tonight
why dont you figure my heart out

bridge
you got something to say
why dont you speak it out loud
instead of living in your head
its always the same
why dont you take your heart out
instead of living in your head

chorus
its just you and i tonight
why dont you figure my heart out
its just you and i tonight
why dont you figure my heart out73embed"
