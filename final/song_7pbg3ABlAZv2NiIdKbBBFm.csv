yeah

prechorus
up up and away hop in
feel the walls in my brain and theyre caving in
outside those walls theres a ocean i cant swim
especially with all these waves

chorus
im walkin in prada tryna solve my problems
through the night finding vibes moonlight sonata
i try to deny but you see the pills in my eyes
i tell her that im high but she dont seem surprised
walkin in prada tryna solve my problems
through the night finding vibes moonlight sonata
i try to deny but you see the pills in my eyes
i tell her that im high but she dont seem surprised uh

verse
maybe i realize that my life is a ride
buckle up hold tight take a left turn right
gps dont work cant see at night
so its getting hard to drive anxiety at a stoplight
hard to think easy to cry thats how i know somethings not right
numb the pain with fun times supermotos perc lines
remember that one time everything was alright
alright ohohoh
