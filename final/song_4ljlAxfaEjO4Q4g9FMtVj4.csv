remember me though i have to say goodbye
remember me dont let it make you cry
for even if im far away i hold you in my heart
i sing a secret song to you each night we are apart
remember me though i have to travel far
remember me each time you hear a sad guitar
know that im with you the only way that i can be
until youre in my arms again remember me
