wheezy outta here

chorus
im just kickin it with a baddie smokin on exotic yes
aint it ironic look at me now i used to sell narcotics yes
couldnt sell it whole had to break it down but now its all profit all profit
they dont like advice but i know this life just aint for everybody
i done heard too many times you cant get rich with no knowledge no knowledge
told the shawty if she mine then promise me you keep it solid keep it solid
you know bitches talk but you with a boss so we keep our business private business private
he aint never fucked you on a privatе island

she love my vibe i love her vibe i mean what can i say
and count it when you pray

refrain
oh we made a way oh made a way
i knew we would see better days
i knew we would see better days
