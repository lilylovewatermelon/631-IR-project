hold up yeah
ooh ooh ooh
somebody done told you wrong
thought it wasnt gon end off like that there huh
hot too hot too hot
too motherfuckin hot

verse 1
okay i started out all alone
cause my baby mama left me
now theres nobody at home
beginning to feel like ms jackson done got cloned
well its some real shit and im living it through this song
a moving vehicle took my family
as i slept out on the sofa in the boom boom room
i woke up very upset
i throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
my daughter my baby my baby mama all escaping me
like a candle in the wind she was my friend
like princess di before she died therefore we tried and tried again
but in the end you pay attention to the pluses
but the minuses behind make it seem like you cant win

chorus
throw your neck out
throw your back out
throw your neck out
throw your back out
throw your neck out
throw your back out
throw your neck out
throw your back out

round two a single parent what is big to do
throw a party not hardly im tryin to stay up outta that womb
or that puss puss i said puss
luther vandross couldnt make a home out of this house that we smooshed
smashed pushed to the limit smash and turned it timid
if anyone was suffering the house was feeling wicked
the cat got sold the dog got old the food got cold
both of our tempers were on swole
for the most most part you fuss fight fart
you build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
repeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash
of two stubborn minds grown folks blind to the signs

chorus
throw your neck out
throw your back out
throw your neck out
throw your back out
throw your neck out
throw your back out
throw your neck out
throw your back out

verse 3
ko knocked out by technicality
the love has kissed the canvas now the whole family is mad at me
my daughter dont want me at her pta meetings
and then my son he cant talk when i change him hes peeing
i think hes pissed i cant dismiss the matter of the fact
because he saw me and you argue now the energys coming back
set an example a positive pattern keep life on track
but im married to the music and committed to the wax
