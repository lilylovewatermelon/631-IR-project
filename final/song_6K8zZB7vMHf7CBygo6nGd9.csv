a lucky stars above but not for me
with love to lead the way
ive found more clouds of grey
than any russian play could guarantee

i was a fool to fall and get that way

although i cant dismiss the memory of her kiss
i know shes not for me

it all began so well but what an end
this is the time a feller needs a friend
although i cant dismiss the memory of her kiss
im so well aware shes not for meyou might also likeembed"
