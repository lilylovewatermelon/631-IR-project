show up in your lace
drink up little girl
and they will always let you down
hold your mothers pearl

show up in your lace
up to your cheekbones
prevention is the only cure
kiss them through windows

verse 3
throw up in your plate
look angelical
if you sleep before i arrive
ill pray for you my girl

refrain
a flower on fire
and i will always let you down
