verse
uh
soon as you hear this verse im out the record deal
exceeded twelve albums four years and thats a record still
hand to the sky like emmett till off the steppin wheel
and minus all the sex appeal your boy about to flex for real
rollsroyce cullinan fourdoors cause my son in it
im drivin down the gardiner toronto home city
with two tings that i partnered up playin putter and possum
then i puff with my girls like buttercup with a blossom
excessive needs for pussy power and suvs
that drop us to the backdoor entrances stress relief
and no less indeed the shooters is pressin like refugees
and the fee at the entranceway too high just to let em free
what cant alarm me is whose crews finna harm me
my little dudes move like new recruits in the army
and all they see is food shrimps scallops and calamari
i gallivant at a barbie while they gather back at your party
uh should let the women i fuck raw and unprotected
like fuck if you get pregnant ill keep it
keep a secret only in town for a week and im
datin women knowin im cheatin for foreign reasonin
fuck yall niggas throwin yall beef in im goin vegan with heavens timin
shootin and set designin theyre movin like i sold ten million records in record timin
i did then i kept on climbin
i started at 90 orenda plays and private agendas
tryna get fly but niggas tried and i kindly reject em
they ran my name through the mud but im finally respected
this here out of the plan this more of a god purpose
this here out of my hands thisll never feel like 2012
signin to sean kingston for clout and advance
im still proud of that man know i fell out from his hands
he didnt do me worse than — and all of his friends
them niggas out of this world they came out of the sands
im still bout it my mans
thought this shit was mad love til i see my album advance
they took radio from me i stayed proud of my stance
i kept slappin the world with hits like i powdered my hands
i wouldve been ten times bigger if — wasnt bein bitter and doubtin my chance
threatenin to shelf my whole career for five years
as if he wasnt takin money from out my advance
i got out by chance
them nights was like the super bowl watchin out from the stands
god dont make things happen by chance
and its some things you gon have to experience
im dappin up the border officer passin the clearance
he always makes a corny joke bout my rapper appearance
then i do a fake laugh that he catches like pass interference
i fly back into paris
blunt smoke ash on my terrace
my competitions just a emptyass class full of chairs
talkin to myself its lonely minus the fact that im here
im tryna see all of my niggas blossom
mariah sellin shows coachella her first year
and minus all the times we disagree im still here
pierre papi yerr bout to be a whole millionaire
davo comin out the cut with a chick with sicilian hair
mansa droppin next month you niggas should be in fear
watchin melii do the numbers like she runnin track and field
plus we just got kaash in here
and its all umbrella army on full attack mode for real
new toronto 3 ill leave it at that
and aint nobody fuckin with me folk ill keep it at that yeah
the next move is goin fully independent
and any label offer under hundred mill is just offensive
