it feels like yesterday the day you up and went away
won’t let you control my fate everything is meant to be
good things are on their way
i can only wait and see
never let your fate control you

chorus
and it feels good
everything is going the way it should
sometimes we all feel misunderstood
and thats ok but because i knew we could
never could get back together
and a wise man knows nothing lasts forever
let the truth unfold we’re better off together
and the cold wind blows it’s just the way life goes

verse 2
i don’t mind the rain sometimes
let the sky cry away
and wipe your dreary eyes
and put the cards on the table
up into the hills we go
i wanna fly high away
never let your fate control you

bridge
smoke arose from the fire and the water put out that flame
i’m so damn high and still i feel no shame
i’m a rock i’m an island and i don’t feel nothing
and when one door closes another is open
