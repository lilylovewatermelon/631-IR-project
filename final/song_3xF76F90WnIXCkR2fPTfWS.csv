dont remember the last time i sparked a blunt
was one and done i should try it
i dont remember the last time i had a drink
let me think uh weeks on weeks
whens the last time i had some good lovin
some good lovin some good touchin
i know im just feeling vulnerable
baby im tripping but i know ohoh oh oh
i hear them demons talking in my ear baby i
im tryna stay afloat but im drowning i
i run around with my own crew that i told you
talking me myself and i
swear im losing my mind

i hear em in my ear i hear em in my ear talkin

but i just stay steady walking on the right path
