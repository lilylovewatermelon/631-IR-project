well im swimmin in debt
and the moneys all gone
i aint got nothin i can call my own
work my fingers to the blood and bone
for a big disappointment when my paycheck comes

verse 2
if i only had a little i could do just fine
i could put a down payment on some peace of mind
but im hangin at the end of a credit line
lord im just livin on borrowed time

verse 3
my trucks financed through the union bank
but i dont have enough to even fill the tank
id take you for a drive girl but i just cant
cause the damned old motor wont even crank

verse 4
our trailers plenty big if we lived outside
but i cant swing the payments on a double wide
you better hold a place in that welfare line
cause im just livin on borrowed time

chorus
well if it comes real cheap but it dont come free
then it stays off limits to a guy like me
they say it brings trouble havin money to burn
i reckon thats a lesson i wont have to learn
see travis tritt liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus
well if it comes real cheap but it dont come free
then it stays off limits to a guy like me
they say it brings trouble havin money to burn
i reckon thats a lesson i wont have to learn

verse 5
yeah i bought my wife a little diamond ring
her mom said hon cant even see that thing
itll be paid off when im sixtyfive
if im lucky enough to still be alive

verse 6
even if i was to up and pass away
my family doesnt have enough to dig my grave
no tombstone just an old wood sign
sayin he was just livin on borrowed time

tag
im out there swingin from a credit line
lord im just livin on borrowed time
lord im just livin on borrowed timeembed"
