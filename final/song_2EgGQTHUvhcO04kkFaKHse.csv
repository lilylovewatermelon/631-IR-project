well i been thinking about the future
im too young to pretend
its such a waste to always look behind you
you should be lookin straight ahead

chorus
yeah im gonna have to move on
before we meet again
yeah its hard
if you hadve only seen

verse 2
1034 flinders street station
im lookin down the tracks
a uniformed man askin am i paid up
now why would i wanna be there

chorus
yeah im gonna have to move on
before we meet again
yeah its hard
if you had hadve only seen
take control
and dont be afraid of me
you might also likebridge
cause every once in a while
you think about if youre gonna get yourself together
you should be happy just to be alive
and just because you just dont feel like comin home
dont mean that youll never arrive

chorus
yeah im gonna have to move on
before we meet again
yeah its hard
if you had hadve only seen
take control
and dont be afraid of me2embed"
