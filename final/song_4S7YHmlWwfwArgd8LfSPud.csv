verse
i know i dream about her all day uh
i think about her with her clothes off uh uh
im ridin round with my system bumpin lsd uh uh
i look for ways to say i love you uh
but i aint into makin love songs uh
baby im just rappin to this lsd uh uh
she aint a stranger to the city life
i introduced her to this hippy life
we make love under pretty lights lsd acid uh
i get a feelin its a trippy night uh uh
them other drugs just dont fit me right uh uh
girl i really fuckin want love sex dream uh uh uh uh
another quarter to the face system uh uh
make no mistakes its all a leap of faith for love acid
it takes a place in feelin that you crave doin love sex dreams uh acid uh

dreamin of sharin love
my tongue at a loss for words
cause my feelings just said it all
party just started up
dreamin of sharin worlds
held this feelin for way too long
said i really wanna let it go

feelin low sometime when the light shines down
makes me high
can you feel it
