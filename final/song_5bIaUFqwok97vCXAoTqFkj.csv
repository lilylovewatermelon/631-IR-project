it is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure
that we welcome you tonight
and now we invite you to relax
let us pull up a chair
as the dining room proudly presents
your dinner

be our guest
be our guest

put our service to the test
tie your napkin round your neck cherie
and well provide the rest

soup du jour
hot hors doeuvres
why we only live to serve
try the grey stuff
its delicious
dont believe me
ask the dishes

they can sing sing sing
they can dance dance dance
after all miss this is france
and the dinner here is never second best

beef ragout

pie and pudding en flambe
well prepare and serve with flair
a culinary cabaret

youre alone
and youre scared
but the banquets all prepared
no ones gloomy or complaining
while the flatwares entertaining

i do tricks
with my fellow candlesticks
and its all in perfect taste
that you can bet

come on and lift your glass

to be our guest
if youre stressed
its fine dining we suggest
