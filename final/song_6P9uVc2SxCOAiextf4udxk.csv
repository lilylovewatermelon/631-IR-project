soarin is this allowed
i sure bet my daddy proud
a little nigga with a shaker smile
on top of the dreams is where im found
some figured i was satan bound
until i came back with a style i found
then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
cause of who i know and the trail of places
that ive stepped
how many niggas wanna hate cause i left
how could you blame me and my plan of attack
cause im risking my soul intact now im heard all over the map
only rule of thumb
it dont really matter just where you from
all that really matter is where you gon go
maybe upstate for some
but you canâ€™t rule out these cats for gone
second chances given out for some
all you gotta do is take advantage
then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
done pimpin you can think about marriage until then get it
then find yourself and lets begin
ima tell you how in a minute
ima show you how i be livin
from a long time ago a young nigga he was timid
now im zoned see things so vivid
hide my soul nah homie not even
ima zone out til i lose feeling remember
ima be gone way past november
even stay up there up there
floatin floatin hopin
i can find peace somewhere

verse 2
ballin is this allowed
without feelin like shallow hal
diamonds on the jesus piece for style
back in cleveland city we ride around
greetin my niggas with dap and pound
so if i fall i wont hit the ground
these are the things thatll make me smile
knowin this blunt might burn a while
i keep myself so lifted
i am accustomed to new heights
i feel perfect though they think its worthless
see without my flight man
everybody wanna be a critic
i have my life and i will live it
shut your mouth before i fuck it
ha my jokes they will love it
if im seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
more than likely i am faded man
you are not the shit if everywhere you go
niggas aint sitting standing round hating so
my vice is when the lights start flashin
ill be zonin all alone then
and the place where my mind is goin
filled with songs that no ones knowin
and the devil in a hot pink dress
tryna ask me for one dance
he think he slick
but my guardians protect me from his wrath
so in my place no hate shall enter
livin high up there up there
copin copin floatin
i will find peace somewhere
chorus
in my mind
it sounds like oooooooh
when im gone
it feels like oooooooh
when im zoned im feeling alright
im feeling alright im feeling alright
when im zoned im feeling alright
im feeling alright i forget about it all

instrumental bridge

chorus
in my mind
it sounds like oooooooh

when im zoned im feeling alright
im feeling alright i forget about it all81embed"
