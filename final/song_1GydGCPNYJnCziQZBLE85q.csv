chorus
no i cant be fooled
i aint playing by your rules
im known to lose my cool but thats cool
cause im known to be too cool
theres a room full of toxic people but it feels like its just me and her in the room
id rather me die before she so i mix drugs up tryna find my doom
tryna find my doom doom doom

i have a lot of troubles
i admit im running from em
walking through hollywood
i admit im astonished

from broke to rich to finding love again
i said so much has happened in the last three months
