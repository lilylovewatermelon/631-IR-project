again in the night we go into
the world unknown just let us go
i know that im breathing slow
inhaling smoke i just awoke
a bottle of pills im choking down
with dancing demons all around
but im hearing sounds
and i know im hearing voices now
with all the buildings crashing down
its armageddon again
ill drink the poison from the crown
and make a toast to the end
for all the kids and all the ones
and even some whove just begun
to feel the pain
cause they cant stand to stay awake

chorus danny
i see the streets burn every time i fall asleep
im losing all my sanity
i cant hide from the voice that speaks inside of me

verse 2 charlie scene
i saw you walk into a room
i saw a face i thought i knew
and all along it was true
it was me it wasnt you
i asked myself if its the truth
a guilty conscience isnt proof
a fingerprint well whats that do
cause gasoline can burn that too
so hide your knives and save yourself
its just you theres no one else
will i change the time will tell
why cant i dream what is this hell
so maybe i should stop this time
and draw the line and see the light
but its too late i cant this time
ive lost my mind so say goodnight

i see the streets burn every time i fall asleep
im losing all my sanity
i cant hide from the voice that speaks inside of me
i see the trees burn along with all my memories
im losing all my sanity
i cant hide from the voice that speaks inside of me

bridge danny
if i lay my head down will you admire
the way i can close my eyes tonight
and burn my conscience for the choir

verse 3 johnny 3 tears
whos to judge whos insane
watch it all wash away
save us from what weve made
it doesnt die it only fades
if i cant feel there isnt pain
another day and its all the same
i always pray i never change
it seems to me were all to blame
push your matches no more rain
burn this fucking world today

chorus danny
i see the streets burn every time i fall asleep
im losing all my sanity
i cant hide from the voice that speaks inside of me
i see the trees burn along with all my memories
im losing all my sanity
i cant hide from the voice that speaks inside of me4embed"
