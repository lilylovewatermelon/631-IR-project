ecstasy is all you need
livin in the big machine now
oh youre so vain
now your world is way too fast
nothings real and nothing lasts
and im aware
im in love but you dont care
turn your anger into lust
im still here but you dont trust at all
and ill be waiting
love and sex and loneliness
take whats yours and leave the rest
so ill survive
god its good to be alive

chorus
and im torn in pieces
im blind and waiting for you
my heart is reeling
im blind and waiting for you

verse 2
still in love with all your sins
where you stop and i begin
and ill  ill be waiting
living like a house on fire
what you fear is your desire
its hard to deal
i still love the way you feel
now this angry little girl
drowning in this petty world
and im who you run to
swallow all your bitter pills
thats what makes you beautiful
youre all or not
i dont need what you aint got

and im torn in pieces
im blind and waiting for you
my heart is reeling
im blind and waiting for you

im blind and waiting for you
im blind and waiting for you

and i cant believe its coming true

im still here waiting for you
and i cant believe its coming true
im blind and waiting for you4embed"
