i walked across an empty land
i knew the pathway like the back of my hand
i felt the earth beneath my feet
sat by the river and it made me complete

refrain
oh simple thing where have you gone
im getting old and i need something to rely on
so tell me when youre gonna let me in
im getting tired and i need somewhere to begin

verse 2
i came across a fallen tree
i felt the branches of it looking at me
is this the place we used to love
is this the place that ive been dreaming of

prechorus
oh simple thing where have you gone
im getting old and i need something to rely on
so tell me when youre gonna let me in
im getting tired and i need somewhere to begin

chorus
and if you have a minute why dont we go
talk about it somewhere only we know
this could be the end of everything
so why dont we go somewhere only we know
