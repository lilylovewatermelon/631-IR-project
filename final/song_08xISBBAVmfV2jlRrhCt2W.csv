our time is ending i feel its only just begun
and im frustrated
i cant believe youre not the one
my ears are bleeding
her voice resides inside my head
and now im choking
release this noose around my neck

prechorus
will i just fall to pieces
or am i all right
to iron out my creases
you must lacerate me til theyre gone

chorus
these are my final words to you
i know youre listening can you hear me
the time has come to say goodbye
these are my final words to you

verse 2
the clock is ticking
my heart is bursting through my chest
and now im crying
the tears are pouring off my face
the chair is creaking
her voice resides inside my head
and now its over
you put this noose around my neck
