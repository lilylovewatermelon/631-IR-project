i woke up it was seven i waited til eleven
just to figure out that no one would call
i think ive got a lot of friends but i dont hear from them
whats another night all alone
when youre spending everyday on your own
and here it goes

chorus
im just a kid and life is a nightmare
im just a kid i know that its not fair
nobody cares cause im alone and the world is
having more fun than me
tonight

verse 2
and maybe when the night is dead ill crawl into my bed
im staring at these four walls again
ill try to think about the last time i had a good time
everyones got somewhere to go
and theyre gonna leave me here on my own
and here it goes

chorus
im just a kid and life is a nightmare
im just a kid i know that its not fair
nobody cares cause im alone and the world is
having more fun than me

wide awake im bored and i cant fall asleep
and every night is the worst night ever

chorus
im just a kid and life is a nightmare
im just a kid i know that its not fair

nobody wants to be alone in the world
