verse 1
sometimes some people get me wrong
when its something ive said or done
sometimes you feel there is no fun
thats why you turn and run

prechorus
but now i truly realize
some people dont wanna compromise
well i saw them with my own eyes
spreading those lies and
well i dont wanna live a lie
too many sleepless nights
not mentioning the fights
im sorry to say lady

chorus
im walking away from the troubles in my life
im walking away oh to find a better day
im walking away from the troubles in my life
im walking away oh to find a better day
im walking away
