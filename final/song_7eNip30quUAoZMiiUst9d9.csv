so look in my eyes what will you leave behind once youve gone so precious
you got what you came for now i think its time to move on when will you see
but these ghosts come alive like water and wine
walk through these streets singing songs and carrying signs
to them these streets belong

verse 1
my atonement lasts the best part of eternity eternity
ran out of hands to count the sin that breeds inside of me inside of me
not this hate but the loneliness has left me here into this mess of

chorus
my hands are soaking in the blood of angels
on broken wings they collapse
will i see the break of day
dark clouds exploded and torrents of rain fell
all these lost halos wash away

verse 2
head hung from shame we bear a weight that brings me to a crawl to a crawl
these years of longing tell of decades of unanswered calls unanswered calls
for a change cause everyday we slip and fall
kicked while were down our fists clenched into a ball

chorus
my hands are soaking in the blood of angels
on broken wings they collapse
will i see the break of day
dark clouds exploded and torrents of rain fell
all these lost halos wash away
you might also likeoutro
so look in my eyes what will you leave behind once youve gone so precious
you got what you came for now i think its time to move on when will you see
but these ghosts come alive like water and wine
walk through these streets singing songs and carrying signs
to them these streets belong
so look in my eyes what will you leave behind once youve gone
you got what you came for now i think its time to move on
but these ghosts come alive like water and wine
walk through these streets singing songs and carrying signs
to them these streets belong1embed"
