you seem like an angel
no one compares to you

chorus 1
youre the best book i ever read
youre the smartest thing i ever said
youre breakfast in bed

verse 3
when in norway
you can do me more ways
than any other
you treat me like you love me
like a mother loves her baby

dress you up and feed you
love you like a daddy loves his baby

youre the fastest race i ever led
youre the finest bride ill ever wed
youre the skin i never want to shed
youre breakfast in bed
youre breakfast in bed
youre breakfast in bed
