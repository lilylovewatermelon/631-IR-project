im a rockstar in his prime
if i take too many percs then i wont die
dont make no sense do it haha
if i take too many percs then i wont die
if i drink too much of this syrup then i wont fly

prechorus
im a rockstar in his prime
a rockstar in his prime
a rockstar in his prime
a rockstar in his prime
a rockstar in his prime

chorus
if i take too many percs then i wont die
if i drink too much of this syrup then im gon fly
i cant deal with this hurt on my own
i cannot deal with this hurt in my downtime
if i take too many percs then i wont die
if i drink too much of this syrup then im gon fly
i cant deal with this hurt on my own
i cannot deal with this hurt

postchorus
everythings just fine
minus the fact im losing my mind
timeless in fact i know its my time
primetime limelights
you might also likeverse
tears on the saint laurent
feel like punchin a wall but i dont wanna break the watch
it was just a year ago i was tellin people watch
thanking god uh it was a part of the plot uh
it feel like part of me alive and part of me not
im tracing my steps uh tryna see where the insanity started
im too high to talk right now im sorry beg my pardon
this not a trend this how ima deal with my demons regardless
oh yeah devil pullin up a chair he sittin right over there
tellin me i should be scared god in my fuckin ear
told me its nothing to fear
i forgot to mention that the devil tryna be my friend
do you hear how confusing this is
i was at the lowest of points feelin like callin it quits
aint nobody understand you should be happy nigga you rich
thats what everybody says
anxiety is a ugly bitch too ugly to comprehend
so i get high and fuck that bitch
prayin for the upper hand i hope that he hear my prayers
devil really want my soul he gon keep it in his lair
me im just gon keep a pole paranoia in the air
everybody gettin killed i wont be a part of it

chorus
if i take too many percs then i wont die
if i drink too much of this syrup then im gon fly
i cant deal with this hurt on my own
i cannot deal with this hurt in my downtime
if i take too many percs then i wont die
if i drink too much of this syrup then im gon fly
i cant deal with this hurt on my own
i cannot deal with this hurt26embed"
