legs are tired these hands are broken
alone i try with words unspoken
silent cry my breath is frozen
with blinded eyes i fear myself

chorus
its burning down its burning high
when ashes fall the legends rise
we burned it out a mile wide
when ashes fall the legends rise

verse 2
my throat is dry my visions fading
im paralyzed and left here waiting
taking time just one step forward
wont lose my mind im here to stay

chorus
its burning down its burning high
when ashes fall the legends rise
we burned it out a mile wide
when ashes fall the legends rise

bridge
whoa
legends rise
whoa
legends rise legends rise rise rise
legends rise rise rise rise rise
you gonna do somethin about it
or just stand there and bleed
see godsmack liveget tickets as low as 46you might also likerefrain
legends rise

chorus
its burning down its burning high
when ashes fall the legends rise
we burned it out a mile wide
when ashes fall the legends rise
