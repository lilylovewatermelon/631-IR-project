verse 1 ll cool j  diddy
i know a honey named millie raised out in philly
body so illy she make a grown man silly
a brainiac really she pretend she dilly
like why you always look at me like that you feel me
theres a girl named wendy love black bentleys
nails in her mouth stay tryin to tempt me
she rolls with her sister and they both real friendly
it wasnt like that when my pockets was empty
shorty named suzie not quite a floozy
lets just say she has a problem bein choosy
scarf on her doobie when she in the jacuzzi
on the celly with her man love you im at the movies
bird named chyna baby where you find her
uptown she wrote a map down with eyeliner
hotness two or three girlfriends behind her
on amsterdam lane to lane dippin the spyder
