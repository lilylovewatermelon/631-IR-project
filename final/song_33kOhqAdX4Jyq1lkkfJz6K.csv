the air was more than humid and the heat was more than hungry
and the cars were square and spitting diesel fumes
the bulls were runnin wild because theyre big and mean and sacred
and the children were playing cricket with no shoes

prechorus
the next mornin we woke up man with a sevenhour drive
well there we were stuck in port blaire where boats break and children stare

chorus
and there were so many fewer questions
when stars were still just the holes to heaven mmhmm
and there were so many fewer questions
when stars were still just the holes to heaven mmhmm

verse 2
disembarking from the port with no mistakes of any sort
moving south the engine running smooth
officials were quite friendly once we drowned them with our sweet talk
and we bribed them with our cigarettes and booze

prechorus
the next mornin we woke up man with the sunrise to the right
moving back north to port blaire where boats break and children stare

and here were so many fewer questions
when stars were still just the holes to heaven mmhmm
yes and there were so many fewer questions
when stars were still just the holes to heaven mmhmm2embed"
