and it begins anew
the hatred of mankind
as it seeks to kill
that which lives inside

refrain 1
now we are dying
dying the slowest death
held down by bonds that bind us
we breathe our final breath

verse 2
and it begins anew
the burning we endure
as we seek the strength
strength to break the bonds

refrain 2
now we are dying dying
dying the slowest death
no more condemnation
we fight for our last breath

chorus
breathe life
for you are not alone
breathe life
inside your heart of stone

and to the ashes you return

and to the ashes you return

break the bonds
break the bonds

chorus
breathe life
for you are not alone
breathe life
inside your heart of stone breathe in life

for you are not alone breathe life breathe in life
breathe life
inside your heart of stoneembed"
