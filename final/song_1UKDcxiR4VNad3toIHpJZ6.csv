baby when were touchin in the dark can you feel it
i can hear the pounding of my heart can you feel it
when you take my body to the stars i believe it
boy this love is supernatural can you feel it

verse 1
come take me by the hand
wanna cross the line baby go ahead
til the mornin light watch my silhouette
cause you know tonight were gonna wake the dead

prechorus
get a little bit wrong get a little bit wild
get a little bit high off of this love tonight
get a little bit raw come a little undone
get a little bit reckless i cant get enough

chorus
baby when were touchin in the dark can you feel it
i can hear the pounding of my heart can you feel it
when you take my body to the stars i believe it
boy this love is supernatural can you feel it

verse 2
come take me in the night
i feel it in my blood want the darker side
baby when we touch look me in the eyes
poison me with love ill bring you back to life
