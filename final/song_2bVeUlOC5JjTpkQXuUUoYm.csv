cant believe that you got me in a suit and tie
i had to take a pull so i wouldnt cry
you got a line out the church door sayin goodbye
yeah i believe em when they say youre in a better place
you had a wild side but you had amazing grace
i know youre way off up in them clouds
but if you can still hear me right now

chorus
i hope you hit those gold streets on two wheels
i hope your mansion in the skys got a tenacre field
with some mud and some hubs you can lock in
make some thunder make em wonder how you got in
hide your beer hide your clear from the man upstairs
crank it loud hold it down til i get there
and when i do i hope you got some new stories to tell
til then give heaven some hell

verse 2
i bet youre lookin for a crew like we had
bunch of noisemakin boys that like to live fast
burnin rubber in a parkin lot
man i dont know if the other sides ready or not but

chorus
i hope you hit those gold streets on two wheels
i hope your mansion in the skys got a tenacre field
with some mud and some hubs you can lock in
make some thunder make em wonder how you got in
hide your beer hide your clear from the man upstairs
crank it loud hold it down til i get there
and when i do i hope you got some new stories to tell
til then give heaven some hell
you might also likebridge
i was there when you raised your hand
heads bowed singing just as i am
walkin that aisle prayin that prayer
man it aint right but if you gotta be there

chorus
i hope you hit those gold streets on two wheels
hope your mansion in the skys got a tenacre field
with some mud and some hubs you can lock in
make some thunder make em wonder how you got in
hide your beer hide your clear from the man upstairs
crank it loud hold it down til i get there
and when i do i hope you got some new stories to tell
til then give heaven some hell

outro
i was there when you raised your hand
heads bowed singing just as i am
man it aint right man it aint fair
ill see you again
but til then give heaven some hell2embed"
