do you remember days on our old block
messin with our neighbors who called the cops
couldve swore that you and me
could get away with anything
wed lay on the grass all day talking
cause we snuck out of class when no one was watching
i remember you and me
yeah i remember everything

prechorus
but lately ive been feelin strange
and everybodys tellin me to act my age
i never thought that everything i had would fade away

chorus
when we were younger
we didnt know how it would be
we were the dumb the wild the free
little league
and when we were younger
we wore our hearts proud on our sleeve
why did we ever have to leave
little league

verse 2
could i get a rewind
get another chance take it back in time
cause i dont know what to do
with everything im goin through
and where did all my friends go
standin on our street but nobodys home
swore wed never move away
but now im going 95 on the interstate

cause lately ive been feelin strange
and everybodys tellin me to act my age
i never thought that everything i had would fade away

chorus
when we were younger
we didnt know how it would be
we were the dumb the wild the free
little league
and when we were younger
we wore our hearts proud on our sleeve
why did we ever have to leave

i wish i was younger
oh wish i was younger

chorus
when we were younger
we didnt know how it would be
we were the dumb the wild the free
little league
and when we were younger
we wore our hearts proud on our sleeve
