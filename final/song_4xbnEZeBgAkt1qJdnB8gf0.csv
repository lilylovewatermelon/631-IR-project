love oh
mm

verse 1
take off my shirt
loosen the buttons and undo my skirt
stare at myself in the mirror
pick me apart piece by piece
sorrow decreased pressure release
i put in work did more than called upon
more than deserved
when it was over did i wind up hurt yes
but it taught me
before a decision ask this question first

chorus
who am i living for oh
is this my limit
can i endure some more oh
chances im given question existing
who am i living for oh
is this my limit
can i endure some more oh
chances im given question existing

take off my cool take off my cool
show them that under here im just like you
do the mistakes ive made make me a fool
or a human with flaws
admit that im lost round of applause round of applause
take the abuse
sometimes it feels like they want me to lose want me to lose
its entertainment is that an excuse no
but the question that lingers whether win or lose is

chorus
who am i living for oh
is this my limit
can i endure some more oh
chances im given question existing
who am i living for oh
is this my limit
can i endure some more oh
chances im given question existing

spoken
dear diary its robyn
entertaining is something i do for a living
this is not who i am
id like to think that im pretty normal
i laugh haha i get mad i hurt
i think guys suck sometimes
but when youre in the spotlight everything seems good
ooh yeah
sometimes i feel like i have it worst
cause i have to always keep my guard up
i dont know who to trust
i dont know who wants to date me for who i am
or who wants to be my friend for who i really am
chorus
who am i living for oh
is this my limit
can i endure some more oh
chances im given question existing
who am i living for oh
is this my limit
can i endure some more oh
