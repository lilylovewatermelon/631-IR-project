5B23ftApTxOqyWUv7cOe3E,Me and Big Dave,Colter Wall,0R8H8XYAiHsh2dwzb4RHsI,"9 contributorsme and big dave lyricsme and big dave were just trying to stay upright
we were chasing white lines and warping our minds last night
we were killing the time though we sure didnt know it
hunting down rhymes with a kentucky poet
me and big dave were just trying to stay alive

theres some folks around town that might cuss our names down to the floor
they might claim that were loners noaccount stoners and more
its the same kind of people claim to be chosen
their ears made of stone and their tongues made of poison
the doctrine they preach has got nothing that they can teach me

well i dont know if dave hates the same kind of hate that i do
well he knows that i know that hes been cut down by it too
well people get talking about things that we uses
i aint in the business of making excuses
me and big dave were just trying to stay alive

this whole worlds full of ghosts that i believe that most folks cant see
the particular demons that reason with big dave and mesee colter wall liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeembed"
