sleeping is giving in
no matter what the time is
sleeping is giving in
so lift those heavy eyelids
people say that youll die
faster than without water
but we know its just a lie
scare your son scare your daughter

verse 2
people say that your dreams
are the only things that save you
come on baby in our dreams
we can live our misbehavior

refrain
every time you close your eyes lies lies
every time you close your eyes lies lies
every time you close your eyes lies lies
every time you close your eyes lies lies
every time you close your eyes
every time you close your eyes
every time you close your eyes
every time you close your eyes
