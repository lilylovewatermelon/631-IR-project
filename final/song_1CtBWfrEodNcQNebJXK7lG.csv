i wish i could tell you how i feel
it dont make sense trust me ive tried
nothing to prove so i dont say nothin
just close my eyes and i stand there
and i smile

never give up on the things that that can make you smile
even if it means you gotta crawl for a thousand miles
dont you worry about how far to go
enjoy the journey and you know who you know you know

cheers cheers to you good lifes success good sex and kids
cheers cheers what i got for you they cant contain with lids
cheers cheers when i look into your eyes and see our kid

just close my eyes and i stand there
