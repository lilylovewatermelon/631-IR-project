no longer no longer
what you ask
strange steps
heels turned black
the cinders the cinders
they light the path
and these strange steps
take us back take us back

chorus
flow sweetly hang heavy
you suddenly complete me
you suddenly complete me

flow sweetly hang heavy
you suddenly complete me
you suddenly complete me

hook
hysteric
hysterical

verse 2
no wonder no wonder
other half
strange steps
heels turned black
the cinders they splinter
and light the path
and these strange steps
trace us back trace us back

flow sweetly hang heavy
you suddenly complete me
you suddenly complete me
flow sweetly hang heavy
you suddenly complete me
you suddenly complete me
