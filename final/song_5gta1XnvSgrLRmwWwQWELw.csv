your perspective is starting to shift
with these thoughts in retrospect
wasnt clever enough to thrift
you spent too much on neglect

and left yourself behind
gave witness to your demise
and came back to find
what was missing inside

chorus
changes got you sentimental
learning your true worth wasnt accidental
the only way ahead is straight and true
out of the deep blue turning you into someone new

verse 2
dawning of a new day
with the past falling to rest
what good could swing your way
as you march forward with the best

feeling lighter with time
as you shred off your skin
bathed in the sublime
that youve found within
you might also likechorus
changes got you sentimental
learning your true worth wasnt accidental
the only way ahead is straight and true
out of the deep blue turning you into someone newembed"
