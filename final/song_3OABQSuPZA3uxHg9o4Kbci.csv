feel your rhythm
you are the king of the road
only thing that you could never could do is darlin what youre told
came down from the north last night
the country big and wide
took a minute to catch my breath
cause it steals it every time
its a lonesome
its a lonesome ten miles
its a lonesome ten miles

verse 2
faster than disaster
you never call me the kid
kicking cans on a sidewalk street on a 62 schwinn
paid for hammering brians house
paid for training a horse
caught a love on a smoky roll of aint what im looking for
its a lonesome
its a lonesome

interlude
i never stayed too far
i never go to close
when i miss you darlin
i never let you know

i dont miss old conroe
i know she misses me
8 minutes on a flatbed truck and she gonna see all there is to see
caught wind of me being here
i never know how you knew
i swore id never leave like this again
but leavings what i do
its a lonesome
its a lonesome
its a lonesome ten miles
its a lonesome ten miles
its a lonesome ten miles
its a lonesome
its a lonesomeembed"
