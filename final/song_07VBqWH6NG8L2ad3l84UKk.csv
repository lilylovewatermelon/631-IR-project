rip to my youth
and you could call this the funeral
im just telling the truth
and you can play this at my funeral
wrap me up in chanel inside my coffin
might go to hell and there aint no stopping
might be a sinner and i might be a saint
id like to be proud but somehow im ashamed
sweet little baby in a world full of pain
i gotta be honest i dont know if i could take it
everybodys talkin but whats anybody saying
mama said if i really want it then i can change it yeah
rip to my youth
if you really listen then this is to you
mama there is only so much i can do
tough for you to witness but it was for me too

chorus
im using white lighters to see whats in front of me in front of me

verse 2
rip to my youth
and you could call this the funeral
im just telling the truth yeah
you can play this at my funeral
tell my sister dont cry and dont be sad
im in paradise with dad
close my eyes and then cross my arms
put me in the dirt let me dream with the stars
throw me in a box with the oxygen off
you gave me the key and you locked every lock
when i cant breathe i wont ask you to stop
when i cant breathe dont call for a cop
i was naive and hopeful and lost
now im aware and trapped in my thoughts woah
you might also likebridge
what do i do what do i do
i dont believe it if i dont keep proof
i dont believe it if i dont know you
i dont believe it if its on the news or on the internet
i need a cigarette

chorus
im using white lighters to see whats in front of me
im using white lighters to see

verse 3
rip to my youth
and you could call this the funeral
im just telling the truth
and you can play this at my funeral
tell my sister dont cry and dont be sad
im in paradise with dad
close my eyes and then cross my arms
put me in the dirt let me be with the stars

im using white lighters to see whats in front of me
