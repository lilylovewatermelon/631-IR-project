0xn3EBq5hDQK4Iw85DZVdV,I Found Out - Remastered 2010,John Lennon,555NIhJIQ4XoS5N7VglF0v,"5 contributorschapter 14 black muslims lyricsin the spring of nineteen fiftynine  some months before brother johnson hintons case had awakened the harlem black ghetto to us  a negro journalist louis lomax then living in new york asked me one morning whether our nation of islam would cooperate in being filmed as a television documentary program for the mike wallace show which featured controversial subjects i told lomax that naturally anything like that would have to be referred to the honorable elijah muhammad and lomax did fly to chicago to consult mr muhammad after questioning lomax then cautioning him against some things he did not desire mr muhammad gave his consent

cameramen began filming nation of islam scenes around our mosques in new york chicago and washington dc sound recordings were made of mr muhammad and some ministers including me teaching black audiences the truths about the brainwashed black man and the devil white man

at boston university around the same time c eric lincoln a negro scholar then working for his doctorate had selected for his thesis subject the nation of islam lincolns interest had been aroused the previous year when teaching at clark college in atlanta georgia he received from one of his religion students a term paper whose introduction i can now quote from lincolns book it was the plainspoken convictions of one of atlantas numerous young black collegians who often visited our local temple fifteen

the christian religion is incompatible with the negros aspirations for dignity and equality in america the student had written it has hindered where it might have helped it has been evasive when it was morally bound to be forthright it has separated believers on the basis of color although it has declared its mission to be a universal brotherhood under jesus christ christian love is the white mans love for himself and for his race for the man who is not white islam is the hope for justice and equality in the world we must build tomorrow

after some preliminary research showed professor lincoln what a subject he had hold of he had been able to obtain several grants and a publishers encouragement to expand his thesis into a book

on the wire of our relatively small nation these two big developments  a television show and a book about us  naturally were big news every muslim happily anticipated that now through the white mans powerful communications media our brainwashed black brothers and sisters across the united states and devils too were going to see hear and read mr muhammads teachings which cut back and forth like a twoedged sword

we had made our own very limited efforts to employ the power of print first some time back i had made an appointment to see editor james hicks of the amsterdam news published in harlem editor hicks said he felt every voice in the community deserved to be heard soon each weeks amsterdam news carried a little column that i wrote then mr muhammad agreed to write a column for that valuable amsterdam news space and my column was transferred to another black newspaper the los angeles herald dispatch

but i kept wanting to start somehow our own newspaper that would be filled with nation of islam news

mr muhammad in 1957 sent me to organize a temple in los angeles when i had done that being in that city where the herald dispatch was i went visiting and i worked in their office they let me observe how a newspaper was put together ive always been blessed in that if i can once watch something being done generally i can catch onto how to do it myself quick picking up was probably the number one survival rule when id been out there in the streets as a hustler

back in new york i bought a secondhand camera i dont know how many rolls of film i shot until i could take usable pictures every chance i had i wrote some little news about interesting nation of islam happenings one day every month id lock up in a room and assemble my material and pictures for a printer that i found i named the newspaper muhammad speaks and muslim brothers sold it on the ghetto sidewalks little did i dream that later on when jealousy set in among the hierarchy nothing about me would be printed in the paper i had founded

anyway national publicity was in the offing for the nation of islam when mr muhammad sent me on a threeweek trip to africa even as small as we then were some of the african and asian personages had sent mr muhammad private word that they liked his efforts to awaken and lift up the american black people sometimes the messages had been sent through me as mr muhammads emissary i went to egypt arabia to the sudan to nigeria and ghana

you will often hear today a lot of the negro leaders complaining that what thrust the muslims into international prominence was the white mans press radio television and other media i have no shred of argument with that they are absolutely correct why none of us in the nation of islam remotely anticipated what was about to happen

in late 1959 the television program was aired the hate that hate produced  the title  was edited tightly into a kaleidoscope of shocker images    mr muhammad me and others speaking    stronglooking setfaced black men our fruit of islam    whitescarved whitegowned muslim sisters of all ages    muslims in our restaurants and other businesses    muslims and other black people entering and leaving our mosques   
every phrase was edited to increase the shock mood as the producers intended i think people sat just about limp when the program went off

in a way the public reaction was like what happened back in the 1930s when orson welles frightened america with a radio program describing as though it was actually happening an invasion by men from mars

no one now jumped from any windows but in new york city there was an instant avalanche of public reaction its my personal opinion that the hate    hate    title was primarily responsible for the reaction hundreds of thousands of new yorkers black and white were exclaiming did you hear it did you see it preaching hate of white people

here was one of the white mans most characteristic behavior patterns  where black men are concerned he loves himself so much that he is startled if he discovers that his victims dont share his vainglorious selfopinion in america for centuries it had been just fine as long as the victimized brutalized and exploited black people had been grinning and begging and yessa massa and uncle tomming but now things were different first came the white newspapers  feature writers and columnists alarming    hatemessengers    threat to the good relations between the races    black segregationists    black supremacists and the like

and the newspapers ink wasnt dry before the big national weekly news magazines started hateteachers    violenceseekers    black racists    black fascists    antichristian    possibly communistinspired   

it rolled out of the presses of the biggest devil in the history of mankind and then the aroused white man made his next move

since slavery the american white man has always kept some handpicked negroes who fared much better than the black masses suffering and slaving out in the hot fields the white man had these house and yard negroes for his special servants he threw them more crumbs from his rich table he even let them eat in his kitchen he knew that he could always count on them to keep good massa happy in his selfimage of being so good and righteous good massa always heard just what he wanted to hear from these house and yard blacks youre such a good fine massa or oh massa those old black nigger fieldhands out there theyre happy just like they are why massa theyre not intelligent enough for you to try and do any better for them massa  

well slavery times house and yard negroes had become more sophisticated that was all when now the white man picked up his telephone and dialed his house and yard negroes  why he didnt even need to instruct the trained black puppets they had seen the television program had read the newspapers they were already composing their lines they knew what to do

im not going to call any names but if you make a list of the biggest negro leaders socalled in 1960 then youve named the ones who began to attack us field negroes who were sounding insane talking that way about good massa

by no means do these muslims represent the negro masses  that was the first worry to reassure good massa that he had no reason to be concerned about his fieldhands in the ghettoes an irresponsible hate cult    an unfortunate negro image just when the racial picture is improving  

they were stumbling over each other to get quoted a deplorable reverseracism    ridiculous pretenders to the ancient islamic doctrine    heretic antichristianity  

the telephone in our then small temple seven restaurant nearly jumped off the wall i had a receiver against my ear five hours a day i was listening and jotting in my notebook as press radio and television people called all of them wanting the muslim reaction to the quoted attacks of these black leaders or i was on longdistance to mr muhammad in chicago reading from my notebook and asking for mr muhammads instructions

i couldnt understand how mr muhammad could maintain his calm and patience hearing the things i told him i could scarcely contain myself
my unlisted home telephone number somehow got out my wife betty put down the phone after taking one message and it was ringing again it seemed that wherever i went telephones were ringing

the calls naturally were directed to me new york city being the major newsmedia headquarters and i was the new york minister of mr muhammad calls came longdistance from san francisco to maine    from even london stockholm paris i would see a muslim brother at our restaurant or betty at home trying to keep cool theyd hand me the receiver and i couldnt believe it either one funny thing  in all that hectic period something quickly struck my notice the europeans never pressed the hate question only the american white man was so plagued and obsessed with being hated he was so guilty it was clear to me of hating negroes

mr malcolm x why do you teach black supremacy and hate a red flag waved for me something chemical happened inside me every time i heard that when we muslims had talked about the devil white man he had been relatively abstract someone we muslims rarely actually came into contact with but now here was that devilintheflesh on the phone  with all of his calculating coldeyed selfrighteous tricks and nerve and gall the voices questioning me became to me as breathing living devils

and i tried to pour on pure fire in return the white man so guilty of white supremacy cant hide his guilt by trying to accuse the honorable elijah muhammad of teaching black supremacy and hate all mr muhammad is doing is trying to uplift the black mans mentality and the black mans social and economic condition in this country

the guilty twofaced white man cant decide what he wants our slave foreparents would have been put to death for advocating socalled integration with the white man now when mr muhammad speaks of separation the white man calls us hateteachers and fascists

the white man doesnt want the blacks he doesnt want the blacks that are a parasite upon him he doesnt want this black man whose presence and condition in this country expose the white man to the world for what he is so why do you attack mr muhammad

id have scathing in my voice i felt it

for the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped or the wolf asking the sheep do you hate me the white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone else of hate

why when all of my ancestors are snakebitten and im snakebitten and i warn my children to avoid snakes what does that snake sound like accusing me of hateteaching

mr malcolm x those devils would ask why is your fruit of islam being trained in judo and karate an image of black men learning anything suggesting selfdefense seemed to terrify the white man id turn their question around why does judo or karate suddenly get so ominous because black men study it across america the boy scouts the ymca even the ywca the cyp pal  they all teach judo its all right its fine  until black men teach it even little grammar school classes little girls are taught to defend themselves  

how many of you are in your organization mr malcolm x right reverend bishop t chickenwing says you have only a handful of members  

whoever tells you how many muslims there are doesnt know and whoever does know will never tell you  

the bishop chickenwings were also often quoted about our antichristianity id fire right back on that
christianity is the white mans religion the holy bible in the white mans hands and his interpretations of it have been the greatest single ideological weapon for enslaving millions of nonwhite human beings every country the white man has conquered with his guns he has always paved the way and salved his conscience by carrying the bible and interpreting it to call the people heathens and pagans then he sends his guns then his missionaries behind the guns to mop up  

white reporters anger in their voices would call us demagogues and i would try to be ready after i had been asked the same question two or three times

well lets go back to the greek and maybe you will learn the first thing you need to know about the word demagogue demagogue means actually teacher of the people and lets examine some demagogues the greatest of all greeks socrates was killed as a demagogue jesus christ died on the cross because the pharisees of his day were upholding their law not the spirit the modern pharisees are trying to heap destruction upon mr muhammad calling him a demagogue a crackpot and fanatic what about gandhi the man that churchill called a naked little fakir refusing food in a british jail but then a quarter of a billion people a whole subcontinent rallied behind gandhi  and they twisted the british lions tail what about galileo standing before his inquisitors saying the earth does move what about martin luther nailing on a door his thesis against the allpowerful catholic church which called him heretic we the followers of the honorable elijah muhammad are today in the ghettoes as once the sect of christianitys followers were like termites in the catacombs and the grottoes  and they were preparing the grave of the mighty roman empire

i can remember those hot telephone sessions with those reporters as if it were yesterday the reporters were angry i was angry when id reach into history theyd try to pull me back to the present they would quit interviewing quit their work trying to defend their personal white devil selves they would unearth lincoln and his freeing of the slaves id tell them things lincoln said in speeches against the blacks they would drag up the 1954 supreme court decision on school integration

that was one of the greatest magical feats ever performed in america id tell them do you mean to tell me that nine supreme court judges who are past masters of legal phraseology couldnt have worked their decision to make it stick as law no it was trickery and magic that told negroes they were desegregated  hooray hooray  and at the same time it told whites here are your loopholes

the reporters would try their utmost to raise some good white man whom i couldnt refute as such ill never forget how one practically lost his voice he asked me did i feel any white men had ever done anything for the black man in america i told him yes i can think of two hitler and stalin the black man in america couldnt get a decent factory job until hitler put so much pressure on the white man and then stalin kept up the pressure  

but i dont care what points i made in the interviews it practically never got printed the way i said it i was learning under fire how the press when it wants to can twist and slant if i had said mary had a little lamb what probably would have appeared was malcolm x lampoons mary

even so my bitterness was less against the white press than it was against those negro leaders who kept attacking us mr muhammad said he wanted us to try our best not to publicly counterattack the black leaders because one of the white mans tricks was keeping the black race divided and fighting against each other mr muhammad said that this had traditionally kept the black people from achieving the unity which was the worst need of the black race in america

but instead of abating the black puppets continued ripping and tearing at mr muhammad and the nation of islam  until it began to appear as though we were afraid to speak out against these important negroes thats when mr muhammads patience wore thin and with his nod i began returning their fire

todays uncle tom doesnt wear a handkerchief on his head this modern twentiethcentury uncle thomas now often wears a top hat hes usually welldressed and welleducated hes often the personification of culture and refinement the twentiethcentury uncle thomas sometimes speaks with a yale or harvard accent sometimes he is known as professor doctor judge and reverend even right reverend doctor this twentiethcentury uncle thomas is a professional negro    by that i mean his profession is being a negro for the white man

never before in america had these handpicked socalled leaders been publicly blasted in this way they reacted to the truth about themselves even more hotly than the devilish white man now their institutional indictments of us began instead of leaders speaking as themselves for themselves now their weighty name organizations attacked mr muhammad

black bodies with white heads i called them what they were every one of those negro progress organizations had the same composition black leaders were out in the public eye  to be seen by the negroes for whom they were supposed to be fighting the white man but obscurely behind the scenes was a white boss  a president or board chairman or some other title pulling the real strings

it was hot hot copy both in the white and the black press life look newsweek and time reported us some newspaper chains began to run not one story but a series of three four or five exposures of the nation of islam the readers digest with its worldwide circulation of twentyfour million copies in thirteen languages carried an article titled mr muhammad speaks by the writer to whom i am telling this book and that led off other major monthly magazines coverage of us

before very long radio and television people began asking me to defend our nation of islam in panel discussions and debates i was to be confronted by handpicked scholars both whites and some of those phd house and yard negroes who had been attacking us every day i was more incensed with the general misrepresentation and distortion of mr muhammads teachings i truly think that not once did it cross my mind that previously i never had been inside a radio or television station  let alone faced a microphone to audiences of millions of people prison debating had been my only experience speaking to anyone but muslims

from the old hustling days i knew that there were tricks to everything in the prison debating i had learned tricks to upset my opponents to catch them where they didnt expect to be caught i knew there were bound to be tricks i didnt know anything about arguing on the air

i knew that if i closely studied what the others did i could learn things in a hurry to help me to defend mr muhammad and his teachings

id walk into those studios the devils and black phd puppets would be acting so friendly and integrated with each other  laughing and calling each other by first names and all that it was such a big lie it made me sick in my stomach they would even be trying to act friendly toward me  we all knowing they had asked me there to try and beat out my brains they would offer me coffee i would tell them no thanks to please just tell me where was i supposed to sit sometimes the microphone sat on the table before you at other times a smaller cylindrical microphone was hung on a cord around your neck from the start i liked those microphones better i didnt have to keep constantly aware of my distance from a microphone on the table

the program hosts would start with some kind of diceloading nonreligious introduction for me it would be something like   and we have with us today the fiery angry chief malcolm x of the new york muslims    i made up my own introduction at home or driving my car i practiced until i could interrupt a radio or television host and introduce myself

i represent mr elijah muhammad the spiritual head of the fastestgrowing group of muslims in the western hemisphere we who follow him know that he has been divinely taught and sent to us by god himself we believe that the miserable plight of americas twenty million black people is the fulfillment of divine prophecy we also believe the presence today in america of the honorable elijah muhammad his teachings among the socalled negroes and his naked warning to america concerning her treatment of these socalled negroes is all the fulfillment of divine prophecy i am privileged to be the minister of our temple number seven here in new york city which is a part of the nation of islam under the divine leadership of the honorable elijah muhammad  

i would look around at those devils and their trained black parrots staring at me while i was catching my breath  and i had set my tone

they would outdo each other leaping in on me hammering at mr muhammad at me and at the nation of islam those integrationmad negroes  you know what they jumped on why couldnt muslims see that integration was the answer to american negroes problems id try to rip that to pieces

no sane black man really wants integration no sane white man really wants integration no sane black man really believes that the white man ever will give the black man anything more than token integration no the honorable elijah muhammad teaches that for the black man in america the only solution is complete separation from the white man

anyone who has ever heard me on radio or television programs knows that my technique is nonstop until what i want to get said is said i was developing the technique then

the honorable elijah muhammad teaches us that since western society is deteriorating it has become overrun with immorality and god is going to judge it and destroy it and the only way the black people caught up in this society can be saved is not to integrate into this corrupt society but to separate from it to a land of our own where we can reform ourselves lift up our moral standards and try to be godly the western worlds most learned diplomats have failed to solve this grave race problem her learned legal experts have failed her sociologists have failed her civil leaders have failed her fraternal leaders have failed since all of these have failed to solve this race problem it is time for us to sit down and reason i am certain that we will be forced to agree that it takes god himself to solve this grave racial dilemma

every time i mentioned separation some of them would cry that we muslims were standing for the same thing that white racists and demagogues stood for i would explain the difference no we reject segregation even more militantly than you say you do we want separation which is not the same the honorable elijah muhammad teaches us that segregation is when your life and liberty are controlled regulated by someone else to segregate means to control segregation is that which is forced upon inferiors by superiors but separation is that which is done voluntarily by two equals  for the good of both the honorable elijah muhammad teaches us that as long as our people here in america are dependent upon the white man we will always be begging him for jobs food clothing and housing and he will always control our lives regulate our lives and have the power to segregate us the negro here in america has been treated like a child a child stays within the mother until the time of birth when the time of birth arrives the child must be separated or it will destroy its mother and itself the mother cant carry that child after its time the child cries for and needs its own world

anyone who has listened to me will have to agree that i believed in elijah muhammad and represented him one hundred percent i never tried to take any credit for myself

i was never in one of those panel discussions without some of them just waiting their chance to accuse me of inciting negroes to violence i didnt even have to do any special studying to prepare for that one

the greatest miracle christianity has achieved in america is that the black man in white christian hands has not grown violent it is a miracle that twentytwo million black people have not risen up against their oppressors  in which they would have been justified by all moral criteria and even by the democratic tradition it is a miracle that a nation of black people has so fervently continued to believe in a turntheothercheek and heavenforyouafteryoudie philosophy it is a miracle that the american black people have remained a peaceful people while catching all the centuries of hell that they have caught here in white mans heaven the miracle is that the white mans puppet negro leaders his preachers and the educated negroes laden with degrees and others who have been allowed to wax fat off their black poor brothers have been able to hold the black masses quiet until now

i guarantee you one thing  every time i was mixed up in those studios with those brainwashed integrationmad black puppets and those tricky devils trying to rip and tear me down as long as the little red light glowed on the air i tried to represent elijah muhammad and the nation of islam to the utmost

dr c eric lincolns book was published amid widening controversy about us muslims at just about the time we were starting to put on our first big mass rallies

just as the television hate that hate produced title had projected that hateteaching image of us now dr lincolns book was titled the black muslims in america the press snatched at that name black muslims was in all the book reviews which quoted from the book only what was critical of us and generally praised dr lincolns writing

the public mind fixed on black muslims from mr muhammad on down the name black muslims distressed everyone in the nation of islam i tried for at least two years to kill off that black muslims every newspaper and magazine writer and microphone i got close to no we are black people here in america our religion is islam we are properly called muslims but that black muslims name never got dislodged

our mass rallies from their very beginning were astounding successes where once detroits struggling little temple one proudly sent a tenautomobile caravan to chicago to hear mr muhammad now from east coast temples  the older temples as well as the new ones that all of the massive publicity had helped us to bring into being  as many as 150 200 and even as many as 300 big chartered buses rolled the highways to wherever mr muhammad was going to speak on each bus two fruit of islam men were in charge big threebyninefoot painted canvas banners hung on the buses sides to be read by the highway traffic and thousands of people at home and on the sidewalks of the towns the buses passed through

hundreds more muslims and curious negroes drove their own cars and mr muhammad with his personal jet plane from chicago from the airport to the rally hall mr muhammads motorcade had a sirenscreaming police escort law agencies once had scoffed at our nation as black crackpots now they took special pains to safeguard against some white crackpots causing any incidents or accidents

america had never seen such fantastic allblack meetings to hear elijah muhammad up to ten thousand and more black people poured from public and private transportation to overflow the big halls we rented such as the st nicholas arena in new york city chicagos coliseum and washington dcs uline arena

the white man was barred from attendance  the first time the american black man had ever dreamed of such a thing and that brought us new attacks from the white man and his black puppets black segregationists    racists accusing us of segregation across america whites barring blacks was standard

many hundreds arrived too late for us to seat them we always had to wire up outside loudspeakers an electric atmosphere excited the great shifting masses of black people the long lines three and four abreast funneling to the meeting hall were kept in strict order by fruit of islam men communicating by walkietalkie in anterooms just inside the halls more fruit of islam men and whitegowned veiled mature muslim sisters thoroughly searched every man woman and child seeking to enter any alcohol and tobacco had to be checked and any objects which could possibly be used to attempt to harm mr muhammad he always seemed deathly afraid that someone would harm him and he insisted that everyone be searched to forestall this today i understand better why

the hundreds of fruit of islam men represented contingents which had arrived early that morning from their temples in the nearest cities some were detailed as ushers who seated the people by designated sections the balconies and the rear half of the main floor were filled with black people of the general public ahead of them were the allmuslim seating sections  the whitegarbed beautiful black sisters and the darksuited whiteshirted brothers a special section near the front was for black socalled dignitaries many of these had been invited among them were our black puppet and parrot attackers the intellectuals and professional negroes over whom mr muhammad grieved so much for these were the educated ones who should have been foremost in leading their poor black brothers out of the maze of misery and want we wanted them to miss not a single syllable of the truths from mr muhammad in person

the front two or three press rows were filled with the black reporters and cameramen representing the negro press or those who had been hired by the white mans newspapers magazines radio and television americas black writers should hold a banquet for mr muhammad writing about the nation of islam was the path to success for most of the black writers who now are recognized

up on the speakers platform we ministers and other officials of the nation entering from backstage found ourselves chairs in the five or six rows behind the big chair reserved for mr muhammad some of the ministers had come hundreds of miles to be present we would be turning about in our chairs beaming with smiles wringing each others hands and exchanging assalaamalaikum and waalaikumsalaam in our genuine deep rejoicing to see each other again

always meeting us older hands in mr muhammads service for the first time there were several new ministers of small new temples my brothers wilfred and philbert were respectively now the ministers of the detroit and lansing temples minister jeremiah x headed atlantas temple minister john x had los angeles temple the messengers son minister wallace muhammad had the philadelphia temple minister woodrow x had the atlantic city temple some of our ministers had unusual backgrounds the washington dc temple minister lucius x was previously a seventh day adventist and a 32nd degree mason minister george x of the camden new jersey temple was a pathologist minister david x was previously the minister of a richmond virginia christian church he and enough of his congregation had become muslims so that the congregation split and the majority turned the church into our richmond temple the boston temples outstanding young minister louis x previously a wellknown and rising popular singer called the charmer had written our nations popular first song titled white mans heaven is black mans hell minister louis x had also authored our first play orgena a negro spelled backwards its theme was the allblack trial of a symbolic white man for his world crimes against nonwhites found guilty sentenced to death he was dragged off shouting about all he had done for the nigra people

younger even than our talented louis x were some newer ministers minister thomas j x of the hartford temple being one example and another the buffalo temples minister robert j x

i had either originally established or organized for mr muhammad most of the represented temples greeting each of these temples brother ministers would bring back into my mind images of fishing for converts along the streets and from doortodoor wherever the black people were congregated i remembered the countless meetings in living rooms where maybe seven would be a crowd the gradually building building  on up to renting folding chairs for dingy little storefronts which muslims scrubbed to spotlessness

we together on a huge halls speaking platform and that vast audience before us miraculously manifested as far as i was concerned the incomprehensible power of allah for the first time i truly understood something mr muhammad had told me he claimed that when he was going through the sacrificial trials of fleeing the black hypocrites from city to city allah had often sent him visions of great audiences who would one day hear the teachings and mr muhammad said the visions also buoyed him when he was locked up for years in the white mans prison

the great audiences restless whisperings would cease   

at the microphone would be the nations national secretary john ali or the boston temple minister louis x they enlivened the allblack atmosphere speaking of the new world open to the black man through the nation of islam sister tynetta dynear would speak beautifully of the muslim womens powerful vital contributions of the muslim womens roles in our nations efforts to raise the physical mental moral social and political condition of americas black people

next i would come to the microphone specifically to condition the audience to hear mr muhammad who had flown from chicago to teach us all in person

i would raise up my hand assalaamalaikum  

waalaikumsalaam it was a roared response from the great audiences muslim seating section

there was a general pattern that i would follow on these occasions

my black brothers and sisters  of all religious beliefs or of no religious beliefs  we all have in common the greatest binding tie we could have    we all are black people

im not going to take all day telling you some of the greatnesses of the honorable elijah muhammad im just going to tell you now his greatest greatness he is the first the only black leader to identify to you and me who is our enemy

the honorable elijah muhammad is the first black leader among us with the courage to tell us  out here in public  something which when you begin to think of it back in your homes you will realize we black people have been living with we have been seeing we have been suffering all of our lives

our enemy is the white man

and why is mr muhammads teaching us this such a great thing because when you know who your enemy is he can no longer keep you divided and fighting one brother against the other because when you recognize who your enemy is he can no longer use trickery promises lies hypocrisy and his evil acts to keep you deaf dumb and blinded

when you recognize who your enemy is he can no longer brainwash you he can no longer pull wool over your eyes so that you never stop to see that you are living in pure hell on this earth while he lives in pure heaven right on this same earth  this enemy who tells you that you are both supposed to be worshiping the same white christian god that  you are told  stands for the same things for all men

oh yes that devil is our enemy ill prove it pick up any daily newspaper read the false charges leveled against our beloved religious leader it only points up the fact that the caucasian race never wants any black man who is not their puppet or parrot to speak for our people this caucasian devil slavemaster does not want or trust us to leave him  yet when we stay here among him he continues to keep us at the very lowest level of his society

the white man has always loved it when he could keep us black men tucked away somewhere always out of sight around the corner the white man has always loved the kind of black leaders whom he could ask well hows things with your people up there but because mr elijah muhammad takes an uncompromising stand with the white man the white man hates him when you hear the white man hate him you too because you dont understand biblical prophecy wrongly label mr muhammad  as a racist a hateteacher or of being antiwhite and teaching black supremacy  

the audience suddenly would begin a rustling of turning   

mr muhammad would be rapidly moving along up a center aisle from the rear  as once he had entered our humble little mosques  this man whom we regarded as islams gentle meek brownskinned lamb stalwart striding closecropped handpicked fruit of islam guards were a circle surrounding him he carried his holy bible his holy quran the small dark pillbox atop his head was goldembroidered with islams flag the sun moon and stars the muslims were crying out their adoration and their welcome little lamb assalaamalaikum praise be to allah

tears would be in more eyes than mine he had rescued me when i was a convict mr muhammad had trained me in his home as if i was his son i think that my lifes peaks of emotion until recently at least were when suddenly the fruit of islam guards would stop stiffly at attention and the platforms several steps would be mounted alone by mr muhammad and his ministers including me sprang around him embracing him wringing both his hands   

i would turn right back to the microphone not to keep waiting those worlds biggest black audiences who had come to hear him

my black brothers and sisters  no one will know who we are    until we know who we are we never will be able to go anywhere until we know where we are the honorable elijah muhammad is giving us a true identity and a true position  the first time they have ever been known to the american black man

you can be around this man and never dream from his actions the power and the authority he has  behind me believe me when i tell you i could feel mr muhammads power

he does not display and parade his power but no other black leader in america has followers who will lay down their lives if he says so and i dont mean all of this nonviolent beggingthewhiteman kind of dying    all of this sittingin slidingin wadingin eatingin divingin and all the rest 

my black brothers and sisters you have come from your homes to hear  now you are going to hear  americas wisest black man americas boldest black man americas most fearless black man this wilderness of north americas most powerful black man

mr muhammad would come quickly to the stand looking out over the vacuumquiet audience his gentlelooking face set for just a fleeting moment then assalaamalaikum  

waalaikumsalaam

the muslims roared it as they settled to listen from experience they knew that for the next two hours mr muhammad would wield his twoedged sword of truth in fact every muslim worried that he overtaxed himself in the length of his speeches considering his bronchial asthmatic condition

i dont have a degree like many of you out there before me have but history dont care anything about your degrees

the white man he has filled you with a fear of him from ever since you were little black babies so over you is the greatest enemy a man can have  and that is fear i know some of you are afraid to listen to the truth  you have been raised on fear and lies but i am going to preach to you the truth until you are free of that fear   

your slavemaster he brought you over here and of your past everything was destroyed today you do not know your true language what tribe are you from you would not recognize your tribes name if you heard it you dont know nothing about your true culture you dont even know your familys real name you are wearing a white mans name the white slavemaster who hates you

you are a people who think you know all about the bible and all about christianity you even are foolish enough to believe that nothing is right but christianity

you are the planet earths only group of people ignorant of yourself ignorant of your own kind of your true history ignorant of your enemy you know nothing at all but what your white slavemaster has chosen to tell you and he has told you only that which will benefit himself and his own kind he has taught you for his benefit that you are a neutral shiftless helpless socalled negro

i say socalled because you are not a negro there is no such thing as a race of negroes you are members of the asiatic nation from the tribe of shabazz negro is a false label forced on you by your slavemaster he has been pushing things onto you and me and our kind ever since he brought the first slave shipload of us black people here  

when mr muhammad paused the muslims before him cried out little lamb    all praise is due to allah    teach messenger he would continue

the ignorance we of the black race here in america have and the selfhatred we have they are fine examples of what the white slavemaster has seen fit to teach to us do we show the plain common sense like every other people on this planet earth to unite among ourselves no we are humbling ourselves sittingin and beggingin trying to unite with the slavemaster i dont seem able to imagine any more ridiculous sight a thousand ways every day the white man is telling you you cant live here you cant enter here you cant eat here drink here walk here work here you cant ride here you cant play here you cant study here havent we yet seen enough to see that he has no plan to unite with you

you have tilled his fields cooked his food washed his clothes you have cared for his wife and children when he was away in many cases you have even suckled him at your breast you have been far and away better christians than this slavemaster who taught you his christianity

you have sweated blood to help him build a country so rich that he can today afford to give away millions  even to his enemies and when those enemies have gotten enough from him to then be able to attack him you have been his brave soldiers dying for him and you have been always his most faithful servant during the socalled peaceful times 

and still this christian american white man has not got it in him to find the human decency and enough sense of justice to recognize us and accept us the black people who have done so much for him as fellow human beings

yah man    umhuh teach messenger    yah    tell em    you right    take your time up there little messenger    oh yes

others besides the muslims would be shouting now we muslims were less extroverted than christian negroes it would sound now like an oldfashioned camp meeting

so let us the black people separate ourselves from this white man slavemaster who despises us so much you are out here begging him for some socalled integration but what is this slavemaster white rapist going about saying he is saying he wont integrate because black blood will mongrelize his race he says that  and look at us turn around in your seats and look at each other this slavemaster white man already has integrated us until you can hardly find among us today any more than a very few who are the black color of our foreparents

godamighty the mans right    teach messenger   hear him hear him

he has left such a little black in us mr muhammad would go on that now he despises us so bad  meaning he despises himself for what he has done to us  that he tells us that legally if we have got one drop of black blood in us that means you are allblack as far as his laws are concerned well if thats all weve got left we want to reclaim that one drop

mr muhammads frail strength could be seen to be waning but he would teach on

so let us separate from this white man and for the same reason he says  in time to save ourselves from any more integration

why shouldnt this white man who likes to think and call himself so good and so generous this white man who finances even his enemies  why shouldnt he subsidize a separate state a separate territory for we black people who have been such faithful slaves and servants a separate territory on which we can lift ourselves out of these white mans slums for us and his breadlines for us and even for those he is complaining that we cost him too much we can do something for ourselves we never have done what we could  because we have been brainwashed so well by the slavemaster white man that we must come to him begging him for everything we want and need  

after perhaps ninety minutes behind mr muhammad every minister would have to restrain himself from bolting up to his side to urge him that it was enough he would be pressing his hands tightly against the edges of the speakers stand to support himself

we black people dont know what we can do you never can know what anything can do  until it is set free to act by itself if you have a cat in your house that you pamper and pet you have to free that cat set it on its own in the woods before you can see that the cat had it in him to shelter and feed itself

we the black people here in america we never have been free to find out what we really can do we have knowledge and experience to pool to do for ourselves all of our lives we have farmed  we can grow our own food we can set up factories to manufacture our own necessities we can build other kinds of businesses to establish trade and commerce  and become independent as other civilized people are 

we can throw off our brainwashing and our selfhate and live as brothers together   

   some land of our own    something for ourselves    leave this white slavemaster to himself   

mr muhammad always stopped abruptly when he was unable to speak any longer

the standing ovation a solid wall of sound would go on unabating

standing up there flailing my arms finally i could quiet the audiences as fruit of islam ushers began to pass along the seating rows the large waxed paper buckets we used to take up the collection i would speak

you know from what you have just heard that no white money finances the honorable elijah muhammad and his program  to advise him and contain him mr muhammads program and his followers are not integrated mr muhammads program and organization are allblack

we are the only black organization that only black people support these socalled negro progress organizations  why they insult your intelligence claiming they are fighting in your behalf to get you the equal rights you are asking for    claiming they are fighting the white man who refuses to give you your rights why the white man supports those organizations if you belong you pay your two or three or five dollars a year  but who gives those organizations those two and three and fivethousand dollar donations the white man he feeds those organizations so he controls those organizations he advises them  so he contains them use your common sense  arent you going to advise and control and contain anyone that you support like your child

the white man would love to support mr elijah muhammad because if mr muhammad had to rely on his support he could advise mr muhammad my black brothers and sisters it is only because your money black money supports mr muhammad that he can hold these allblack meetings from city to city telling us black men the truth thats why we are asking for your allblack support

nearly all bills  and far from all onedollar bills either filled the waxed buckets the buckets were swiftly emptied then refilled as the fruit of islam ushers covered the entire audience

the audience atmosphere was almost as if the people had gone limp the collections always covered the rally expenses and anything beyond that helped to continue building the nation of islam

after several big rallies mr muhammad directed that we would admit the white press fruit of islam men thoroughly searched them as everyone else was searched  their notebooks their cameras camera cases and whatever else they carried later mr muhammad said that any whites who wanted to hear the truth could attend our public rallies until a small separate section for whites was filled

most whites who came were students and scholars i would watch their congealed and reddened faces staring up at mr muhammad the white man knows that his acts have been those of a devil i would watch also the faces of the professional black men the socalled intellectuals who attacked us they possessed the academic knowhow they possessed the technical and the scientific skills that could help to lead their mass of poor black brothers out of our condition but all these intellectual and professional black men could seem to think of was humbling themselves and begging trying to integrate with the socalled liberal white man who was telling them in time    everythings going to work out one day    just wait and have patience these intellectual and professional negroes couldnt use what they knew for the benefit of their own black kind simply because even among themselves they were disunited united among themselves united with their own kind they could have benefited black people all over the world

i would watch the faces of those intellectual and professional negroes growing grave and set  as the truth hit home to them

we were watched our telephones were tapped still right today on my home telephone if i said im going to bomb the empire state building i guarantee you in five minutes it would be surrounded when i was speaking publicly sometimes id guess which were fbi faces in the audience or other types of agents both the police and the fbi intently and persistently visited and questioned us i do not fear them mr muhammad said i have all that i need  the truth

many a night i drifted off to sleep filled with wonder at how the twoedgedsword teachings so hurt confused concerned and upset the government full of men trained highly in all of the modern sciences i felt that it never could have been unless the most learned one allah himself had given the little fourthgradetrained messenger something

black agents were sent to infiltrate us but the white mans secret spy often proved first of all a black man i cant say all of them of course theres no way to know  but some of them after joining us and hearing seeing and feeling the truth for every black man revealed their roles to us some resigned from the white mans agencies and came to work in the nation of islam a few kept their jobs to counterspy telling us the white mans statements and plans about our nation this was how we learned that after wanting to know what happened within our temples the white law agencies second major concern was the thing that i believe still ranks today as a big worry among americas penologists the steadily increasing rate at which black convicts embrace islam

generally while still in prison our convictconverts preconditioned themselves to meet our nations moral laws as it had happened with me when they left prison they entered a temple fully qualified to become registered muslims in fact convictconverts usually were better prepared than were numerous prospective muslims who never had been inside a prison

we were not nearly so easy to enter as a christian church one did not merely declare himself a follower of mr muhammad then continue leading the same old sinful immoral life the muslim first had to change his physical and moral self to meet our strict rules to remain a muslim he had to maintain those rules

few temple meetings were held for instance without the minister looking down upon some freshly shaved bald domes of new muslim brothers in the audience they had just banished from their lives forever that phony lyeconked metalliclooking hair or the process as some call it these days it grieves me that i dont care where you go you see this symbol of ignorance and selfhate on so many negroes heads i know its bound to hurt the feelings of some of my good conked nonmuslim friends  but if you study closely any conked or processed negro you usually find he is an ignorant negro whatever show or front he affects his hair lyecooked to be whitelooking fairly shouts to everyone who looks at his head im ashamed to be a negro he will discover just as i did that he will be muchimproved mentally whenever he discovers enough black selfpride to have that mess clipped off and then wear the natural hair that god gives black men to wear

no muslim smokes  that was another of our rules some prospective muslims found it more difficult to quit tobacco than others found quitting the dope habit but black men and women quit more easily when we got them to consider seriously how the white mans government cared less about the publics health than about continuing the tobacco industrys billions in tax revenue what does a serviceman pay for a carton of cigarettes a prospective muslim convert would be asked it helped him to see that every regularly priced carton he bought meant that the white mans government took around two dollars of a black mans hardearned money for taxes not for tobacco

you may have read somewhere  a lot has been written concerning it  about the nation of islams phenomenal record of dopeaddiction cures of longtime junkies in fact the new york times carried a story about how some of the social agencies have asked representatives of the muslim program for clinical suggestions

the muslim program began with recognizing that color and addiction have a distinct connection it is no accident that in the entire western hemisphere the greatest localized concentration of addicts is in harlem

our cure programs first major ingredient was the painfully patient work of muslims who previously were junkies themselves

in the ghettos dope jungle the muslim exjunkies would fish out addicts who knew them back in those days then with an agonizing patience that might span anywhere from a few months to a year our exjunkie muslims would conduct the addicts through the muslim sixpoint therapeutic process

the addict first was brought to admit to himself that he was an addict secondly he was taught why he used narcotics third he was shown that there was a way to stop addiction fourth the addicts shattered selfimage and ego were built up until the addict realized that he had within the selfpower to end his addiction fifth the addict voluntarily underwent a cold turkey break with drugs sixth finally cured now an exaddict completes the cycle by fishing up other addicts whom he knows and supervising their salvaging

this sixth stage always instantly eliminated what so often defeats the average social agencies  the characteristic addicts hostility and suspicion the addict who is fished up knew personally that the muslim approaching him very recently had the same fifteen to thirtydollar a day habit the muslim may be this addicts buddy they had plied the same dope jungle they even may have been thieves together the addict had seen the muslim drifting off to sleep leaning against a building or stepping as high over a matchstick as if it were a dog and the muslim approaching the addict uses the same old junkie jungle language

like the alcoholic the junkie can never start to cure himself until he recognizes and accepts his true condition the muslim sticks like a leech drumming at his old junkie buddy youre hooked man it might take months before the addict comes to grips with this the curative program is never really under way until this happens

the next curephase is the addicts realization of why he takes dope still working on his man right in the old jungle locale in dives that you wouldnt believe existed the muslim often collects audiences of a dozen junkies they listen only because they know the cleancut proud muslim had earlier been like them

every addict takes junk to escape something the muslim explains he explains that most black junkies really are trying to narcotize themselves against being a black man in the white mans america but actually the muslim says the black man taking dope is only helping the white man to prove that the black man is nothing

the muslim talks confidently and straight daddy you know i know how you feel wasnt i right out here with you scratching like a monkey smelling all bad living mad hungry stealing and running and hiding from whitey man whats a black man buying whiteys dope for but to make whitey richer  killing yourself

the muslim can tell when his quarry is ready to be shown that the way for him to quit dope is through joining the nation of islam the addict is brought into the local muslim restaurant he may occasionally be exposed to some other social situations  among proud clean muslims who show each other mutual affection and respect instead of the familiar hostility of the ghetto streets for the first time in years the addict hears himself called genuinely brother sir and mr no one cares about his past his addiction may casually be mentioned but if so it
is spoken of as merely an especially tough challenge that he must face everyone whom this addict meets is confident that he will kick his habit

as the addicts new image of himself builds inevitably he begins thinking that he can break the habit for the first time he is feeling the effects of black selfpride

thats a powerful combination for a man who has been existing in the mud of society in fact once he is motivated no one can change more completely than the man who has been at the bottom i call myself the best example of that

finally vitally this addict will decide for himself that he wants to go on cold turkey this means to endure the physical agonies of abruptly quitting dope

when this time comes exaddict muslims will arrange to spend the necessary days in aroundtheclock shifts attending the addict who intends to purge himself on the way to becoming a muslim

when the addicts withdrawal sets in and he is screaming cursing and begging just one shot man the muslims are right there talking junkie jargon to him baby knock that monkey off your back kick that habit kick whitey off your back the addict writhing in pain his nose and eyes running is pouring sweat from head to foot hes trying to knock his head against the wall flailing his arms trying to fight his attendants he is vomiting suffering diarrhea dont hold nothing back let whitey go baby youre going to stand tall man i can see you now in the fruit of islam

when the awful ordeal is ended when the grip of dope is broken the muslims comfort the weak exaddict feeding him soups and broths to get him on his feet again he will never forget these brothers who stood by him during this time he will never forget that it was the nation of islams program which rescued him from the special hell of dope and that black brother or the sister whom muslim sisters attend rarely ever will return to the use of narcotics instead the exaddict when he is proud clean renewed can scarcely wait to hit the same junkie jungle he was in to fish out some buddy and salvage him

if some white man or approved black man created a narcotics cure program as successful as the one conducted under the aegis of the muslims why there would be government subsidy and praise and spotlights and headlines but we were attacked instead why shouldnt the muslims be subsidized to save millions of dollars a year for the government and the cities i dont know what addicts crimes cost nationally but it is said to be billions a year in new york city an estimated 12 million a year is lost to thieves in harlem alone

an addict doesnt work to supply his habit which may cost anywhere from ten to fifty dollars a day how could he earn that much no the addict steals he hustles in other ways he preys upon other human beings like a hawk or a vulture  as i did very likely he is a school dropout the same as i was an army reject psychologically unsuited to a job even if he was offered one the same as i was

women addicts boost shoplift or they prostitute themselves muslim sisters talk hard to black prostitutes who are struggling to quit using dope in order to qualify morally to become registered muslims you are helping the white man to regard your body as a garbage can  

numerous exposés of the nation of islam have implied that mr muhammads followers were chiefly excons and junkies in the early years yes the converts from societys lowest levels were a sizable part of the nations broad base of membership always mr muhammad instructed us go after the black man in the mud often he said those converted made the best muslims

but gradually we recruited other black people  the good christians whom we fished from their churches then an increase began in the membership percentage of educated and trained negroes for each rally attracted to the local temple a few more of that particular citys socalled middleclass negroes the type who previously had scoffed at us black muslims as demagogues and hateteachers black racists and all the rest of the names the muslim truths  listened to thought about  reaped for us a growing quota of young black men and women for those with training and talents the nation of islam had plenty of positions where those abilities were needed

there were some registered muslims who would never reveal their membership except to other muslims because of their positions in the white mans world there were i know a few who because of their positions were known only to their ministers and to mr elijah muhammad

in 1961 our nation flourished our newspaper muhammad speaks full back page carried an architects drawing of a 20 million islamic center proposed to be built in chicago every muslim was making personal financial contribution toward the center it would include a beautiful mosque school library and hospital and a museum documenting the black mans glorious history

mr muhammad visited the muslim countries and upon his return he directed that we would begin calling our temples mosques

there was a sharp climb now too in the number of muslimowned small businesses our businesses sought to demonstrate to the black people what black people could do for themselves  if they would only unify trade with each other  exclusively where possible  and hire each other and in so doing keep black money within the black communities just as other minorities did

recordings of mr muhammads speeches were now regularly being broadcast across america over small radio stations in detroit and chicago schoolage muslim children attended our two universities of islam  through high school in chicago and through junior high in detroit starting from kindergarten they learned of the black mans glorious history and from the third grade they studied the black mans original language arabic

mr muhammads eight children now were all deeply involved in key capacities in the nation of islam i took a deep personal pride in having had something to do with that  at least in some cases years before when mr muhammad had sent me out in his service as a minister i began to feel it was a shame that his children worked as some of them then did for the white man in factories construction work driving taxis things like that i felt that i should work for mr muhammads family as sincerely as i worked for him i urged mr muhammad to let me put on a special drive within our few small mosques to raise funds which would enable those of his children working for the white man to be instead employed within our nation mr muhammad agreed the special fund drive did prove successful and his children gradually did begin working for the nation emanuel the oldest today runs the drycleaning plant sister ethel muhammad sharrieff is the muslim sisters supreme instructor her husband raymond sharrieff is supreme captain of the fruit of islam sister lottie muhammad supervises the two universities of islam nathanial muhammad assists emanuel in the drycleaning plant herbert muhammad now publishes muhammad speaks the nations newspaper that i began elijah muhammad jr is the fruit of islam assistant supreme captain wallace muhammad was the philadelphia mosque minister until finally he was suspended from the nation along with me  for reasons i will go into the youngest child akbar muhammad the family student attends the university of cairo at elazhar akbar also has broken with his father

i believe that it was too strenuous a marathon of long speeches that mr muhammad made at our big rallies which abruptly badly aggravated his longbothersome bronchial asthmatic condition

just in conversation mr muhammad would suddenly begin coughing and the coughing tempo would increase until it racked his slight body

mr muhammad almost doubled up sometimes soon he had to take to his bed as hard as he tried not to as deeply as it grieved him he had to cancel several longscheduled appearances at bigcity rallies thousands were disappointed to have to hear me instead or other poor substitutes for mr muhammad in person

members of the nation were deeply concerned doctors recommended a dry climate the nation bought mr muhammad a home in phoenix arizona one of the first times i visited mr muhammad there i stepped off a plane into flashing and whirring cameras until i wondered who was behind me then i saw the cameramens guns they were from the arizona intelligence division

the wire of our nation of islam brought all muslims the joyful news that the arizona climate did vastly relieve the messengers suffering since then he has spent most of each year in phoenix

despite the fact that mr muhammad convalescing could no longer work the daily long hours he had previously worked in chicago he was now more than ever burdened with heavy decisionmaking and administrative duties in every respect the nation was expanded both internally and externally mr muhammad simply could no longer allot as much time as previously to considering and deciding which publicspeaking radio and television requests he felt i should accept  as well as to some organizational matters which i had always brought to him for advice or decision

mr muhammad evidenced the depth of his trust in me in those areas ive described he told me to make the decisions myself he said that my guideline should be whatever i felt was wise  whatever was in the general good interests of our nation of islam

brother malcolm i want you to become well known mr muhammad told me one day because if you are well known it will make me better known he went on

but brother malcolm there is something you need to know you will grow to be hated when you become well known because usually people get jealous of public figures

nothing that mr muhammad ever said to me was more prophetic1embed"
