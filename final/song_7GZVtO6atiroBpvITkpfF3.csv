youre alright
in fact i think
youre pretty swell
cant you tell

meg white
such a pretty thing
i saw your face on the cover
of a magazine

someday
id like
to take a walk with you
maybe ride our
bikes down by the
seaside

meg white
saw you on the big screen
oh jack was king
but you stole the scene

meg white
baby youre the bomb
oh jack is great
dont get me wrong
but this is your song
you might also likesomeday
id like
to take a walk with you
and talk about most anything
youd like to talk about
and watch the sun going down
going down

playin those drums
is hard to do
its true
and nobody plays them
quite like you do

meg white
youre alright
in fact i think
youre pretty swell
cant you tell

meg white
such a pretty thing
saw your face on
the cover of a
magazine
someday
id like
to take a walk with you
maybe ride our
bikes down by the
seaside
and watch the sun going down
going down
going down
going downembed"
