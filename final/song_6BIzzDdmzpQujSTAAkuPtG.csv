run and hide your heads on fire
whirling masses rolling ashes
dream of morning grey earth dawning
life in stasis 40 paces

verse
to turn away from the night
allowing the light alone
is surely fooling yourself
leaving half on the shelf

you’ll never know
how low an angry heart can go
so hold onto that certain hand
as we’re turning in

chorus

outro
does anybody else here
feel that fear
that none of all these good things had to be
or is it just meyou might also likeembed"
