power to the people we back to do maintenance
yeah yeah we gon rock like crack when it came in
you know this work hard as the latin invasion
for black entertainers
hollow glad you could make it… it’s just sad he won’t make it
at these tapings they don’t even show the show dancers
turn pro trans to respect to the session bein closecamerad
look at this another future knowitall with no answers
past catches up to him present day — look nana
we got another kid with a gift just found out that there’s no santa
afraid they never calculate the mistake they about to make
any time you get gassed up to get traffic
well it’s obvious you gon break nigga
i’m talkin to a dead man at his wake
this is a interview with a vampire you don’t know that high stakes
will take his life out of place i eradicate then create
but the gun makers the mind that combine that we brung tanks
i don’t know what they must think
i’m out of verses or the hearse is out of trunk space
but you a petty drug case cupcake
this aint front like you front weight
i hate niggas who pump fake
and youve been givin shots you gon play drunk date
blind and find that there’s some states thats unsafe
they have holes in defenses to jump the gate
what could you do
id have thought your retorts or your rebuttals through
data for this matchup you probably was runnin to
it just it just aint the same backup when it’s in front of you
forget it i got a tonload for him
you know what i come and do you know who they came to see
you books youre a showman
it’s not as much about my opponent as the look i’ma go with
soldiers for the glory who do we put in our moments
well it’s a fight in the ring
i can’t picture the don king but he good for promotion
i wanna put it in motion put it in motion
i like aggravation on faces attracted to bein famous
this is an art i give you a start in imagination
then i pick you apart like a talent agent
clarification my character basin was the fall of calicoes greatness
but lux you was wrong for puttin the pictures up
shit he was wrong for takin it
i take it you see my last flick classic
yours wasnt too dazzlin
you waved then got wiped out brother
surfin just never looked worse with you in the castin
i was all in the entertainin center
this nigga mama name must be brenda with this trash shit
you look like a nigga in front of the deli that keep askin
they gave it to you the first two times — oh this a habit
we know your story we seen the views
a million and one times it’s the same action
hollow you keep givin us old shit
but what else we expect to get out the addict
you baggage lot of trouble in the vein
i heard you and drake was tight
turns out you’re munchin off the name
pictures of yall at dinner he showed the public that he came
well he put it in his albums too
he said thank me later take care then nothin was the same
i expose you niggas in rap collisions
loyalty over money that’s suspicious
wasnt it just nyb to the death last edition
oh the numbers just keep disappearin this math magician
has befriended everything about new york
the texas slang the drinkin lean
the swangin on a mutherfuckin train
yeah the fastest way is the a it’s a level in which i usually train
you in the grave cause the payin
and removin the stain through the exchange
i square off for every root in your frame
why else would a king be pawn shoppin this for human remains
new york versus new york
oh baby this home cookin lookin like grandmas
i keep tellin you hollow fans
to stop thinkin a hiro aint just a sandwich
you gotta talk to em like they daddy’s little girls
what you want with this nigga that keep goin back to jail
did that time behind enemy lines make the family proud
did … pal your man aint got it
you handwashin a niggas handmedowns
another top tier nigga tearin on the top tier
when they tearin your bottom out like nana gown
but you lightnin with the jab but the footage can’t be found
you stole who cupcake
you aint gonna take nothin but your panties down
you no different from a maid dryin the laundry
and this guy locked and confined
i mean you was just hangin out in the yard
now your spots on the line nigga
alright hold on i’ll mourn him
yeah 12 told me get on that track and exploit him
i was runnin around the battle scene lookin for freezer storage
yeah i called you out keep ignorin
that’s why you aint even see this comin
actin like you aint see me callin nigga
are you a left winger or a set banger
excuse me don’t confuse me your new gear dirty nigga
you couldnt clean up round a pack of mexican painters
your closet for kanye would be a death chamber
you wouldnt know fly shit in a jet hangar
you might also likeround 1 hollow da don
i feel you on your black panther shit
the power is engaged but you a diva nigga
made them wait to take an hour to hit the stage
i said damn takin all that time you done hurt these fans
i guess it took a while to put on that hells angels jacket
and them eddie murphy pants
since he wants to take so long
fuck it i’ma do his original introduction
first smack back— wait we on uw cause i stabbed smacks back
loaded lux you know what’s up when we rollin up
yeah we know what’s up you coked up
aces click fastest way to harlem is the a train slick
well it’s actually the fdr
but you wouldn’t know cause you don’t have a car
but he does have a hearse
against calicoe you set the scene
you brought props and everything from that picture
you scored cause you got the pic when smack set the screen
i mean just to see a lux battle
you gotta see women in violet gowns
choir sounds tire mounts tightropin and lion growls
it’s a whole buncha “you gon get this work” and quiet downs
it’s a circus act just to see this clown go through a fire round
was all that rented stuff
you still got the hearse you kept the tux
oooh great investment lux
your death is up neck get cut stretch his guts chest get—
hold up hold up i can’t do this he a black panther
i gotta be positive with lux i’ma battle the same
nah fuck lux i’m only concerned with the first half of his name loaded 5th let’s get it in over offensive lines
my niggas got they face masks at your residence
i got the goons waitin on the outside like a defensive end
and i call them my special team
cause while yall kickin it i send em in
ill send this nigga to hell
bring him back to life send his ass to hell again
or like you repentin sins i have him heavensent
them your choices you can try hell or let they sky tell
its two ways i can send him messages
let’s say he pick message two and dude you right there
grab the pipe blast it twice tragic sight
lux dies… i’ll fuckin i’ll fuckin… grab a knife slash and slice
my own wrists just to battle him in the afterlife
i’ll be like yeah who the best nigga here i wanna battle christ
tell stack he nice and give dj screw a half a pint
i’ll bring the footage back down to earth
so yall fans can see him severed
and they watchin like damn that was a match made in heaven
i’ll come to a shrine guzzlin wine jugglin mines
i’m so far ahead and above with my time
i can rebuttal your rhyme before you come up with the line
i said let me introduce you to this cat you facin
a mixture of larry davis and pappy mason
a nigga who will battle half the nation with scars and lacerations
that’s why the line outside longer than the african vaccination
now my next styles like a reptile from the xfiles
have your legs bound then found in the west now
kick your crib down my niggas play peyton with his kid now
they toss him to me i catch him and slam him shawn kemp style
i hate you lux i hate you lux
i hope your true love grow up to be a fruit cup
or a nigga that’s screwed up shoot his whole school up
peep how i’m puttin the scheme
cmon my nigga… look at me king
you see that large picture somethin that i got king
loaded lux loaded what loaded lux loaded what
loaded lux — how you got the name loaded lux
not 4s you clutch unloaded and loadin up
it was ups loading trucks
you better be super loadin them up
cause if loaded overloaded he wouldnt be loaded enough
i mean i was good with goodz i surfed with surf
and now i’m loaded for loaded
i hold it for loaded i load it for loaded i open and close it
loaded lux let’s talk about chokin lux
they said lux choked i said lux choked oh yes
they said the second and third was crazy
i was like damn i thought you meant he choked to death
but let the fans tell it some of em say he’s perfect
he choked on purpose
he can craft rhymes out the air and he don’t rehearse it
he can disable a bomb and he won’t get nervous — he’s perfect
he can bury a meteor and it won’t resurface — he’s perfect
but legends don’t choke on purpose
i mean picture john elway on his last drive
within the goal line in his 4th in 5
the blitz come he scrambles and get in around it
sees the wide receiver open then intentionally grounds it
legends don’t choke picture jordan game 6 4th quarter
and him passin it to ron harper… legends don’t choke
my nigga what was the obstacle there
you couldn’t find nothin to rhyme with hospital bed
i mean not pop with the lead
shot in the head drop til you dead
you like to talk about calicoes pops and the feds
even that rhymes with hospital bed
why you didn’t just freestyle off the top—
round 2 loaded lux
just when we thought hollows had points to their rounds
youre brickin with your shot
you gotta be fuckin kiddin me
i do this whole movie production bit
the signs the divines the pickets and the props
and this is what you got
oh you in grave danger i know you can dig it
shit we’ll pick out the box
i mean look i could care less if you audition or not
i wrote this story for you i gotta stick you in the plot
but you gon love it the script is hot
i tell your mother look lady
i know crack was rough out there in the 80s
but don’t be depressed about your best
i mean these young heffers out here still droppin they babies
but you raised them with an agenda
and revelations is scripture just goin to take a few more of your funerals breakin until they remember
all that static on the set
that’s the same wire hangin for the antenna
and why it always take a black mother bangin on the box
for you niggas to get the picture
as far as the past leave it to lux
harlem been on the map but i’m back leadin the rush
you from a borough where ll was the battle mc to crush
as if nasty wasn’t enough
could you be the one run dmc let they last adidas to run up if the ave needed a crutch you a sad scene in the clutch
rupaul couldnt drag queens this much
i see them on jamaica ave
i’m movin like a coroner with this body of work without the tag
he bop and pass shoppin bags — what’s up son
i’m like this new shit if you got the cash
now see you baby boy i lie to yall not
it was the same scene in baby boy
where jody asked p are you a buyer or a seller
he didn’t even have the rest of the money
for the bail bondsman to buy you out the cellar
that should tell ya you buy we sell
whose hands the weakest dealt
in the end you got the bags but i got the cash
don’t cheat yourself treat yourself the streets is swell
you know that when you signed and you cd shelved
you need the help i go from the trunk like a keebler elf
ask your man grime about me
i know your hustle your origin that’s partly why i believe your partnership got your partner shipped
you came down when he went up it’s not bargainin
it’s like sponsorin free trade been the game
since first 48 hours got marketin
targetin crews that who lack honor and staff arguments
is lom in the trap partyin or in the rap partisan
yall shoulda been had an audience
on noggin with all barney friends
i mean all you niggas sing you might look like monsters on screen but you’re backyardigans
why the point man always tryna get it on the arm
food stamps come you gotta babysit the card
you don’t even help out with that rent up in the bronx
that’s you lom niggas living off of moms
you smoked yourself out of the last house that you was sleep
it’s such a disaster what that cannabis do
when your whole pad out in the street
it’s sad watchin this
if you doin this you’re down to whatever your last option is
you kids match snack opposite with rap operatives
the man butter his whole band rubber snap out of it
ars what you got to give i need 40 shorty
you can’t negotiate the big brother with black hostages
this don’t make good sense
why your voice be climbin like you’re whinin
changin pitch like the yankees bench aint this a bitch
came to vent at the main event
next time you rap about my age
you tell them who the most talked about battle rapper of this age
the guy that do the autopsies on the stage
i get to breakin down a rapper
i bet you aint have a book since spades
but i’m readin you nigga right before i’m takin out the chapters
you actors aint seen a star brighter
car lighters don’t go in like this hard fighter
punch for punch i aint never shown a weak hand but i off writers
you wish it was more like us both of our names public
but mines is the main hoverin
all that means is you got bars too just not the hang of it
you aint discovered
when i give a nigga this work it aint mae returnin
your fate determine no queens block will be safe to turn in
bourbon make you virgin i’m focused you with the surgeon
my next ep md check the sermon
you gon get this work til you fired in a furnace
calicoe got a casket for free you gonna earn it nigga
you with the madison square gardener
i rakes up the scratch and then leaves
dear father tell baby duress she aint safe on the street of tonkas
hollow the primadonna youre brakes on a beatup honda
greezy partners stretchin pies spendin dough
nigga you got a job at a pizza parlor
even smarter they say you was aau jump it and dunk it
round 2 hollow da don
nigga i was raised in aq nigga that’s queens
you said my band rubber
damn brother what does that mean
so you call niggas rubber oh that nigga rubber
that nigga soft — see i don’t get this shit
niggas be actin like lux on some different shit
but all he do is take some simple shit
like a door and make it intricate
they’re opposed to who’s opposin us
do you want it closed or shut
the life of sanctuary is close enough
and when it’s your turn things will open up
i seen more counter tops than a flower pot
an hour clock on the tower watch — and the crowd will rock
like woo i don’t know it just sounded hot
because you don’t understand him it don’t mean that he nice
for example he said it’s about 50cc of vicodin in his writing pen
but vicodin’s a pill and ccs liquid… what are you writin then
because you don’t understand him it don’t mean that he’s nice
i mean my bars give you that mmm i just shitted face
his bars give you that hmm i think i get it face
i mean you wanna know why lux is so deep
he tell his boys i can’t comfortably sleep
i don’t want to be stuck in fatigue
i need supplements meek like my digestive system functioning least and they’re like huh
he’s like “i’m tryin to get somethin to eat”
cause you don’t understand him it don’t mean that he’s nice
you know the reason why i don’t respect your flow
cause last battle you had the swag of that muslim
that was in the cypher with x and hov
i mean can’t you see that he’s fake
he came dressed like t d jakes
cause he can’t sell any of his cds and tapes
but when he battle raps people zone out sit and stare
in a mist of air as he paints that picture clear
and takes you to that place… that isn’t there
i mean wanna be like lux here’s some options
use smart words like synopsis
analyze an object or dance around the topic
i mean i made up stuff before
and i apologize and i’m makin amends
and i promise yall i will never put an intercom in a generator again
but if he was to do that they would make it make sense
it’s lux you don’t get what he’s sayin dummy
he’s talkin about the battle
he enter calm so he can generate some money
lux got bars — see but i don’t get this shit
cause nigga like that act like lux be on some different shit
but all you do is take some simple shit and make it intricate
and the ones that’s diggin it
look at him like “you can’t be serious”
to the ones that aint feelin it
act like they silliness and belligerent
but when they go home and break down these bars i’m mentionin
for followin you they the fuckin idiots
example what you gonna do put it all in my catchers mitt
i mean is this baseball are we playin catch and shit
oh i guess it went way over our heads and we aint catch the shit
wait yall aint catch this shit
i said he act like we playin baseball
and it went way over our heads and we aint catch the shit
well if he is makin sense and shit
only problem i got left with him
is slow down your sentences don’t forget and remember it
and add a round off your penmanship
wait i can’t say this to lux
the god the legend the veteran aint nobody better than
oh you might need some notes to take home
i wrote some i’m gonna give you a letter then
dear lux we fuck with your energy
but the way you cram your bars
for some fans it’s frustratin mentally
slow down it aint all about the punchin your memory
i mean we like the way you structure your similes
but sometimes you run through them literally
we fuck with your energy but we question abilities
oh what i’m tryin to tell you ps don’t rush your delivery
against miles he was the champ
we couldn’t shoo him he was in his prime
but now that we don’t get his rhymes
we just keep kick side of him when he finish lines
right before he begin his line
loaded it’s like i swallowed a laxative on accident
i got them shittin in they pants again
oh crap it’s him loaded forty thousands not enough to get a kilo just a sniff not for traffickin
couple thousand left over i guess i get me a casket then
after that it’s back to the ave again
layin down blankets with the africans
oh yall didn’t know he said i stay at moms house
but prior to summer madness 2
he was homeless so he had to do what he had to do
niggas that been on fortune or jamaica ave yall know this true
yall done had him sell some things to you
you dont want the lionz den cd cool
we got jeezy and weezy too
it’s usually five beloved but three for you
hold up don’t stop my sale beloved
it’s usually five beloved but three for you
alright alright times is hard bring me two

round 3 loaded lux
i hope you brought that pain medicine with you
cause you gon need it
how sweet breathin can be screened
door breezes when romanced
well the romans when they beat on jesus is in yo hands
but nothin i write can hit you harder than life
especially one weak for demons
but you say you straight in the state of the saints
we gon see if it’s new or leanin
promethazine codeine morphine it doesn’t motivate
the exposure makes you doze not awake these are opiates
the doses traits of the properties
of the poppy seed that the dopers take
make no mistake about this if you ever been around someone on heroin they’re a dependant
they go from bingin to druggin just to function that engine
the whole body readjust and you just can’t end it
they attack the habit but the cause of withdrawals is still pendin
so are you sober nigga
cause you said you stopped drinkin lean in october
well that isnt a surprise hollow
you picked the month wherein the end every individual lies
i mean you can dress it up how you picture it in your mind
but til hollow wean off it he gon always be a nigga in disguise
how fly is the moon man that went to the bottom
ever since you first spaced out in houston he had a problem
we listen and bear witness
you already snoo dat—in your system nigga
hollow the dininininin— my prediction
that repetition in your diction due to addiction
from sippin your mind slippin
its like your life written scripted but seem cryptic
you driftin off in the mist of the mission until its missin
oh the sorrow i came to clean young blood out sorrel
this aint even a quarrel nigga
this like quarry versus ali when the right follow
your sights boggle your time borrowed
your life shoulda been swallowed
hollows apollo the light model who fights drago
you might wallow into depression
dresser full of empty sprite bottles
i’ll never forget that night
when i seen you on 174th street and vice
it was at gunz video shoot
you had that cup in your hand and you was nice
and i asked to battle you
and out of all the avenues we coulda been on it was vice
wow the brain disease you can’t seem to knock out
and ironically i thought i never blocked out
that was god with me when you said follow me
into that pharmacy — you get the picture
the good farmer sees what need to be cropped out
you a bad weed and this a travesty and this one casualty
is gonna be for every one of your multiple personalities
are you the don dotti the ddddon duttar man
the dininini— nigga its all dimmin
but let me ask you this did you mean don lennon or don lemon
after the cnn journalist who dont even enjoy women
but boys in em speed stickin by mennen bennett
i think like him as a brother whos in a public figure
i figure in it to restore ignorance
i hate you lost niggas yall offswitches
they don’t put us on to the system i assist em
i tell him where it is and where this gets him
how the game rigged your name makes you look big
but you a victim that’s why they pimp him
i just see what you don’t see hollow i’m statin the facts
i made you the most money you ever been gave for a match
but don’t even thank me for that
i just wanna know why when every leader rise
they use his own kind to put the stake in his back
what they paid you at smack nigga
they probably paid you in smack
cause you can’t even see fast your last drank of that batch
but you paint me as wack
you make the fans see me as greedy as if i broke some treaty because i don’t let em treat me like a don
whos in the position to influence
for the student but educatin him wrong
baby you a star they love you the way you are
but i love you enough to not leave you the way you are
you make it hard for people that say what they mean
and mean what they say cause that what they mean
how they gon follow a junkie be a fan not a fiend
and you be a nigga from queens not a queen
man up cause standup niggas don’t lean
this is revolution
not some shit you put on a song to sound cute with
a wise man once told me son you want respect huh
well you make money not excuses
im through with work
im up here givin hollow the business model
i’m showin the battle rapper today how to get it tomorrow
you welfare nigga free healthcare
you give it to him but don’t show him how you got it
how you gon teach business with free shit
where’s the knowledge but why should we expect a nigga named hollow to give us anything solid
i’m polished a freedom leader
but we will leave us and weak achievers 
i’m a contracted speaker an avid reader
i stand on these lines not for athletes sneakers neither
fbi been trappin keepers of light since trapperkeepers
you mightve thought hoover was just a vacuum cleaner
yeah all right master thinker
these don lemons be twistin up yall agenda
that’s why i wore this image so you don’t forget to remember
why the members of the panthers tried
why bobby hutton and the fred hampton died
they can’t deny the answers lie
right there in history stamped in time
you youre the cancer that propaganda designed
it’s sad cause some minds you can’t remind
it’s bad you blind to the rubbish due to the druggin
they sat you down gave you time to think
prisonconfined bunked him
cause you won’t take more money from rap
but you’ll stand on the block with a pack you disgustin
who they trustin
i got to be the guy you wasnt for the youngin
to show him somethin cause if you look up to a hollow
you just gon grow up and do nothin
you should be banned from a booth nigga
unless you’re surrounded by a firin squad commanded to shoot
i got plans for the youth you tryin to lean on me
this is principal clark battlin sams on the roof
jump nigga kill yourself
all night i been givin you mad questions
but they can’t mix problems with bad guesses
hollow you aint loaded enough for the rap legend
you up here talkin all this big daddy kane shit
and you halfsteppin nigga my walks clearer
it’s like i’m thoughtsharin
on the frequencies that the dog hearin
i’m more darin than mcfadden runnin back with the ball bearin the wheel and youre caught starin
i should split your shit like divorced parents nigga
you know what forget the money forget that money
shit i should make peter pay me in pallbearers
show one a dollar somell bottlin a dream
you don’t understand that when you reproduce
everything you are is the product that you breed
god forbid a condom was a leak and you fatherin a seed
jay z if you’re listenin and you’re followin the tweets
you probably didn’t speak to obama before the speech
but i swear he might not pass one gun control law
but i’m tryna get every last one of these hollows up off the street man
i will battle anyone on the card with this hand of jesus
don’t you niggas ever throw rocks at the sun you can’t reach it

so in court when they ask occupation you had to put none
i’m pretty sure your baby moms on welfare you got one
this is 0908 around the time when you were a bum
so youd rather panhandle cds on the street than get a 95
were you too good to fly through them friendly skies
oh i know why cause niggas from the jobll be like
that’s loaded lux from smack
i though he was flossin on the grind
he’s workin here that nigga must be starvin for a dime
but if you was a real man
for your lil man you’d put that talkin to the side
but i guess your son aint more important than your pride
you shouldve got that work nigga
now his son is inhalin secondhand smoke
while playin with his tonka trucks with the cartoons on high
cause he don’t wanna hear his moms get fucked
you shouldve got that work there nigga
how you know calicoes pops aint try to fly through them friendly skies and got denied every time
so he supposed to be like you
waitin weeks for 40k from a league nah
blackface linked up with bmf and made 40k on the street
whether right or wrong who are you to judge that man’s fate
what you felt his vibe you looked him in the eyes
you felt his hand shake what you thought
he got life and they locked him up in a bad cave
he’s a lost nigga well i found him now say it to blacks face
can you relate have you ever sat in that cell with them hunger pangs cause you got transferred to another jail
and it took a couple days til your money came
you ever seen a blade open a face
sittin in court not knowin your fate
you get a letter that your man got killed
and you can’t go to the wake i aint think so
so think about that before you judge a life that you never lived
cause it’s easy to develop a large picture
when youre focused on the negatives
i’m at his true loves school i’m lookin for his bae bae
even his biggest dickriders go
put that chopper down i may day
but everybody in that school still get screwed
once i chop chop with that ak
cause over drama it don’t matter who kid that k slay
you had enough cause that chopper will clean him out
boom leave him standin where he stay
i couldve got the 49 and spray but i’m fantastic with the k
i said my nigga you aint got a street bone in your body
but when it comes to streets — head ice they fuck with him
cause when you was passin out bibles he was out there bubblin
when you was spreadin the word he was out there hustlin
that’s why the streets say that nigga ice he hot
i know it burns when i rub it in
i said quit with all that gandhi stuff
tellin us youre headed for your selfdestruction
will only get your posse cut
click over everybody get bodied yup
this nigga get a 9 this nigga a couple times
i’m tellin you your clique over you aint hear me on the other line
i said loaded lux you aint got enough
cause i come around loaded
for the diesel i’m in your pad touchin your keys
in one click i have you down loaded
i said loaded lux and when he was homeless
his baby mom fault she left him
with 50 bucks in harlem had lux homeless
and other times he’s in the x with ten just roamin
they said is he broke
i said fuck broke he aint got a buck he broken
and they said i’ll be damned i thought lux was loaded
i said i seen him outside freezin stuck and froze
it’s ironic cause i’m the one that’s fuckin cold
but this is stuff he knows stuffy nose14embed"
