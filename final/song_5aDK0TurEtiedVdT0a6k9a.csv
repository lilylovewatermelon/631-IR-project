theres a bottle on the dresser by your ring
and its empty so right now i dont feel a thing
and ill be hurtin when i wake up on the floor
but ill be over it by noon
thats the difference between whiskey and you

verse 2
come tomorrow i can walk in any store
it aint a problem theyll always sell me more
but your forgiveness
well thats somethin i cant buy
there aint a thing that i can do
thats the difference between whiskey and you

chorus
ones a devil one keeps drivin me insane
at times i wonder if they aint both the same
but ones a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
and ones the long gone bitter truth
thats the difference between whiskey and you

verse 3
ive got a problem but it aint like what you think
i drink because im lonesome and im lonesome cause i drink
but if i dont break down and bring it on myself
itll hit out of the blue
thats the difference between whiskey and you

ones a devil one keeps drivin me insane
at times i wonder oh if they aint both the same
ones a liar that helps to hide me from my pain
and ones the long gone bitter truth
thats the difference between whiskey and you
