verse 1
did i wake you were you sleeping were you still in the bed
or is a nightmare keeping you up instead
poor baby are you feeling guilty for what you did
if you think youre hurting you aint seen nothing yet

prechorus
was it really worth it
was she everything that you were looking for to feel like a man
i hope you know that you cant come back
cause all we had is broken like shattered glass

chorus
youre gonna see me in your dreams tonight
my face is gonna haunt you all the time
i promise that you gon want me back
when your world falls apart like shattered glass
glass glass glass

verse 2
are you having trouble focusing throughout the day
do you find yourself still calling my name
do you wish you could rewind time and take it back
i bet you realize that she aint half the woman i am
you might also likeprechorus

was she everything that you were looking for to feel like a man
i hope you know that you cant come back
cause all we had is broken like shattered glass

chorus
youre gonna see me in your dreams tonight
my face is gonna haunt you all the time
i promise that you gon want me back
when your world falls apart like shattered glass
