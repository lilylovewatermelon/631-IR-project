i said woo dont make me
break out the velour suit and the staceys
give me a baseline and a break beat
fuck around on the dance floor make a baby watch me
got a cane with a gold tip
gucci ice cream tat type flow bitch
i could make it rain but i wont shit
cause im cheap motherfucker and i dont tip i dont
watch out im about to pull this new watch out ta dow
puttin in work we dont clock out
how bout we go and cut the rug at the powwow
get to movin and breakin and poppin like wild style
electric boogaloo
she movin that body like a booty in a hula hoop
gave her that look like you dont know what id do to you
and she was like oh my god i just googled you
jheri curl mullet on some mario lopez
last call then we go and hit the coat check
lyft outside buenos noches
now tell that motherfucker take us back to the homestead gone

chorus otieno terry

verse 2 macklemore
oh shit she just gave me her number number
you now dealing with the irish hustler hustler
like a 2002 usher usher
let that burn nah im wearing a rubber
plaid on me dancin like a one man army
turn a funeral into a dance party
meet the holy ghost ima catch me a body
you dont wanna see me when i start doin the zombie thriller
master p barbecue chip percy miller
thats a rap snack im a fat dad got some fat abs
sweatin like im eatin jalape√±os out in baghdad
you aint on the level got a medal for the flash dance
you aint fucking gigging what the hell you getting mad at
i pulled up in that purple thang
i didnt dress like prince in purple rain oh my god
lions cheetahs like the circus came
and i should charge everybody to observe the game
pour shots big up and fuck cops
invite the whole neighborhood to a party on my block
up rock a booty juicier than a cumquat
boyfriend mean muggin little buddy fuck off
chorus otieno terry
now take your shoes off in here
we dont need to talk we dont need to talk
i said im shooting for the moon baby
now watch me walk watch me walk
i dont believe in gravity honey
im an astronaut im an astronaut
just wanna see you levitate and ima watch ima watch
