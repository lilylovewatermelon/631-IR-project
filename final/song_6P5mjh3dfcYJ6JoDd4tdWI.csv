there was a time
i packed my dreams away
living in a shell
hiding from myself
there was a time
when i was so afraid
i thought id reached the end
baby that was then
i am made of more than my yesterdays

chorus
this is my now
and i am breathing in the moment
as i look around
i cant believe the love i see
my fears behind me
gone are the shadows and doubt
that was then
this is my now

verse 2
i had to decide
was i gonna play it safe
well but somewhere deep inside
i tried to turn the tide
and find the strength to take that step of faith
