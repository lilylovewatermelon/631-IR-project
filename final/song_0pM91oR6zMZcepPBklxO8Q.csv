does it smell like a school gymnasium in here
its funny how theyre all the same
its funny how you always remember
and weve both done it all a hundred times before
its funny how i still forgot

prechorus
it would be a hundred times easier
if we were young again but as it is and it is

chorus
were just two slow dancers last ones out
were two slow dancers last ones out

verse 2
and the ground has been slowly pulling us back down
you see it on both our skin
we get a few years and then it wants us back

prechorus
it would be a hundred times easier
if we were young again but as it is and it is

bridge
to think that we could stay the same
to think that we could stay the same
to think that we could stay the same
but were two slow dancers last ones out

were two slow dancers last ones out
