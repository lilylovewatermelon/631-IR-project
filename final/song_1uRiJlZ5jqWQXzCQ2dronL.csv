id give anything
but i wont give up on you
id say anything but not goodbye
i will run with your changes
and im always on your side
and theres not a word that ive ever heard
that will make me change my mind

chorus
words theyll try to shake you
dont let them break you
or stop your world from turning
when words keep you from feeling good
use them as firewood and let em burn

verse 2
like stones in your pocket
people try to wear you down
someone always wants to take the love youve found
so lets run with these changes
and i want you by my side
and theres not a word that ive ever heard
that could make me change my mind

chorus
words theyll try to shake you
dont let them break you
or stop your world from turning
when words keep you from feeling good
use them as firewood and let em burn
