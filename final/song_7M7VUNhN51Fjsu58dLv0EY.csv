so you found out today your lifes not the same
not quite as perfect as it was yesterday
when you were just getting in the groove
now youre faced with something new
and i know it hurts and i know you feel torn
but you never gave up this easily before
so why do you choose today to give it all away

well its not so bad yall together we all fall
just as long as we get up well stand tall
we shouldnt waste another day
thinking bout the things that we forgot to say
im hitting back yall kicking these four walls
just as hard as i can til i cant crawl

prechorus
i wont waste another day
with all these silly things swimming in my brain

chorus
theres no giving up now
do you really wanna give this all away
cant you ever see things in a different way somedays
no giving up now
such a beautiful thing to throw away
you should think things through
over and over again
all over again

so your scars fade away you soaked up the pain
a better person cause you lived through those days
and now you know what its like to prove
you can overcome anything that gets to you
well its alright were saying our goodbyes
to the past and everything that aint right

prechorus
wont waste another day
with all these silly things in our way

chorus
theres no giving up now
do you really wanna give this all away
cant you ever see things in a different way somedays
no giving up now
such a beautiful thing to throw away
you should think things through
before you give it up now

bridge
i know we have given all that we can give
when theres nothing to lean on
well id remember this
all we make of this lifetime is always here within
and remembering thats why
we should never give in
chorus
do you really wanna give this all away
cant you ever see things in a different way somedays
such a beautiful thing to throw away
you should think things through
over and over again
all over again

outro
theres no giving up nowembed"
