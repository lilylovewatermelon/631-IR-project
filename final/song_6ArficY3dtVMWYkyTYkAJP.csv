sold i to the merchant ship
minutes after they took i
from the bottomless pit

but my hand was made strong
by the hand of the almighty
we forward in this generation
triumphantly

wont you help to sing
these songs of freedom
cause all i ever had
redemption songs
redemption songs

emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
none but ourselves can free our minds
have no fear for atomic energy
cause none of them can stop the time

how long shall they kill our prophets
while we stand aside and look
some say its just a part of it
weve got to fullfil the book

these songs of freedom
cause all i ever had
redemption songs
redemption songs
redemption songs

old pirates yes they rob i
sold i to the merchant ships
minutes after they took i
from the bottomless pit

how long shall they kill our prophets
while we stand aside and look
yes some say its just a part of it
weve got to fulfill the book

so wont you help to sing
these songs of freedom
cause all i ever had
redemption songs
all i ever had
redemption songs
these songs of freedom
