silver sands of st augustine
fire in the ground between my better teeth
were dancing on the poison in their graves
at the end of the night wed all seen better days

chorus
i know you tried i know youre cursed
i know your best was still your worst
when hollywood was calling out your name
st augustine

verse 2
if i stayed behind
would you let your hair grow
i will forget the favors that you owe
im dreaming of car wrecks and thunderstorms a bright
lets bury ourselves and go haunt someone tonight

chorus
i know you tried i know youre cursed
i know your best was still your worst
when hollywood was calling out your name
st augustine
