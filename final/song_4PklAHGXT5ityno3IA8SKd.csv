verse 1 polo g  stunna 4 vegas
hit the strip after school couldnt wait til i got out of class used to stare at the clock and shit
before all of this rappin shit i was gangbangin and doin highspeeds on the cops and shit
and im straight from the chi but i ball like a king up in cali and shoot like stojaković
keep applyin that pressure i go on the run it aint no lettin it up aint no stoppin this
had to tell my lil brother to chill gotta stay in the house come outside he be poppin shit
you aint heard about us well you need to go watch the news niggas know we be dropping shit
got the feds on my ass in the hood cause they think im the one who been buyin up glocks and shit
im just focused on music they say my last tape was a classic but i got some hotter shit hotter shit
might be rocking a show or if im not up the stu then im fucking this cash off
dont you know polo g skinny tall with the dreads that lil nigga be rappin his ass off
yeah i heard she got surgery still wanna clap from the back just to see if her ass soft
go like harden with rockets we blast off
tried to throw us some bullets but we made em fumble like nah you aint gettin that pass off
spin the block now im takin my mask off
hit the gas like we racin speed off in them foreigns and leave tire marks on the asphalt
its gon be rip once your ass caught
