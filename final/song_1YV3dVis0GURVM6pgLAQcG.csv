all i wanted comes in colors
vanish every day
i keep these promises these promises
stranger things will come before you
always out of the way
we keep these promises these promises

chorus 2
can you call it see it coming
just enough to tell a story
bout a portrait of a young girl
waiting for a new year

verse 1
all you ever wanted
is it getting away
visions of a feeling
the footsteps at bay
you were getting stronger
memories again
now youre open wider
its better this way

chorus 1
all i wanted comes in colors
vanish every day
i keep these promises these promises
stranger things will come before you
always out of the way
we keep these promises these promises

wont you write a letter
on the page
in your own way
write it in a letter
on the page
its your own way

verse 2
you were getting wiser
its better this way
faces in the mirror
memories again
now look to a feeling
its lighter than breath
all you ever wanted
is it getting away

chorus 2
can you call it see it coming
just enough to tell a story
bout a portrait of a young girl
waiting for the ending of an era
can you call it see it coming
just enough to tell a story
bout a portrait of a young girl
waiting for the new year8embed"
