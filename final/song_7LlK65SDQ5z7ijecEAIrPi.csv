lately i have had the strangest feeling
with no vivid reason here to find
yet the thought of losing yous been hanging
round my mind

far more frequently youre wearing perfume
with you say no special place to go
but when i ask will you be coming back soon
you dont know never know

chorus
well im a man of many wishes
i hope my premonition misses
but what i really feel my eyes wont let me hide
‘cause they always start to cry
‘cause this time could mean goodbye

verse 2
lately ive been staring in the mirror
very slowly picking me apart
trying to tell myself i have no reason
with your heart
just the other night while you were sleeping
i vaguely heard you whisper someones name
but when i ask you of the thoughts youre keeping
you just say nothings changed

well im a man of many wishes
i hope my premonition misses
but what i really feel my eyes wont let me hide
‘cause they always start to cry
‘cause this time could mean goodbye goodbye
oh im a man of many wishes
i hope my premonition misses
but what i really feel my eyes wont let me hide
‘cause they always start to cry
‘cause this time could mean goodbye11embed"
