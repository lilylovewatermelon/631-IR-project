closing time
open all the doors and let you out into the world
closing time
turn all of the lights on over every boy and every girl
closing time

closing time
you dont have to go home but you cant stay here

chorus
i know who i want to take me home
i know who i want to take me home
i know who i want to take me home
take me home

verse 2
closing time
time for you to go out to the places you will be from
closing time
this room wont be open til your brothers or your sisters come
so gather up your jackets move it to the exits
i hope you have found a friend
