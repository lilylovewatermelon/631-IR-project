please welcome the man the myth the legend cannabis hey everybody
everybody love you all right guys so uh yeah i figured lets ask cannabis a
couple of questions to get this thing rolling and then well get into some song reviews right after that so um
right away it is im curious like just tell us a little bit about like your journey as a hiphop artist you know
where did you start out and and how did you get to where you are today right so uh you know
funny enough um i started out back in the 80s uh beatboxing
before rama right so i used to beat box for well started out breakdancing really thats where it
started my journey with rap music and hiphop and so you know breaking and popping and
locking and all that but that doesnt really go that far after you know what im saying your grandmother smashes a
couple of your boom boxes you know you start to leave that alone so um uh pretty much got out of the popping
unlocking and i used to beatbox for one of my homies um that used to uh rhyme
down there in uh florida um two live crew was out at the time and there was a group called afro rican and my homeboy
ian used to dj for uh for afro rica now and then and eventually he became my d my dj i went
to a high school called aboard anderson we used to call the ba for on board anderson but that was back when like the
18 was out we should just call it b8 because it was like bad news bad attitude type of place but you know we
made the best of it a lot of talent came out of florida at that time he had plantation he had dillard high school so
long story short with the beatboxing i was beat boxing for my homie used to rhyme
then i went from uh beatboxing to starting around myself so
that when we would have battles with other other dudes at school or stuff like that we used to flip it on him like
i was beatboxing he was rhyming and then for somebodys crew who had the same kind of dynamic he would start
beatboxing and i would start rhyming and we did it strictly in the beginning to just throw the people who were watching for a
loop and and and beat the person we were up against or the group we was up against and so uh after doing that
it really turned things upside down on his head and uh i started to rhyme and then uh i
was 13 at the time and then i really got into a series when my mom went up to uh
um one of the ads in the paper that i was looking at to get me in the sonic 16 plus so that i could start sampling and
doing beats and so thats how i started and i had to make the beach for my own demo before i met the lost boys which
eventually turned into how i got my recording contract with universal umg
thats amazing so you kind of have like youre doing in lots of different things right you started out with the boombap and the i
mean the the beatboxing did you do any breaking pneumatic just pneumatic
yeah you said breaking would you say oh group home you said
whats that now did you do any breakin as well when you back in the days oh
logan yeah all day man like all day like like um
um from uh you know its just uh thats like that was something that you
do you know kids they bounce off the walls anyway right we were young at that time like we were
we were um you talking about like well like you know anywhere from eight
to like 12 you know what i mean like that was a long time ago boss like so children are always bouncing off the
walls and back then there was no internet that we were there was you know there was nothing to keep you glued in one
place we were just always bouncing off the walls so breakdancing was something
we did just because man it was cool to do and thats what we did in the beginning and then of course like i said
you know you started to advance a little bit more and then it came with the beat box and then it came with the
me going to go get my sonic plus my sampler and thats when i started like sampling and truncating
beats what did it call it you truncate quantize your uh lfo wave you cut and
you put the little disc in and go you put the os disk
yeah you know and thats how it started for me you know what i mean so i am familiar with
with what the producers do at least at the beat making process um
once it gets into the you know like like ive heard stories with a certain you know top of the tier
producers theyll run theyll do the make the record and then theyll take it and put it back
to two inch and then bounce it out on two inch and then put it and then run it back into
digital so you know theres techniques that these guys are using now thats just like way over the top
you know for sure man i think back on those early days when when you got your first record
deal like how do you think the industry has changed now for upandcoming artists compared to back
then so i want to i want to applaud like everybody out there now
thats just um thats continuing to do this you know thats even
trying to get into it now like trying to break into it now i want to applaud you because
you really youre really standing up uh like youre standing up youre facing
obstacles that we didnt really have at that time when we were coming up and i salute you
for it man like its not nothing now is uh nothings now nothing now is
is guaranteed like not even the opportunity anymore like now you know
your ambition has to pretty much you got to go in their ambition heavy like you got to have enough ambition to
spare youve got to have enough determination to be able to start out with a crew of five
people and after everybodys quitting or you know something happened they move
off to the sideline you gotta go it all alone like thats the type of determination
ambition you have to have now and i dont envy this younger generation for it its very difficult now for them um
i will say that your company the kind of structure that you guys got going it
really does help them it gives them a big boost as to you know their options and what they can do
but without without that type of foundation or cornerstone i mean for for me like just for example
when we were coming up you know andre harrell did this uh you know rest in paradise to andre to
harrell too but so theres a story and i know the story is true but he um
andre slept like oh he didnt sleep but he spent the night outside one of the offices
uh it was down there and uh next to times square like not too far
from where the original um uptown records was at because i i i interned at uptown so i i remember
like its running in sabaros kitchen is above its like 30 30 38 42nd street like right there in times
square like uh its right over there in that area and um your quad next to quad quads down the block so its unique
down as those are also famous studios but uptown records was right there on that block like right here in the middle
of times square and um its funny because i remember times when the stories were
that like dre herrera when he was trying to get his deal for jekyll and hyde he um
he wasnt able to uh like get through to the the gentleman that he was trying to meet with you know
they werent interested and so he just like uh like every time he tried to speak to him
and hand them music they just werent interested hes like do you have five minutes youre like no not right now so he ended up waiting downstairs
like you know when they got off work they saw him there when they came into work in the morning they saw him there like like dre harrell made it impossible
for them to get in and out of the building in or out of the building without seeing him till one of the days
the gentleman just said to him what what i see here all the time like what can i help you with hes like thank
you uh if you got five minutes ill let you out ill tell you so he says yeah all right play it man so
you know that kind of thing thats how dre andre harrell was able to get his label imprint for you know he
did the jekyll and mr hyde thing thats how it started for him but then from there he was able to get his label in
print uh basically start to get to uptown have all those artists you know the mary j bliges the uh you know puff
puff was working as diddy now you know um you know what i mean in the early days jodeci you know father mc heavy d
um so for real lost boys i mean you just name it like so many
groups came out of that label and uh you know what i mean like uh
thats how andre harrell started thats what im trying to say like and nowadays
you cant do it that way anymore you cant just sit down in front of somebodys building or you cant you
cant you cant you cant strongarm anybody into giving you a moment to listen to your stuff you
know what i mean um and thats sad i dont really envy these folks now because of what they got to go
through its just endless endless typing on the keyboard you know what i mean youre just sending
emails everywhere you know what i mean its its its easy for your stuff to get stolen i supposed or reinterpreted
someone take your stuff like its so easy to get your stuff bootlegged now or or pirated so
i dont envy him so i gotta applaud you guys for doing it you know what i mean im kind of here to learn from you too
man right on i i think i think all the people im seeing in the chat they they appreciate that because yeah it is it is a lot of work i think it is also theres
so much opportunity now right things are different i think youre kind of being youre definitely being humble too saying like oh i kind of had it sort of
easy which it was never easy not to mention i think its dope how youre able to stay on the cutting edge of stuff like
youve got you know the nfts youre doing these bundles you know all this kind of stuff so im wondering how
for for artists who want to like forge their own path and then also stay consistent for decades like you have and
stay relevant how how have you approached that how have you been able to do that where like youre youre putting out the most material ever it
feels like now um you know and youre doing using this new technology and doing all this cool stuff
what was your approach to stay relevant technology is always a always a great
thing to have on you know you know technology i mean it really
does it when when its customized for you and built for you
um it can really streamline your your you know your your completion process the
streamline and things that youre getting done um your task list but in so insofar as relevancy or
you know staying power or whatever you want to call that i gotta be honest with you
its up to the fans i call my fans like its pretty much like a brotherhood and thats who i got to give it up to i
got to give it up to them man thats how you you retain your footing man because
we all have you know similar to the same if not identical
um uh you know amounts of reach i mean you know we got
we got we got we got 10 of these you know sometimes a little bit less i hope not
anymore we got and we got 10 down there and and you know
that can only get you but so far its its the fans that are behind you
that you know you build a rapport with them where youre giving them something that they can only get from you they
cant get it from anyone else and once they identify with that and they know that they cant get it anywhere else now
youve got something going on where the synergy and what the technology does is that comes along to help
you and them finetune a way to stay connected thats thats really thats really what
the technology means to me its a way for me to stay connected to them mind you i dont have as much time as i wish i
had in order to just sit down and kick it with them and stuff but um the technology does make it so that
we can we can kick it with each other and uh i would say that thats key like
for anybody out there wanting to know um i saw reals the reals cassette chase
yeah its funny somebody or they just talk about reels or reels and cassette tape yeah so um so uh yeah you know its about its
about the brotherhood man like your fans your base your uh your demographic
um you always want to have some kind of connection to them to where you know you
dont have to ask them what is it that they want in the beginning you just want to do what youre doing and see who
who is who gravitates towards it or who whos interested in it and from there you can kind of finetune
whats going on and i got to tell you man like my my brotherhood theyve been with me
for a long time like due to ups and the downs yo and um
its you know its like we grew up together man weve been through a lot of stuff together
yeah man thats thats really great that you say that because a lot of what gabe and i teach you know we try to teach
artists and producers how they can have a successful career and a lot of that is based on building a community right like
having that tribe around you and having that relationship because without that you know you dont really have much as
an artist right you have to you got to treat this as okay so
lets lets lets go ahead and lets pay homage to the big labels for one of the things that they get right
and thats uh when they press the button on you theyre getting your stuff on billboards
its in the commercials like when the machine presses the button youre everywhere they send your stuff
everywhere right but thats what they do right okay so
but as a but as an artist or someone trying to break into the game because you never hear me really talking
bad about like umg like my former label you never really because the truth is
that if it wasnt for umg taking a chance on me then i wouldnt have gotten anywhere
you see where im trying to where im coming from like of course you have artists that like even lets take cash
money for an example and im only bringing them up because i was there i watched how when they came to ung
cash money was huge where they were at you know in the neighboring south and all that they were huge but they needed
that extra off that extra gas when it came to the videos worldwide
distribution and marketing like they didnt have that so universal they did a 50 50 and thats but but they already
had the the the corvettes the the hummers the jewelry the uh
the you know the pt cruisers the bikes the the convoy the police convoy driving
them around they already had all that stuff you know the the compound where you got
20 producers in there producing on on on the tracks at the same time like a compound like a studio compound they had
all this stuff prior to getting with umg so when they got the umg
they were just ready to shoot videos but they had all the toys that you would need for a video so
once again a label is going to get you out there to the world known to the world whether you
have like all of this money or not theyre still going to get you out there but
you know if theres any advice or counsel or just kind of like a fail safe
that i could give to the people watching is that no matter how huge your label is
or no matter how big a deal you get and no matter how much you know how great things are going for
you once they press the button always remember that if they take it all the way from you tomorrow
what do you have left to work with so you have to treat that situation as if it is 15 minutes you got 15 minutes
what are you gonna do and i i heard that andy warhol thats his thats his uh
thats his term he coined that youre 15 minutes so and it really is like 15 minutes man its not five
you know its not half hour its not an hour its more like 15 minutes man which is its like that you know its just
long enough for you to get used to it and enjoy it but not long enough for you to
you know get so comfortable that you know you think that its never going back to the way it was so you know we
got to treat this as like you get in here you know always be cordial and polite
to these people that are on your team that are with you that are helping you even if they might not be doing it to
the best of their ability or they might just be you got to be polite and cordial to them because remember theyre just doing a job too and um and you never
know where its going to take you 10 years down the line or 20 year my case 27 years later you know youre still
going to see some of these people out here you you want to have some kind of relationship where they know that
you know what this guys been out here for this many years and uh
you know hes hes hes never done this and hes never done this but hes doing this you know what i mean hes you know
you can count on him to be this way and if somebody else comes along and says well hes like this they like nah thats
not the guy i met the guy i met was was like you know he had his head screwed on straight you know what i mean and so
thats what uh thats what i could say to those folks watching man is like always
always build your own brand as if if
if the if the hype and the label gets taken away from you tomorrow that you still have something to stand on
you know you still have something to work with yeah no thats great advice and i feel also like if you focus on that first
building that brand building that community the labels are going to be more interested in the first place anyway right because they nowadays they
just theyre looking for people already have that builtin audience right so if you focus on that but you know even once
you once you get on the label like you said later on if for whatever reason it doesnt work out or you move on to your
own thing you still have that same brand you still have that audience as well so yeah thats the way to do it
oh man well lets lets kind of uh bring it back to right now and and cannabis today and im just curious if you can
tell us a little bit about this new project you brought out today and where people can get a copy of that yeah so um
lets see here he said thats why i got it mike club oh hes taking it back okay so uh how many folks we got in here by
the way lets take a look at what yeah it looks like almost a hundred
wow 87 it looks like yeah you cant fit 100 people where im at man so thats a big deal but um
yeah man uh definitely um you know the project right now its one
of many um it it pretty much is talking about a certain time an era when we were
releasing music like at that level um we were on the road
that madie and i and uh born son uh occasionally we bring que solo out there
we had him out on the road with us like i mean we were out there getting it popping man so
um those records were done like during that time a little bit before maybe a little bit after and the wreckage kind
of reflect what was going on at that time like in hiphop some of my stuff is a little bit
a little bit uh a little bit forwardreaching so so like for example like the record um
they had a complete i was recorded in 2014
and uh and i was talking about a lot of things on there that pretty much had started to transpire
um recently so and thats fay out of complete um so so yeah you know uh this record
were taking a snapshot back as opposed to um
you know looking forward like this this almighty era wreck is taking a snapshot back
most of the other records i record with 80 and so forth theyre always taking a snapshot of the future
and at the very least like the present you know shout out to all the jurassic fighter j5 people man
okay and where can people check out the album oh so they can go get that record on uh
uh canny nftcom thats uh thats uh wwwcan
i nftcom um you know yeah you can get you can go there you
can check out we got all kinds of things up there you can go get um you know and then of course uh music man
you know we got music coming so uh you know yall get in there check it out and
um just so that people know my thing is always like tonight
a couple of my buddies got got like a little radio station thing that theyre doing um its called like the circle or
something the circle um cali ranks is on it ive got third eye on it ive got uh
um they invited me over to it um its gonna be friday night at nine theyre
gonna start and i dont know maybe ill get a a a a link and put it up later but
im supposed to be playing like some some records that i did theyre collaborative records its like one of
my little things that ive been working on a project of mine and um thats the kind of thing that
like im into im really into the collaborations um and uh and ive got like ive got
like everywhere i turn ive got a collaboration to either do or complete or or get to and im doing that right
now but this the site with this little radio station im doing that tonight
and um im building and expanding on whats already going on like you guys are gonna see like like as as were moving in the
future because i know youre heavy in this space hanno i told you uh i got a lot of respect for you um and gabe but
you in particular because i watched you build this man i was around like you know 14 years ago 15 years ago and saw
your name buzzing back then bro its a big deal thanks man i appreciate that yeah
cool man well im super excited about that radio show for sure ill be tuning into that and uh yeah i already already
listened to the album you know i know most of the songs already so yeah everybody go check that out its its an
incredible project and uh also shout out to matt for kind of the being there for that process
too like putting together that i guess that time period in your career so you know i wanna drop off i wanna drop a
bomb on campus right now because he doesnt know you know this this is born in jamaica and anna was well youre born in germany
or united kingdom germany right germany yeah yeah so so anno and i were doing so much business i had every like record
label wed ever worked with every artist wed ever worked with like sign off so he could move to america you know get
his work visa and annos family had never met me and theyre like who are you to just uproot
our son from us and then you know he ended up meeting the love of his life in america and he
still lives in the usa and so when i met his family at the wedding theyre like we didnt like you at first but you know
our son is now with his soul mate so like youre good people but like thats how back how far back like anna and i go
like we used to talk on like aol instant messenger and stuff like that so its like all these years later man annos as
strongwilled as anyone i know because man he has to deal with me
you did show me some pictures you did show me some pictures yall was hanging out it was years ago though those
pictures yeah i mean but it still means something thats thats really what what were talking
about like what matt just said there were talking about relationships were trying to
show the folks that are tuned in and watching this man were like so one thing we did have then is we
we understood a little bit more about longlasting strong relationships
than this this uh confluence of the moores law
has created like its created a lot of frankenstein stuff where people
you know they theyre like trolls some of them are trolls or they give way to the troll stuff and they they get
involved in that stuff and its counterproductive and so what happens is people dont realize that one day youre
youre kind of going to be like on the chopping block or close to it and youre going to need people to vouch for youre
going to need people who are real like real people not just you know this this internet stuff you
know what i mean so we got to have some kind of real solid connection beyond just
the you know the machine and these these these you know the sound waves and just the electric vibe like there has to be
some kind of soul vibe still and um i just want to point that out you know
because 10 years down the line youre still going to be here you feel me you know if life lasts if god is good
you know what im saying life lasts youll still be here 10 years down the line you want to have build these relationships with folks
that you can still count on yeah man life lessons right there i appreciate that but uh listen
you know as much as id love to like just ask you questions all night and i have lots of them you know most of the guys here they really want to play their
music for you so maybe we can get into playing some tracks and you give us your thoughts
yeah for sure let me uh let me get some of these lined up we have some of these basically we raffled these off from
people who bought um that uh that exclusive tape thats got uh your feature on there i do
my preferences id rather play the ones from the people who are here so let me know is moochie c or k camp sushi in

we got uh k camp sushi uh right here whats

the gates of buckingham
daddys second palace knockout and im like yo right right when i wrote that
wow yeah so i never heard the finished product man thats a dope man you got busy on that the wreck is the wreck is
dope you know thank you what you doing with it you know uh it
aint got it the hook in it is real small like uh you know if if youre at the record label you know what theyre telling you like yo yall
need 16 16 16 what is that   
thats right all right thats what we talking about man you know i mean we just you know what it is man
we still we still young and hot man in spirit yo we we just wanna we just wanna bounce all over the walls let that rhyme
go take take the leash off and just let it go big fat
why they so mad at us for doing that man like we just we just trying to stay out of trouble like it keeps us out of
trouble it helps burn off that energy man like you know thats a big factor i i mean
like i see it like this im never gonna stop writing whether i get on or not i dont look for
that anymore what i look for is just putting out my heart and letting people know that you know what im saying
try to let people feel what im trying to say you know im saying with my words instead of like saying it because its
kind of hard i applaud you i applaud you saying that because i always thats what
i always say you took the words out of my mind i always say
that when people the people make their music youre making it for the creator like
youre not really making it for you know the charts and the record labels its not really what youre
making it for youre making it for the creator first and foremost because thats how youre showing that
you know if it even makes any sense like if the creator gave you you know seeing the ability to be part by pedal and run
or walk when thats what you do is you when youre a child youre growing up you know how to crawl and you learn how
to you know tumble around and eventually youre walking and then youre walking and youre running so
when you get to the point where you can write rhymes or make a beat or play an
instrument youre the first person that youre going to impress with that is the
creator because the creator gave you that ability you know what im saying so so now once thats over with
you should be at peace with what you make you just go ahead and make the best you can and you should be at peace with
it because the creators satisfied with it the problem is we kind of dont get satisfied as humans
until somebody just sit next to you is like yo you know that    is crazy yo let me
hear that again or until its playing on the radio its playing on the tv and everybodys on your jock
theres nothing wrong with it theres nothing wrong with it but but im im making a distinction between the
two its not that when we make it its not good enough to be out to be on the radio
or be on the tv all day thats not whats happening theres just a distinction there where what youre
making if its like the record we just made that records dope enough to go all the
way if a label came behind and i pressed the button on it it could go all the way you should have that before but
but since theyre not pressing a button on it thats not what the thats not excuse me thats not whats destined for
that one then the creator is still impressed by and still happy with it satisfied with it i
know what i heard i was satisfied with it and i want you of all people to be satisfied with it
brother because thats the whole point you see im saying thats the whole point sushi we gotta
we gotta and even for the folks out there listening like dont feel bad or feel defeated or feel deflated or
dont you know dont get dont get that feeling of um of uh you know lack of selfworth or any
type of you know just anything derogatory or negative behind your music not being accepted you know
by by people somewhere or group here or what have you because like i said were
making it for the creator first you see what im saying right all right thats all cause i feel like
sometimes people get really they get really caught up in how how it feels and and i need yall to
know for everybody out there listening trust me when i tell you like ive felt
more of that pain when it comes to like music and rhyming and rap or what have you
probably more than than most people on here i mean i dont know everybodys story but um its quite possible that i felt
more than anybody i i dont got to show many summits and crap
different summits and then crashed and then and and now its all about its all about streamlining it now but but in the
end in the end what is it youre really looking for youre looking for
your work as a whole you know what im saying when you look at it from you know when you factor
everything in and you average the mean youre looking at it for it to be agreeable to the creator you see what
im saying like you youre looking at it for the creators just be like even even if he even if he you know im saying
like he look at it and you know his stomach gurgle a little bit or he look at it and theres no smile he
doesnt crack up like a like a cheese smile or he doesnt but if he just if he just looks and give you the nod or wink
at you or what have you you know its agreeable to the creator you know what im saying and thats good enough thats
good enough brothers thats just its like yeah its good enough for us you know
yeah i was seeing i was seeing that you got your website in the nft website
you you getting into that now because im into that so right so its candynftcom
um thats like forward thinking right like like uh i havent really started
um doing the nft things like full flush as yet because theres a lot more to it
than people might think so um im pretty much now just looking on ways to
you know how to add value to it before i just drop one you dont drop one and then try to add value to it you want to
add value before right right i just dropped my my my collection
okay 27 its called sushi man in case you youre looking at okay
make sure m80 gets the link over there or ano or um gabe gets a link and ill go over that ill grab one it aint
nothing ill grab
want to do though is you know over the course of time we want to add value to our jones story you feel me like like
you just have them its not valued music
like really though in all seriousness we got to add value to our    man see
the people not gonna tell you that theyre gonna these folks thats running this game its still the wild west and
some of the rules are made when they finish making all the rules then theyre gonna open the gates and say come on in
but you know its good for us to try to get involved now and see whats going on and try to figure out how to add values
man you got it right yeah chris rodriguez you know what he talked about yeah they want to add that too but
we got to add value to it man we have to because once you know how to add value or you can add value to it then
you know by having a little bit of ownership of it now it matters in your world in your life right what whats happening whats
happening on other parts of the world is and other things that we do is um
well have stuff and then someone is devaluing what it is that were doing its like rap like rap
was devalued for the entire time i was involved with it like raps been devalued like they took
you know things that now should be priceless and and you know these things are like you cant find
them nowhere you know what im trying to say like i mean it was a time when i remember when we were
like okay im gonna give you an example so i remember the time of motown where there was a there was a restaurant in in
the city in new york on the east coast where uh you could um go in in the in
the motown restaurant and uh and they had like the motown cafe and
they had they had like michaels glove in there they had uh from the eisley brothers they had uh mr
biggs cane or something like that or something or another did he have like reality
they would have artifact right they would have artifacts and these things like trust me like you didnt even need to call police
and somebody whos trying to mess around with michael glover and if somebody would have reached in there did something like a glove and somebody would have probably you know saying
clapped you in there you understand right so
thats what i mean by value but now you know look like how valuable is michaels glove now is
what im saying you know what im saying like somebody would probably tell you it aint nowhere near as valuable
you see where im coming from so its tricky its tricky how theyll take your value from you so you gotta
i think thats probably very important for us to do im still looking im still looking for ways to do it but we gotta
add value to our stuff man we have to right right thats good advice i do
bro
dope dope i just want to make sure we get you know a little time for a couple other people because i know i know your your time is limited here

when 50 and john got into it right yeah so when 50 and john got into it
i remember that john m was doing a thing john was making a lot of noise remember when 50 came out
it was crazy it was crazy yeah but when 50 first came out before
he got with aftermath it was like he did that uh you know that how to rob track and then
this won a battle the ambulance picking them up and it was like it was crazy because
it wasnt defeat nobody knew that 50 was going to be the guy that he is today right
i remember when he came out one of the first things he did was he was like yo john you singing on the records    all
that you singing on a record music josh stopped singing on the record
and started he didnt want to sing on the record one and 50 started singing on the record laughter
and then thats how i dont know if you remember what im talking about man yeah of course
laughter he made him quit for him

collaborations man this is the way to the future i will tell you that you know im not sure
it can only get bigger from here but uh and im just you know im saying i just pray to the creator man that we
you know we dont get it taken from us like that we can we can you know get enough time to enjoy it and make some
make some classics but i will tell you that uh collaboration is the way its the way to
get to the goal line man its you can only do it through collaborating i mean when you look at every other industry
and every other genre of music or entertainment in general you know hollywood went you know when those
credits rolled at the end of the film every one of those names in the credit
and the in the credits you know were were responsible and took you know they pulled their weight
they they drew they draw their they had a certain amount of draw weight they told the line to get it across to get it
across the line and um thats always something that you know thats what i was saying man build these
foundations build them as strong as you can so that you know heading out to the
future you have you youll have you have crutches out there you know in the event that were all
human sometimes you make a misstep something happens and its easier for you to get back in
step no straight up brother and actually ive noticed exactly what you said um
since dropping collaborations and    ive seen the release radar on spotify go way up
um for everybody dropping collabs and stuff my advice is for you to drop on a friday
spotify picks it right up and get it at least seven days in advance
pitch pitch it to the playlist the editorials and stuff like that and youll get on the release radar
and uh thats thats thats solid advice radar advice i can tell i can tell you this
since since bis and i started you know working heavy on these records again between
our drop in december our drop in january our drop in february cannabis is monthly listeners has gone up 65 000
and his instagram his instagram social media account has gone up 7 200 and uh you know so its like the more
the merrier man thats what we want yeah hes made up very good for all yall wondering
what those numbers are when he tells you what the fee is man thats what it is see he knows those numbers man he can
spit him out and he knows where to find him you cant really uh you cant
you know you you the maggots couldnt eat match knowledge out of his head you know what im trying to say like like he
matt got it all up here yo its all up there man straight up
and working together collaborating thank god you know we have the ability to work with each other were all from
the same creator you know what it means so lets create will bring you more together through the
anno domini legion beats pipeline i promise you that oh hell yeah man im up for it
whats up all right so maybe well wrap it up with a couple of questions whats up brother jesse
hey headline peace peace headline peace man that was dope the record was dope
great job all right lets see whos got a good question for cannabis to wrap it up something uh that everyone can benefit
from i saw vladimir naval vlad naval thats vlad naval yeah
youre a sub captain man youre a sub captain without a dog thats a wicked name man
that is my real government name no cap wow um i gotta deal with this webcam real quick
uh was your pops like a uh you know a spook a sub spook
um see like my whole family was from haiti and all that
okay so the weird thing is like my mom got my name from
this show where they had this little kid and they named him vlad so it was like bloody me
so thats where i got my name from unfortunately the russian president is making my name look bad but thats not
what were here to talk about no man hey that name was that name been a powerful name for a long time g
you know im saying that to have naval behind it thats you know thats like you know these subs the silent fleets
man its a its a its a crazy government name yeah
all right but i got three questions that i want to ask real
quick the first one is related to your
uh whats a competition you had with eminem back in the day
would you have changed anything that youve done during that situation
like do you ever look back to a certain track you sit at him and be like dang i maybe should have put this bar in or
something like that well see what happened with with with the
you know elvis i call him elvis because he would hes an institution at this
point right hes not just a rapper or so anytime when someones like you know you know they
they say his name or they sort of like bring him up if it you know to me
i look at it like hes an institution they might look at it like hes a rapper but i know that hes an institution at
this point so you got to be you you got you you got to be objective about what youre saying you cant just
deal with an institution and say and just be subjective and just say whatever you want because youre
dealing with an institution so so and you know keeping that in mind ill
still be honest and be transparent and what ill say is like so there were always a lot of
uh arbitrary parties involved you know if he and i were in the same
space if we were in the same room or if we were outdoors in the same kind of cipher circle there was always like
extra heads standing there or around and i just feel like you know
whatever happened and however things developed i feel that a lot of that the
lions share of all of that was attributed to these extra folks standing around man
you know what im saying you know because it was always that it was always that you know what i mean because from
what i understand you know he always loved that kind of hiphop that style
and from the beginning and thats what he comes from is that raw spitting you know that that its all about the
lyrics and all about you your cadence and you know everything that makes you an mc
and a great one and and he was always about the same stuff that i was about you know what im
saying so how things didnt develop to where the fans
could you know see us together or whatever like i do take responsibility for things that you
know i have said or done maybe to uh like when i poked my chest
out when something was said and my name came up i had to poke my chest out and defend defend what i was doing but i
will say that i was never proactive and i was never the person to like launch a
first attack and stuff like that that was never my style like even up to now how i am
im not the im not the proactive offense or im never coming at something
first im always reacting to things i dont do that anymore but you know
that was my baseline was reacting to things and a lot of times when id react to it
id react to it and what i was doing was so much more uh inflammatory than
than than the the original cause for me reacting to it that people skipped right
over why is he saying that why is he doing that they would always get right you
well i mean look what you just did and nobody ever you know what i mean like looked at the
cause so um to to you know wrap that in a nice little bow tie for
you i really feel that had it not been for certain other arbitrary elements around
you know whether you could you could call them people or media or writers or what have you you know there was always
somebody telling him or telling me
the wrong thing for things to have developed better and thats thats really what it boils down
to like what do they call it like wrong advice or wrong counsel or things of that nature right
you know because you gotta you gotta remember that there are also things involved where for and im not im not playing this is
like its some type of card that im drawing out of a pack but theres truth to it you gotta remember that while
there is reverse racism and things like that going on in rap where there was in
the in the 90s um you still got to remember that you know there was a there was like a
takeover period where it seemed like for every mc hammer you had a vanilla ice or
for every um you know for every like uh you know chuck d slash you know um
uh uh uh uh nice and smooth or or or every uh
uh groups the group or artifacts or out out outsiders you had uh like an mc
search like a third base you know what im saying like for every facet of like rat
you would always have like another ethnicity come in there and play ball and i mean if you just look at it
im not like i said im not drawing any cards im just saying what it like how it developed it always looks like okay
so you got this person coming out and theyve been doing this for a long time then you got this one coming out and
its like they rock it straight to you know to untouchable realms where its like they become institutions you
know what im saying like somebody else makes it become an institution you know whereas
you know what i mean for for those that are you know not so you know i mean not so favored um you
know they end up having to like do everything the hard way you know what im trying to say and its just the
truth i mean people could say what they want they could be upset at it but i mean we all live it we live that we we
you know what i mean like i mean come on man like vanilla ice made so much more than hammer
i mean you you cant even and im not mad at vanilla ice like you know what im saying i like vanilla ice you know
what im saying like in terms of what he ended up doing after rap like i i looked at vanilla ice as a person and i could
see like i could see like how okay hes a cool dude and stuff but you know what hammer was taking care of his family too
thats why he went broke he was taking care of people that he didnt know so its kind of
that element was there and and youre asking me that question and im giving you an answer im giving you more than
just the answer im giving you the background to all of that you know what im saying and i saw some of my comments
because hammer was buying everything for people like thats not just it it also it was that when hammer came out
he um you know and this i wasnt there in hammers camp but what im saying to you is that i saw how
the record labels was going crazy about how you know hammer was selling so many records and then and then ice came out
and then um uh and ice was wearing the same type of pants that hammer was you know
them uh the rayon jumps you know what im saying yo so so i just remember
how hammer was supposed to i think he did is it 5 million the first time or 15
million the first time and then or 5 million and then the next time he was planning for him to do either 15 or 30
million and its like everybody was behind it but then you know it didnt do that and then they
just they just started pouring the water on the fire they started to put the fire out instead of
just give hammer some more lead time give him some more run time because when you look at ice ice got a whole lot of
things to keep him to kept him going that that ninja turtle jump all by itself was worth
that made him an institution because once he did the ninja turtles jump vanilla ice was out of here man there
was no come on man my brother was ordering pizza i was ordering my my little mans pizza and all that with the
ninja turtle junk on it man like so thats really you know id say thats
what it is its its its a lot going on with that it aint just elvis and me
it could never be that hes an institution theres a lot of things going on you know
and um but everythings cool everythings cool you know sometimes
things develop the way they do and and thats just how it is i mean you you didnt see edison and uh marconi work
together or edison and tesla work together right they they were kind of like at each other and
then you know one day you know edisons patents get it and tesla you know passed away
feeding pigeons in new york and down in the hotel new yorker were feeding pigeons in this in in times square where
where all that light that was on outside the electricity he discovered that he discovered the way that that ac power
worked because from dc the the uh the transformer yeah you got blackballed thats right
because because teslas and im gonna say to shut up about it tesla what tesla wanted to do
which is what none of the other guys wanted to do tesla wanted to
he felt like give everybody the energy or access to energy and access to power give it to
everybody dont just you know you know do it just for military industry like give it to everybody its free energy
give it to everybody and so you know westinghouse and some of the other folks they was looking at him like oh hell nah
man how we gonna make money off it if we give it to everybody but they didnt understand what tesla was saying was if
you give everybody a baseline to start from a rising tide
raises all boats so today you would have people you would have everybody would have a
certain amount of inherent intelligence and ability to do computers
and like you say you from haiti right so being from haiti you you already know what a third world country situation is
like im from jamaica so you know that certain amount of the days they might shut the electric off you didnt run running power like so if if tesla if
they had to listen to tesla everybody would have had power and free energy right instead they wanted to they
wanted to industrialize it and make it the way where people got to pay for it so whos the people who had enough money
to afford had disposable income to pay for it it would be people who you know didnt really live out there
pretty much and and and ethnically that that always looks like something youre
talking about numbers on a paper you talk about statistics cool but but theres also it looks like something too
theres a visual to all of that and i think people skip over that you know theyre so quick to jump on
you know what i mean what the media says or what the media writes and i mean i dont know i dont im not really sure
why it continues and why its so redundant but um you know i will i will say that yeah man
you know its just a lot of extra people a lot of other people out here you know
um second thing that i thought of was you being in the game for so long like
what keeps your mind fresh with new ideas what keeps your
mind always coming up with ways to improve yourself as time goes on
pretty much like you guys man um i get it from the i get all everything
that goes on man i get it i get it from yall man like so the creator
puts things in motion and then um it speaks to me through yall like uh you know pretty much like
i call them like the brotherhood theyre not just fans man but i but i do feel inspired
by the fans um like like that uh a lot of different ideas things ive had that have been
expounded on and people are built on like tonight i got a theres a radio station that my homeboy callie ranks and
third eye put together and im gonna be playing some new stuff on there um uh the almighty record the almighty record
if were on long enough im going to play pieces of that but this is something that ties into the the almighty and the other you know kaiju
and one step closer to infinity that ties in but were on the air from nine nine pm to two am and um
and its its all about collaborative stuff and so thats the sort of thing what im talking about like i was
greatly inspired by some of the musics that that my brotherhood made and to the
point where theres some songs that i listened to man and i flat out cry like a little like a little child you know
just listening to it and the creativity that was involved in that and went into it and thats where the inspiration comes
from thats what keeps me sharp um and im im blessed for that right im
blessed for getting that from my brotherhood as opposed to from the fans as opposed to
um having like a a person like an anr or someone in
your world thats being paid to tell you what to do or what to do next you know you might not really like
what they tell you to do but you got to do it because youre a part of a machine thats a lot bigger than yourself
you know on this side of the fence like we all come together in a collaborative effort and and we make good hiphop man
we make hiphop that if you know if it aint the biggest its its gonna last
you know as long as some of the biggest you know and well see right well see
well see how long its around tom will definitely tell that um last
question that i thought of um as
a modernday hiphop fan like there will be like fans of todays music
that may not be familiar with some of the music in the past
because they may not look back to them im not only used to like modern day music
so how would someone that got a feature from the industry icons
how would they be able to market that song to that audience right
so yeah you just asked like thats the 64 million dollar question um
you want me to handle that yeah yeah yeah um vlad theres thats why people like
me exist um you know not every like baby grand records let me take it back there baby graham records
i did about eight hundred thousand dollars in record deal advances with them before they ever heard a single
second of music from any record i was pitching whether it was wu chang whether it was uh um jizza bronze nazareth
wounded culture almighty because all they cared about was how it looked on paper how many famous producers you got
my famous features boom heres the money were gonna market this wutang project the same way were gonna market this dip
set project same way were gonna market this jedi manchester project and that worked for them the reality of it is not every artist is
the same so people like me exist and when we do our marketing campaigns you know
theres theres like a like a like a spreadsheet of like whats up theres 12 things that are important in the music
marketing now were not going to do all 12 every time especially if the budgets not there to do them but we are going to do
what we feel is going to be the strongest to advance you know the ideals of that particular project whether its an lp or lp or ep a mixtape a single
whatever so im accessible on the internet uh almighty m80 on almighty
immediate gmail almighty m80 on instagram stuff like that um i do
artists consultations and what i do is get to know the artists craft a plan for
them over a course of three six nine months or three six nine 12 months let them run with it so they can see their
analytics rise see the subscribers growing see their audience growing and really tap into whats best for them
where as opposed to when you know when cannabis was on the baby grand era when i was on the baby grin era it was like
just throw it all in the    pot and whatever happens happens thats not the case now like you know this this has
been blessed that he has a large cult following that lives on the internet so its like clearly i dont need to go do
street team marketing you know so its like to each zone to figure out the strengths and the weaknesses of each and its kind of like
a trial and er thing ive done enough trial and error between cannabis wutang red man snoop corrupt crooked eye bronze
you name it to understand what works for each artist and so if youd like to you know have one of those consultations
with me not a problem at all ill get you on the right path
let me let me add to that as well real quick like dont feel like when you put out music that
everybody that youre trying to make music for everybody right you dont have to please everyone with your output if you know
your lane is like oldschool boombap hiphop and thats what you love then its enough to find the audience thats
receptive to that you dont have to appeal to everyone whos listening to the radio i mean for me for example you know i
ive been making 90s era type beats since basically i started making beats like 17 years ago
and to this day people still come to me and buy beats because thats my lane and i found my crowd in my audience and they
like what i put out so you know i dont feel the need to put out trap music or r b hits just because
thats whats playing on the radio as long as you have your audience and you can connect with them and you can build a relationship with them then theyre
going to appreciate that from you 100 so thats pretty much 100
and you got to make enough of it you got to make enough of it right like if you if you if youre just doing it as a
hobby and its recreation for you thats cool but if if anyone out there
you listen to whoever out there listening and youre so serious about like so serious about it then you know
what you got to make a catalog you got to make a catalog and and you know unfortunately
because thats why i say i dont envy you like yall and you know youre coming up and this i dont envy you you
like what your task is ahead of you is because like you have to make a catalog it might take
you know that that time is increasing as as as you know as we get more connected with
with this technology but you might have you might be sitting on a catalog
and itll take you know its going to take way longer than it would when we were we were in the 90s and you you know
somebody had a hundred albums you know back in in the 90s youre like who where take me to him thats all we
wanted to hear back then is like who got you oh you got catalog like that because most of us couldnt even get into there
was no equipment like that you had to go into a studio and pay for the the 12hour blockout sessions you know what
im saying but now you can have your own equipment in your home you know what i mean nice portable stuff you can
collaborate like this through sending emails emailing waves and files and sound session sessions so so you know
now if youre serious make sure you have that catalog because while you might not blow up today or
tomorrow or next year in three years it might that opportunity might present
itself and youve got the catalog now so now and then you own it you still own your catalog so now
you know you talk to somebody like 80 like m80 and hes gonna hes gonna go ahead and give you the tools you need
and the resources for you to continue owning it or if you want to slice off a piece of it to the highest bidder you
can do that too but those options are available for you but you aint going to have none of that if you dont have
catalog so yeah so keep keep recording
yeah great advice here yo i think i think well do one more question and then well wrap it up
so if somebody has a really good one uh whats hearing i saw uh jamal jamal was on here i think
he had something to ask jamal you there yeah im here can you hear me yeah yeah
yeah um see like you know back in the day it was only regular hip hop boom bap
and gangsta rap but now its like so many different subgenres of hiphop
i was just wondering like how does one determine his primary subgenre subgenre hiphop
wow um so this is jamal dobson right yeah
crazy man you got you got two of the names like two of my favorite people uh
its mike dobson and then you got uh you got jamal you know if theyre in new york man jamal used to run around with
me man help me do things man but thats crazy though but anyway um to answer your question like you know
what brother thats above my pay grade maybe maybe 80 could take that or and or
how does it like with so many different sub genres in hip hop how does one determine his primary subgenre
yeah i could i could take a quick stab at it i mean matt im curious what you have to say but i think basically it comes down to testing and seeing what
feels good to you but then also what people respond to and then the other thing too is also sometimes um like like
were making our right were trying to express ourselves but if if were looking at this as a business we also have to cater to our customers and that
doesnt mean you have to make any one genre or the most popular genre or anything but you do have to make music
for somebody so if you think about who is that person who am i trying to speak to and then just make sure it speaks to
them to me thats a lot more important than figuring out whats the exact name of this of this scenario i mean like
most of the music i make is like real interpersonal music like i talk about my personal life my experiences what i go
through but like when i when i go to run my run my promo campaigns and stuff
i like all these subgenres pop up like even when i go to distribute it all these subjects
sometimes i dont know which one to pick and it by the way it doesnt matter what you pick because the only people that
see that for instance like cd baby does that the only people that see that are people that actually log on to cd baby
no one sees that if youre on itunes no one sees it if youre on spotify or title or apple its just something they
do for their own kind of like classification system on their website but uh i mean yeah ultimately its like
you fall into the genre that makes you feel good and best defines you so like my i have an older brother and
he when i was young and when i was rapping always wanted me to be like like little dicky like i could have been a little dicky before lil dicky but i
didnt want to rap like that i liked being funny like around my friends but i didnt want to like be funny on the mic
i want to like spit bars so thats the difference like who knows maybe id still be like you know rapping
fulltime if i would have gone the little dicky comedic route with it because you know that that seems like
thats more acceptable now but in the era of cannabis and wuchang and and big pun its like i didnt want
to be like my bars are hilarious i wanted to like be respected by the people i looked up
to so that didnt fit at the time but now hiphop is so expansive you can
literally get in where you fit in with no qualm like this is who i am this is the genre i fall into and its cool to
have interpersonal music because people will identify with the same    youre putting out there for the world its
true music yeah and if all if if all else fails
just make up your own genre do your own thing like literally like grape diggers and
flatliners and    made up horror core rap there was no horror core like there was no like emo rap until
artists x y and z came around like you can if you want you can make your own    like there was no little dicky
before little dicky like you can make it up as you go
right so when you when you um when you start your pr campaign um
like say for somebody who has no articles no reviews or anything yet how would you determine your uh
target audience i i would base a campaign with a regional
pr rep to start getting you local press regional press stuff like that then
build up so its like its like youre not going for the gusto off top youre not getting source and double xl and
vibe and you know all hiphop and stuff but you can start getting some some local like theyll plug you to the
locals theyll plug you to the regionals and then after you know say a month goes by and those stories kind of like
disseminate into the market and your product is out then you know you have followup so its like then as youre
getting a different pr rep thats going to get you the national exposure when they type here heres what they dont want to see no one wants to type your
name in on google and the first one that comes up is your facebook or your instagram like that should be like on
the 10th page so the first nine pages should be filled with press and its like you got to
build to that so its like dont waste your money because its not like like a pr rep can
do their job but its not up to them if hip hop dx picks up your    or double xl picks up your    theyre going to
pick up the music that they think is going to bring the most traffic therefore the traffic equals ad dollars and ad dollars you know boom it keeps
the    motor moving so its like dont look like man like i gave my money to this pr rep and i
didnt get    for results its literally because you aim for the stars when you know you werent ready yet you
know it wasnt ready so i always build a system where its like this is what we can do on a local and regional basis
this is what we can do from regional national and and take it that way because otherwise
if youre soliciting to like one of these big you know assets and they dont see anything like any
anything to back it up then theyre just going to pass on it because its not going to bring traffic to their site
so a lot of times i used to have artists like like upcoming artists like the icons pack is a perfect example of like
what i used to do for these independent artists you know my artist jason bain dating back to like
09 got him one of the best record deals like ever and uh his first appearance isnt like hiphop
yx and double xl and the source where jason bane drops new single featuring
fred the god song jason bain drops new single produced by street runner so they were picking up the story based off the
associated name thats big name you know big    if it got enough traffic on that merit then he could go and get
press like the next time you want to drop a solo song on his own accord but he couldnt have got to that level had
it not been for the building blocks so the icons package kind of gives you the pr building blocks to really get out
there in your in your region like yes theres gonna be other people that have the same verse as you but guess what
like its not like youre competing with the guy who lives across the street right you make your song to appeal for your
region and this dudes gonna make his to appeal to his and thats what it is like i broke her licenses all year round in a
big a big portion of the of the um of the consumer base is either rappers
making mixtapes or rappers trying to build their first albums or people in the edm world because they dont care
about if theyve heard that little wayne verse from 10 years ago they want to see the name of wayne and their vibe into it
in the club and its like theyre not paying attention to the    lyrics anyway just makes for good music so thats
thats my shortterm answer but again i hope that a lot of you tuned in you know for some consultations and i can make
some good things happen for you but even if not anno and gabe make good    happen for you guys every day and i
applaud them yeah yeah i appreciate that man so yeah lets wrap it up guys i just
want to say a huge shout out to m80 thank you shout out to cannabis a true
