wheres the streetwise hercules to fight the rising odds
isnt there a white knight upon a fiery steed
late at night i toss and i turn and i dream of what i need

i need a hero
im holding out for a hero till the end of the night
hes gotta be strong and hes gotta be fast and hes gotta be fresh from the fight
i need a hero
im holding out for a hero till the morning light
hes gotta be sure and its gotta be soon and hes gotta be larger than life
larger than life

somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy
somewhere just beyond my reach theres someone reaching back for me
racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
its gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet

i need a hero
im holding out for a hero till the end of the night
hes gotta be strong and hes gotta be fast and hes gotta be fresh from the fight
i need a hero
im holding out for a hero till the morning light
hes gotta be sure and its gotta be soon and hes gotta be larger than life
i need a hero
im holding out for a hero till the end of the night
see bonnie tyler liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeinstrumental break

up where the mountains meet the heavens above
out where the lightning splits the sea
i could swear there is someone somewhere watching me
through the wind and the chill and the rain
and the storm and the flood
i can feel his approach like a fire in my blood

i need a hero
im holding out for a hero till the end of the night
hes gotta be strong and hes gotta be fast and hes gotta be fresh from the fight
i need a hero
im holding out for a hero till the morning light
hes gotta be sure and its gotta be soon and hes gotta be larger than life
i need a hero…
i need a hero…

i need a hero
im holding out for a hero till the end of the nightembed"
