just a watertreader waiting on the line
just a drygindrinker masterandahound
turned a circusswinger
look hes coming down
down

can you shake it up
just once for me
your little globe just so we can see
the snow blowing round your hands

and the wingnut turned
the song that we both know
sent us flying round the carnival
you can throw all your lucky coins on me
