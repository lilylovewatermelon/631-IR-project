another day goes by
and where was i
didnt think id still be here
just to make things clear

chorus
whats the use
im not talking sense
call it a ruse on myself
i wanted to go
i wanted to say
all things come to pass with time
but i want everything now to be all mine

verse 2
you think its all over
get up and try again
youve got to act your age darling
before you fall back in

call it a ruse on myself
