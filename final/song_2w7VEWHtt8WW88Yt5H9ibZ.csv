its on my mind
and nothin really matters
ive got to be on time
look in the view mirror
is he hot on my tracks
is he getting nearer
i feel some heat is on my back
speedin on the freeway gotta get a lead way
speed demon
doin it on the highway gotta have it my way
speed demon
mind is like a compass im stoppin at nothin
speed demon
he say pull over boy and get your ticket right
and nothin gonna stop me
aint no stop and go
im speedin on the midway
i gotta really burn this road
speedin on the freeway gotta get a lead way
speed demon
doin it on the highway gotta have it my way
speed demon
mind is like a compass im stoppin at nothin
speed dеmon
he say pull over boy and get your tickеt right
speed demon youre the very same one
who said the futures in your hands
the life you save could be your own
youre preachin bout my life like youre the law
gonna live each day and hour like
for me theres no tomorrow
go go go go aaow
speedin on the freeway gotta get a lead way
speed demon
got fire in my pocket i just lit a rocket
speed demon
i just pull over boy and get your ticket right
speed demon
pull over boy and get your ticket right
speed demon
i just pull over boy and eat your ticket
pull over boy
pull over boy and get your ticket right
get your ticket right
pull over boy
get your ticket right
pull over boy and get your ticket right
pull over boy
pull over boy and get your ticket
eat your ticket
get your ticket
eat yo get yo
get your ticket rightyou might also likeembed"
