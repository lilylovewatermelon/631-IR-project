could i trust you with my thoughts
or would you use them all against me
can you replace my eyes for yours
and see what i really look like
i could help you criticize

chorus 1
looking for a sense of relation
where do people want me to be
i cant help but cry on vacation
dressed to unimpress easily
losing sight again
ill go ahead and give your eyes back now

verse 2
you grow up gone
so whats the point of connecting to anyone
is a relationship bought or is it won

chorus 2
are the things i think are important
simply just distractions from death
all of my ideas turn to content
they can be conceived til theyre read
lost my words again
it doesnt matter
cause you wouldnt understand
you might also likechorus 3
love in teens and life in the twenties
nothing much to look forward to
i cant help but cry on vacation
is this the way to exit my youth
oh

outro
hey treacherous doctor do you know whats the matter with me
