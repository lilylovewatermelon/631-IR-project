i was walking down the street
looking at my feet
i didnt have no shoes
on the way to school
looking like a fool
and everybody knew
but it was all right
cause my friends of mine
knew i had a guitar
they knew i would play
become a big star
and i would go so far

chorus raphael saadiq  dawn robinson dawn
remember the times
when i didnt have a dime
we remember the times
when i didnt have a dime
those were the best days

verse 2 raphael saadiq raphael saadiq  dawn robinson
going down the street playing at the mall
on them cheap bikes
looking for somebody to steal
somebody to rob and somebody to fight
i didnt know my name as well
as i knew my friends
but i knew we were so cool
but everybody wanted to play by their own rules
we didnt go to school

i remember the times

when i didnt have a dime
not even a dime
i remember the times

when i didnt have a dime

verse 3 raphael saadiq raphael saadiq  dawn robinson dawn
by the time i was fourteen or fifteen
trying to pass my drivers test
the thing to do was to drive to school
cause i could never win for best dressed
i could never win for best dressed
i drove a raggedy car
to sneak in the bars
young boy life has no stress
young boy life has no stress
watching cartoon
and popping balloons
that was the best

chorus raphael saadiq  dawn robinson dawn
remember the times
remember the times
when i didnt have a dime
not even a dime
i remember the times
remember the times
when i didnt have a dime
not even a dime
those were the best days
outro
yeah i was in junior high school 35
and um i think it was 82 or 83
and everyone was wearing these nikes
you know the ones with the little suede lip on the front and the canvas
it wasnt canvas like nylon the swoosh or whatever
i told my mom i wanted those so we went down to modells
heh she saw the price she was like
well we could get two of them other little cheap things for the same price as those
man i remember thatembed"
