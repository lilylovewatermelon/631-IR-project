between the lunch and dinner rush
kelly caught that outbound bus for vegas
and were all out here talking trash making bets
lips wrapped round our cigarettes
she always thought she was too good to be a waitress

when our ship comes in well just sail away

her exhusbands in the pen
for two to five or five to ten longer ha
and brendas traded smokes for cake
