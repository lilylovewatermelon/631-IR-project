well i wish there was someone
well i wish there was someone to love me
when i used to be someone
and i knew there was someone that loved me
as i sit here frozen alone
even ghosts get tired and go home
as they crawl back under the stones

chorus
and i wish there was something
please tell me theres something better
and i wish there was something
more than this saturated loneliness
and i wish i could feel it
and i wish i could steal it
abduct it corrupt it but i never can
its just saturated loneliness

verse 2
does the silence get lonely
does the silence get lonely who knows
ive been hearing it tell me
ive been hearing it tell me go home
â€˜cause the freaks are playing tonight
they packed up and turned out the lights
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likechorus
and i wish there was something
please tell me theres something better
and i wish there was something
more than this saturated loneliness
and i wish i could feel it
and i wish i could steal it
abduct it corrupt it but i never can
its just saturated loneliness

outro
and the bathwaters cold
and this lifes getting old
and i wish i could feel it
and i wish i could feel it
and i wish i could steal it
abduct it corrupt it
and i wish i could feel it
and i wish i could steal it
and i wish i could feel it
abduct it corrupt it
but i never can
i never can
never can
never can
never can4embed"
