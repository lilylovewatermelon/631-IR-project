—ssaa10decalcoholfree  twiceoriginal song  romanization  english translation
ever since the release of fancy twice keeps surprising us comeback after comeback by trying different sounds after offering their own take on tropical house with more  more exploring a more retro dua lipaesque vibe on i cant stop me and finally showing a darker side with cry for me they are now back with a summer song that feels really unique alcoholfree the unexpected association of bossa nova with hiphop  works amazingly well and creates a refreshing atmosphere that i havent experienced in other kpop songs the members vocals particularly shine with smooth vocalizations at the end of each sentence listening to the track takes me away from my daily life for a while and i find myself chilling on a sunbed with a cocktail in hand—whether a mojito margarita or alcoholfree beverage—exactly what a good summer song is supposed to make you feel like right

—ab212boom  dpr live ft dpr ianoriginal song
boom is a sexy song full of fun melodies and summer vibes this track is my favorite from dpr lives ep iite cool and it features dpr ian whose album im obsessed with and in my opinion is aoty having the two together again after no blueberries was definitely a treat they are absolute musical geniuses during your first listen you would never expect the altrock interlude with angsty and vulnerable lyrics this builds all the way up to finally explode back into the main song like a true rollercoaster leaving you with the same feeling of adrenaline when the ride is over

—eleventhcassettebutter  btsoriginal song
i was very excited and looked forward to butter as soon as bts announced its release  and as i thought they didnt disappoint me it was a great song and i cant stop listening to it ever since  for me the best part of the song is the chorus  verse 3 especially sugas rap part i also love the instrumental part after the second chorus rms songwriting made the song feel even more personal i believe this song has better proved bts success and it showed how perfect bts are the music video is a visual treat and all the members looked amazing with butter bts has once again given us fans a summer anthem to vibe all year long

—aacloud  wavycake ft donutman  clavitaoriginal song
a single that was included in his third fulllength album baggage at first i didnt think the collaboration would happen but i was sure it would be catchy since wavycake as well as clavita—an uprising rb singer with distinct sounds—are known for that the chorus that was brought by clavita is perfectly stuck in my head due to its witty lyrics and donutman made sure to enhance their chemistry

—sa44drunkdazed  enhypenoriginal song  romanization  english translation
admittedly i am not the biggest fan of enhypen when drunkdazed came out i had already put the group off to the side despite having watched the entirety of iland however drunkdazeds horror carnival concept really helped me hit the nail on defining what kind of a group enhypen is before as a casual listener i often felt as if enhypen and other boy groups sometimes overlapped in sound and concept drunkdazed flowed very naturally and never lost the momentum gained by the bass starting in the first verse despite the melodic verses chorus and bridge all sounding distinctively different the chorus is simply phenomenal the repetition of the lyrics conforms to the songs concept and makes you feel like youre stuck on a carnival ride and the high pitched variations in the lyrics convey a wonderful anomaly to conformity but never jarring nor frightening the dynamic yet sharp choreography of drunkdazed takes the song one step further to showcase the ability of hybe and enhypen to seamlessly weave together the music and the arts

—anc613end of the world  epik high ft gsoul original song  romanization  english translation
the golden voice of korea puns intended teamed up with my favorite south korean trio epik high on epik high is here 上 despite that the album is packed with highquality music this ballad is one of the best songs on off it the song asks what if the end of the world comes what will be the most important then what hits harder in uncertain times we are living in now the rough rap of the questions asked paired with gsouls soothing vocals really hits differently and makes it feel even nostalgic but this song contrary to appearances is not sad and the conclusion is that after all you have to dream love and live life to the fullest as if there was no tomorrow even if the world is dark and things seems out of control

for girl groups with powerful concepts everglow is a name that should come to mind the sextet has explored many different genres such as powerful militarystyle adios and retro la di da with first everglow continues to prove they are aiming for the top while also being the firsts exploring varieties of power concepts first is a powerful trapedm track that makes me feel like im about to face off against the final boss in a video game which may as well be everglow even with a new concept the song is still so everglow and it shows off the girls talents quite well leader sihyeon got a big share of the vocal parts allowing her to show off her vocals alongside mia onda lacking recognition throughout their career got the center position for the dance break aisha and yiren made the stage theirs with their amazing charisma and main rapper eu though short had an extremely memorable rap part adding the last bit of spice needed to make first one of the most powerful songs of 2021

last waltz had an interesting trajectory for me this left me astonished on the first listen that orchestral melody became one of the highlights plus their exceptional vocals proved they could pull off a certain kind of style that twice rarely unveils this is the kind of song i’ve always manifested for them to include again in their discography after “cry for me the song blossoms into a pleasurable track that brings a hailing shot of seductiveness if i had it my way i’d bump up the track’s beat and dance to it

seeing the reactions to the song online “life is still going on” really captivates every listener’s heart the grip that this song has on me makes me so happy and because of that i bop to it all the time it’s a pretty auralleaning tempo track that is made more engaging by its standout raps the song succeeds on the strength of its groove after a flimsy languid verse the track’s chorus sets its rhythm and is definitely a song to vibe to i admire the variety of textures and structures used because the song gives a fun sense of interplay made even more fitting with a fair dose of blessed adlibs the finished product feels like the soundtrack to a peaceful scene

—loveholicmaverick  the boyzoriginal song  romanization  english translation
slowly but surely achieving international success the boyz had two wellreceived comebacks in 2021 while thrill ride the first was a summery and vibey song the more recent maverick takes the cake as their most intense title track sporting a darker concert than they have ever done before the songs narrative centers around a maverick—someone who is independent and does not conform to societal standards—accompanied by a survival game concept that is reminiscent of netflix hit 오징어 게임 squid game which blew up a month prior to the songs release the music video portrays this concept well with members in intense confrontations with one another leaving us on edge to see where this plot will lead aside from standing out amongst the crowd the song showcases the groups many strengths the verse progression alternates between fierce rapping to strong vocals eventually leading into an intense chorus with their signature synchronized choreography overall this is one of the boyzs strongest comebacks and is definitely a sign of success for them in 2022

—vinylzombiemcrodd eye  dreamcatcheroriginal song  romanization  english translation
in late january dreamcatcher came back in full force with their title track odd eye from their ep dystopia road to utopia the end of their dystopia trilogy odd eye starts off with strong and mysterious melodies the lyrics portraying how humans keep chasing a perfect world that doesnt exist—a utopia the prechorus builds the song up with haunting synth sounds until the chorus drops with one of the coolest guitar riffs ever as a breaker damis rap verse has a more electronic vibe and my favorite lyrics in the song struggling with meaninglessness we seemed to be in the same place again with endless thirst no matter how you chase a mirage its not there in the bridge i always imagine thats how dreamcatcher would sound like after a big explosion a breaking point where theyve realized their reality and lost all hope i love the choreography at this part leading to the girls powerful spinning jump in the last chorus vocally the highlights there are yoohyeons and siyeonss harmonies and backing vocals landing the song to a breathtaking end besides the musical aspect of the track the music video for odd eye is the best film release of dreamcatcher so far the girl group has always had great music video concepts but now theyve perfected them with amazing direction special effects artsy sets and cyberpunk imagery with the conclusion of the dystopia series i cant wait to see what else dreamcatcher has in store for us

—eleventhcassettepaint me naked  tenoriginal song
the perfect demonstration of tens attributes as an artist is conveyed through paint me naked not only is it bright with its addictive beat and changing colors but it also showcases tens creativity and devotion for his art as he took part in the creative process of the release as a fan of ten there is nothing more inspiring and aweinducing than seeing him reinvent himself with every work of his and it is easy to tell that he is always trying to challenge himself and go on new adventures may it be either his spotless work ethic the power that the poprock song oozes or the facility with which ten can belt out high notes and lighten up a gloomy mood through his charisma and dancing abilities but paint me naked is a delightful piece that brings out the best of ten and showcases him as one of the most complete performers out there

—seokyoungready to love  seventeenoriginal song  romanization  english translation
thematically seventeen’s “ready to love” was one of the most interesting takes on romantic love this year “ready to love” is as much a statement as it is an offer the ‘me’ of the song is offering themselves and their love to the one they love if this love will reach fulfillment is up to them it is as the album is aptly titled “your choice” this situation leads to a song filled with a nervous but hopeful energy that is exemplified through the steady beat which pushes the song forward like a pulsating heart anxiety and anticipation swell as more and more instruments kick in towards the chorus needing a release or catharsis additionally the choreography is probably one of seventeen’s most elegant ones to date reminiscent of “fallin’ flower” or “don’t wanna cry” in its combination of difficult moves flowing gestures and narrative formations it perfectly encapsulates the emotional vulnerability of putting yourself out there unsure whether one will be accepted or rejected the song doesn’t indicate what the choice is or ought to be instead it leaves the listener on a reverberation that feels like an empty space as one anxiously anticipates a response

—ssaa10decspider  hoshioriginal song  romanization  english translation
it is kind of hard for me to believe that “spider” is hoshi’s first proper solo release hoshi’s command throughout the song and the track’s ability to lure in its listeners like a spider to its prey is one of the many reasons why i love the song weaved over a sultry electric guitar “spider” lets hoshi shine not only as a performer but also as a vocalist with 13 members in the group seventeen songs often struggle with the vocal part distribution with a solo release hoshi is once again able to remind listeners of his talent as a singer the music video and the song’s insane choreography are other highlights of this debut for me from his forehead god bless his stylist to the upsidedown acrobatics the music video was filled with moments that fans can instantly fall in love with with “spider” hoshi proves why he was chosen as the performance leader in seventeen and also makes his impact as a soloist with tremendous potential
