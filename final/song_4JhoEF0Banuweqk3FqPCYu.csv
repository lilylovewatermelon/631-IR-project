i might walk a little funny but my walk is me
i might stutter when i talk but i say what i see
i dont agree with every other little thing thats proven
i do a lot of things that i shouldnt be doin
ill ruin everything you might have had in mind
im a consistent belligerent solidified find
rhinestone freak suburban star
i aint got no money and i got no car
i might make par if it dont take much
see i dont ride very far cause i ride on luck
i stay pretty stuck in a rut like i should
and i do it for the love of everything thats still good

chorus
i dont know why i come here
but i know ill never leave
its the only place i wanna be
yeah yeah yeah
i dont know why i come here
but i know ill never leave
its the only place i wanna be
yeah yeah yeah

verse 2
im a long way gone but i aint short lived
i got deep deep pockets that leak like a civ
i give 110 throughout the course of a night
and if i dont go home then i did things right
id like to settle down but i aint that guy
cause everything i ever did i always did on the fly
i like to ride the wave til the tide dont swell
i dont like cocaine but i like the smell
i dwell in a place you might see unfit
but there aint nothing you can ever say to make me give a shit
i stay pretty stuck in a rut like i should
and do it for the love of everything thats still good

verse 3
id like to say that i dont do them bars
but my street called straight dont stretch too far uh huh
im on the move goin nowhere fast
and you can tell the whole world they can kiss my ass
ill take a pass be the last in line
and if it takes ten years then imma be just fine
i saw the signs in the grass aint green
i found love at the bottom of the bottle of beam
see comin clean just seemed so jaded
and bein underrated is underrated
but i dont hate it i stay stuck in a rut like i should
you know i do it for the love of everything thats still good

chorus
i dont know why i come here
but i know ill never leave
its the only place i wanna be
yeah yeah yeah
i dont know why i come here
but i know ill never leave
its the only place i wanna be
yeah yeah yeah
i dont know why i come here
but i know ill never leave
i dont know why i come here
but i know ill never leave
i dont know why i come here
but i know ill never leave
its the only place i wanna be
yeah yeah yeah
its the only place i wanna be
yeah yeah yeahembed"
