youre a flower drawn in sidewalk chalk
beautiful but she wont stick around for long
youll be gone from here in a matter of hours
after the first summer rain washes all of you away
and every single trace of your late night drunk phone call
tellin me you love me after all
i still taste the red wine on your lips on the side of the phone
but somehow we lose connection and then youre gone

chorus
if id a held on a little longer
loved you a little stronger
would you still be ridin shotgun next to me
showed up uninvited to be right by your side now darlin
would we be more than a good memory

verse 2
youre a southern livin magazine
so elegant and pristine
well you smell like a rich womans cologne
soon someones bound to pick you up and take you home

chorus
if id a held on a little longer
loved you a little stronger
would you still be ridin shotgun next to me
showed up uninvited to be right by your side now darlin
would we be more than a good memory
if id a held on a little longer
loved you a little stronger
would you still be ridin shotgun next to me
showed up uninvited to your hill countryside apartment
would we be more than a good memory
