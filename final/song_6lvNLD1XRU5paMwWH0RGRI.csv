so glad to see you have
overcome them completely silent now
with heavens help
youve cast your demons out

chorus
and not to pull your halo down
around your neck and tug you off your cloud
but im more than just a little curious
how youre planning to go about making your amends
to the dead
to the dead

verse 2
recall the deeds as if theyre all
someone elses atrocious stories
now you stand reborn before us all
so glad to see you well

chorus
and not to pull your halo down
around your neck and tug you to the ground
but im more than just a little curious
how youre planning to go about making your amends
to the dead
to the dead
