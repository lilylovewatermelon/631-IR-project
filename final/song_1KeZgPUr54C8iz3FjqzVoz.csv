young
we were so young when we thought that we knew how to love
fought about anything everything led to dysfunction
but we just gotta own that shit
dont let it go like this
maybe we can grow from this yeah

and almost fought your father when he pushed me in the yard
and all those nights we snuck out like to meet up at the bar
dont worry my love were learning to love
but its hard when youre young
