one for the road ooh ooh
one for the road ooh ooh

verse 1 alex turner
from the bottom of your heart
the relegation zone
i saw this comin from the start
the shake rattle and roll
the cracks in blackout blinds
cast patterns on the ceiling
but youre feeling fine
i thought it was dark outside
i thought it was dark outside

chorus alex turner  josh homme
one for the road
so we all go back to yours
and you sit and talk to me on the floor
theres no need to show me round baby
i feel like ive been here before
ive been wonderin whether later
when you tell everybody to go
will you pour me one for the road

verse 2 alex turner
i knew this would be on the cards
i knew you wouldnt fold
i saw this comin from the start
the shake rattle and roll
you might also likechorus alex turner  josh homme
one for the road
so we all go back to yours
and you sit and talk to me on the floor
theres no need to show me round baby
i feel like ive been here before
ive been wonderin whether later
when you tell everybody to go
will you pour me one for the road

bridge alex turner  josh homme
the mixture hits you hard
dont get that sinking feeling dont fall apart
some out of tune guitar
soundtrack to disaster
ooh ooh one for the road
ooh ooh one for the road
ooh ooh one for the road
ooh ooh one for the road

guitar solo
ooh ooh
ooh ooh
ooh ooh
ooh ooh
chorus alex turner  josh homme
one for the road
so we all go back to yours
and you sit and talk to me on the floor
theres no need to show me round baby
