you can stand beside the madness like a falling tear
you can hold onto the sadness like a souvenir
or you can close your eyes and see your life
like the air

you can tap into the strength you never knew you had
you can breathe into your faith no matter where you’re at
just close your eyes and change your life
like the air

chorus
like the air you can
rise from the rubble with your mind you can hover
you can rise like the tide like the heat it in the summer
yes i know there are those who will wanna bring you down
but you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
like the air you can rise
rise

verse 2
the earth can pull you down with all its gravity
and the measure of your worth is sometimes hard to see
so just hold on when the night is done
like the sun
you might also likechorus
like the air you can
rise from the rubble with your mind you can hover
you can rise like the tide like the heat it in the summer
yes i know there are those who will wanna bring you down
but you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
like the air you can rise
rise

bridge
so even when your bones feel like weights
and it’s hard to lift the smile on your perfect face
you can still find a peaceful place
close your eyes until youre floating up in outer space
it’ll be alright they’re just jealous of your highs
so they can knock you down but

chorus
like the air you can
rise from the rubble with your mind you can hover
you can rise like the tide like the heat it in the summer
yes i know there are those who will wanna bring you down
but you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
like the air you can rise
