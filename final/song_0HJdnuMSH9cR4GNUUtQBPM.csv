beauty queen of only eighteen
she had some trouble with herself
he was always there to help her
she always belonged to someone else
i drove for miles and miles
and wound up at your door
ive had you so many times
but somehow i want more

chorus
i dont mind spending every day
out on your corner in the pouring rain
look for the girl with the broken smile
ask her if she wants to stay a while
and she will be loved
and she will be loved

verse 2
tap on my window knock on my door
i want to make you feel beautiful
i know i tend to get so insecure
doesnt matter anymore
its not always rainbows and butterflies
its compromise that moves us along
my heart is full and my doors always open
you come any time you want
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likechorus
i dont mind spending every day
out on your corner in the pouring rain
look for the girl with the broken smile
ask her if she wants to stay a while
and she will be loved
and she will be loved
and she will be loved
and she will be lovedembed"
