nooooo nooooooo

verse 1
picture of perfection the object of a nigga affection
partners in passionate sex a place to put my erection
fantasies of you in submission freaky positions
pushin pullin and twistin im on a mission got me on the mash
tried to dig you was screamin when i did
steady yellin out spots for me to hit and aw shit
soon as i seen her saw us playin hide the weiner
wanna freak like me fuck adina
up and down is the object side to side
make you holla out my name when a thug nigga ride can i cum inside
say you dont feel it thats a lie
you just scared to get this penitentiary dick
the trot caught your eye when i walked by i said hi
but you was so shy i cant lie damn near stuttered when you walked by
you want me to lick it and even worse
got your heart set on me goin first and that aint no fair exchange

hook mya
only one thing that you can do for me
baby you can treat me right we can do it all the night
nothin more than our fair exchange
hit my gspot and make me scream your name
you can do whatever you want i got what i want and gone
nothin more than our fair exchange

open your legs
got me marchin like its a million you tremble from the feelin
look up cause i got mirrors on the ceilin
and if you willin then we can ride until the sun shine
and just for fun i betchu i can make you cum 61 times
close your eyes let me heat it up
cause when we fuck i refuse to bust a nut until i beat it up
drop the top time to fuck while the wind blow
baby throw yo legs out the window
remember on the balcony bend over baby bounce on me
and let me hit it where it counts and flee
remember me i get around and im haunted by my temptations
sexual participation my motivation
even though i like the way you work it
you dont deserve it cause you walk around actin like you perfect
took a while but i finally got it and like a boss player
bitch you aint doin me no favors
fair exchange

hook mya
only one thing that you can do for me
baby you can treat me right we can do it all the night
nothin more than our fair exchange
hit my gspot and make me scream your name
you can get whatever you want i got what i want and gone
nothin more than our fair exchange
verse 3
now yo attitude aint realistic
yeah its true im gettin pussy but baby you gettin dick
and since you bein laced with the penetration
its only right to show a form of appreciation
instead of fakin like you cant hear the bed shakin
in bed naked you so twisted think yo legs breakin
you said take it so im blind in my passion how long will i last
doggy style steady pumpin on that ass until i blast
and then i laugh as we lay back
see i wait til you asleep and thats the payback
cause you actin like you did somethin givin me a piece
i had you mufflin your screams in the sheets fuckin with me
a true digger that love triggers a thug nigga
hustlin bitches like drug dealers
before i say goodbye put an end to all the games
heres my number for another fair exchange

hook mya
its only one only one thing that you can do thing that you can do for me for me
baby you can treat me right we can do it all the night
nothin more than our fair exchange
hit my gspot and make me scream your name make me scream baby
you can get whatever you want i got what i want and gone
nothin more than our fair exchange
only one thing that you  whatever you want can do for me
baby you can treat me right can you do me we can do it all the night
nothin more than our fair exchange
hit my gspot and make me scream your name
you can get whatever you want i got what i want and gone
nothin more than our fair exchange
adlibs mya

no one gives me lovin lovin
quite like you do no one gives me lovin like you do
