and my words will be here when im gone
as im fading away against the wind
and the words you left me linger on
as im failing again now never to change this

chorus
and im sympathetic
never letting on i feel the way i do
as im falling apart again at the seams

verse 2
and it seems im alone here hollow again hollow again
as im flailing again against the wind against the wind
and the scars i am left with swallow again
as im failing again now never to change this

chorus
and im sympathetic
never letting on i feel the way i do
as im falling apart again at the seams
and im sympathetic
never letting on i feel the way i do
as im falling apart again at the seams

bridge

and i cant seem to make them go away
and i cant take all the pressure sober
but i cant seem to make it go away

and i cant seem to make them go away
and i cant take all the pressure sober
i cant make it go away
i cant make it go away

chorus
and im sympathetic
never letting on i feel the way i do
as im falling apart again at the seams
and im sympathetic
never letting on i feel the way i do
as im falling apart again at the seams
