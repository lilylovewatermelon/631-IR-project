read my mind got me at a stop light
start me up then you make a stop like
why you gotta put me in the spotlight
but you dont even ever hit the spot right
youre always riding my wave riding riding riding riding
but never riding through

chorus
you get me up to let me down
one too many times to count
why you gotta do that why
youre the one who blew that
make it tough to get it out
youre done but im ready now
why you gotta do that why
youre the one who blew that

postchorus 1
every time you come you do
every time you come you do

verse 2

stuck inside of your cage im stuck right now
i play your game to lose over and over

you get me up to let me down
one too many times to count
why you gotta do that why

i really thought you knew
every time you come you leave me blue

something inside me is swimming
thought you did something you didnt
soon as i hit the beginning
is when you reached the end
something inside me is swimming
thought you did something you didnt
soon as i hit the beginning
is when you reached the end

you get me up to let me down
one too many times to count

make it tough to get it out
youre done but im ready now
why you gotta do that why
youre the one who blew that
