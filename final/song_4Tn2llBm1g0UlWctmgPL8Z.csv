ive been lookin for a driver who is qualified
so if you think that youre the one step into my ride
im a finetuned supersonic speed machine
with a sunroof top and a gangsta lean

prechorus
so if you feel me let me know know know
come on now what you waitin for for for
my engines ready to explode explode explode
so start me up and watch me go go go go

chorus
get you where you wanna go if you know what i mean
got a ride thats smoother than a limousine
can you handle the curves can you run all the lights
if you can baby boy then we can go all night
cause im zero to sixty in three point five
baby you got the keys
now shut up and drive drive drive drive
shut up and drive drive drive drive

verse 2
ive got class like a 57 cadillac
got overdrive with a whole lot of boom in the back
you look like you can handle whats under my hood
you keep sayin that you will boy i wish you would
