i used to be a renegade i used to fool around
but i couldnt take the punishment and had to settle down
now im playing it real straight and yes i cut my hair
you might think im crazy but i dont even care
because i can tell whats going on
abridged chorus
its hip to be square
its hip to be square

verse 2
i like my bands in business suits i watch them on tv
im working out most every day and watching what i eat
they tell me that its good for me but i dont even care
i know that its crazy
i know that its nowhere
but there is no denying that
chorus
its hip to be square
its hip to be square
its hip to be square
so hip to be square
saxophone solo

its not too hard to figure out you see it every day
and those that were the farthest out have gone the other way
you see them on the freeway it dont look like a lot of fun
but dont you try to fight it an idea whose time has come
dont tell me that im crazy
dont tell me im nowhere
take it from me

chorus
its hip to be square
its hip to be square
its hip to be square
so hip to be square
tell em boys

outro
here there and everywhere
hip hip so hip to be square
here there and everywhere
hip hip
here there and everywhere
hip hip so hip to be square
here there and everywhere
hip hip
here there and everywhere
hip hip so hip to be square
here there and everywhere
hip hip
here there and everywhere
hip hip so hip to be square
here there and everywhere
