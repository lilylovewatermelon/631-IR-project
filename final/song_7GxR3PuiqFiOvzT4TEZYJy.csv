i found a line and then it grew
i found myself still thinking of you
i felt so empty and now im fine
but still its burning when will you be mine

chorus
too much of the same stories in our lives
i think its time for change dont you
too much of the same stories in our lives
i think its time for us to walk away from here

postchorus
stories in our lives we keep them all inside
stories in our lives we keep them all inside

verse 2
look at me still in your mind
our memories so intertwined
well you broke through you found your way
and so did i no need to stay
in the same old picture tried and true
weve been through that lets look for something new

chorus
too much of the same stories in our lives
i think its time for change dont you
too much of the same stories in our lives
i think its time for us to walk away from here

do you remember lying on the beach so late at night
do you remember running through the sprinklers that night
do you remember all the songs that i have wrote for you
all the songs that i have wrote for you for you
i remember the way you made me feel when i was with you
i remember the smile that always brought me back to you
that look in your eyes
i never thought that this could be untrue
that look in your eyes
i never thought that this could be untrue
