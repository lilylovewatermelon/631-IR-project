flying down the interstate
mesmerized by power lines and blighted dour estates

and all the things i just felt
somewhere in the rust belt
wondering how many times can a heart melt
still hoping your season will start well

pardon my semantics
its somewhat pedantic
but your outline against the atlantic
well its idyllic and highly romantic

in a dream
oh i took several transfers to the g line
now bushwick inlets just to our right
id never seen manhattan at night
i said its lovely you said thats right

sidewalks brownstones and street posts
they line my dreams in complete rows
on cold days she wears a peacoat
while staring out from the east coast

a furtive glance as the fields roll
a stray outsider that she knows
could i be someone you need most
when im so far from the east coastyou might also like4embed"
