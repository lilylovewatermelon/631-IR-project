just let me go im on my own a rolling stone and im in the zone
dont let me fall just let me know when well make it through
just let me go im on my own a rolling stone and im in the zone
dont let me fall just let me know when well make it through

chorus
no matter what the price may be for clarity ill make it home
just let me go just let me go just let me go just let me go
no matter what the price may be for clarity ill make it home
just let me go just let me go just let me go a rolling stone
no matter what the price may be for clarity ill make it home
just let me go just let me go just let me go just let me go
no matter what the price may be for clarity ill make it home
just let me go just let me go just let me go a rolling stone

verse
i got my hand upon the throttle holding up a broken bottle
ready to cut you up and gut you like a fucking avocado
desperado on the track in fact if i am gone tomorrow
then my motto is no sorrow no apologies just karma
dont get it twisted and delete me off your friends list
staying busy tweeting hatred at me all up in my business
im getting kicks outta this shit like it was my sneakers
and the game fears me like a motherfucking wifebeater oh
see falling in reverse liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likebreakdown
i got an anger that runs deep in my blood
and im always staying true repping the city im from
and if you got a problem nows the time to speak up
cause im blowing up im never gonna stop

interlude
just let me go im on my own a rolling stone and im in the zone
dont let me fall just let me know when well make it through
just let me go im on my own a rolling stone and im in the zone
dont let me fall just let me know when well make it through

chorus
no matter what the price may be for clarity ill make it home
just let me go just let me go just let me go just let me go
no matter what the price may be for clarity ill make it home
just let me go just let me go just let me go a rolling stone
no matter what the price may be for clarity ill make it home
just let me go just let me go just let me go just let me go
no matter what the price may be for clarity ill make it home
just let me go just let me go just let me go a rolling stoneembed"
