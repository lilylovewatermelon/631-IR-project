verse pitbull
pits taking over the world
yall better get used to the fact
i jump on the track drop the bass
and i aint talkin bout crack
i was born in a era where michael jackson
was still tryna figure out the man in the mirror
and when it came to drugs
miami would always stand and deliver
welcome to the 80s ladies and gentlemen
i took over the radio i took over the clubs
late night no letterman
my father he was never there
but it made me a better man
the partys the world the worlds my girl
i dare you not to let em in
