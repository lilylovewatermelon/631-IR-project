ooh

verse 1
she was a queen
she had a house
she was a fighter
she was a queen
had a good dude
brought me a rabbit
she was a queen
wearing white gloves
but she kept em clean
classy lady
but she wasnt quiet
she was a queen

interlude
ooh

verse 2
one day she was gone
she died in a fight
cause she was a fighter
but she was a queen
