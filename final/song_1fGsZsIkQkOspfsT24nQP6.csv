i was reminiscing just the other day
while having coffee all alone and lord it took me away
back to a firstglance feeling on new york time
back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
took off faster than a green light go
hey you skip the conversation when you already know
i left a note on the door with a joke wed made
and that was the first day

chorus
and darling it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground

verse 2
spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
we had this big wide city all to ourselves
we blocked the noise with the sound of i need you
and for the first time i had something to lose
and i guess we fell apart in the usual way
and the storys got dust on every page
but sometimes i wonder how you think about it now
and i see your face in every crowd
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likechorus
cause darling it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground

bridge
tonight im gonna dance
for all that weve been through
but i dont wanna dance
if im not dancing with you
tonight im gonna dance
like you were in this room
but i dont wanna dance
if im not dancing with you

chorus
it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground

outro
tonight im gonna dance
for all that weve been through
but i dont wanna dance
if im not dancing with you
tonight im gonna dance
like you were in this room
but i dont wanna dance
if im not dancing with you27embed"
