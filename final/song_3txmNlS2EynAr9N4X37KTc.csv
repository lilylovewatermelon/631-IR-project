i just cant believe that its over
we were chilling out on the sofa
digging how the guitar goes
in a song that no one knows
did you lick that line yourself
or did the voodoo magic help
does everyone have a different take
do you seem real but i seem fake
does everyone get hypnotized by your fire

chorus
so long jimmy so long
though you only stayed a moment
we all know that youre the one
singing so long jimmy so long
sure were glad for the experience
we miss you now youve gone
were just swimming in your soul cause
we all wish we wrote this song
life goes on

verse 2
im just so relieved that its over
we were hanging out going nowhere
digging how the guitar goes
in a song that no one knows
did you burn that bridge yourself
or did the voodoo magic help
does everyone have a different take
are you just cool and im just baked
does everyone get mesmerized by your fire
