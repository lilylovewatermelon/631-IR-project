hey big head
im locked in tryna make this bread woo
i cant keep on giving you time
i got cash to make instead cash
she wanna fuck me oneonone
we might run that train instead
me and my friend just like twins
same nutsack and the same dick head what the fuck
seen that bitch and we aint impressed woo
thick brunette and she came from lex
phone got bugs and they aint insects
feds tuned in when i send my texts
aint nobody worried bout if im next
cause they know im next
i thank god i know im blessed
i recall when you threw shade
i can let that shit go i guess
im locked in had to go out less
everybody act like they know best know best
her boyfriend aint fresh

she’s so wet had to hold my breath
aint hit since she know im pressed fucked up about it
show my chest let me flex bitch ha
in the flesh got connects down in texas woo
pussy juice side of eggs thats my breakfast
sugar mama 56 off of craigslist ayy
can we have a threesome with your fuckin best friend
i aint talking florida when i say im destined
she aint know my money taller than a westin
hotel got your bitches checked in
exchick salty just like chex mix uh
cop a plane ticket for my new chick once the check hits
i come from a city that is very much eclectic
but its got another side to it that gets hectic
shorty that i mess with got a friend thats a detective
she gon run surveillance just to find out who ive slept with
all my jewelry gifted just like me aint bought a necklace
im not young and reckless bitch im cool calm and collected collected
flexin im the one that she texting texting
