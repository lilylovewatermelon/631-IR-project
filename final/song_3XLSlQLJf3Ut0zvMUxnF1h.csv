we all got dreams and we all star reachin

housekeeper knock to see if all yall decent
young girls envy the life yall leadin
never satisfied with a nice calm evenin
you be at the games lookin right all season
but you always with me on the night yall leavin
ask lo ask lo i always request you
you go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
carry you inside get you some water and undress you
i give you my all and the next morning youll forget who
or why or how or when
tonight its prolly bout to happen all over again
and she live in a mindset that i could never move to
until you find yourself its impossible to lose you
uh because i never had you although i would be glad to
id probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
i swear i start to think that im going crazy
