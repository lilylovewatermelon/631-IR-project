work

verse 1 trap house crim
ridin in the 3rd with the all black tint what
smoke one ho get high with a pimp
kick the front door bitch better bust down
sippin on dip while we break down the loud work
just know one thing i dont fuck with nobody nah
case full of shells with a twelvegauge shotty pow
trap house crim bitch i could give a fuck
ridin round town with the nine on tuck
never hesitate if i gotta go and bust what
dare a motherfucker to try and act tough what
hunnid motherfuckers thats all ready to rush
hunnid motherfuckers thats dyin to light em up brrah
live from the land where you six feet deep
before you even die just standing on your feet
gold teeth with a grin thatll make a bitch wet
504 keep the choppa on flex
