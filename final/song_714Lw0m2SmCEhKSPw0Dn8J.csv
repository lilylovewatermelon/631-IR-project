do you ever feel like breakin down
do you ever feel out of place
like somehow you just dont belong
and no one understands you
do you ever wanna run away
do you lock yourself in your room
with the radio on turned up so loud
that no one hears your screamin

prechorus
no you dont know what its like
when nothin feels alright
you dont know what its like
to be like me

chorus
to be hurt to feel lost
to be left out in the dark
to be kicked when youre down
to feel like youve been pushed around
to be on the edge of breakin down
and no ones there to save you
no you dont know what its like
welcome to my life
see simple plan liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likeverse 2
do you wanna be somebody else
are you sick of feelin so left out
are you desperate to find somethin more
before your life is over
are you stuck inside a world you hate
are you sick of everyone around
with their big fake smiles and stupid lies
while deep inside youre bleedin

prechorus
no you dont know what its like
when nothin feels alright
you dont know what its like
to be like me

chorus
to be hurt to feel lost
to be left out in the dark
to be kicked when youre down
to feel like youve been pushed around
to be on the edge of breakin down
and no ones there to save you
no you dont know what its like
welcome to my life
bridge
no one ever lied straight to your face
and no one ever stabbed you in the back
you might think im happy but im not gonna be okay
everybody always gave you what you wanted
you never had to work it was always there
you dont know what its like what its like

chorus
to be hurt to feel lost
to be left out in the dark
to be kicked when youre down
to feel like youve been pushed around
to be on the edge of breakin down
and no ones there to save you
no you dont know what its like what its like
to be hurt to feel lost
to be left out in the dark
to be kicked when youre down
to feel like youve been pushed around
to be on the edge of breakin down
and no ones there to save you
no you dont know what its like
welcome to my life
welcome to my life
