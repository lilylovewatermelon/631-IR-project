todays escape will consist of a mask
i found it in a bargain bin why do you ask
rosy cheeks and a smile
theres no shame in my game of denial

verse 2
dont you touch move along keep your hands inside
ask enough from afar enjoy the ride
it dont get much better than this
theres the riff heres the hook wheres the myth

chorus
manning my stations
taking control of the situation
say hello to my force field

verse 2
beaten down on all fours and theyll stare as they pass
please dont feed or provoke or tap on the glass
bet you never felt quite like that
you could say dont complain where im at

chorus
manning my stations
taking control of the situation
say hello to my force field
see smash mouth liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likebridge
you wont see me cry
you wont you wont
you wont see me die

verse 3
the escapade still exists of the task
of pulling off a miracle out of my ass
it dont get much better than that
a savvy fox a loyal dog a sunny cat

chorus
manning my stations
taking control of the situation
say hello to my force field say hello to my force field

outro
say hello to my force field say hello to my force field
say hello to my force field
say hello to my force fieldembed"
