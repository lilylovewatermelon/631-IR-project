im slowly turning into you
but you dont know this
tell the truth
you say im lying and i never really tell you the truth
but your face is getting older
so put your head on my shoulder
yeah put your head on my shoulder

verse 2
yesterday it hit me that i do all the little things
that you do
except the same little things that you do are annoying
theyre annoying as hell in fact
it kinda struck a little bell in fact
i like to keep my little shell intact

chorus
and im slowly turning into you
and im slowly turning into you

verse 3
then something else came to mind
that was the mirror
it made everything clearer
that youre more beautiful compelling and stronger
it didnt take much longer
just for me to realize i love all the little things
and the beauty that theyre gonna bring
i dig your little laugh and im lovin your quick wit
i even love it when youre faking it
and it might sound a little strange for me to say to you
but im proud to be you
you might also likechorus
and im slowly turning into you
and im slowly turning into you
and im slowly turning into you
and im slowly turning into you2embed"
