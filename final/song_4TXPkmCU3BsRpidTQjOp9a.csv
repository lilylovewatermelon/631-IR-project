we drove all night to billings montana
flew into utah slept there all day
i can’t remember stopping in denver
yeah i live my illusion that somebody needs me to play

chorus 1
sometimes i’m drunk
sometimes i’m stoned
and yes i get tired of being alone
i miss my son
i miss my wife
but the devil named music is taking my life

verse 2
now i sold my soul a long time ago
i put it in a six string and a sad melody
and i’m sometimes a winner most times a loser
if the crowd gets into it it’ll all feel the same way to me

chorus 2
sometimes i’m drunk
sometimes i’m stoned
and yes i get tired of being alone
i miss my daughter
i miss my wife
but the devil named music is taking my life
