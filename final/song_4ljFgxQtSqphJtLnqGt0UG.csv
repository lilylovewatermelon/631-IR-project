damn girl you so fine i had missed you
i thought i was never gon see you dawg
shit crazy

verse 1 kodak black
at times i thought a nigga wouldn’t ever see ya
but now im back out here and i won’t ever leave ya
i was wilin with my strap i was totin ninas
you know i pull up in the jag i want you in a bimmer
tell my momma you my one and only girl i need ya
tell my baby you my lady i just wanna please ya
i be pullin on yo hair when i be stroking deeper
i know you don’t like that smell when i be smoking reefer
you my favorite alphabet they just wanna be ya
i remember poppin checks runnin up the meter
i can take you to a place you thought youd never go
i can do some things for you you thought impossible
man sometimes i just be thinkin i wont ever make it
cause i be goin through a lot of situations
ima keep it real with you girl im infatuated
ima show you that i love you i will never fake it
i remember drinking lean living like the matrix
i always see you in my dreams i love to see you naked
girl you know im from the streets yeah im a project baby
wonderin would you stay with me if i don’t ever make it

verse 2 kodak black
im forever your lil hustler
you so bad i dont want to see you fuckin with no busta
to see your face again it got me captivated
keep it real with me what you been doing lately
i need a jump right in that pussy i feel like a virgin
after you drop that neck im gonna drop some verses
i aint seen you in so long it got me feelin nervous
im sorry for leaving you aint do that shit on purpose

hold me down when i’m gone i got in a lil trouble
