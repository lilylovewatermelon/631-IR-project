oh lighten up cogsworth and let nature take its course

mrs potts spoken
its obvious theres a spark between them​

cogsworth spoken
yes yes but theres no harm in fanning the flames you know a little besides they must fall in love tonight if we ever expect to be human again​

lumière spoken
aaahhuman again​

mrs potts spoken
human again​

lumière spoken
yes think of what that means

sung
ill be cooking again
be goodlooking again
with a mademoiselle on each arm
when im human again
only human again
poised and polished and gleaming with charm
you might also likeill be courting again
chic and sporting again

mrs potts
which should cause sevral husbands alarm

lumière
ill hop down off the shelf
and tout de suite be myself

lumière  mrs potts
i cant wait to be human again

assorted
when were human again
only human again
when were knickknacks and whatnots no more
when were human again
good and human again

wardrobe
ah chérie wont it all be topdrawer
ill wear lipstick and rouge
and i wont be so huge
why ill easily fit through that door
ill exude savoirfaire
ill wear gowns ill have hair
its my prayer to be human again
cogsworth  mrs potts
when were human again
only human again
when the world once more starts making sense

cogsworth
ill unwind for a change

lumière
really thatd be strange

cogsworth
can i help it if im tttense
in a shack by the sea
ill sit back sipping tea
let my early retirement commence
far from fools made of wax
ill get down to brass tacks
and relax

all
when im human again
so sweep the dust from the floor
lets let some light in the room
i can feel i can tell
someone might break the spell
any day now
shine up the brass on the door
alert the dustpail and the broom

if all goes as planned
our time may be at hand
any day now

babette  dusters
open the shutters and let in some air

mrs potts
put these here and put those over there

all
sweep up the years
of sadness and tears
and throw them away

well be human again
only human again
when the girl finlly sets us all free
cheeks abloomin again
were assumin again
well resume our long lost joie de vivre

well be playin again
holidayn again
and were prayin its asap
we will push they will shove
they will whoosh fall in love
and well finally be human again

dialogue

well be dancing again
well be twirling again
well be whirling around with such ease
when were human again
only human again
well go waltzing those old onetwothrees

well be floating again
well be gliding again
stepping striding as fine as you please
like a real human does
ill be all that i was
on that glorious morn when were finlly reborn
and were all of us human againembed"
