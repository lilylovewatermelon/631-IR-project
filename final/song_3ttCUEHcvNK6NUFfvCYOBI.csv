what i see is whats to be
cartwheels to eternity
round and round my head she goes
in the good dreams though she wears no clothes
took our picture by the sea
the ocean waits to carry me
carry me back home again
to where she sleeps i lay my head

prechorus
saw her running barefoot
but the ground there never touched her feet
watched her in the shadows
while the tide came in and claimed our beach
we couldve made it in the dunes
we had it all within our reach
but ive got a lot of life to learn
and youve got a lot of life to teach

chorus
why do we all end up alone
why do we always have to find our way back home
why do we all end up alone
we gather no moss just like a rolling

what i say is what i mean
no definition in between
couldnt make it in the movie scene
you couldnt stay on you couldnt stay clean
what you wear is who you are
the odds are in and youll go far
a penny for your thoughts youll see
a nickel buys you what you need

prechorus 2
saw you on the big show
saw you swinging from the big trapeze
standing on my tiptoes
while you brushed the dirt from off your knees
should have come as no surprise
no one else here did have your drive
youve got a big white stretch parked right outside
but nobody there to share your ride

chorus
why do we all end up alone
why do we always have to find our way back home
why do we all end up alone
why do we all end up dead drunk or stoned
bridge
what i know is what i hear
the ringing in my ears is clear
a monkeys got it made you see
swinging from the vine of a coconut tree

chorus
why do we all end up alone
why do we always have to find our way back home
why do we all end up alone
we gather no moss just like a rolling stone
why do we all end up alone
why do we always have to find our way back home
why do we all end up alone
why do we all wake up dead drunk or stoned

outro
dead drunk or stoned
just like a rolling stoneembed"
