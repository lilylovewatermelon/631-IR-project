all it takes is a downtown bar
all it takes is some neon stars
a little you a little me
in the same vicinity and its on
everyone is the first last time
walk away then we hit rewind
a little touch a little buzz
dont know what keeps keepin it up

chorus
is it your heart or mine
is it whiskey or wine
is it somethin in the night
makin us wanna cross that line
girl were playin with fire
love aint too far behind
its just a matter of time
til it finds your heart or mine

verse 2
we say that it aint no thing
we say it then the telephone rings
a hello arе you at home
cause im all alone missin you
wе swear it aint love love love
but youre there when the sun comes up
we swear it aint love love love
but it always comes back to us

is it your heart or mine
is it whiskey or wine
is it somethin in the night
makin us wanna cross that line
girl were playin with fire
love aint too far behind
its just a matter of time
til it finds your heart or mine

instrumental break

bridge
we swear it aint love love love
we swear it aint love love love

chorus
is it your heart or mine
is it whiskey or wine
is it somethin in the night
makin us wanna cross that line
girl were playin with fire
love aint too far behind
its just a matter of time
til it finds your heart or mine
your heart or mineembed"
