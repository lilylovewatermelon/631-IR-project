give me your hand
the fox in the garden row is covered in mud
and dragging your mothers clothes
cinder and smoke
the snake in the basement
found the juniper shade
the farmhouse is burning down

verse 2
give me your hand
and take what you will tonight
ill give it as fast
and high as the flame will rise
cinder and smoke
some whispers around the trees
the juniper bends
the farmhouse is history

verse 3
give me your hand
your mother is drunk
as all the firemen shake
a photo from fathers arms
cinder and smoke
you asked me to pray for rain
with ash in your mouth
youll ask it to burn againsee iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeembed"
