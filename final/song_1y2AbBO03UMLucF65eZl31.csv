damn youre so dull
still need to borrow your hate
change what they can
persuade us back under cover

oh old youre so over
who made you king of the ages
tending the wounds
thinking of adding another

chorus
but the chosen never wrong
he sat holding several thoughts
ill take anything thats not bolted down
bolted down

verse 2
tricking us in dont get along if theyre brothers
so phasing it out correcting vision with fists
and drawing a line still give it less than a week
checking the wounds thinking of adding another

chorus
but the chosen never wrong
he sat holding several thoughts
ill take anything thats not bolted down
bolted down
see chevelle liveget tickets as low as 161you might also likebridge
free whats bolted down

chorus x2
but the chosen never wrong
he sat holding several thoughts
ill take anything thats not bolted downembed"
