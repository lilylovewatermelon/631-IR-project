all work and no play
thats the way it is aint it
theres a rhythm deep inside of you
and you must get reacquainted

chorus
when was the last time you danced
when was the last time you danced
well come rock with me baby
dance with me darling
step with me sweetheart
the world is watching

verse 2
under an endless sky
wish i could fly away forever and ever
and the poetry is so pure
when we are on the floor together its been a long time

chorus
when was the last time you danced
when was the last time you danced
well come rock with me baby
dance with me darling
step with me sweetheart
the world is watching

ooh come closer yeah
lets dance the night away

when was the last time you danced
well come rock with me baby
