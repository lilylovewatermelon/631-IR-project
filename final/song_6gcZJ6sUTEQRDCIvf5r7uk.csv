so they laugh for no reason what drops all hatin okay
wishin they was in your situation
so that why we take two vacations
one wit all the kids then one wit all the strippers that ya crew stay chasin
chillin in a camry okay far away from fame
and all the other situation weighin heavy on the brain
and now we margarita drankin drankin champagne poppin oop
