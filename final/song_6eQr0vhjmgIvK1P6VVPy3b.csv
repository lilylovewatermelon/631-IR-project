verse 1
yo it was all a dream i used to play chess at the coffee bean
and as my coffee steamed i thought about my life and my lofty dreams
its so sick and im startin to mix thanks to am rest in piece banana split
was the place we all went sundays to make people feel this way we would one day
and i remember when you gave me the secret popped in the dvd and peeped it
and if you dreamin you achivin after that it was a wrap
and now i walk in the club like a million times
spit on the mic like a million rhymes
we party rock to a billion drops and this shot makes one zillion shots
yes im feelin good and we the best im feelin good
and in your breast are feelin good haha lmfao
im a pro with this party thang
i love cherry tree cola and bacardi mayne
hey ive been the same before the start of fame
the only that has changed is we changed the game
you and i and the crew that i roll with
its gonna be the the same crew i grow old with
memories fade like old leather
but the music that we make gonna last forever legacy

verse 2

i feel like flyin on top of my game and i aint even tryin
nowadays im stylin and when she naked it i feel like cryin
its better than i hoped itd be
i walk down the street and people notice me
no body was as broke as me
they say you never get nowhere smokin weed
so i roll one up i stepped on a landmine blowin up
and i aint never growin up
and if the party rocks then you know its us
me and foo in the club straight postedup
back when i wasnt old enough
now bottles on ice when we rollin up
cheers a toast to us
oh we winnin now
my whole lifes changed since then and now
fans show love and women shout
make me feel like im the man
all of my friends n my fans say dont let em change you
been from london to japan and im still the same dude
and hes still the same foo
struggles we came through
stuck with our team and our dream and look how it came true
