wear them gold and diamond rings
all them things dont mean a thing
chaperones and limousines
shopping for expensive things
i be on the movie screens
magazines and bougie scenes
im not clean im not pristine
im no queen im no machine
i still go to taco bell
drivethrough raw as hell
i dont care im still real
no matter how many records i sell
after the show after the grammys
i like to go cool out with the family
sippin and reminiscin
on days when i had a mustang
and now im

verse 2 ludacris
im talking champagne wishes caviar dreams
you deserve nothing but all the finer things
now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
ive got enough money in the bank for the two of us
plus i gotta keep enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish
lifestyle so rich and famous robin leachll get jealous
half a million for the stones
taking trips from here to rome
so if you aint got no money take yo broke ass home

flyin first class up in the sky
poppin champagne
livin my life in the fast lane
i wont change by the glamorous

i got problems up to here i got people in my ear
telling me these crazy thangs that i dont wanna know fuck yall
i got money in the bank and id really like to thank
all the fans id like to thank thank you really though
cause i remember yesterday when i dreamt about them days
when id rock on mtv thatd be really dope
damn its been a long road and the industry is cold
im glad my daddy told me so he let his daughter know

outro fergie  polow da don
if you aint got no money take yo broke ass home you say it
my daddy told me so
if you aint got no money take yo broke ass home
he let his daughter know
he said if you aint got no money take yo broke ass home you say it
my daddy told me so

he let his daughter know31embed"
