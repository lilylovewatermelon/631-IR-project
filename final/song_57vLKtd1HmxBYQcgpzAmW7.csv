the rocking horse came
from an old oak tree
just missed the house
when it was hit by lightning
my daddy painted that horse
a midnight blue
shooting stars and silver horseshoes
and it was something magic out of something frightening

chorusx2
thats how i live my life
i take it as it comes
and i find the hidden love
when its pouring down on me
in my mind i see
the rocking horse inside the tree
a broken heart
means deeper feelings
a thorn in the flesh
means room for healing
oh salt in your tears
can open your eyes
wounded years
make you realize
its just something magic out of something frightening

things arent always as they seem
take the nightmare from my dreams
