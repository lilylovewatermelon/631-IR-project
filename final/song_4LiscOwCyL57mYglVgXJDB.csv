way back singin mrs robinson on train tracks
drinkin out of bottles with the stray cats
i had a grip it slipped away

verse 2
older than i was yesterday
my shoulders learnt to carry all this weight and more
tomorrow wont you come my way

chorus
oh it’s all a show we pretend like we know what we’re doing
oh it’s the blood in our veins take pride in your name
and i keep going
i keep going

verse 3
city keeps telling me that i been lookin shitty
hitting too much coke and whiskey
i guess i’ll drink myself to death

chorus
oh it’s all a show we pretend like we know what we’re doing
oh it’s the blood in our veins take pride in your name
and i keep going

chorus
oh it’s all a show we pretend like we know what we’re doing

oh and i keep going
and i keep going
and i keep going
and i keep goingembed"
