boy youll be the death of me
youre my james dean
you make me feel like im seventeen
you drive too fast
you smoke too much
but that dont mean a thing
cause im addicted to the rush

chorus
cause id rather die young than live my life without you
id rather not live at all than live my life without you
cause id rather die young than live my life without you
id rather not live at all than live my life without you

verse 2
you know ive been in love before
youre the first one i ever seen
that burns like gasoline
so light a match
turn off the lights
im holdin on to you
cause this might be our last night oh

chorus
cause id rather die young than live my life without you
id rather not live at all than live my life without you
cause id rather die young than live my life without you
id rather not live at all than live my life without you you
