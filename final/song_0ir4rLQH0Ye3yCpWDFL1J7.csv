well our souls are all mistaken in the same misguided way
we all end up forsaken were just choosing our own way
the future now incinerates before our very eyes
and leaves us with the emptiness of no more tries
well our visions of glory now have spiraled down the drain
the best of our intentions now come crashing down in flames
the depths of our despair we are unable to contain
its shallow living

chorus
the noose is falling and all my friends are crawling
the noose is falling and enemies are rising
a truth appalling our maker comes acalling
the noose is falling and enemies are rising

verse 2
well the tracers from yesteryear are burning in the dust
your bruises are reminders of naivety and trust
youre only feeling stronger cause your bodys getting numb
now i lay you down put the coins in your eyes
and blow the candles out

chorus
the noose is falling and all my friends are crawling
the noose is falling and enemies are rising
a truth appalling our maker comes acalling
the noose is falling and enemies are rising

the noose is falling and all my friends are crawling
the noose is falling and enemies are rising
a truth appalling our maker comes acalling
the noose is falling and enemies are rising

no more no more no more no more
nothing
no more no more no more no more
ever
no no more
no no more

chorus
the noose is falling and all my friends are crawling
the noose is falling and enemies are rising
a truth appalling our maker comes acalling
the noose is falling and enemies are rising
