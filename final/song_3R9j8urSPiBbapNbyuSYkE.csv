verse 1
im married to this game thats who i made my wife
said id die alone i told that bitch she probably right
one thing thats for sure not a stranger to this life
got a safe thats full of franklins and a shoulder full of stripes ah
dont know a nigga like myself
i say selfmade meanin i designed myself
county jail fades you could pull my file yourself
spot raid swallow rocks im gettin high myself
look and damn right i like the life i built
im from westside 60 shit i might got killed
standin so tall they think i might got stilts
legendary baller like mike like wilt
96 impala thug life on wheels
up against the walls squabble at fox hills
like a motherfuckin boss ask me how i feel
successful street nigga touchin them first mils woah

aint we travel round the world gettin cream or what
aint you get off on whoever hussle seem to rush

50 cent and mayweather fleed the scene with us
