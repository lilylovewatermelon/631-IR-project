so long
farewell
hello to the new me
the better me

my life

verse 1
21 and ive realized
everything you wants not meant to be
21 then you qualify
to stand up to responsibilities
so i tried to prioritize
by deciding what i know is best for me
and then theres always

prechorus
love that tries to trip you up
you try to catch yourself before you hit the ground
ooh but nothings promised
friends are there to cheer you up
to give you strength and build you up when you are down
ooh so i set sail emotion

chorus
i say
so long farewell
my lifes moving forward
my ship has sailed
and im so glad its over
my heart is well
after all that ive been through
i found myself

taking care of my needs
life isnt guaranteed
its time to start living
it wont always be the same
cant be afraid of change
you wanna have your way
demand till your satisfied
you lower your self esteem
you gotta live your dream
its all bout confidence
to let them know that you can stand up
you never try
learn to express you mind
sometimes you gotta fight
its your life so dont you give up
