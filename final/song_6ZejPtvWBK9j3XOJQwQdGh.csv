of the bluebird as she sings
the six oclock alarm would never ring
but it rings and i rise
wipe the sleep out of my eyes
my shavin razors cold and it stings

cheer up sleepy jean
oh what can it mean
to a daydream believer
and a homecoming queen

you once thought of me
as a white knight on a steed
but wow you know how happy i can be
and our good times start and end
without dollar one to spend
but how much baby do we really need

cheer up sleepy jean
oh what can it mean
to a daydream believer
and a homecoming queen

cheer up sleepy jean
oh what can it mean
to a daydream believer
and a homecoming queen
you might also likecheer up sleepy jean
oh what can it mean
to a daydream believer
and a homecoming queen

repeat and fade outembed"
