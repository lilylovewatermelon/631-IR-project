verse 1
cop provisions feed my addictions mistakes i made
then i opened up the holes and they crawled in
now when its time for the feed they wont let me forget
they ride upon my back and theyll fuck me with their need
my invisible enemies all my monkeys

bridge
theyre coming
theyre coming
theyre coming
theyre coming
theyre coming
theyre coming to take me away haha

verse 2
disgusted
with my position
so submissive i am
the only way we get away is give in
sharpen up the razors stab the needles into pipes to kill cravings
so sick of this in me cant stand the want to need
cant get free always got a grip on me

every time i try to run away i fall on my face
they drag me back

every time i try to run away i fall on my face

lull me into a deep sleep
