i take a moment just to breathe when im feeling that stress
with the sins on my sleeve with what heart i have left
til i take my last breath i will battle with the flesh
i picked the side for which i ride there aint no straddle in the fizz lord please
i feel the time passing by
i can feel the crash coming i been on a manic high
reminisce to cooking packs changed my life no looking back
the only man i fear is the reflection im looking at
only time im ever happy is when im keeping a buzz
i feel a wall around myself and the people i love
lord protect me from the storm i feel the thunder again
i done prayed before with a pistol under my chin
lord please

prechorus jelly roll
cause i know that ive been living wrong
all along i just didnt wanna be alone
pray for me cause i know that ive been living wrong
all along i just didnt wanna be alone

chorus jelly roll
im so afraid of me
my demons keep chasing me
there aint no saving me
i cant get away from me
cause i know that ive been living wrong
i cant get away from me
i just didnt wanna be alone
i cant get away from me
i cant get away from me
i cant get away from me
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 2 struggle jennings
still running from the devil stilettos on the gas pedal
pain so high that she crying in a falsetto
echos of my last words louder than her screams
living in a nightmare i promised her a dream
but i promise this aint her this is me
my life is slipping through my hand her loves at my feat
i beat myself up til my eyes swelled shut
so i cant see the love and the choice thats in front of me fuck
i feel stuck in a rut deep pain in my gut
im an angel to my demons that duck that cup
built a wall around my heart not to hide
its to keep my love safe from what i see inside

prechorus jelly roll
pray for me cause i know that ive been living wrong
all along i just didnt wanna be alone
pray for me cause i know that ive been living wrong
all along i just didnt wanna be alone

chorus jelly roll
im so afraid of me
my demons keep chasing me
there aint no saving me
i cant get away from me
pray for me cause i know that ive been living wrong
i cant get away from me
pray for me i just didnt wanna be alone
i cant get away from me
i cant get away from me
i cant get away fromembed"
