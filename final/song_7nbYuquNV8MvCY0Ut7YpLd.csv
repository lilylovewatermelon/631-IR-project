she likes to watch him out the window
goin’ ‘round in circles under the sun
somethin’ ‘bout a man on a tractor
with his hat on backwards
lookin’ forward to after he’s done

verse 2
he keeps his eye on the back porch
she walks out kicks off her shoes
bare feet standin’ in the short grass
sweet ice tea in a tall glass
judgin’ by her smile it’s about time to

chorus
shut it down
lotta work left to do the sun’s still out
but any hay to make can wait for now
throttle back drop the plow
shut it down

verse 3
he wipes his face off with his tshirt
climbs down and meets her by the gate
takes himself a long cool sip
lays some sugar on her lips
thinkin’ maybe he oughta just call it a day
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
shut it down
lotta work left to do the sun’s still out
any hay to make can wait for now
take it on in the house
shut it down

bridge
ooh big blue sky halfplowed field
bird on a fender tractor sittin’ still

chorus
any hay to make can wait for now
take it on in the house
close the door lock it out lock it out
shut it down shut it down shut it down
shut it down1embed"
