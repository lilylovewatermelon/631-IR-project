if you want me the cherry on top
the pick of the pack the crème de la crop
if you want me you better do better than that tonight ohoh
if you want me it takes more than a wink
more than a drink more than you think
if you want me youre gonna have to break the bank tonight ooh

prechorus
cause some dont have the patience
some call me high maintenance
but you pay the bill
cause thats the deal

chorus
if you wanna ride just name your price
dont play cheap with your heart
dont make a bet if you cant write the check
for me for me
cause i can be bought but youll pay the cost
if you can afford me

verse 2
if you want me im not a piece of ass
a onenight stand a storage shed
i think you better walk by tonight oh no
if you want me then stop begging
i dont put out for charity
if you want me theres no discount price tonight ooh

chorus
if you wanna ride just name your price
dont play cheap with your heart

for me for me
cause i can be bought but youll pay the cost
if you can afford me

refrain
if you want me the cherry on top
the pick of the pack the crème de la crop

chorus
if you wanna ride just name your price

dont play cheap with your heart
dont make a bet if you cant write the check
for me for me
cause i can be bought but youll pay the cost
