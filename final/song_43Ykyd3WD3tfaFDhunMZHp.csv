verse
i work the pack i was never overthestove whippin
had to trap to make a way this shit a cold business
boy if you conversate with rats might get a long sentence uh
nina blow him kisses til his soul liftin
my lil homie known for shootin like he cole bennett
was just a shawty off this check was fuckin grown women
my life a movie all these bitches want a role  in it
the cloth im cut from was special i wear my clothes different
lock in a booth say im the goat for how im killin tracks
bitch just be grateful if you got a chance to witness that
i fucked up the racks went on the road just to get it back
starin in the mirror still aint met nobody realer yet
coward was that nigga lost his soul i remember that
how you go on ten thousand drills still aint no killer yet
three blicks in the whip and if they deep then we got sticks for that
they gon have to outline his body like a silhouette
what you know bout watchin out for opps in a bullpen
devil dont care bout your innocence you will get lured in
i might have a bed made in hell for these newer sins
i cant say im sorry bout some shit that im gon do again
we might pop out at your party snuck them rugers in
uh them glocks hot when my shooters spin
baby we just set the tone we dont do the trends
im from where they tryna make a livin off a two for ten
yeah bitch you know how we roooock
fuck with the gang youll get brutalized
please dont try to take my chain boy thats suicide
comin straight from the slums where its doordie
now how you gon survive aint nowhere you can hide
for show them troopers slide hollows gon chew his spine
that glizzyll bust leave his noodles fried
is you with us or what better choose a side
dont sign up for this if you aint bout it this shit deadly
goofies talkin bout that they outside nigga barely
i got way too faded seen the reaper but he spared me
from the slimy ass block where niggas real rarely
bein broke and trusting snakes the only thing that scare me
if i hear that back door unlock a nigga gettin buried
vvs my pendant this shit hittin check my clarity
got on and made donations in my hood like a charity
i been wreaking havoc cause they never played it fair with meyou might also like11embed"
