with my eyes on me gold and me henny to the top
and me got sean paul and a sell some plaque
dem no like that so them come a huff up and a puff up
and a gwaan like say dem waan bruk up the big up
dem no love we lifestyle but we still a live it up
sean say fi represent so we rep it up
what a pity dutty run the city lock up a titty
gal a shake them ass and keepin it jiggy
take it back to basic 2pac and biggie
and a watch old school joints on rap city
kickin back and relax and a blaze a ziggy
and the first draw she take she start move giggly
me haffi wonder if da gal ya come from tripoli
make her know this jamaican is too muckily
chorus sean paul
