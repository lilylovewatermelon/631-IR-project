ive been looking all night
watching them empty out
invisible to this crowd
always double vision
ive been losing my mind
listening to broken speech
stacking up broken seats
its a lonely picture

prechorus
and i hear your voice as it echoes round my head
always that same thing that you said

chorus
get out get out while you still can
dont let the nights slip through your hands
the world is wide from where you stand
so get out get out while you still can

verse 2
as im sweeping up glass
i see the exit light so green
these people falling into the street
something comes together
ive been here too long
and if i stay theyll tie me down
i know this chance wont hang around
so im gone forever

and i hear your voice as it echoes round my head
always that same thing that you said

chorus
so get out get out while you still can
dont let the nights slip through your hands
the world is wide from where you stand
so get out get out while you still can

bridge
packing up my suitcase racing down forgotten street
making my tracks along the cracks in the concrete
seeing those headlights shining down upon my feet
if you find me you will find me on the run
for all the bleeding hearts pushing round their shopping carts
ive seen the greener grass ive seen the faster cars
and i dont need your happy hours i dont need your lonely bars
im ejecting like a bullet from a gun
so take your final look at me maybe even take my hand
standing on the staircase come and chase the master plan
the long awaited getaway play it like a grand slam
this is no encore we have only just begun

chorus
so get out get out while you still can
dont let the nights slip through your hands
the world is wide from where you stand
so get out get out while you still can8embed"
