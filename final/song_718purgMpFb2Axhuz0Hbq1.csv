i waited by ya
i waited for ya
i waited on ya
but now i dont

verse 1
you didnt see it
i didnt see it
i didnt see it
but now oh i do
i play your game
i play your game now
i play your game
i play your game

chorus
i take my chances alone
get on your horse and be gone
i will not wait up for you anymore
so you can ask me if something is wrong
will you go
i dont know anymore

verse 2
when the night isnt ready for you
its a fleeting unorthodox view
they invited a stewardess too
now they want you to see it
heres to days he decides hes got time
and he claims that its not a surprise
when he finds out the truths on his side
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likechorus
i take my chances alone
get on your horse and be gone
i will not wait up for you anymore
so you can ask me if something is wrong
will you go
i dont know anymore
i dont believe anyone
as they crawl out of my way

outro
waiting for the night
leaving night by night
you can see me travel
we could be in trouble every night
were having a new life21embed"
