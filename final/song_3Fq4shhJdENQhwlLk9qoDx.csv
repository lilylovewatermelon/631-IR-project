and you keep on diggin til you get down there where its darker than your darkest fears
and that woman in the kitchen she keeps on cookin but she aint had meat in years
just live off bread live off hope in a pool of a million tears

now let me tell you somethin bout the gospel
and make sure that you mark it down
when god spoke out let there be light
he put the first of us in the ground
and well keep on diggin til the comin of the lord
and gabriels trumpet sounds
cause if you aint minin for the company boy
there aint much in this town

we couldve made somethin of ourselves out there if wed listened to the folks that knew
that coal is gonna bury you

now its darker than a dungeon
and its deeper than a well
so sometimes i imagine
that im gettin pretty close to hell
and in my darkest hour
i cry out to the lord
he says keep on minin boy
cause thats why you were born
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likewell we couldve made somethin of ourselves out there if wed listened to the folks that knew
that coal is gonna bury you1embed"
