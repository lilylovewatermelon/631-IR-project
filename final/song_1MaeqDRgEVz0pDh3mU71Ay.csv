im waiting for you right outside
the place we first locked eyes oh
i feel like were both losing sight
we dont get to do this twice
and i wonder

chorus
will you care
when im gone
and its done
and ive really had enough
and im sorry
for the trouble
thats been costing us so much
splitting apart its getting harder to tell what you want
so bored with these games games games games

verse 2
the last time that i left these steps
was after our first kiss
i wonder why you havent shown
ill be leaving here alone
and i wonder

chorus
will you care
when im gone
and its done
and ive really had enough
and im sorry
for the trouble
thats been costing us so much
splitting apart its getting harder to tell what you want
so bored with these games games games games
