im looking at you through the glass
dont know how much time has passed
oh god it feels like forever
but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home
sitting all alone inside your head

cause im looking at you through the glass
dont know how much time has passed
all i know is that it feels like forever
but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home
sitting all alone inside your head

verse 1
how do you feel that is the question
but i forget you dont expect an easy answer
when something like a soul becomes initialized
and folded up like paper dolls and little notes
you cant expect a bit of hope
so while youre outside looking in
describing what you see
remember what youre staring at is me

chorus
cause im looking at you through the glass
dont know how much time has passed
all i know is that it feels like forever
but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home
sitting all alone inside your head

how much is real so much to question
an epidemic of the mannequins
contaminating everything
we thought came from the heart
but never did right from the start
just listen to the noises
null and void instead of voices
before you tell yourself its just a different scene
remember its just different from what youve seen

chorus
im looking at you through the glass
dont know how much time has passed
and all i know is that it feels like forever
but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home
sitting all alone inside your head

cause im looking at you through the glass
dont know how much time has passed
and all i know is that it feels like forever
but no one ever tells you
that forever feels like home
sitting all alone inside your head
