so scream i heard about your message
and how it reeked of your indifference
it bleeds horizontal straight from your wrists
so scream louder now
i’m bound to come around about
im bound to come around
but can’t you can’t you feel it rolling off your lips
tensing up your shoulders c’mon say it is

chorus adam lazzara fred mascherino adam lazzara  fred mascherino
well it’s love it’s love
make it hurt i deserve it
well it’s love it’s love
make it hurt i deserve it
well it’s love it’s love it’s love make it hurt

verse 2 adam lazzara fred mascherino
i said i used the inconsistencies that undress the machine
you’re the poster boy their selling point
the focus for their new campaign
“something has to be done”
i’m bound to come around about
i’m bound to come around
can’t you can’t you feel it rolling off your lips
tensing up your shoulders c’mon

the keys to the castle are right where i left them
the princess walked in just to take more attention
cause after all well isn’t that all that i’ve been after
and after all well isn’t that all that i’m after
you’re so

bridge adam lazzara fred mascherino
no way out
i’ll give up in you well i’ll give up in you
no way out
i’ll give up in you
no way out
well i’ll give up in you i’ll give up in you
no way out
well i’ll give up in you
