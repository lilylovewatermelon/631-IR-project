oh

the satellite comes and goes
we give each other all we know
in silence we still talk
by the light of the stereo we waltz

and will you rain down
in your cinematic love truck
im gonna hold you like
nothings gonna stop us

and she comes to take me away
shes all that i needed
i dont breathe another lover
no

flicker on a tv screen
everythings more than it seems
the mighty backward fall
we stare at the light on the wall

and i swear to this
she felt like velvet
second blonde child
like velvet velvet
see bush liveget tickets as low as 28you might also likeand she comes to take me away
shes all that i needed
i dont breathe another lover
uh

im an alien youre an alien
its a beautiful rain a beautiful rain
im an alien youre an alien
its a beautiful rain a beautiful rain

im an alien youre an alien
its a beautiful rain beautiful rain beautiful rain

beautiful beautiful
oh

when she come around again
when she come around again around again
around again
around again

im an alien youre an alien
its a beautiful rain beautiful rain
im an alien youre an alien
its a beautiful rain beautiful rain
im an alien youre an alien

beautiful rain a beautiful rain a beautiful rain
