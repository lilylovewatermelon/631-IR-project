old stars fall to the ground
floors are flat and the moon is round
grass is green and skies are blue
and girl i got a thing for you
old trucks rattle down gravel roads
rivers wind and the north wind blows
raindrops fall on old tin roofs
girl i got a thing for you
dreamers dream and wishers wish
talkers talk and fishers fish
sun sets in the west each day
dont ask me why it goes that way
old cowboys aint got much to say
christmas comes on christmas day
and i guess what im gettin into
is girl i got a thing for you
farmers farm and painters paint
god is good and the devil aint
summers hot and sidewalks crack
dont ask me why it goes like that
now slide on over next to me
let me kiss those pretty red lips so sweet
and get lost in your eyes of blue
cause girl i got a thing for you
see easton corbin liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeoutro
when it comes to you girl im a fool
cause i got a thing for youembed"
