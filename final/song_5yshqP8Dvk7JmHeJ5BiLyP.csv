verse 1 lil hearse
three am drinkin with this pistol on my lap uh
six medications guess there aint no fixin that
its that broken motherfucker knuckling til i relapse
if i die they might cry til they inherit my stacks uh
cold fuckin world tell me whats the word
only time i speak my heart is when the message come out slurred uh
people pleasing always eager to fix a motherfuckers problems
leave me at the bottom more comfortable with gomorrah and sodom
i chew on fent and rot my teeth
all for moments of peace and slow heartbeats
got offered a god i dissed who gon save me hmph
all i could do is laugh and say cest la vie uh yeah
woe is me i know you get the picture uh
this type of pain will earn you seven figures
check my dna my rna come with predictors
this shit is scripture and for what i got theres no elixirs uh
feel like im not enough
find myself playing my dad like honey boy and shia labeouf
my mama crying as she watch the clock
text my bro i love him even though he got my number blocked
i would give up everything to see my brothers clean
no second thoughts its fuck the cost or take me leave em be
take my money say you love me even if its lies
that connections so depressing but its all i got
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likechorus lil hearse  notorious big
when i die when i die just play this fucking song
i was never meant for this been tortured just to carry on when i die
couple coupes lotta zeroes and a couple homes
none of it did shit for me cock the pistol and now im when i die

verse 2 oddy nuff da snow leopard
aight
head in the clouds it look like it might rain again
always holdin back tears its how i manage to pay the rent
pay the bills place the bet so i dont have to chase the check
verified through uicide the glitz and glamour came and went
wash my fucking soul theres still that one stain is kept
i just wanna be loved the root of all my pain
except the type that comes with age and death
i can finally lay and rest im owed a little peace
and im ready to erase the debt i i i i
i never planned on showing the world the face that hides behind the mask
i always thought the last thing i would hear would be the guns blast
fill in the black hole in my chest with sex and drugs but it never lasts it never lasts
shit two years ago big pharma should have just cashed me out
now i got a deviated septum ima just rat me out
pat me down ask me how im still depressed
all they see is my set all they see is lack of debt
all they see is what they wanna see
calling me a wannabe
i dont wanna be in misery exit the pharmacy
get a girl i wanna see i wanna see how hard i bleed
when she rips out my fucking heart enter the pharmacy
im a private person and take pride in my verses
fuck your whole opinion i dont care if it worsens
ill ruin my reputation and make sure its on purpose
fuck this shit
chorus oddy nuff da snow leopard  notorious big
when i die when i die just play this fucking song
i was never meant for this been tortured just to carry on when i die
couple coupes lotta zeroes and a couple homes
none of it did shit for me cock the pistol and now im gone when i die

outro notorious big
fuck it i wanna go to hell
