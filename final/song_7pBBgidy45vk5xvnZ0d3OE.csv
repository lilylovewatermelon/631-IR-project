but i wont be blue always
i know the suns going to shine
in my back door someday

i got that trouble in mind thats true
i have almost lost my mind
life aint worth living
sometimes i feel like dying

tell you what im gonna do
im going to lay
on some lonesome railroad line
and let twoten train
ease my trouble in mind

meanwhile i got that
trouble in mind im blue
but i wont be blue always
i know the suns going to shine
in my back door someday

if things dont get better
im going down to the river
im gonna take my old rocking chair
and if the blues overtake me
im gonna rock on away from here
