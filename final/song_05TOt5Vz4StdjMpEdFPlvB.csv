i will leave my heart at the door
i wont say a word
theyve all been said before you know
so why dont we just play pretend
like were not scared of what is coming next
or scared of having nothing left

prechorus
look dont get me wrong
i know there is no tomorrow
all i ask is

chorus
if this is my last night with you
hold me like im more than just a friend
give me a memory i can use
take me by the hand while we do
what lovers do
it matters how this ends
cause what if i never love again

verse 2
i dont need your honesty
its already in your eyes
and im sure my eyes they speak for me
no one knows me like you do
and since youre the only one that mattered
tell me who do i run to

look dont get me wrong
i know there is no tomorrow
all i ask is

chorus
if this is my last night with you
hold me like im more than just a friend
give me a memory i can use
take me by the hand while we do
what lovers do
it matters how this ends
cause what if i never love again

bridge
let this be our lesson in love
let this be the way we remember us
i dont want to be cruel or vicious
and i aint asking for forgiveness
all i ask is

chorus
if this is my last night with you
hold me like im more than just a friend
give me a memory i can use
take me by the hand while we do
what lovers do
it matters how this ends
cause what if i never love again44embed"
