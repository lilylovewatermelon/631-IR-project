dont tell me that this is your last chance to change
cause if you do then you would be telling a lie
but

verse 1
i warned you
what could happen if you should decide
to live your life from 9 till 5
and i mourn you
for that detail that is left unsaid
is a reminder of the time you bled

chorus
return to days when you knew you still felt alive
reveal the way you felt when you could look inside

verse 2
they sold you
everything you need to fix you up
and you feel good now but you cant wake up
they found a way to reassure you that everything would be okay
reach out today now i implore you to remember who you are

chorus
return to days when you knew you still felt alive
reveal the way you felt when you could look inside

so you felt it but you dont know
why you cant explain at all
why you felt it cause you dont know
no you dont know

bridge 2
break the walls between building atrophy
causing all your problems to recede
break the walls between break the walls between
causing all your pain causing all
youll never learn

chorus
return to days when you knew you still felt alive
reveal the way you felt when you could look inside

outro
break the walls between building atrophy
take back the beat in your heart
why fight when you cant be bought
causing all your problems to recede
take back the beat in your heart
why fight when you cant be bought
break the walls between
take back the beat in your heart
why fight when you cant be bought
causing all your pain
take back the beat in your heart
why fight when you cant be bought1embed"
