theyve got the best equipment that money can buy hell every team theyre sending over here has their own personal masseuse not masseur masseuse but it doesnt matter do you know that every mohawk competitor has electrocardiogram blood and urine tests every fortyeight hours to see if theres any change in his physical condition do you know that they use the most sophisticated training methods from the soviet union east and west germany and the newest olympic power trinidad  tobago but it doesnt matter it just doesnt matter it just doesnt matter i tell you it just doesnt matter it just doesnt matter it just doesnt matter it just doesnt matter it just doesnt matter it just doesnt matter it just doesnt matter even if we win if we win ha even if we win even if we play so far over our heads that our noses bleed for a week to ten days even if god in heaven above comes down and points his hand at our side of the field even if every man woman and child held hands together and prayed for us to win it just wouldnt matter

verse
yeah
yeah
um um
jumpin out the camino
just left the gas station smell like hot cheetos
recordin softcore on her tivo
ma the meatloaf
resmoke got a vegan bitch in the peace corp
all she ever do is ask me what i eat meat for—
hold up pause always over the quota
boss wake up in polo sleep in lacoste
travel across the world but that didnt phase me
couple people that i know that happen to play me
once they start to realize that im actually crazy
shit im actually crazy um and
qs phone gettin blown up by lyor cohen
christian dior nothin im ownin
go to hawaii fuck with samoans
get faded and sleep in the oceans
keep it in motion
im rollin
yeah yeah yeah im rollin
keep it in motion
im rollin yeah
and your bitch wearin elbow pads
sell her pussy over melrose ave
ive been to hell and back tryna get attached to my better half
never that the smiles so gone so bring the coke on
im higher than voltron with a bunch of gold on
caucasians still love me like my name was michael bolton
hold on do you fuckin dirty like the soap gone
froze on its bone chillin colder than the popes secrets
older than capones demons comin from a place where there was no jesus
walkin bohemoth i increase the feces
cause shit real fly into your windshield and get killed
buggin out had it all im nothin now
i just gave it away
fuck a label cain and abel put a name to a face
um yeah
i bust your speakers with some bullshit rap
im on drugs all my new shit wack
remember that
i aint shit but a fraud
but everyone i know aint nothin to a god
but everyone i know aint nothin to god
