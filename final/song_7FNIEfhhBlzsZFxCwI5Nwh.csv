a little less conversation a little more action please
all this aggravation aint satisfactioning me
a little more bite a little less bark
a little less fight and a little more spark
close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
satisfy me baby

verse 1
baby close your eyes and listen to the music
drift through a summer breeze
its a groovy night and i can show you how to use it
come along with me and put your mind at ease
hey

chorus
a little less conversation a little more action please
all this aggravation aint satisfactioning me
a little more bite a little less bark
a little less fight and a little more spark
close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
satisfy me baby

verse 2
come on baby im tired of talking
grab your coat and lets start walking
come on come on
come on come on
come on come on
dont procrastinate dont articulate
girl its getting late getting upset waiting around
