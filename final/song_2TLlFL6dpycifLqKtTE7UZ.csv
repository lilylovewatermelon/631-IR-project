no whoa whoa whoa
phone drier than mojave
daddy diabetic so he eat his pancakes with agave
mama headed to the church now

naked like a nudist
fruity loops and stanley kubrick
peanut butter jelly
cousin bumping makaveli
sipping stellas with my fellas
bumping nothing but fela kuti
groupies say they wanna do me

and act like its alright when its not whoa
