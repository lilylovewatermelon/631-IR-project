so you made it this far
we upstairs
i let you up here
you special
marley dont shoot em
you know what this is
its still tha carter ii people
its still tha carter ii people
yeah youre still in tha carter ii people
hey yeah

verse
all i have in this world is a pistol and a promise
a fistful of dollars a list full of problems
i address em like po boxes
yeah im from new orleans the creole cockpit
we so out of it zero tolerance
gangsta gumbo ill serve em a pot of it
im wealthy still fuckin with that block shit
wet your ass up head to feet til your socks drip
dont slip you might fall and bust your ass
no snakes at the carter tell the gardener cut the grass
i hear em but they talking under masks
stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass
thats cash money honeypie
we aint running we dont hide
screamin fuck the other side
dont get caught on it
this the deadliest grinds i put your heart on it
and walk on it
the chalks only for the art homie
how they trace ya after i erase ya
look around
we at war and you still in preparation
im ridin for them reparations no patience
slow paper is better than no paper
fast money dont last too long you got to pace it
you gotta know that paper
if you got it from a caper gotta blow that paper
gotta know that
photophobia no kodak moments
feds walls with my pictures on em naw
i aint even in the school yearbook
i dont do too much posing got a cool killer look ah
career crook get your career took
im back like a brassiere hook
bitch cheer
camouflage gear the hunters here
better play it by ear
you aint nothing but a deer
around here and this here is tha carter
serve it while its hot out the pot to your mama
and slim tell me aint nobody hotter
but get your boy some dipping sauce i want the whole enchilada
i got em by the collar watch me drop em
on they head at the bottom
you aint got to shoot em cause i already shot em
and i aint got to get em cause i already got em
