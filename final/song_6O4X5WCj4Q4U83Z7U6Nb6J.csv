i won’t hesitate
to twist the blade slowly
so you can feel my hate
surprise won’t fool me
when i see it in your eyes
as i tear the blade out again
and again and again until you die
don’t take what i say so lightly
if you got a problem with me
come fight me delight me
we’re gonna take a finger
for every bridge that you burned
i’m not gonna stop until
every rock has been unturned
the blood warm and heavy
like a boulder on my fist
drips down my elbow
i am the consequence of your risk
i will watch you lay there
in blood pumped by lies
you thought you could escape forever
took more than your life could buy
i’m not fooling around…you might also likeembed"
