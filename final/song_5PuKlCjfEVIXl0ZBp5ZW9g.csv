its the best time of the year
i dont know if therell be snow
but have a cup of cheer
have a holly jolly christmas
and when you walk down the street
say hello to friends you know
and everyone you meet

oh ho the mistletoe
is hung where you can see
somebody waits for you
kiss her once for me
have a holly jolly christmas
and in case you didnt hear
oh by golly have a holly
jolly christmas this year
