threw my heart away each spring
but now a spring romance hasnt got a chance
promised my first dance to winter
and all ive got to shows a splinter for my little fling

spring this year has got me feeling
like a horse thats never left the post
i lie in my room staring up at the ceiling
spring can really hang you up the most

mornings kiss wakes trees and flowers
and to them id like to drink a toast
i walk in the park just to kill lonely hours
spring can really hang you up the most

all winter long those birds they twittertwit
i know the song this is love this is it
heard it before and i know the score
and ive decided that spring is a bore

doctors once prescribed a tonic
sulphur and molasses was the dose
that didnt help a bit my condition must be chronic
spring can really hang you up the most
see norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likei am all alone the party is over
old man winter was a gracious host
but when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover
spring can really hang you up the mostembed"
