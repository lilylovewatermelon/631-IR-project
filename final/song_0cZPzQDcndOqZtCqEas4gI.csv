drugs straight out the capsule send her ass to molly world
i dont even drink for real but i damn near fucked a bottle girl
i just bought a bitch two pair of chanels i told her model for it
when im in the club with niggas i dont like we havin bottle wars
said to my man like we on that nigga ass aint no talkin to us
give me compliments my bitch for real but aint no talkin to her
champagne back to back in the gucci store when i walk through it
get high then i treat the mic like therapy cause i talk to it
i sit back and ask myself why so many times
they treatin sports just like the streets they tryna give em fines
he in the trenches without a gun i called and gave him mine
bumped heads with my day ones yesterday i say ima give em time
hope ba get right back off that time they gave him fiftyfive
i hate tayski gone forever we locked in on 59th
he was my dawg he was my round he was like fifty twice
i made it out i beat the odds you gotta be precise
me and my auntie had some words that shit ate me alive
see my lil daughter bad as hell and she aint even five
he got the same time as the shooter and he aint even drive
an opp got hit in his top and he aint even die
ive seen so many young niggas lose they lives
thats why when i go to a funeral today i dont even cry
and that real shit run in my veins
some niggas i dont fuck with for real they just wanted my stain
i put ninety on your head thats one of my chains
and i cant cap that nigga von made me go to johnny dang
i popped a pill and hit my head damn i was feelin strange
im swingin first whenever a nigga ask me what i bang
when you lose five niggas in one summer thats when youll feel my pain
you aint gotta snatch it theyll kill you you cant feel my chains
im the highest in the room i feel just like la flame
theyll give you life but change to a dub if you give em names
yeah my life for real for real this not a movie
if a nigga i know support my song theyll call em groupies
and they aint even meet lil baby but theyll go post his music
and thats my dawg for sure yeah thats my dawg for sure
and i be stressed out with my kids sometimes i dont call at all
and you be actin like you off percs but you off tylenol
i done popped some x and i told my mama i was off adderall
i buy that glock i need that switch i need that attatchment yallyou might also like5embed"
