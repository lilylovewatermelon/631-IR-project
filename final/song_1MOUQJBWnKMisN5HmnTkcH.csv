met you in texas
i left you in texas
read your text message damn girl youre reckless
thanks to you all i do is think about you
another hundred racks changed my mood
i bet two hundred racks change yours too
girl you know i wouldnt say nothin bout it
but you know i heard everything about it
you used to strip out of east atlanta
probably where you learn all of your talents

prechorus
lets get back to the love making
lets get back to the legs shaking
remember when you said you was always faking
when you with him you dont miss him you just distant
oh oh yeah

i dont care to say it shawty need you

chorus

nobody but you single want nobody but you
thinkin bout nobody but you

takin it from nobody but me
keep it for me keep it for me
that loyalty is all i need
