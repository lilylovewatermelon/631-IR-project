see the storm is broken
in the middle of the night
nothing left here for me
its washed away
the rain pushes
the buildings aside
the sky turns black
the sky
wash it far
push it out to sea
theres nothing left here
for me
i watch it lift up to the sky
i watch it crush me
and then i die

verse 2
speak to me baby
in the middle of the night
pull your mouth close to mine
i can see the wind coming down
like black night
so speak to me
like the winds outside
its broken up
pushing us
hear the rain fall
see the wind come to my eyes
see the storm broken
now nothing
speak to me baby
in the middle of the night
speak to me
hold your mouth to mine
because the sky is breaking
its deeper than love
i know the way you feel
like the rains outside
speak to meyou might also likeembed"
