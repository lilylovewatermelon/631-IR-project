remember when when it was 1992
two little kids stealing records skipping school
we must have been like only ten
taking life for granted till we learn it had an end
remember when and time is something they say
you never appreciate till you age
and to this day you never knew
i wanted to be just like you

chorus
if i only knew then what i know now
then what i know now
if i only knew then what i know now
then what i know now

verse 2
remember when when it was 2002
you started slinging coke and got the dopest pair of shoes
but yo this house just aint a home
since our father hit the bottle and our mother hit the road
and time is something they say
you never understand until it slips away
and looking back i think you knew
i wanted to be just like you
you might also likechorus
if i only knew then what i know now
then what i know now
if i only knew then what i know now
then what i know now

and its better me better me than you
