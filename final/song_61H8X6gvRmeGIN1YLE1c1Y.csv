in a galaxy closely closely near is it closely
yeah its closely just keep the evil voice
oh oh im sorry for party rocking
ive been sipping on that whiskey all day just read it
two men emerged out of the muck
april 1 2007 april fools day
it marked the birth of a new sound party rock
and what we do is rock the beat
its going down
cause we lmfao rock the beat and rock the show
move your feet onto the floor start to freak and drink some more

put your hands up put your hands up
if you came to party put your motherfucking hands up
put your hands up put your hands up
if you came to party put your motherfucking hands upyou might also like1embed"
