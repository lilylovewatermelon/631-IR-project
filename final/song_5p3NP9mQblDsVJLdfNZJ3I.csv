verse 1
ever since a young man since a young man
all i wanna be was a gunman was a gunman
shootin’ up the charts better run man
yall gotta see that i won man
slick as el debarge with the finger waves work it jt
handle bars like a fade watch me work it jt
im at large runnin’ plays like a circuit jt
im sellin verses jt watch me work it jt
look look… hol up
dont judge me my mama caught me with a strap
dont judge me i was young fuckin all the brats
dont judge me aimin’ at your head for a stack
don’t judge dont judge me now my home got a valley peak
don’t judge me if i press your line you a freak
dont judge me wont you tell a friend yall gon’ see—

chorus
this what god feel like huh heyeah
laughin to the bank like aha huh heyeah
flex on swole like aha huh heyeah

fuck is you talkin to
ayy do you know who you talkin to
slide on you like fallen drapes
god toss full of carnivals
i kill em with kindness
or i kill em with diamonds
or i put up like fifteen hundred
get yo ass killed by the finest
everything in life is a gamble
nothin in life i cant handle
seen it all done it all felt pain more
for the cause i done put blood on sword
everything i do is to embrace yall
everything i write is a damn eight ball
everything i touch is a damn gold mine
everything i say is from an angel

bridge
i dont rush shit fuck shit always your shit my shit
cannonballs to ignite shit morning to the night shift
im on i aint sorry for it
asked for a piece of mind you charged me for it
i wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
im in the streets sometimes and cant afford it
i got a bad habit levitatin duckin haters
oh my my heart is rich my heart is famous
