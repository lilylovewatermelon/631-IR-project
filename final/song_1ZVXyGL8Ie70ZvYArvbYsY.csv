cant you see im holdin your flag
the one that you left on the ground
well is the world too heavy for you
and if it makes you feel better ill carry it too
cause no ones gonna stand in your light
impressions are easy to fight
but until you turn to me and say
you dont need anyone to carry the weight
i will stay

chorus
abilene
bring it on home to me
abilene
well isnt it good to be free

verse 2
cant you see im wearin your shirt
the one with the heart on the sleeve
now everyone can see youve been hurt
oh but honey dont give up on me
oh when you gonna make up your mind
when you gonna get out of bed
well every day youre gonna find
broken promises are no worse than words never said
