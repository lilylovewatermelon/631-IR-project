salt air and the rust on your door
i never needed anything more
whispers of are you sure
never have i ever before

chorus
but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
cause you were never mine

verse 2
your back beneath the sun
wishin i could write my name on it
will you call when youre back at school
i remember thinkin i had you

chorus
but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
cause you were never mine
ahhahh
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likebridge
back when we were still changin for the better
wanting was enough
for me it was enough
to live for the hope of it all
cancel plans just in case youd call
and say meet me behind the mall
so much for summer love and saying us
cause you werent mine to lose
you werent mine to lose no

chorus
cause i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
you were never mine

outro
you were never mine
never mine
do you remember
remember when i pulled up and said get in the car
and then canceled my plans just in case youd call
back when i was livin for the hope of it all for the hope of it all
meet me behind the mall
and then i canceled my plans just in case youd call
back when i was livin for the hope of it all hope of it all
remember when i pulled up and said get in the car
and then canceled my plans just in case youd call
back when i was livin for the hope of it all for the hope of it all
meet me behind the mall
