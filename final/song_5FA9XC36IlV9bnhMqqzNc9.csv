i woke up in japan
feeling low feeling lonely
the best i ever had
it was more than half empty
i woke up in japan
feeling low feeling lonely
the best i ever had
it was more than half empty

verse 1 luke
it was more than just a neon weekend
light slipping through the third floor curtain
spreading love like the morning news
from the day before

prechorus all
falling fast breathing slow
time is up the end is just a dream
just a dream

chorus luke
i woke up in japan
feeling low feeling lonely
the best i ever had
it was more than half empty

its enough to let the night let go of me
a few steps into the open doorway
heart pounding theres a noise complaint
from room 304

prechorus all
falling fast breathing slow
time is up the end is just a dream
just a dream

i woke up in japan
feeling low feeling lonely
the best i ever had
