think i unraveled my mind
i dropped a mouse into the sink just to watch it climb out
then took it to the woods and said youre free
youll be living like this for awhile now
youre free
for awhile now at least

you say cupid i say comet
you say wallace i say gromit
you brought it back when i said
you promised to just call the whole thing off please
you stay needy i stay friendless
you stay pristine i stay pretentious
wed get married but its too expensive
lets call the whole thing off please
oh my god
this aint a happening to me
and its all your fault
said by popular decree
possum queen by law shes been building up estates in east la

is this your first time thats sweet
say hello to lookingforward for me
if i could set your mind at ease
this will last forever
and when it doesnt love it for what it is
dont miss it the way i do
the way i used to
if you love it love it for what its been
dont miss it
dont wish it back
dont wish itd last cause if it doesnt
love it for what it is
dont miss it the way i do
dont miss it
dont miss it the way i miss youyou might also likeembed"
