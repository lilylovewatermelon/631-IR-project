all my life you know i havent been very love strong
theres been so many fights that ive fought and ive never won
so i decided that i should just give up on trying to right your wrongs
and word on the street is that she did to you what you did to me

chorus
5 4 3 2 1
bang bang bang boy
youre going down down down boy
to the ground where you left my heart to bleed
bang she shot you karma tastes so
bang bang bang boy
youre going down down down boy
to the ground where you left my heart to bleed
bang she shot you karma tastes so sweet

verse 2
so unfortunately for girls like me there are more like you
bending and breaking the rules and were making exceptions too
but how does it feel to swim in your own tears
you lied and you lied and i died and i died and now you know why

chorus
5 4 3 2 1
bang bang bang boy
youre going down down down boy
to the ground where you left my heart to bleed
bang she shot you karma tastes so
bang bang bang boy
youre going down down down boy
to the ground where you left my heart to bleed
bang she shot you karma tastes so sweet
bang bang bang boy
youre going down down down boy
to the ground where you left my heart to bleed
bang she shot you karma tastes so
bang bang bang boy
youre going down down down boy
to the ground where you left my heart to bleed
bang she shot you karma tastes so

bang bang bang boy
youre going down
to the ground
