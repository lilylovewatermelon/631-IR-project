gilbert
my dear ernest what are you laughing at

ernest
at a capital story that i have just come across in this volume of reminiscences that i have found on your table

gilbert
what is the book ah i see i have not read it yet is it good

ernest
well while you have been playing i have been turning over the pages with some amusement though as a rule i dislike modern memoirs they are generally writtеn by people who have еither entirely lost their memories or have never done anything worth remembering which however is no doubt the true explanation of their popularity as the english public always feels perfectly at its ease when a mediocrity is talking to it

gilbert
yes the public is wonderfully tolerant it forgives everything except genius but i must confess that i like all memoirs i like them for their form just as much as for their matter in literature mere egotism is delightful it is what fascinates us in the letters of personalities so different as cicero and balzac flaubert and berlioz byron and madame de sévigné whenever we come across it and strangely enough it is rather rare we cannot but welcome it and do not easily forget it humanity will always love rousseau for having confessed his sins not to a priest but to the world and the couchant nymphs that cellini wrought in bronze for the castle of king francis the green and gold perseus even that in the open loggia at florence shows the moon the dead terror that once turned life to stone have not given it more pleasure than has that autobiography in which the supreme scoundrel of the renaissance relates the story of his splendour and his shame the opinions the character the achievements of the man matter very little he may be a sceptic like the gentle sieur de montaigne or a saint like the bitter son of monica but when he tells us his own secrets he can always charm our ears to listening and our lips to silence the mode of thought that cardinal newman represented—if that can be called a mode of thought which seeks to solve intellectual problems by a denial of the supremacy of the intellect—may not cannot i think survive but the world will never weary of watching that troubled soul in its progress from darkness to darkness the lonely church at littlemore where ‘the breath of the morning is damp and worshippers are few’ will always be dear to it and whenever men see the yellow snapdragon blossoming on the wall of trinity they will think of that gracious undergraduate who saw in the flower’s sure recurrence a prophecy that he would abide for ever with the benign mother of his days—a prophecy that faith in her wisdom or her folly suffered not to be fulfilled yes autobiography is irresistible poor silly conceited mr secretary pepys has chattered his way into the circle of the immortals and conscious that indiscretion is the better part of valour bustles about among them in that ‘shaggy purple gown with gold buttons and looped lace’ which he is so fond of describing to us perfectly at his ease and prattling to his own and our infinite pleasure of the indian blue petticoat that he bought for his wife of the ‘good hog’s harslet’ and the ‘pleasant french fricassee of veal’ that he loved to eat of his game of bowls with will joyce and his ‘gadding after beauties’ and his reciting of hamlet on a sunday and his playing of the viol on week days and other wicked or trivial things even in actual life egotism is not without its attractions when people talk to us about others they are usually dull when they talk to us about themselves they are nearly always interesting and if one could shut them up when they become wearisome as easily as one can shut up a book of which one has grown wearied they would be perfect absolutely

ernest
there is much virtue in that if as touchstone would say but do you seriously propose that every man should become his own boswell what would become of our industrious compilers of lives and recollections in that case

gilbert
what has become of them they are the pest of the age nothing more and nothing less every great man nowadays has his disciples and it is always judas who writes the biography

ernest
my dear fellow
gilbert
i am afraid it is true formerly we used to canonise our heroes the modern method is to vulgarise them cheap editions of great books may be delightful but cheap editions of great men are absolutely detestable

ernest
may i ask gilbert to whom you allude

gilbert
oh to all our secondrate littérateurs we are overrun by a set of people who when poet or painter passes away arrive at the house along with the undertaker and forget that their one duty is to behave as mutes but we won’t talk about them they are the mere bodysnatchers of literature the dust is given to one and the ashes to another and the soul is out of their reach and now let me play chopin to you or dvorák shall i play you a fantasy by dvorák he writes passionate curiouslycoloured things

ernest
no i don’t want music just at present it is far too indefinite besides i took the baroness bernstein down to dinner last night and though absolutely charming in every other respect she insisted on discussing music as if it were actually written in the german language now whatever music sounds like i am glad to say that it does not sound in the smallest degree like german there are forms of patriotism that are really quite degrading no gilbert don’t play any more turn round and talk to me talk to me till the whitehorned day comes into the room there is something in your voice that is wonderful

gilbert
i am not in a mood for talking tonight i really am not how horrid of you to smile where are the cigarettes thanks how exquisite these single daffodils are they seem to be made of amber and cool ivory they are like greek things of the best period what was the story in the confessions of the remorseful academician that made you laugh tell it to me after playing chopin i feel as if i had been weeping over sins that i had never committed and mourning over tragedies that were not my own music always seems to me to produce that effect it creates for one a past of which one has been ignorant and fills one with a sense of sorrows that have been hidden from one’s tears i can fancy a man who had led a perfectly commonplace life hearing by chance some curious piece of music and suddenly discovering that his soul without his being conscious of it had passed through terrible experiences and known fearful joys or wild romantic loves or great renunciations and so tell me this story ernest i want to be amused

ernest
oh i don’t know that it is of any importance but i thought it a really admirable illustration of the true value of ordinary artcriticism it seems that a lady once gravely asked the remorseful academician as you call him if his celebrated picture of ‘a springday at whiteley’s’ or ‘waiting for the last omnibus’ or some subject of that kind was all painted by hand

gilbert
and was it

ernest
you are quite incorrigible but seriously speaking what is the use of artcriticism why cannot the artist be left alone to create a new world if he wishes it or if not to shadow forth the world which we already know and of which i fancy we would each one of us be wearied if art with her fine spirit of choice and delicate instinct of selection did not as it were purify it for us and give to it a momentary perfection it seems to me that the imagination spreads or should spread a solitude around it and works best in silence and in isolation why should the artist be troubled by the shrill clamour of criticism why should those who cannot create take upon themselves to estimate the value of creative work what can they know about it if a man’s work is easy to understand an explanation is unnecessary

gilbert
and if his work is incomprehensible an explanation is wicked
ernest
i did not say that

gilbert
ah but you should have nowadays we have so few mysteries left to us that we cannot afford to part with one of them the members of the browning society like the theologians of the broad church party or the authors of mr walter scott’s great writers series seem to me to spend their time in trying to explain their divinity away where one had hoped that browning was a mystic they have sought to show that he was simply inarticulate where one had fancied that he had something to conceal they have proved that he had but little to reveal but i speak merely of his incoherent work taken as a whole the man was great he did not belong to the olympians and had all the incompleteness of the titan he did not survey and it was but rarely that he could sing his work is marred by struggle violence and effort and he passed not from emotion to form but from thought to chaos still he was great he has been called a thinker and was certainly a man who was always thinking and always thinking aloud but it was not thought that fascinated him but rather the processes by which thought moves it was the machine he loved not what the machine makes the method by which the fool arrives at his folly was as dear to him as the ultimate wisdom of the wise so much indeed did the subtle mechanism of mind fascinate him that he despised language or looked upon it as an incomplete instrument of expression rhyme that exquisite echo which in the muse’s hollow hill creates and answers its own voice rhyme which in the hands of the real artist becomes not merely a material element of metrical beauty but a spiritual element of thought and passion also waking a new mood it may be or stirring a fresh train of ideas or opening by mere sweetness and suggestion of sound some golden door at which the imagination itself had knocked in vain rhyme which can turn man’s utterance to the speech of gods rhyme the one chord we have added to the greek lyre became in robert browning’s hands a grotesque misshapen thing which at times made him masquerade in poetry as a low comedian and ride pegasus too often with his tongue in his cheek there are moments when he wounds us by monstrous music nay if he can only get his music by breaking the strings of his lute he breaks them and they snap in discord and no athenian tettix making melody from tremulous wings lights on the ivory horn to make the movement perfect or the interval less harsh yet he was great and though he turned language into ignoble clay he made from it men and women that live he is the most shakespearian creature since shakespeare if shakespeare could sing with myriad lips browning could stammer through a thousand mouths even now as i am speaking and speaking not against him but for him there glides through the room the pageant of his persons there creeps fra lippo lippi with his cheeks still burning from some girl’s hot kiss there stands dread saul with the lordly malesapphires gleaming in his turban mildred tresham is there and the spanish monk yellow with hatred and blougram and ben ezra and the bishop of st praxed’s the spawn of setebos gibbers in the corner and sebald hearing pippa pass by looks on ottima’s haggard face and loathes her and his own sin and himself pale as the white satin of his doublet the melancholy king watches with dreamy treacherous eyes too loyal strafford pass forth to his doom and andrea shudders as he hears the cousins whistle in the garden and bids his perfect wife go down yes browning was great and as what will he be remembered as a poet ah not as a poet he will be remembered as a writer of fiction as the most supreme writer of fiction it may be that we have ever had his sense of dramatic situation was unrivalled and if he could not answer his own problems he could at least put problems forth and what more should an artist do considered from the point of view of a creator of character he ranks next to him who made hamlet had he been articulate he might have sat beside him the only man who can touch the hem of his garment is george meredith meredith is a prose browning and so is browning he used poetry as a medium for writing in prose

ernest
there is something in what you say but there is not everything in what you say in many points you are unjust

gilbert
it is difficult not to be unjust to what one loves but let us return to the particular point at issue what was it that you said

ernest
simply this that in the best days of art there were no artcritics

gilbert
i seem to have heard that observation before ernest it has all the vitality of error and all the tediousness of an old friend

ernest
it is true yes there is no use your tossing your head in that petulant manner it is quite true in the best days of art there were no artcritics the sculptor hewed from the marble block the great whitelimbed hermes that slept within it the waxers and gilders of images gave tone and texture to the statue and the world when it saw it worshipped and was dumb he poured the glowing bronze into the mould of sand and the river of red metal cooled into noble curves and took the impress of the body of a god

with enamel or polished jewels he gave sight to the sightless eyes the hyacinthlike curls grew crisp beneath his graver and when in some dim frescoed fane or pillared sunlit portico the child of leto stood upon his pedestal those who passed by δια λαμπροτατου βαινοντες αβρως αιθερος became conscious of a new influence that had come across their lives and dreamily or with a sense of strange and quickening joy went to their homes or daily labour or wandered it may be through the city gates to that nymphhaunted meadow where young phaedrus bathed his feet and lying there on the soft grass beneath the tall wind—whispering planes and flowering agnus castus began to think of the wonder of beauty and grew silent with unaccustomed awe in those days the artist was free from the river valley he took the fine clay in his fingers and with a little tool of wood or bone fashioned it into forms so exquisite that the people gave them to the dead as their playthings and we find them still in the dusty tombs on the yellow hillside by tanagra with the faint gold and the fading crimson still lingering about hair and lips and raiment on a wall of fresh plaster stained with bright sandyx or mixed with milk and saffron he pictured one who trod with tired feet the purple whitestarred fields of asphodel one ‘in whose eyelids lay the whole of the trojan war’ polyxena the daughter of priam or figured odysseus the wise and cunning bound by tight cords to the maststep that he might listen without hurt to the singing of the sirens or wandering by the clear river of acheron where the ghosts of fishes flitted over the pebbly bed or showed the persian in trews and mitre flying before the greek at marathon or the galleys clashing their beaks of brass in the little salaminian bay he drew with silverpoint and charcoal upon parchment and prepared cedar upon ivory and rosecoloured terracotta he painted with wax making the wax fluid with juice of olives and with heated irons making it firm panel and marble and linen canvas became wonderful as his brush swept across them and life seeing her own image was still and dared not speak all life indeed was his from the merchants seated in the marketplace to the cloaked shepherd lying on the hill from the nymph hidden in the laurels and the faun that pipes at noon to the king whom in long greencurtained litter slaves bore upon oilbright shoulders and fanned with peacock fans men and women with pleasure or sorrow in their faces passed before him he watched them and their secret became his through form and colour he recreated a world

all subtle arts belonged to him also he held the gem against the revolving disk and the amethyst became the purple couch for adonis and across the veined sardonyx sped artemis with her hounds he beat out the gold into roses and strung them together for necklace or armlet he beat out the gold into wreaths for the conqueror’s helmet or into palmates for the tyrian robe or into masks for the royal dead on the back of the silver mirror he graved thetis borne by her nereids or lovesick phaedra with her nurse or persephone weary of memory putting poppies in her hair the potter sat in his shed and flowerlike from the silent wheel the vase rose up beneath his hands he decorated the base and stem and ears with pattern of dainty oliveleaf or foliated acanthus or curved and crested wave

then in black or red he painted lads wrestling or in the race knights in full armour with strange heraldic shields and curious visors leaning from shellshaped chariot over rearing steeds the gods seated at the feast or working their miracles the heroes in their victory or in their pain sometimes he would etch in thin vermilion lines upon a ground of white the languid bridegroom and his bride with eros hovering round them—an eros like one of donatello’s angels a little laughing thing with gilded or with azure wings on the curved side he would write the name of his friend καλος αλκιβιαδης or καλος χαρμιδης tells us the story of his days again on the rim of the wide flat cup he would draw the stag browsing or the lion at rest as his fancy willed it from the tiny perfumebottle laughed aphrodite at her toilet and with barelimbed maenads in his train dionysus danced round the winejar on naked muststained feet while satyrlike the old silenus sprawled upon the bloated skins or shook that magic spear which was tipped with a fretted fircone and wreathed with dark ivy and no one came to trouble the artist at his work no irresponsible chatter disturbed him he was not worried by opinions by the ilyssus says arnold somewhere there was no higginbotham by the ilyssus my dear gilbert there were no silly art congresses bringing provincialism to the provinces and teaching the mediocrity how to mouth by the ilyssus there were no tedious magazines about art in which the industrious prattle of what they do not understand on the reedgrown banks of that little stream strutted no ridiculous journalism monopolising the seat of judgment when it should be apologising in the dock the greeks had no artcritics
gilbert
ernest you are quite delightful but your views are terribly unsound i am afraid that you have been listening to the conversation of some one older than yourself that is always a dangerous thing to do and if you allow it to degenerate into a habit you will find it absolutely fatal to any intellectual development as for modern journalism it is not my business to defend it it justifies its own existence by the great darwinian principle of the survival of the vulgarest i have merely to do with literature

ernest
but what is the difference between literature and journalism

gilbert
oh journalism is unreadable and literature is not read that is all but with regard to your statement that the greeks had no artcritics i assure you that is quite absurd it would be more just to say that the greeks were a nation of artcritics

ernest
really

gilbert
yes a nation of artcritics but i don’t wish to destroy the delightfully unreal picture that you have drawn of the relation of the hellenic artist to the intellectual spirit of his age to give an accurate description of what has never occurred is not merely the proper occupation of the historian but the inalienable privilege of any man of parts and culture still less do i desire to talk learnedly learned conversation is either the affectation of the ignorant or the profession of the mentally unemployed and as for what is called improving conversation that is merely the foolish method by which the still more foolish philanthropist feebly tries to disarm the just rancour of the criminal classes no let me play to you some mad scarlet thing by dvorák

the pallid figures on the tapestry are smiling at us and the heavy eyelids of my bronze narcissus are folded in sleep don’t let us discuss anything solemnly i am but too conscious of the fact that we are born in an age when only the dull are treated seriously and i live in terror of not being misunderstood don’t degrade me into the position of giving you useful information education is an admirable thing but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught through the parted curtains of the window i see the moon like a clipped piece of silver like gilded bees the stars cluster round her the sky is a hard hollow sapphire let us go out into the night thought is wonderful but adventure is more wonderful still who knows but we may meet prince florizel of bohemia and hear the fair cuban tell us that she is not what she seems

ernest
you are horribly wilful i insist on your discussing this matter with me you have said that the greeks were a nation of artcritics what artcriticism have they left us

gilbert
my dear ernest even if not a single fragment of artcriticism had come down to us from hellenic or hellenistic days it would be none the less true that the greeks were a nation of artcritics and that they invented the criticism of art just as they invented the criticism of everything else for after all what is our primary debt to the greeks simply the critical spirit and this spirit which they exercised on questions of religion and science of ethics and metaphysics of politics and education they exercised on questions of art also and indeed of the two supreme and highest arts they have left us the most flawless system of criticism that the world has ever seen

ernest
but what are the two supreme and highest arts

gilbert
life and literature life and the perfect expression of life the principles of the former as laid down by the greeks we may not realise in an age so marred by false ideals as our own the principles of the latter as they laid them down are in many cases so subtle that we can hardly understand them recognising that the most perfect art is that which most fully mirrors man in all his infinite variety they elaborated the criticism of language considered in the light of the mere material of that art to a point to which we with our accentual system of reasonable or emotional emphasis can barely if at all attain studying for instance the metrical movements of a prose as scientifically as a modern musician studies harmony and counterpoint and i need hardly say with much keener aesthetic instinct in this they were right as they were right in all things since the introduction of printing and the fatal development of the habit of reading amongst the middle and lower classes of this country there has been a tendency in literature to appeal more and more to the eye and less and less to the ear which is really the sense which from the standpoint of pure art it should seek to please and by whose canons of pleasure it should abide always even the work of mr pater who is on the whole the most perfect master of english prose now creating amongst us is often far more like a piece of mosaic than a passage in music and seems here and there to lack the true rhythmical life of words and the fine freedom and richness of effect that such rhythmical life produces

we in fact have made writing a definite mode of composition and have treated it as a form of elaborate design the greeks upon the other hand regarded writing simply as a method of chronicling their test was always the spoken word in its musical and metrical relations the voice was the medium and the ear the critic i have sometimes thought that the story of homer’s blindness might be really an artistic myth created in critical days and serving to remind us not merely that the great poet is always a seer seeing less with the eyes of the body than he does with the eyes of the soul but that he is a true singer also building his song out of music repeating each line over and over again to himself till he has caught the secret of its melody chaunting in darkness the words that are winged with light certainly whether this be so or not it was to his blindness as an occasion if not as a cause that england’s great poet owed much of the majestic movement and sonorous splendour of his later verse when milton could no longer write he began to sing who would match the measures of comus with the measures of samson agonistes or of paradise lost or regained when milton became blind he composed as every one should compose with the voice purely and so the pipe or reed of earlier days became that mighty manystopped organ whose rich reverberant music has all the stateliness of homeric verse if it seeks not to have its swiftness and is the one imperishable inheritance of english literature sweeping through all the ages because above them and abiding with us ever being immortal in its form yes writing has done much harm to writers we must return to the voice that must be our test and perhaps then we shall be able to appreciate some of the subtleties of greek artcriticism

as it now is we cannot do so sometimes when i have written a piece of prose that i have been modest enough to consider absolutely free from fault a dreadful thought comes over me that i may have been guilty of the immoral effeminacy of using trochaic and tribrachic movements a crime for which a learned critic of the augustan age censures with most just severity the brilliant if somewhat paradoxical hegesias i grow cold when i think of it and wonder to myself if the admirable ethical effect of the prose of that charming writer who once in a spirit of reckless generosity towards the uncultivated portion of our community proclaimed the monstrous doctrine that conduct is threefourths of life will not some day be entirely annihilated by the discovery that the paeons have been wrongly placed

ernest
ah now you are flippant

gilbert
who would not be flippant when he is gravely told that the greeks had no artcritics i can understand it being said that the constructive genius of the greeks lost itself in criticism but not that the race to whom we owe the critical spirit did not criticise you will not ask me to give you a survey of greek art criticism from plato to plotinus the night is too lovely for that and the moon if she heard us would put more ashes on her face than are there already but think merely of one perfect little work of aesthetic criticism aristotle’s treatise on poetry it is not perfect in form for it is badly written consisting perhaps of notes dotted down for an art lecture or of isolated fragments destined for some larger book but in temper and treatment it is perfect absolutely

the ethical effect of art its importance to culture and its place in the formation of character had been done once for all by plato but here we have art treated not from the moral but from the purely aesthetic point of view plato had of course dealt with many definitely artistic subjects such as the importance of unity in a work of art the necessity for tone and harmony the aesthetic value of appearances the relation of the visible arts to the external world and the relation of fiction to fact he first perhaps stirred in the soul of man that desire that we have not yet satisfied the desire to know the connection between beauty and truth and the place of beauty in the moral and intellectual order of the kosmos the problems of idealism and realism as he sets them forth may seem to many to be somewhat barren of result in the metaphysical sphere of abstract being in which he places them but transfer them to the sphere of art and you will find that they are still vital and full of meaning it may be that it is as a critic of beauty that plato is destined to live and that by altering the name of the sphere of his speculation we shall find a new philosophy but aristotle like goethe deals with art primarily in its concrete manifestations taking tragedy for instance and investigating the material it uses which is language its subjectmatter which is life the method by which it works which is action the conditions under which it reveals itself which are those of theatric presentation its logical structure which is plot and its final aesthetic appeal which is to the sense of beauty realised through the passions of pity and awe that purification and spiritualising of the nature which he calls καθαρσις is as goethe saw essentially aesthetic and is not moral as lessing fancied concerning himself primarily with the impression that the work of art produces aristotle sets himself to analyse that impression to investigate its source to see how it is engendered as a physiologist and psychologist he knows that the health of a function resides in energy to have a capacity for a passion and not to realise it is to make oneself incomplete and limited the mimic spectacle of life that tragedy affords cleanses the bosom of much ‘perilous stuff’ and by presenting high and worthy objects for the exercise of the emotions purifies and spiritualises the man nay not merely does it spiritualise him but it initiates him also into noble feelings of which he might else have known nothing the word καθαρσις having it has sometimes seemed to me a definite allusion to the rite of initiation if indeed that be not as i am occasionally tempted to fancy its true and only meaning here this is of course a mere outline of the book but you see what a perfect piece of aesthetic criticism it is who indeed but a greek could have analysed art so well after reading it one does not wonder any longer that alexandria devoted itself so largely to artcriticism and that we find the artistic temperaments of the day investigating every question of style and manner discussing the great academic schools of painting for instance such as the school of sicyon that sought to preserve the dignified traditions of the antique mode or the realistic and impressionist schools that aimed at reproducing actual life or the elements of ideality in portraiture or the artistic value of the epic form in an age so modern as theirs or the proper subjectmatter for the artist

indeed i fear that the inartistic temperaments of the day busied themselves also in matters of literature and art for the accusations of plagiarism were endless and such accusations proceed either from the thin colourless lips of impotence or from the grotesque mouths of those who possessing nothing of their own fancy that they can gain a reputation for wealth by crying out that they have been robbed and i assure you my dear ernest that the greeks chattered about painters quite as much as people do nowadays and had their private views and shilling exhibitions and arts and crafts guilds and preraphaelite movements and movements towards realism and lectured about art and wrote essays on art and produced their arthistorians and their archaeologists and all the rest of it why even the theatrical managers of travelling companies brought their dramatic critics with them when they went on tour and paid them very handsome salaries for writing laudatory notices whatever in fact is modern in our life we owe to the greeks whatever is an anachronism is due to mediaevalism it is the greeks who have given us the whole system of artcriticism and how fine their critical instinct was may be seen from the fact that the material they criticised with most care was as i have already said language for the material that painter or sculptor uses is meagre in comparison with that of words words have not merely music as sweet as that of viol and lute colour as rich and vivid as any that makes lovely for us the canvas of the venetian or the spaniard and plastic form no less sure and certain than that which reveals itself in marble or in bronze but thought and passion and spirituality are theirs also are theirs indeed alone if the greeks had criticised nothing but language they would still have been the great artcritics of the world to know the principles of the highest art is to know the principles of all the arts

but i see that the moon is hiding behind a sulphurcoloured cloud out of a tawny mane of drift she gleams like a lion’s eye she is afraid that i will talk to you of lucian and longinus of quinctilian and dionysius of pliny and fronto and pausanias of all those who in the antique world wrote or lectured upon art matters she need not be afraid i am tired of my expedition into the dim dull abyss of facts there is nothing left for me now but the divine μονοχρονος ηδονη of another cigarette cigarettes have at least the charm of leaving one unsatisfied

ernest
try one of mine they are rather good i get them direct from cairo the only use of our attachés is that they supply their friends with excellent tobacco and as the moon has hidden herself let us talk a little longer i am quite ready to admit that i was wrong in what i said about the greeks they were as you have pointed out a nation of artcritics i acknowledge it and i feel a little sorry for them for the creative faculty is higher than the critical there is really no comparison between them

gilbert
the antithesis between them is entirely arbitrary without the critical faculty there is no artistic creation at all worthy of the name you spoke a little while ago of that fine spirit of choice and delicate instinct of selection by which the artist realises life for us and gives to it a momentary perfection well that spirit of choice that subtle tact of omission is really the critical faculty in one of its most characteristic moods and no one who does not possess this critical faculty can create anything at all in art arnold’s definition of literature as a criticism of life was not very felicitous in form but it showed how keenly he recognised the importance of the critical element in all creative work

ernest
i should have said that great artists work unconsciously that they were ‘wiser than they knew’ as i think emerson remarks somewhere

gilbert
it is really not so ernest all fine imaginative work is selfconscious and deliberate no poet sings because he must sing at least no great poet does a great poet sings because he chooses to sing it is so now and it has always been so we are sometimes apt to think that the voices that sounded at the dawn of poetry were simpler fresher and more natural than ours and that the world which the early poets looked at and through which they walked had a kind of poetical quality of its own and almost without changing could pass into song the snow lies thick now upon olympus and its steep scarped sides are bleak and barren but once we fancy the white feet of the muses brushed the dew from the anemones in the morning and at evening came apollo to sing to the shepherds in the vale but in this we are merely lending to other ages what we desire or think we desire for our own our historical sense is at fault every century that produces poetry is so far an artificial century and the work that seems to us to be the most natural and simple product of its time is always the result of the most selfconscious effort believe me ernest there is no fine art without selfconsciousness and selfconsciousness and the critical spirit are one

ernest
i see what you mean and there is much in it but surely you would admit that the great poems of the early world the primitive anonymous collective poems were the result of the imagination of races rather than of the imagination of individuals

gilbert
not when they became poetry not when they received a beautiful form for there is no art where there is no style and no style where there is no unity and unity is of the individual no doubt homer had old ballads and stories to deal with as shakespeare had chronicles and plays and novels from which to work but they were merely his rough material he took them and shaped them into song they become his because he made them lovely they were built out of music and so not built at all and therefore built for ever

the longer one studies life and literature the more strongly one feels that behind everything that is wonderful stands the individual and that it is not the moment that makes the man but the man who creates the age indeed i am inclined to think that each myth and legend that seems to us to spring out of the wonder or terror or fancy of tribe and nation was in its origin the invention of one single mind the curiously limited number of the myths seems to me to point to this conclusion but we must not go off into questions of comparative mythology we must keep to criticism and what i want to point out is this an age that has no criticism is either an age in which art is immobile hieratic and confined to the reproduction of formal types or an age that possesses no art at all

there have been critical ages that have not been creative in the ordinary sense of the word ages in which the spirit of man has sought to set in order the treasures of his treasurehouse to separate the gold from the silver and the silver from the lead to count over the jewels and to give names to the pearls but there has never been a creative age that has not been critical also for it is the critical faculty that invents fresh forms the tendency of creation is to repeat itself it is to the critical instinct that we owe each new school that springs up each new mould that art finds ready to its hand there is really not a single form that art now uses that does not come to us from the critical spirit of alexandria where these forms were either stereotyped or invented or made perfect i say alexandria not merely because it was there that the greek spirit became most selfconscious and indeed ultimately expired in scepticism and theology but because it was to that city and not to athens that rome turned for her models and it was through the survival such as it was of the latin language that culture lived at all when at the renaissance greek literature dawned upon europe the soil had been in some measure prepared for it but to get rid of the details of history which are always wearisome and usually inaccurate let us say generally that the forms of art have been due to the greek critical spirit to it we owe the epic the lyric the entire drama in every one of its developments including burlesque the idyll the romantic novel the novel of adventure the essay the dialogue the oration the lecture for which perhaps we should not forgive them and the epigram in all the wide meaning of that word in fact we owe it everything except the sonnet to which however some curious parallels of thoughtmovement may be traced in the anthology american journalism to which no parallel can be found anywhere and the ballad in sham scotch dialect which one of our most industrious writers has recently proposed should be made the basis for a final and unanimous effort on the part of our secondrate poets to make themselves really romantic each new school as it appears cries out against criticism but it is to the critical faculty in man that it owes its origin the mere creative instinct does not innovate but reproduces

ernest
you have been talking of criticism as an essential part of the creative spirit and i now fully accept your theory but what of criticism outside creation i have a foolish habit of reading periodicals and it seems to me that most modern criticism is perfectly valueless

gilbert
so is most modern creative work also mediocrity weighing mediocrity in the balance and incompetence applauding its brother—that is the spectacle which the artistic activity of england affords us from time to time and yet i feel i am a little unfair in this matter as a rule the critics—i speak of course of the higher class of those in fact who write for the sixpenny papers—are far more cultured than the people whose work they are called upon to review this is indeed only what one would expect for criticism demands infinitely more cultivation than creation does

ernest

certainly anybody can write a threevolumed novel it merely requires a complete ignorance of both life and literature the difficulty that i should fancy the reviewer feels is the difficulty of sustaining any standard where there is no style a standard must be impossible the poor reviewers are apparently reduced to be the reporters of the policecourt of literature the chroniclers of the doings of the habitual criminals of art it is sometimes said of them that they do not read all through the works they are called upon to criticise they do not or at least they should not if they did so they would become confirmed misanthropes or if i may borrow a phrase from one of the pretty newnham graduates confirmed womanthropes for the rest of their lives nor is it necessary to know the vintage and quality of a wine one need not drink the whole cask it must be perfectly easy in half an hour to say whether a book is worth anything or worth nothing ten minutes are really sufficient if one has the instinct for form who wants to wade through a dull volume one tastes it and that is quite enough—more than enough i should imagine i am aware that there are many honest workers in painting as well as in literature who object to criticism entirely they are quite right their work stands in no intellectual relation to their age it brings us no new element of pleasure it suggests no fresh departure of thought or passion or beauty it should not be spoken of it should be left to the oblivion that it deserves

ernest
but my dear fellow—excuse me for interrupting you—you seem to me to be allowing your passion for criticism to lead you a great deal too far for after all even you must admit that it is much more difficult to do a thing than to talk about it

gilbert
more difficult to do a thing than to talk about it not at all that is a gross popular error it is very much more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it in the sphere of actual life that is of course obvious anybody can make history only a great man can write it there is no mode of action no form of emotion that we do not share with the lower animals it is only by language that we rise above them or above each other—by language which is the parent and not the child of thought action indeed is always easy and when presented to us in its most aggravated because most continuous form which i take to be that of real industry becomes simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatsoever to do no ernest don’t talk about action it is a blind thing dependent on external influences and moved by an impulse of whose nature it is unconscious it is a thing incomplete in its essence because limited by accident and ignorant of its direction being always at variance with its aim its basis is the lack of imagination it is the last resource of those who know not how to dream

ernest
gilbert you treat the world as if it were a crystal ball you hold it in your hand and reverse it to please a wilful fancy you do nothing but rewrite history

gilbert
the one duty we owe to history is to rewrite it that is not the least of the tasks in store for the critical spirit when we have fully discovered the scientific laws that govern life we shall realise that the one person who has more illusions than the dreamer is the man of action he indeed knows neither the origin of his deeds nor their results from the field in which he thought that he had sown thorns we have gathered our vintage and the figtree that he planted for our pleasure is as barren as the thistle and more bitter it is because humanity has never known where it was going that it has been able to find its way

ernest
you think then that in the sphere of action a conscious aim is a delusion

gilbert
it is worse than a delusion if we lived long enough to see the results of our actions it may be that those who call themselves good would be sickened with a dull remorse and those whom the world calls evil stirred by a noble joy each little thing that we do passes into the great machine of life which may grind our virtues to powder and make them worthless or transform our sins into elements of a new civilisation more marvellous and more splendid than any that has gone before but men are the slaves of words they rage against materialism as they call it forgetting that there has been no material improvement that has not spiritualised the world and that there have been few if any spiritual awakenings that have not wasted the world’s faculties in barren hopes and fruitless aspirations and empty or trammelling creeds what is termed sin is an essential element of progress without it the world would stagnate or grow old or become colourless by its curiosity sin increases the experience of the race through its intensified assertion of individualism it saves us from monotony of type in its rejection of the current notions about morality it is one with the higher ethics and as for the virtues what are the virtues nature m renan tells us cares little about chastity and it may be that it is to the shame of the magdalen and not to their own purity that the lucretias of modern life owe their freedom from stain charity as even those of whose religion it makes a formal part have been compelled to acknowledge creates a multitude of evils the mere existence of conscience that faculty of which people prate so much nowadays and are so ignorantly proud is a sign of our imperfect development it must be merged in instinct before we become fine selfdenial is simply a method by which man arrests his progress and selfsacrifice a survival of the mutilation of the savage part of that old worship of pain which is so terrible a factor in the history of the world and which even now makes its victims day by day and has its altars in the land virtues who knows what the virtues are not you not i not any one it is well for our vanity that we slay the criminal for if we suffered him to live he might show us what we had gained by his crime it is well for his peace that the saint goes to his martyrdom he is spared the sight of the horror of his harvest

ernest
gilbert you sound too harsh a note let us go back to the more gracious fields of literature what was it you said that it was more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it

gilbert
yes i believe i ventured upon that simple truth surely you see now that i am right when man acts he is a puppet when he describes he is a poet the whole secret lies in that it was easy enough on the sandy plains by windy ilion to send the notched arrow from the painted bow or to hurl against the shield of hide and flamelike brass the long ashhandled spear it was easy for the adulterous queen to spread the tyrian carpets for her lord and then as he lay couched in the marble bath to throw over his head the purple net and call to her smoothfaced lover to stab through the meshes at the heart that should have broken at aulis

for antigone even with death waiting for her as her bridegroom it was easy to pass through the tainted air at noon and climb the hill and strew with kindly earth the wretched naked corse that had no tomb but what of those who wrote about these things what of those who gave them reality and made them live for ever are they not greater than the men and women they sing of ‘hector that sweet knight is dead’ and lucian tells us how in the dim underworld menippus saw the bleaching skull of helen and marvelled that it was for so grim a favour that all those horned ships were launched those beautiful mailed men laid low those towered cities brought to dust yet every day the swanlike daughter of leda comes out on the battlements and looks down at the tide of war the greybeards wonder at her loveliness and she stands by the side of the king in his chamber of stained ivory lies her leman he is polishing his dainty armour and combing the scarlet plume with squire and page her husband passes from tent to tent she can see his bright hair and hears or fancies that she hears that clear cold voice in the courtyard below the son of priam is buckling on his brazen cuirass the white arms of andromache are around his neck he sets his helmet on the ground lest their babe should be frightened behind the embroidered curtains of his pavilion sits achilles in perfumed raiment while in harness of gilt and silver the friend of his soul arrays himself to go forth to the fight from a curiously carven chest that his mother thetis had brought to his shipside the lord of the myrmidons takes out that mystic chalice that the lip of man had never touched and cleanses it with brimstone and with fresh water cools it and having washed his hands fills with black wine its burnished hollow and spills the thick grapeblood upon the ground in honour of him whom at dodona barefooted prophets worshipped and prays to him and knows not that he prays in vain and that by the hands of two knights from troy panthous’ son euphorbus whose lovelocks were looped with gold and the priamid the lionhearted patroklus the comrade of comrades must meet his doom phantoms are they heroes of mist and mountain shadows in a song no they are real action what is action it dies at the moment of its energy it is a base concession to fact the world is made by the singer for the dreamer

ernest
while you talk it seems to me to be so

gilbert
it is so in truth on the mouldering citadel of troy lies the lizard like a thing of green bronze the owl has built her nest in the palace of priam over the empty plain wander shepherd and goatherd with their flocks and where on the winesurfaced oily sea οινοψ ποντος as homer calls it copperprowed and streaked with vermilion the great galleys of the danaoi came in their gleaming crescent the lonely tunnyfisher sits in his little boat and watches the bobbing corks of his net yet every morning the doors of the city are thrown open and on foot or in horsedrawn chariot the warriors go forth to battle and mock their enemies from behind their iron masks all day long the fight rages and when night comes the torches gleam by the tents and the cresset burns in the hall those who live in marble or on painted panel know of life but a single exquisite instant eternal indeed in its beauty but limited to one note of passion or one mood of calm

those whom the poet makes live have their myriad emotions of joy and terror of courage and despair of pleasure and of suffering the seasons come and go in glad or saddening pageant and with winged or leaden feet the years pass by before them they have their youth and their manhood they are children and they grow old it is always dawn for st helena as veronese saw her at the window through the still morning air the angels bring her the symbol of god’s pain the cool breezes of the morning lift the gilt threads from her brow on that little hill by the city of florence where the lovers of giorgione are lying it is always the solstice of noon of noon made so languorous by summer suns that hardly can the slim naked girl dip into the marble tank the round bubble of clear glass and the long fingers of the luteplayer rest idly upon the chords it is twilight always for the dancing nymphs whom corot set free among the silver poplars of france in eternal twilight they move those frail diaphanous figures whose tremulous white feet seem not to touch the dewdrenched grass they tread on but those who walk in epos drama or romance see through the labouring months the young moons wax and wane and watch the night from evening unto morning star and from sunrise unto sunsetting can note the shifting day with all its gold and shadow for them as for us the flowers bloom and wither and the earth that greentressed goddess as coleridge calls her alters her raiment for their pleasure the statue is concentrated to one moment of perfection the image stained upon the canvas possesses no spiritual element of growth or change if they know nothing of death it is because they know little of life for the secrets of life and death belong to those and those only whom the sequence of time affects and who possess not merely the present but the future and can rise or fall from a past of glory or of shame movement that problem of the visible arts can be truly realised by literature alone it is literature that shows us the body in its swiftness and the soul in its unrest

ernest
yes i see now what you mean but surely the higher you place the creative artist the lower must the critic rank

gilbert
why so

ernest
because the best that he can give us will be but an echo of rich music a dim shadow of clearoutlined form it may indeed be that life is chaos as you tell me that it is that its martyrdoms are mean and its heroisms ignoble and that it is the function of literature to create from the rough material of actual existence a new world that will be more marvellous more enduring and more true than the world that common eyes look upon and through which common natures seek to realise their perfection but surely if this new world has been made by the spirit and touch of a great artist it will be a thing so complete and perfect that there will be nothing left for the critic to do i quite understand now and indeed admit most readily that it is far more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it but it seems to me that this sound and sensible maxim which is really extremely soothing to one’s feelings and should be adopted as its motto by every academy of literature all over the world applies only to the relations that exist between art and life and not to any relations that there may be between art and criticism

gilbert
but surely criticism is itself an art and just as artistic creation implies the working of the critical faculty and indeed without it cannot be said to exist at all so criticism is really creative in the highest sense of the word criticism is in fact both creative and independent

ernest
independent

gilbert
yes independent criticism is no more to be judged by any low standard of imitation or resemblance than is the work of poet or sculptor the critic occupies the same relation to the work of art that he criticises as the artist does to the visible world of form and colour or the unseen world of passion and of thought he does not even require for the perfection of his art the finest materials anything will serve his purpose and just as out of the sordid and sentimental amours of the silly wife of a small country doctor in the squalid village of yonvillel’abbaye near rouen gustave flaubert was able to create a classic and make a masterpiece of style so from subjects of little or of no importance such as the pictures in this year’s royal academy or in any year’s royal academy for that matter mr lewis morris’s poems m ohnet’s novels or the plays of mr henry arthur jones the true critic can if it be his pleasure so to direct or waste his faculty of contemplation produce work that will be flawless in beauty and instinct with intellectual subtlety why not dulness is always an irresistible temptation for brilliancy and stupidity is the permanent bestia trionfans that calls wisdom from its cave to an artist so creative as the critic what does subjectmatter signify no more and no less than it does to the novelist and the painter like them he can find his motives everywhere treatment is the test there is nothing that has not in it suggestion or challenge

ernest
but is criticism really a creative art

gilbert
why should it not be it works with materials and puts them into a form that is at once new and delightful what more can one say of poetry indeed i would call criticism a creation within a creation for just as the great artists from homer and aeschylus down to shakespeare and keats did not go directly to life for their subjectmatter but sought for it in myth and legend and ancient tale so the critic deals with materials that others have as it were purified for him and to which imaginative form and colour have been already added nay more i would say that the highest criticism being the purest form of personal impression is in its way more creative than creation as it has least reference to any standard external to itself and is in fact its own reason for existing and as the greeks would put it in itself and to itself an end certainly it is never trammelled by any shackles of verisimilitude no ignoble considerations of probability that cowardly concession to the tedious repetitions of domestic or public life affect it ever one may appeal from fiction unto fact but from the soul there is no appeal

ernest
from the soul

gilbert
yes from the soul that is what the highest criticism really is the record of one’s own soul it is more fascinating than history as it is concerned simply with oneself it is more delightful than philosophy as its subject is concrete and not abstract real and not vague it is the only civilised form of autobiography as it deals not with the events but with the thoughts of one’s life not with life’s physical accidents of deed or circumstance but with the spiritual moods and imaginative passions of the mind i am always amused by the silly vanity of those writers and artists of our day who seem to imagine that the primary function of the critic is to chatter about their secondrate work the best that one can say of most modern creative art is that it is just a little less vulgar than reality and so the critic with his fine sense of distinction and sure instinct of delicate refinement will prefer to look into the silver mirror or through the woven veil and will turn his eyes away from the chaos and clamour of actual existence though the mirror be tarnished and the veil be torn his sole aim is to chronicle his own impressions it is for him that pictures are painted books written and marble hewn into form

ernest
i seem to have heard another theory of criticism

gilbert
yes it has been said by one whose gracious memory we all revere and the music of whose pipe once lured proserpina from her sicilian fields and made those white feet stir and not in vain the cumnor cowslips that the proper aim of criticism is to see the object as in itself it really is but this is a very serious error and takes no cognisance of criticism’s most perfect form which is in its essence purely subjective and seeks to reveal its own secret and not the secret of another for the highest criticism deals with art not as expressive but as impressive purely

ernest
but is that really so

gilbert
of course it is who cares whether mr ruskin’s views on turner are sound or not what does it matter that mighty and majestic prose of his so fervid and so fierycoloured in its noble eloquence so rich in its elaborate symphonic music so sure and certain at its best in subtle choice of word and epithet is at least as great a work of art as any of those wonderful sunsets that bleach or rot on their corrupted canvases in england’s gallery greater indeed one is apt to think at times not merely because its equal beauty is more enduring but on account of the fuller variety of its appeal soul speaking to soul in those longcadenced lines not through form and colour alone though through these indeed completely and without loss but with intellectual and emotional utterance with lofty passion and with loftier thought with imaginative insight and with poetic aim greater i always think even as literature is the greater art who again cares whether mr pater has put into the portrait of monna lisa something that lionardo never dreamed of the painter may have been merely the slave of an archaic smile as some have fancied but whenever i pass into the cool galleries of the palace of the louvre and stand before that strange figure ‘set in its marble chair in that cirque of fantastic rocks as in some faint light under sea’ i murmur to myself ‘she is older than the rocks among which she sits like the vampire she has been dead many times and learned the secrets of the grave and has been a diver in deep seas and keeps their fallen day about her and trafficked for strange webs with eastern merchants and as leda was the mother of helen of troy and as st anne the mother of mary and all this has been to her but as the sound of lyres and flutes and lives only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing lineaments and tinged the eyelids and the hands

and i say to my friend ‘the presence that thus so strangely rose beside the waters is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand years man had come to desire’ and he answers me ‘hers is the head upon which all “the ends of the world are come” and the eyelids are a little weary’

and so the picture becomes more wonderful to us than it really is and reveals to us a secret of which in truth it knows nothing and the music of the mystical prose is as sweet in our ears as was that fluteplayer’s music that lent to the lips of la gioconda those subtle and poisonous curves do you ask me what lionardo would have said had any one told him of this picture that ‘all the thoughts and experience of the world had etched and moulded therein that which they had of power to refine and make expressive the outward form the animalism of greece the lust of rome the reverie of the middle age with its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves the return of the pagan world the sins of the borgias’ he would probably have answered that he had contemplated none of these things but had concerned himself simply with certain arrangements of lines and masses and with new and curious colourharmonies of blue and green and it is for this very reason that the criticism which i have quoted is criticism of the highest kind it treats the work of art simply as a startingpoint for a new creation it does not confine itself—let us at least suppose so for the moment—to discovering the real intention of the artist and accepting that as final and in this it is right for the meaning of any beautiful created thing is at least as much in the soul of him who looks at it as it was in his soul who wrought it nay it is rather the beholder who lends to the beautiful thing its myriad meanings and makes it marvellous for us and sets it in some new relation to the age so that it becomes a vital portion of our lives and a symbol of what we pray for or perhaps of what having prayed for we fear that we may receive the longer i study ernest the more clearly i see that the beauty of the visible arts is as the beauty of music impressive primarily and that it may be marred and indeed often is so by any excess of intellectual intention on the part of the artist for when the work is finished it has as it were an independent life of its own and may deliver a message far other than that which was put into its lips to say sometimes when i listen to the overture to tannhäuser i seem indeed to see that comely knight treading delicately on the flowerstrewn grass and to hear the voice of venus calling to him from the caverned hill but at other times it speaks to me of a thousand different things of myself it may be and my own life or of the lives of others whom one has loved and grown weary of loving or of the passions that man has known or of the passions that man has not known and so has sought for tonight it may fill one with that ερως των αδυνατων that amour de l’impossible which falls like a madness on many who think they live securely and out of reach of harm so that they sicken suddenly with the poison of unlimited desire and in the infinite pursuit of what they may not obtain grow faint and swoon or stumble

tomorrow like the music of which aristotle and plato tell us the noble dorian music of the greek it may perform the office of a physician and give us an anodyne against pain and heal the spirit that is wounded and ‘bring the soul into harmony with all right things’ and what is true about music is true about all the arts beauty has as many meanings as man has moods beauty is the symbol of symbols beauty reveals everything because it expresses nothing when it shows us itself it shows us the whole fierycoloured world

ernest
but is such work as you have talked about really criticism

gilbert
it is the highest criticism for it criticises not merely the individual work of art but beauty itself and fills with wonder a form which the artist may have left void or not understood or understood incompletely

ernest
the highest criticism then is more creative than creation and the primary aim of the critic is to see the object as in itself it really is not that is your theory i believe

gilbert
yes that is my theory to the critic the work of art is simply a suggestion for a new work of his own that need not necessarily bear any obvious resemblance to the thing it criticises the one characteristic of a beautiful form is that one can put into it whatever one wishes and see in it whatever one chooses to see and the beauty that gives to creation its universal and aesthetic element makes the critic a creator in his turn and whispers of a thousand different things which were not present in the mind of him who carved the statue or painted the panel or graved the gem

it is sometimes said by those who understand neither the nature of the highest criticism nor the charm of the highest art that the pictures that the critic loves most to write about are those that belong to the anecdotage of painting and that deal with scenes taken out of literature or history but this is not so indeed pictures of this kind are far too intelligible as a class they rank with illustrations and even considered from this point of view are failures as they do not stir the imagination but set definite bounds to it for the domain of the painter is as i suggested before widely different from that of the poet to the latter belongs life in its full and absolute entirety not merely the beauty that men look at but the beauty that men listen to also not merely the momentary grace of form or the transient gladness of colour but the whole sphere of feeling the perfect cycle of thought the painter is so far limited that it is only through the mask of the body that he can show us the mystery of the soul only through conventional images that he can handle ideas only through its physical equivalents that he can deal with psychology and how inadequately does he do it then asking us to accept the torn turban of the moor for the noble rage of othello or a dotard in a storm for the wild madness of lear yet it seems as if nothing could stop him most of our elderly english painters spend their wicked and wasted lives in poaching upon the domain of the poets marring their motives by clumsy treatment and striving to render by visible form or colour the marvel of what is invisible the splendour of what is not seen their pictures are as a natural consequence insufferably tedious they have degraded the invisible arts into the obvious arts and the one thing not worth looking at is the obvious i do not say that poet and painter may not treat of the same subject they have always done so and will always do so

but while the poet can be pictorial or not as he chooses the painter must be pictorial always for a painter is limited not to what he sees in nature but to what upon canvas may be seen

and so my dear ernest pictures of this kind will not really fascinate the critic he will turn from them to such works as make him brood and dream and fancy to works that possess the subtle quality of suggestion and seem to tell one that even from them there is an escape into a wider world it is sometimes said that the tragedy of an artist’s life is that he cannot realise his ideal but the true tragedy that dogs the steps of most artists is that they realise their ideal too absolutely for when the ideal is realised it is robbed of its wonder and its mystery and becomes simply a new startingpoint for an ideal that is other than itself this is the reason why music is the perfect type of art music can never reveal its ultimate secret this also is the explanation of the value of limitations in art the sculptor gladly surrenders imitative colour and the painter the actual dimensions of form because by such renunciations they are able to avoid too definite a presentation of the real which would be mere imitation and too definite a realisation of the ideal which would be too purely intellectual it is through its very incompleteness that art becomes complete in beauty and so addresses itself not to the faculty of recognition nor to the faculty of reason but to the aesthetic sense alone which while accepting both reason and recognition as stages of apprehension subordinates them both to a pure synthetic impression of the work of art as a whole and taking whatever alien emotional elements the work may possess uses their very complexity as a means by which a richer unity may be added to the ultimate impression itself you see then how it is that the aesthetic critic rejects these obvious modes of art that have but one message to deliver and having delivered it become dumb and sterile and seeks rather for such modes as suggest reverie and mood and by their imaginative beauty make all interpretations true and no interpretation final some resemblance no doubt the creative work of the critic will have to the work that has stirred him to creation but it will be such resemblance as exists not between nature and the mirror that the painter of landscape or figure may be supposed to hold up to her but between nature and the work of the decorative artist just as on the flowerless carpets of persia tulip and rose blossom indeed and are lovely to look on though they are not reproduced in visible shape or line just as the pearl and purple of the seashell is echoed in the church of st mark at venice just as the vaulted ceiling of the wondrous chapel at ravenna is made gorgeous by the gold and green and sapphire of the peacock’s tail though the birds of juno fly not across it so the critic reproduces the work that he criticises in a mode that is never imitative and part of whose charm may really consist in the rejection of resemblance and shows us in this way not merely the meaning but also the mystery of beauty and by transforming each art into literature solves once for all the problem of art’s unity

but i see it is time for supper after we have discussed some chambertin and a few ortolans we will pass on to the question of the critic considered in the light of the interpreter

ernest
ah you admit then that the critic may occasionally be allowed to see the object as in itself it really is

gilbert
i am not quite sure perhaps i may admit it after supper there is a subtle influence in supperembed"
