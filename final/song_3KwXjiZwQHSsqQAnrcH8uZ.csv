cocaine flame in my bloodstream
sold my coat when i hit spokane
bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes
in the early morning rain
lately my hands they dont feel like mine
my eyes been stung with dust and blinds
held you in my arms one time
lost you just the same

chorus
jolene
well i aint about to go straight its too late
and i found myself face down in the ditch
booze in my hair blood on my lips
a picture of you holding a picture of me
in the pocket of my blue jeans
still dont know what love means
still dont know what love means

its been so long since ive seen your face
or felt a part of this human race
ive been living out of this here suitcase for way too long
man needs something he can hold onto
nine pound hammer or a woman like you
either one of them things will do

chorus
jolene
well i aint about to go straight its too late
and i found myself face down in the ditch
booze in my hair blood on my lips
a picture of you holding a picture of me
in the pocket of my blue jeans
still dont know what love means
still dont know what love means
