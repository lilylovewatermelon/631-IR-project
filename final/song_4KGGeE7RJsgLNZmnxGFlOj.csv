moved out to a new city
june is dawning down on me
and all that i can finds

a sickly romance in the air
lovers stroll without a care in sight
oh this can’t be right

chorus
cause the suns engaged to the sky
and my best friends found a new guy
i’m only getting older
ive never had a shoulder to cry on
someone to call mine
everybodys falling in love
and im falling behind

verse 2
touched the ocean fell right in
stepped outside and burned my skin
my life wont go my way
bossa nova in my room
hoped that ill find someone too
to love bеcause

and my best friends found a new guy

i’ve never had a shoulder to cry on
someone to call mine
everybody’s falling in love
and im falling behind

everybody’s falling in love
everybodys falling in love
