life is a waterfall
were one in the river and one again after the fall
swimming through the void we hear the word
we lose ourselves but we find it all
cause we are the ones that wanna play
always wanna go but you never wanna stay
and we are the ones that wanna choose
always wanna play but you never wanna lose

chorus serj tankian
aerials in the sky
when you lose small mind you free your life

verse 2 serj tankian
life is a waterfall
we drink from the river then we turn around and put up our walls
swimming through the void we hear the word
we lose ourselves but we find it all
cause we are the ones that wanna play
always wanna go but you never wanna stay
and we are the ones that wanna choose
always wanna play but you never wanna lose oh

chorus serj tankian
aerials in the sky
when you lose small mind you free your life
aerials so up high
when you free your eyes eternal prize
