and thats the thing
that thing right there
thats my girl i cant share
maybe im selfish i get a little jealous
i lose my mind when you say that
balmain silk slip off your back
you get so impatient
i know you got your cravings
so tell me you didnt tell all of your girlfriends about this yeah
tell me you still think my neighbors dont know girl you shout it yeah
girl i know that youve been trying i swear im the proudest yeah
but the question is girl do you think you could live without it without it

chorus
nothing on you when you naked
except a cartier bracelet
silhouette through the shower
fuck you 24 hours
sun peeking through the curtains
know im with you when youre hurting
baby girl the worlds ours
fuck you 24 hours
in that shit like oh
baby girl the worlds ours
fuck you 24 hours
in that shit like oh
nothing on you when you naked
except a cartier bracelet
you might also likeverse 2
nothing on you when you naked
got a pretty little heart i dont wanna break it
girl i just want to save you
swear to god thank the lord every day that he made you
all the girls tryna flex they dont phase you
take you down with my guns then we blaze ooh
get rough ima stay through stay through
cause she rare oh yeah
the way she lookin in the mirror unfair
you know we couldnt even make it upstairs
had to hit it right there

chorus
nothing on you when you naked
except a cartier bracelet
silhouette through the shower
fuck you 24 hours
sun peeking through the curtains
know im with you when youre hurting
baby girl the worlds ours
fuck you 24 hours
in that shit like oh
baby girl the worlds ours
fuck you 24 hours
in that shit like oh
nothing on you when you naked
except a cartier bracelet yeah yeah4embed"
