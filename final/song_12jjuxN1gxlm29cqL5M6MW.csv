back when all my little goals seemed so important
every pot of gold feeling full of distortion
heaven was a place still in space not in motion
but soon

chorus
i got you
i got everything ive got you
i dont need nothing more than you
i got everything ive got you

verse 2
we went walking through the hills trying to pretend that we both know
maybe if we save up we could build a little home
but then the hailstorm came it yelled
you need to let go you got no control no

chorus
i got you
i got everything ive got you
i dont need nothing more than you
i got everything ive got you

bridge
this weights too much alone
some days i cant hold it at all
you take it on for me
when tomorrows too much ill carry it all i got you
yeah when tomorrows too much ill carry it all i got you

i dont need nothing more than you
