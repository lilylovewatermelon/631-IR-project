these walls are paper thin
and everyone hears every little sound
everyones a voyeurist
theyre watching me watch them watch me right now
theyre shaking hands theyre shaking in their shoes
oh lord dont shake me down
everyone wants two of them
and half of everyone else whos around
its been agreed the whole world stinks
so no ones taking showers anymore

chorus
laugh hard its a long ways to the bank
i cant be blamed for nothing anymore
its been a long time since youve been around
laugh hard its a long ways to the bank

bridge
tow the line to tax the time you know
that you dont owe
i cant be a fool for everyone
that i dont know

these walls are paper thin
and everyone hears every little sound
everyones a voyeur
as theyre watching me watch them watch me right now
theyre shaking hands theyre shaking in their shoes
oh lord dont shake me down
everyone wants two of them
and half of everyone else whos around
its been agreed the whole world stinks
so no ones taking showers anymore
