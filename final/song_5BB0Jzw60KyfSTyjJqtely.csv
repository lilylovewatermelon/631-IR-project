verse 1 gerard way
drugs gimme drugs gimme drugs
i dont need it but ill sell what you got
take the cash and ill keep it
eight legs to the wall
hit the gas kill em all
and we crawl and we crawl and we crawl
you be my detonator
love gimme love gimme love
i dont need it but ill take what i want from your heart
and ill keep it in a bag in a box
put an x on the floor
gimme more gimme more gimme more
shut up and sing it with me

na nanana nanana from mall security
na nanana nanana to every enemy
na nanana nanana were on your property
standing in vformation
na nanana nanana lets blow an artery
na nanana nanana eat plastic surgery
na nanana nanana keep your apology
give us more detonation

postchorus gerard way

verse 2 gerard way
oh let me tell you bout the sad man
shut up and let me see your jazz hands
remember when you were a madman
thought you was batman nana
and hit the party with a gas can
kiss me you animal

chorus gerard way
na nanana nanana you run the company
na nanana nanana fuck like a kennedy
na nanana nanana i think wed rather be
burning your information
na nanana nanana lets blow an artery
na nanana nanana eat plastic surgery
na nanana nanana keep your apology
give us more detonation
bridge gerard way
and right here right now all the way in battery city
the little children raise their open filthy palms
like tiny daggers up to heaven
and all the juvie halls and the ritalin rats
ask angels made from neon and fucking garbage
scream out what will save us
and the sky opened up

refrain gerard way
everybody wants to change the world
everybody wants to change the world
but no one no one wants to die
wanna try wanna try wanna try
wanna try wanna try now
ill be your detonator

guitar solo

interlude
na nanana nanana nananana

chorus gerard way
na nanana nanana make no apology
na nanana nanana its death or victory
na nanana nanana on my authority
crash and burning young and loaded
na nanana nanana drop like a bullet shell
na nanana nanana dress like a sleeper cell
na nanana nanana id rather go to hell
outro gerard way
than be in purgatory
cut my hair gag and bore me
pull this pin let this world explode80embed"
