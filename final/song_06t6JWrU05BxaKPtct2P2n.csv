so its over
this time i know its gone
saltwater
tasted it too long
i only know im wrong
now i know its gone

hook
up in flames
up in flames
up in flames
we have slowly gone

verse 2
so its over
this time youre flying on
this time i know no song
cant stop its lonely burn
cant stop it slowly going

hook
up in flames
up in flames
up in flames
we have slowly gone
