wont get to space cause i havent got a rocket
but ive air in my lungs
eyes in my sockets
and a heart that beats
like a tap that leaks
in the night when you havent got a plumber who can stop it
jack in a box without a key to lock it
well this boat may sink
but im not going to rock it
cause the sea doesnt know my name
yeah the boat may sink but im not going to rock it
cause the sea doesnt know my name

well if you cant get what you love
you learn to love the things youve got
if you cant be what you want
you learn to be the things youre not
if you cant get what you need
you learn to need the things that stop you dreaming
all the things that stop you dreaming

well ive got no ones word and nobodys promise
not a lot to show
but this book full of sonnets
and my liver may be fuced but my heart is honest
and my word is true
like the sky is blue in the summer time
when everybody gets on it
warm our skins and get sunburnt from it
and our eyes shine bright like a sky full of comets
that shoot like silver trains
yeah our eyes shine bright like a sky full of comets
that shoot like silver trains

all the things that stop you dreaming
well if you cant get what you love
