take me to the hamptons bugatti veyron

i said can we party later on he said yes yes yes

chorus

winin and dinin drinkin and drivin
excessive buyin overdose and dyin
on our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
blurring the lines between real and the fake
dark and lonely i need somebody to hold me

keep me safe in his belltower hotel
money is the anthem of success
so put on mascara and your party dress
