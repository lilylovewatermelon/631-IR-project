you walk on like a woman in suffering
wont even bother now to tell me why
you come alone letting all of us savor the moment
leaving me broken another time
you come on like a bloodstained hurricane
leave me alone let me be this time
you carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
i dont want to mention

chorus
the reason i know
that i am stricken and cant let you go
when the heart is cold theres no hope and we know
that i am crippled by all that youve done
into the abyss will i run

verse 2
you dont know what your power has done to me
i want to know if ill heal inside
i cant go on with a holocaust about to happen
seeing you laughing another time
youll never know why your face has haunted me
my very soul has to bleed this time
another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
leaving me breathless

the reason i know
that i am stricken and cant let you go
when the heart is cold theres no hope and we know
that i am crippled by all that youve done
into the abyss will i run
into the abyss will i run
