girl tell me what youre doing on the other side
and so just tell me what youre doing with that other guy
cause i aint got patience to slow down the pace
all your girlfriends are wasted
they need it they chase it
face it you want it you crave it
believe when i say that youll know once you taste it

chorus mitchel cave
all of your friends have been here for too long
they must be waiting for you to move on woo
girl im not with it im way too far gone
im not ready eyes heavy now woo
heart on your sleeve like youve never been loved
running in circles now look what youve done woo
give you my word as you take it and run
wish youd let me stay im ready now

verse 2 mitchel cave and christian anthony
just give me some time and space to realize
that you were busy lying sleeping round with other guys
and what the hell were we
tell me we werent just friends
this doesnt make much sense no
but im not hurt im tense
cause ill be fine without you babe woo

im not ready eyes heavy now

running in circles now look what youve done woo
give you my word as you take it and run
wish youd let me stay im ready now woo
