i i need you i i dont
i question myself all the time asking why i dont know

prechorus
its kinda hard to walk right
when youre walking on my left
with your high heels on and your sexyass dress
i see you talking on your phone phone
wish i could get you on your own own
but ive seen you gone over love

chorus
i think i know she don’t love me
thats why i fuck her right
i think i know she dont love me
thats why i fuck her right

postchorus
i want you your body
i want you your body on top of mine
