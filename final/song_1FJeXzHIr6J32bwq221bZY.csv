love to be beside you the way you smell
the way your lips feel and your fingernails
the way your fingers crawl up my spine
the way you always make me the last in line

prechorus
i carry the weight of the world as the past is unfurled
but i wont stop to wander
going through this life on my own made me cold as stone
im a ship going under

chorus
and id tell you this but i dont know how
and im caving in and im falling out
and i cant resist and i cant rebound
with the weight of the world as the world falls down

verse 2
its the way you thrill me then pull away
the way you seem to kill me a little more each day
and itâ€™s what youre thinking in your twisted mind
the way your body trembles when its next to mine

prechorus
i carry the weight of the world as the past is unfurled
but i wont stop to wander
going through this life on my own made me cold as stone
im a ship going under

and id tell you this but i dont know how
and im caving in and im falling out
and i cant resist and i cant rebound
with the weight of the world as the world falls down
falls down falls down

chorus
and id tell you this but i dont know how
and im caving in and im falling out
and i cant resist and i cant rebound
with the weight of the world as the world falls down
falls down falls down falls down

outro
this pain i think about it everyday
it tells me im never gonna get away
i know its over but i cant escape
memories and how to face another dayembed"
