at the bottom theres a stir
and now surface is a blur
tell the truth like its a joke
and dont fix the part that isnt broke
i know im just a memory
and i know thats how its got to be
so tell the mirror on the wall
mirror mirror on the wall
theres no reflection here at all

chorus
mirror mirror on the wall theres no reflection here at all

verse 2
im so tired that i cant sleep
the secrets that my secrets keep
down the stairway to the church
blackbirds hanging in the lurch
i dont want to see my name in stone
i tied a ribbon round a bone
took a ride in a yellow car
and bought myself an old guitar
things aint what they used to be
i gotta devil after me
tell the mirror on the wall
mirror mirror on the wall
theres no reflection here at all

mirror mirror on the wall theres no reflection here at all

verse 3
theyre looking high theyre looking low
and you got something on your mind
did someone give you bad directions
where you in the wrong place at the wrong time
they found a body in the river
they found a note left in the sand
leave my worries to the water
and leave my body to the landembed"
