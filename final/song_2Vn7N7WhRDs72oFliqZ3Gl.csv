hey can you turn it up a little bit

verse 1
well i was ridin in shotgun speedin down the highway
listenin to music havent slept in like five days
i try take a nap lean my head against the window
it feels real i swear to god this shit pretend though
cause me i get high make music for a livin
if that ainâ€™t the best job then give me your opinion
cause i love life chillin for the night case of bud light
small world for me but you you live a bugs life
scared to chase your dreams scared to take a risk
think its make believe so you hate the shit
valentine love it grimier than rubbish
you softer than a snuggie and you sweeter than a sunkist
never eatin beets on your doug shit
come with all the swagger but you lackin all the substance
cool the dude you used to wanna be in school
spendin money drinkin liquor naked girls up in my pool
you might also likechorus
wake up in my bed gettin head she said she said
the act so cool but she easily impressed
i love to lay back watch her while she get dressed
put herself together last night was a mess yes yes
today a new day new day a fresh start fresh start
if you didnt make mistakes you wouldnt get far get far
life get hard get hard so we get high get high
you aint shit til you try try

verse 2
ayy
ayo my herb smoke tastin like a nerds rope
ima get rich so i can buy my bitch a fur coat
somethin like a millionaire in trainin
still my shit amazin we jumpin over puddles when its rainin
plannin on a tan im in the sand
and well be jammin make it bounce
while we dancin on the clouds until im landin in my house
remember when my moms would hate me standin on the couch
but now im makin so much money i start to lose count
i try and spend it quick i got bills though
yeah im only eighteen i got skills though
beats rhymes life tribe called chill flow
you been rappin twentyfive years and you still broke
no disrespect the riches is the art
im just mad at all these haters who was bitches from the start
we just do this cause we love it and its settin us apart
we was already gone while you was only on your mark hey
chorus
wake up in my bed gettin head she said she said
the act so cool but she easily impressed
i love to lay back watch her while she get dressed
put herself together last night was a mess yes yes
today a new day new day a fresh start fresh start
if you didnt make mistakes you wouldnt get far get far
life get hard get hard so we get high get high
you aint shit til you try try6embed"
