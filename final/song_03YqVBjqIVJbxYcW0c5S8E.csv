carolina moon lazy ol river
time keeps floating on by
moss hanging from an oak tree
baby its just you and me
sure makes one beautiful sight
we got postcard views
curled up in this rocking chair
feel like i ought tip my hat
to the man up stairs

chorus
leaving the light on
leaving the light on
burning the whole night through
leaving the light on
leaving the light on
so i can look at you

verse 2
your pretty brown eyes
your legs that go forever
still cant believe youre mine
come on baby lets take a walk
follow the path down to that old dock
see darius rucker liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeand bring along that bottle of wine
that old moons so bright
just hang in up there
feel like i ought counting my blessings
and thank the man upstairs for

chorus

verse 3
its getting kind of late girl
lets go back to the house
i want to watch you from my pillow
until morning rolls around so im

leaving the light on
leaving the light on
burning the whole night through
leaving the light on
leaving the light on
so i can so i can see you
oh i want to look at you o so im
im leaving the light
leaving the light on
oh its burning oh its burning through
oh its burning through yeah
