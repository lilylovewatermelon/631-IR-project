verse 1

verse 2
mad rich got it out the mud it was ugly
average i cant go back to havin nothin
savage product of my environment im hustlin
karats clarity gon glisten when its dirty
karats they glisten when they dirty keep a thirty
bulletproof suburban avoidin all the worries
the way i ball i know for sure that every time my jersey breakin the laws
wake up early morning go serve it
take the time buildin my crib like a pyramid thats my crib
reminiscin where i come from get money a religion
you got smoke in the air dont let it cloud your vision
some of my partners not here i really do miss you
take the money and ball it up and use it for tissues
sendin gun powder out resolving these issues
and the way things goin is very malicious
its another bloody summer inside of my city
outro
uhuh its another bloody summer inside of my city
uhuh the way things goin the way things goin1embed"
