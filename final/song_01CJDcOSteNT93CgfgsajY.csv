am i really just the spare
im not part of the town not born to be queen
just somebody hopelessly inbetween
shes the scholar athlete poet
im the screw up dont i know it
but then who could ever compare
of course theyre gonna think im just the spare
well i wont care
so im the extra button on a coat
in case another one comes loose
but if i have to be a button
why cant i be a button thats of use
oops
i may lack style and i may lack grace
and once in a while ill fall on my face
but this little button deserves a place in the sky
this button wants to fly
wait buttons cant fly that doesnt make any sense
so im a rusty horseshoe hanging up over somebodys old barn door
and ill be hanging there forever just wishing the horse had one leg more
and maybe i cant be the perfect one
and maybe i err on the side of fun
but horseshoes need a chance to run somewhere
this horseshoe is more than just a spare
someday ill find my thing a thing thats all my own
that thing that makes me part of something not just all alone
if only all these feelings i have in my heart
could mean something to someone
how id love to play that part
so im just a second born sister
who most of the town ignores
like a button like a horseshoe
like a girl whos bad at metaphors
maybe i dont have a magic touch
maybe i dont have a talent as such
just this heart with much too much to share
so ill never be the heir
but im more than just the spare
