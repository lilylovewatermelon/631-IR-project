feeling like your day may be done
here it comes the strawberry smog
chasing away the sun
dont let those precious moments fool you
happiness is getting you down
a rainbow never smiles or blinks
its just a candy colored frown
you were going on at halfpast seven
now its going on a quarter to nine
all the angels want to know
are you lost or treading water
and youre going on your fifteenth bender
but youve only got a matter of time
yes weve all got seeds to sow
not everyones got lambs to slaughter

when the night wind starts to turn
into the ocean breeze
and the dew drops sting and burn
like angry honey bees
that is when youll hear the song falling from the sky
happy yesterday to all
we were born to die
you might also likesometimes youre filled with the notion
the afterlifes a moment away
you want to tell someone the way that you feel
but then you aint got nothing to say
you fight for freedom from devotion
a battle that will always begin
with somebody giving you a piece of advice
by the way youre living in sin
now theres never gonna be an intermission
but therell always be a closing night
never entertain those visions
lest you may have packed your baggage
first impressions are cheap auditions
situations are long goodbyes
truth so often living dormant
good luck walks and bullshit flies
when the headlights guide your way
you know the place is right
when the treetops sing and sway
dont go to sleep tonight
that is when you see the sign
luminous and high
tomorrows not what it used to be
we were born to die
happy yesterday to all
we were born to dieembed"
