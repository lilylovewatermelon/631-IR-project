its like a bolt of lightning hits me in my chest
right out of the blue
every time i see you every time i see you
top of the world im standing rocking at my best
then i look like a fool
every time i see you every time i see you

chorus
youre like a wreck out on the highway
i cant look away and i cant pass through
youre like an early morning monday
bringing me down messing with my mood
id love to say i can hold myself together
but i cant help but come unglued
every time i see you every time i see you

verse 2
i want to tell you everything i ever wanted to say
but i never do
every time i see you every time i see you
im sure my steering wheel and dashboard
would love a good break but they feel it too
every time i see you why i got to see you

chorus
youre like a wreck out on the highway
i cant look away and i cant pass through
youre like an early morning monday
bringing me down messing with my mood
id love to say i can hold myself together
but i cant help but come unglued
every time i see you every time i see you
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus
oh youre like a wreck out on the highway
i cant look away and i cant pass through
youre like an early morning monday
bringing me down messing with my mood
id love to say i can hold myself together
but i cant help but come unglued
every time i see you every time i see you
every time i see you oh yeah

outro
oh im walking down the street
and you walk right up to me and i freeze
every time i see you1embed"
