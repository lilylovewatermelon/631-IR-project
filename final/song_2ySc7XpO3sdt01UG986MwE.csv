hey
its like

verse 1
long days longer nights
you keep startin fights think you always right
call you up to tell you i aint comin home tonight
say you wanna leave me its just talkin but i know you might
now get along i get along i go
you sing along to every song that you know
you play your part im playin mine
you breakin hearts aint breakin mine
since growin old is takin time im actin like im eight or nine
tryin to move on talkin to my old friends
see me say what up and im actin like i dont know them
causin so much problems why you doin that doin that
rippin peoples hearts out you too cute for that cute for that
i been on the same shit same shit
we run into each other and its like we dont even speak the same language language
i guess people always goin through changes changes
didnt think i would lose you once i got famous

chorus
said baby i got missed calls and emails all goin into detail
bout how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave
so go go
ill be fine on my own own
said baby i got missed calls and emails all goin into detail
bout how you used to love me i keep changin like the leaves
hell go go
youll be fine on your own own

she tell me you an asshole superficial douchebag
wishin that you knew that you could have these shoes back
all of this perfume back necklaces and jewels back
all the shit you buy me she said i want you back
i cant be seen again with you and none of your friends
its so hard to pretend that its like it was way back when
i thought you used to be the one i guess you dont have time
cause all you do is grind and its got me losin my mind
you just dont dont dont love me like you used to
think im bout to lose you
ima end this now before things just confuse you
kept breakin promises you said youd keep
so you can leave a message at the beep

chorus
said baby i got missed calls and emails all goin into detail
bout how you just not happy and you think you gotta leave
so go go
ill be fine on my own own
said baby i got missed calls and emails all goin into detail
bout how you used to love me i keep changin like the leaves
hell go go
youll be fine on your own own49embed"
