just a few seconds away away
from everyone from everything
just a few seconds away away
a second of your time and an inch of my own space

verse 1
silence quiet need a little peace of mind
after all this after all that you do
shut it up zip it need a little time to think
without all this without all that you do
keep it dont want it think ill just go away
away from here from you
time out walk it off think i need to throw a flag
just a little break from the games that you play

chorus
just a few seconds away away
from everyone from everything
just a few seconds away away
all i want from all of you
just a few seconds away away
away from this its never ending
just a few seconds away away
a second of your time and an inch of my own space

beat up whip it topped with a little scream
all that you are for all that you do
crush it all kill it calling out my enemy
dont want anything i want nothing from you
dry it up baby turn around and walk away
cry your tears pussy
lift it up destroy it build it up to tear it down
all the little things that make me run away

chorus
just a few seconds away away
from everyone from everything
just a few seconds away away
all i want from all of you
just a few seconds away away
away from this its never ending
just a few seconds away away
a second of your time and an inch of my own space

bridge
stop talking stop bothering me
just walk away ive had enough today
i have a life too ive had enough of you
feel like screaming so go the fuck away
go away
go away
go away
go away
chorus
just a few seconds away away
from everyone from everything
just a few seconds away away
all i want from all of you
just a few seconds away away
away from this its never ending
just a few seconds away away
a second of your time and an inch of my own spaceembed"
