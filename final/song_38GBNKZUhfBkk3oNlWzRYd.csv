did you think id show up in a limousine no
had to save my money for security
got a stalker walkin up and down the street

havent had a party since i got the keys
had a pretty boy over but he couldnt stay
on his way out made him sign an nda mm

maybе i should think about a new career uh
somewhere in kauai where i can disappear
