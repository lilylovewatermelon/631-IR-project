whoa oh

verse 1
the in and out of datings got me all confused
i build up expectations end up feeling used
seems everybodys into fast food fast food
everybodys in too quick
i want someone to take the time
fine dine me not rush it oh ooh
now its nearly seventhirty im slippin on a dress
i keep my fingers crossed youre not like all the rest
so when you come to pick me up come right to my door
dont stay in your car and beep beep the horn

prechorus
maybe im a hopeless romantic
youll pick the sounds for the background to our drive into town
baby dont be one of the traffic
had too many nights with the wrong guys
coming up red lights

chorus
tell me how many frogs do i have to kiss
before i find my prince before i find my prince
all you girls that are goin through this
tell em how it is tell em how it is

we pull up to our premiere red carpet good
you check my coat get my chair like i hoped you would
youre funny and your flirtins really workin for me
but where it goes from here better wait and see

prechorus
maybe im a hopeless romantic maybe
youll pick the view that we kiss to
make me go ooh ooh
and baby itll all turn out tragic
and youll push for more back at my front door

you got you gotta tip the waiter thats how it works
you cant skip the starter go straight to dessert
you gotta pop the cork before you taste the wine wine
now make your mad dash for the finish line
up in a row cause the dating game is whoa
we get hooked up but the real shame is
too much connection followed by rejections
gonna hurt a girl til she learns her lesson
