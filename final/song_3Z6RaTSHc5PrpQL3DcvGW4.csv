i just i just live
i live day by day fighting demons

verse
i smoked away my brain i think i’m going dumb
cocaine up on my gums i think they’re going numb
i’m having stomach pains now i’m throwing up
cause i’m a microphone fiend give me the bass
give me the beat and let me lean tap the vein let it stream
feel the pain young martin luther king with a dream
that one day that my team we can make it with this rappin
now we swaggin makin money in manhattan trick what’s happenin
they try to intellect with indirection just to test you
a rebel til my death it’s in my flesh it’s in my vessels
fuck the clique you with i’m finna fuck the bitch you next to
fuck a metrosexual suck a dick i’m disrespectful
you know the kid get it getget sick
spit clip spit quick split shit hit kids women
oh that’s your girl huh well i just hit it
it’s aap nigga live with it swag
