so you feel all your powers unfold
stretching your big wings over waters turning gold
so tell your story baby don’t give up
just let all it go out the quiet wishing’s not loud enough

chorus little dragon
will you be the one to take a chance
have demands spill your heart
will you be the one to take a stand
make the girls dance
spill your thoughts
will you be the one to take a chance
have demands spill your heart
will you be the one to take a stand
make the girls dance
spill your thoughts will you

verse 2 little dragon
you could break up clouds with your fist in the air
were singing out loud as we march up the square
he always goes to put you in your place
and now youre chanting out loud so you cant be erased

chorus little dragon
will you be the one to take a chance
have demands spill your heart
will you be the one to take a stand
make the girls dance
spill your thoughts
will you be the one to take a chance
have demands spill your heart
will you be the one to take a stand
make the girls dance
spill your thoughts will you
