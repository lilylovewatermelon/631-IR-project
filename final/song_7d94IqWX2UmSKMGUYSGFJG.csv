uh uh uhuh uhuh uh uh daytrip took it to ten hey

verse 1
swallow all these pills with my pride uh
married to my highs you may kiss the bride
trouble in my brain see it in my eyes
i got voices in my head they keep me up at night
said i was okay but im lying feel like that im dying
soul screaming and crying feel my brain frying
try to numb the pain all the drugs ive been buying
this oxy gettin pricey pour the codeine in the hic
blood red blend in the hic
ive been doing so much wrong even though ma told me to do the right thing
poppin pills all night long in the studio pourin out my feelings
cant explain this feeling
kinda feels like im losing even though im winning

chorus
drain out bad energy drain out bad energy
forget the bad memories forget the bad memories
drain out bad energy drain out bad energy
forget the bad memories forget the bad memories ayy ayy

verse 2
multimillion dollars
all mine from the start
codeine kills the drama
and the trauma in my heart
just got a call from the dark side
stab wounds in my chest but im alright
i miss my friends i hate this spotlight
i love my girl i hate the thot life
yellow diamonds shiny pearls
im tryna give her the world
im tryna show her the world
she aint no ordinary girl
i know she know i know she know im down and out
life is a ocean demons ive been drownin out
i watch the crowd and crack a smile
i have a job to lead them out

drain out bad energy drain out bad energy
forget the bad memories forget the bad memories
drain out bad energy drain out bad energy
forget the bad memories forget the bad memories drain ayy
