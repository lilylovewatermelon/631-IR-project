in the early days of december an old man of some seventy years of age pursued his way along the rue de varenne in spite of the falling rain he peered up at the door of each house trying to discover the address of the marquis raphael de valentin in a simple childlike fashion and with the abstracted look peculiar to philosophers his face plainly showed traces of a struggle between a heavy mortification and an authoritative nature his long gray hair hung in disorder about a face like a piece of parchment shriveling in the fire if a painter had come upon this curious character he would no doubt have transferred him to his sketchbook on his return a thin bony figure clad in black and have inscribed beneath it classical poet in search of a rhyme when he had identified the number that had been given to him this reincarnation of rollin knocked meekly at the door of a splendid mansion

is monsieur raphael in the worthy man inquired of the swiss in livery

my lord the marquis sees nobody said the servant swallowing a huge morsel that he had just dipped in a large bowl of coffee

there is his carriage said the elderly stranger pointing to a fine equipage that stood under the wooden canopy that sheltered the steps before the house in place of a striped linen awning he is going out i will wait for him

then you might wait here till tomorrow morning old boy said the swiss a carriage is always waiting for monsieur please to go away if i were to let any stranger come into the house without orders i should lose an income of six hundred francs

a tall old man in a costume not unlike that of a subordinate in the civil service came out of the vestibule and hurried part of the way down the steps while he made a survey of the astonished elderly applicant for admission

what is more here is m jonathan the swiss remarked speak to him

fellowfeeling of some kind or curiosity brought the two old men together in a central space in the great entrancecourt a few blades of grass were growing in the crevices of the pavement a terrible silence reigned in that great house the sight of jonathans face would have made you long to understand the mystery that brooded over it and that was announced by the smallest trifles about the melancholy place

when raphael inherited his uncles vast estate his first care had been to seek out the old and devoted servitor of whose affection he knew that he was secure jonathan had wept tears of joy at the sight of his young master of whom he thought he had taken a final farewell and when the marquis exalted him to the high office of steward his happiness could not be surpassed so old jonathan became an intermediary power between raphael and the world at large he was the absolute disposer of his masters fortune the blind instrument of an unknown will and a sixth sense as it were by which the emotions of life were communicated to raphael

i should like to speak with m raphael sir said the elderly person to jonathan as he climbed up the steps some way into a shelter from the rain

to speak with my lord the marquis the steward cried he scarcely speaks even to me his fosterfather

but i am likewise his fosterfather said the old man if your wife was his fostermother i fed him myself with the milk of the muses he is my nursling my child carus alumnus i formed his mind cultivated his understanding developed his genius and i venture to say it to my own honor and glory is he not one of the most remarkable men of our epoch he was one of my pupils in two lower forms and in rhetoric i am his professor
ah sir then you are m porriquet

exactly sir but——

hush hush jonathan called to two underlings whose voices broke the monastic silence that shrouded the house

but is the marquis ill sir the professor continued

my dear sir jonathan replied heaven only knows what is the matter with my master you see there are not a couple of houses like ours anywhere in paris do you understand not two houses faith that there are not my lord the marquis had this hotel purchased for him it formerly belonged to a duke and a peer of france then he spent three hundred thousand francs over furnishing it thats a good deal you know three hundred thousand francs but every room in the house is a perfect wonder good said i to myself when i saw this magnificence it is just like it used to be in the time of my lord his late grandfather and the young marquis is going to entertain all paris and the court nothing of the kind my lord refused to see any one whatever tis a funny life that he leads m porriquet you understand an inconciliable life he rises every day at the same time i am the only person you see that may enter his room i open all the shutters at seven oclock summer or winter it is all arranged very oddly as i come in i say to him

you must get up and dress my lord marquis

then he rises and dresses himself i have to give him his dressinggown and it is always after the same pattern and of the same material i am obliged to replace it when it can be used no longer simply to save him the trouble of asking for a new one a queer fancy as a matter of fact he has a thousand francs to spend every day and he does as he pleases the dear child and besides i am so fond of him that if he gave me a box on the ear on one side i should hold out the other to him the most difficult things he will tell me to do and yet i do them you know he gives me a lot of trifles to attend to that i am well set to work he reads the newspapers doesnt he well my instructions are to put them always in the same place on the same table i always go at the same hour and shave him myself and dont i tremble the cook would forfeit the annuity of a thousand crowns that he is to come into after my lords death if breakfast is not served inconciliably at ten oclock precisely the menus are drawn up for the whole year round day after day my lord the marquis has not a thing to wish for he has strawberries whenever there are any and he has the earliest mackerel to be had in paris the programme is printed every morning he knows his dinner by rote in the next place he dresses himself at the same hour in the same clothes the same linen that i always put on the same chair you understand i have to see that he always has the same cloth and if it should happen that his coat came to grief a mere supposition i should have to replace it by another without saying a word about it to him if it is fine i go in and say to my master

you ought to go out sir

he says yes or no if he has a notion that he will go out he doesnt wait for his horses they are always ready harnessed the coachman stops there inconciliably whip in hand just as you see him out there in the evening after dinner my master goes one day to the opera the other to the ital——no he hasnt yet gone to the italiens though for i could not find a box for him until yesterday then he comes in at eleven oclock precisely to go to bed at any time in the day when he has nothing to do he reads—he is always reading you see—it is a notion he has my instructions are to read the journal de la librairie before he sees it and to buy new books so that he finds them on his chimneypiece on the very day that they are published i have orders to go into his room every hour or so to look after the fire and everything else and to see that he wants nothing he gave me a little book sir to learn off by heart with all my duties written in it—a regular catechism in summer i have to keep a cool and even temperature with blocks of ice and at all seasons to put fresh flowers all about he is rich he has a thousand francs to spend every day he can indulge his fancies and he hadnt even necessaries for so long poor child he doesnt annoy anybody he is as good as gold he never opens his mouth for instance the house and garden are absolutely silent in short my master has not a single wish left everything comes in the twinkling of an eye if he raises his hand and instanter quite right too if servants are not looked after everything falls into confusion you would never believe the lengths he goes about things his rooms are all—what do you call it—er—er—en suite very well just suppose now that he opens his room door or the door of his study presto all the other doors fly open of themselves by a patent contrivance and then he can go from one end of the house to the other and not find a single door shut which is all very nice and pleasant and convenient for us great folk but on my word it cost us a lot of money and after all m porriquet he said to me at last

jonathan you will look after me as if i were a baby in long clothes yes sir long clothes those were his very words you will think of all my requirements for me i am the master so to speak and he is the servant you understand the reason of it ah my word that is just what nobody on earth knows but himself and god almighty it is quite inconciliable

he is writing a poem exclaimed the old professor

you think he is writing a poem sir its a very absorbing affair then but you know i dont think he is he often tells me that he wants to live like a vergetation he wants to vergetate only yesterday he was looking at a tulip while he was dressing and he said to me

there is my own life—i am vergetating my poor jonathan now some of them insist that that is monomania it is inconciliable
all this makes it very clear to me jonathan the professor answered with a magisterial solemnity that greatly impressed the old servant that your master is absorbed in a great work he is deep in vast meditations and has no wish to be distracted by the petty preoccupations of ordinary life a man of genius forgets everything among his intellectual labors one day the famous newton——

newton—oh ah i dont know the name said jonathan

newton a great geometrician porriquet went on once sat for twentyfour hours leaning his elbow on the table when he emerged from his musings he was a day out in his reckoning just as if he had been sleeping i will go to see him dear lad i may perhaps be of some use to him

not for a moment jonathan cried not though you were king of france—i mean the real old one you could not go in unless you forced the doors open and walked over my body but i will go and tell him you are here m porriquet and i will put it to him like this ought he to come up and he will say yes or no i never say do you wish or will you or do you want those words are scratched out of the dictionary he let out at me once with a do you want to kill me he was so very angry

jonathan left the old schoolmaster in the vestibule signing to him to come no further and soon returned with a favorable answer he led the old gentleman through one magnificent room after another where every door stood open at last porriquet beheld his pupil at some distance seated beside the fire

raphael was reading the paper he sat in an armchair wrapped in a dressinggown with some large pattern on it the intense melancholy that preyed upon him could be discerned in his languid posture and feeble frame it was depicted on his brow and white face he looked like some plant bleached by darkness there was a kind of effeminate grace about him the fancies peculiar to wealthy invalids were also noticeable his hands were soft and white like a pretty womans he wore his fair hair now grown scanty curled about his temples with a refinement of vanity

the greek cap that he wore was pulled to one side by the weight of its tassel too heavy for the light material of which it was made he had let the paperknife fall at his feet a malachite blade with gold mounting which he had used to cut the leaves of the book the amber mouthpiece of a magnificent indian hookah lay on his knee the enameled coils lay like a serpent in the room but he had forgotten to draw out its fresh perfume and yet there was a complete contradiction between the general feebleness of his young frame and the blue eyes where all his vitality seemed to dwell an extraordinary intelligence seemed to look out from them and to grasp everything at once

that expression was painful to see some would have read despair in it and others some inner conflict terrible as remorse it was the inscrutable glance of helplessness that must perforce consign its desires to the depths of its own heart or of a miser enjoying in imagination all the pleasures that his money could procure for him while he declines to lessen his hoard the look of a bound prometheus of the fallen napoleon of 1815 when he learned at the elysee the strategical blunder that his enemies had made and asked for twentyfour hours of command in vain or rather it was the same look that raphael had turned upon the seine or upon his last piece of gold at the gamingtable only a few months ago

he was submitting his intelligence and his will to the homely commonsense of an old peasant whom fifty years of domestic service had scarcely civilized he had given up all the rights of life in order to live he had despoiled his soul of all the romance that lies in a wish and almost rejoiced at thus becoming a sort of automaton the better to struggle with the cruel power that he had challenged he had followed origens example and had maimed and chastened his imagination

the day after he had seen the diminution of the magic skin at his sudden accession of wealth he happened to be at his notarys house a wellknown physician had told them quite seriously at dessert how a swiss attacked by consumption had cured himself the man had never spoken a word for ten years and had compelled himself to draw six breaths only every minute in the close atmosphere of a cowhouse adhering all the time to a regimen of exceedingly light diet i will be like that man thought raphael to himself he wanted life at any price and so he led the life of a machine in the midst of all the luxury around him

the old professor confronted this youthful corpse and shuddered there seemed something unnatural about the meagre enfeebled frame in the marquis with his eager eyes and careworn forehead he could hardly recognize the freshcheeked and rosy pupil with the active limbs whom he remembered if the worthy classicist sage critic and general preserver of the traditions of correct taste had read byron he would have thought that he had come on a manfred when he looked to find childe harold

good day pere porriquet said raphael pressing the old schoolmasters frozen fingers in his own damp ones how are you

i am very well replied the other alarmed by the touch of that feverish hand but how about you
oh i am hoping to keep myself in health

you are engaged in some great work no doubt

no raphael answered exegi monumemtum pere porriquet i have contributed an important page to science and have now bidden her farewell for ever i scarcely know where my manuscript is

the style is no doubt correct queried the schoolmaster you i hope would never have adopted the barbarous language of the new school which fancies it has worked such wonders by discovering ronsard

my work treats of physiology pure and simple

oh then there is no more to be said the schoolmaster answered grammar must yield to the exigencies of discovery nevertheless young man a lucid and harmonious style—the diction of massillon of m de buffon of the great racine—a classical style in short can never spoil anything——but my friend the schoolmaster interrupted himself i was forgetting the object of my visit which concerns my own interests

too late raphael recalled to mind the verbose eloquence and elegant circumlocutions which in a long professorial career had grown habitual to his old tutor and almost regretted that he had admitted him but just as he was about to wish to see him safely outside he promptly suppressed his secret desire with a stealthy glance at the magic skin it hung there before him fastened down upon some white material surrounded by a red line accurately traced about its prophetic outlines since that fatal carouse raphael had stifled every least whim and had lived so as not to cause the slightest movement in the terrible talisman the magic skin was like a tiger with which he must live without exciting its ferocity he bore patiently therefore with the old schoolmasters prolixity

porriquet spent an hour in telling him about the persecutions directed against him ever since the revolution of july the worthy man having a liking for strong governments had expressed the patriotic wish that grocers should be left to their counters statesmen to the management of public business advocates to the palais de justice and peers of france to the luxembourg but one of the popularityseeking ministers of the citizen king had ousted him from his chair on an accusation of carlism and the old man now found himself without pension or post and with no bread to eat as he played the part of guardian angel to a poor nephew for whose schooling at saint sulpice he was paying he came less on his own account than for his adopted childs sake to entreat his former pupils interest with the new minister he did not ask to be reinstated but only for a position at the head of some provincial school

qraphael had fallen a victim to unconquerable drowsiness by the time that the worthy mans monotonous voice ceased to sound in his ears civility had compelled him to look at the pale and unmoving eyes of the deliberate and tedious old narrator till he himself had reached stupefaction magnetized in an inexplicable way by the power of inertia

well my dear pere porriquet he said not very certain what the question was to which he was replying but i can do nothing for you nothing at all i wish very heartily that you may succeed——

all at once without seeing the change wrought on the old mans sallow and wrinkled brow by these conventional phrases full of indifference and selfishness raphael sprang to his feet like a startled roebuck he saw a thin white line between the black piece of hide and the red tracing about it and gave a cry so fearful that the poor professor was frightened by it

old fool go he cried you will be appointed as headmaster couldnt you have asked me for an annuity of a thousand crowns rather than a murderous wish your visit would have cost me nothing there are a hundred thousand situations to be had in france but i have only one life a mans life is worth more than all the situations in the world—jonathan

jonathan appeared

this is your doing doubledistilled idiot what made you suggest that i should see m porriquet and he pointed to the old man who was petrified with fright did i put myself in your hands for you to tear me in pieces you have just shortened my life by ten years another blunder of this kind and you will lay me where i have laid my father would i not far rather have possessed the beautiful foedora and i have obliged that old hulk instead—that rag of humanity i had money enough for him and moreover if all the porriquets in the world were dying of hunger what is that to me

raphaels face was white with anger a slight froth marked his trembling lips there was a savage gleam in his eyes the two elders shook with terror in his presence like two children at the sight of a snake the young man fell back in his armchair a kind of reaction took place in him the tears flowed fast from his angry eyes

oh my life he cried that fair life of mine never to know a kindly thought again to love no more nothing is left to me

he turned to the professor and went on in a gentle voice—the harm is done my old friend your services have been well repaid and my misfortune has at any rate contributed to the welfare of a good and worthy man

his tones betrayed so much feeling that the almost unintelligible words drew tears from the two old men such tears as are shed over some pathetic song in a foreign tongue

he is epileptic muttered porriquet

i understand your kind intentions my friend raphael answered gently you would make excuses for me illhealth cannot be helped but ingratitude is a grievous fault leave me now he added tomorrow or the next day or possibly tonight you will receive your appointment resistance has triumphed over motion farewell

the old schoolmaster went away full of keen apprehension as to valentins sanity a thrill of horror ran through him there had been something supernatural he thought in the scene he had passed through he could hardly believe his own impressions and questioned them like one awakened from a painful dream

now attend to me jonathan said the young man to his old servant try to understand the charge confided to you

yes my lord marquis

i am as a man outlawed from humanity

yes my lord marquis

all the pleasures of life disport themselves round my bed of death and dance about me like fair women but if i beckon to them i must die death always confronts me you must be the barrier between the world and me

yes my lord marquis said the old servant wiping the drops of perspiration from his wrinkled forehead but if you dont wish to see pretty women how will you manage at the italiens this evening an english family is returning to london and i have taken their box for the rest of the season and it is in a splendid position—superb in the first row

raphael deep in his own deep musings paid no attention to him

do you see that splendid equipage a brougham painted a dark brown color but with the arms of an ancient and noble family shining from the panels as it rolls past all the shopgirls admire it and look longingly at the yellow satin lining the rugs from la savonnerie the daintiness and freshness of every detail the silken cushions and tightlyfitting glass windows two liveried footmen are mounted behind this aristocratic carriage and within a head lies back among the silken cushions the feverish face and hollow eyes of raphael melancholy and sad emblem of the doom of wealth he flies across paris like a rocket and reaches the peristyle of the theatre favart the passersby make way for him the two footmen help him to alight an envious crowd looking on the while

what has that fellow done to be so rich asks a poor lawstudent who cannot listen to the magical music of rossini for lack of a fivefranc piece

raphael walked slowly along the gangway he expected no enjoyment from these pleasures he had once coveted so eagerly in the interval before the second act of semiramide he walked up and down in the lobby and along the corridors leaving his box which he had not yet entered to look after itself the instinct of property was dead within him already like all invalids he thought of nothing but his own sufferings he was leaning against the chimneypiece in the greenroom a group had gathered about it of dandies young and old of ministers of peers without peerages and peerages without peers for so the revolution of july had ordered matters among a host of adventurers and journalists in fact raphael beheld a strange unearthly figure a few paces away among the crowd he went towards this grotesque object to see it better halfclosing his eyes with exceeding superciliousness

what a wonderful bit of painting he said to himself the strangers hair and eyebrows and a mazarin tuft on the chin had been dyed black but the result was a spurious glossy purple tint that varied its hues according to the light the hair had been too white no doubt to take the preparation anxiety and cunning were depicted in the narrow insignificant face with its wrinkles incrusted by thick layers of red and white paint this red enamel lacking on some portions of his face strongly brought out his natural feebleness and livid hues it was impossible not to smile at this visage with the protuberant forehead and pointed chin a face not unlike those grotesque wooden figures that german herdsmen carve in their spare moments

an attentive observer looking from raphael to this elderly adonis would have remarked a young mans eyes set in a mask of age in the case of the marquis and in the other case the dim eyes of age peering forth from behind a mask of youth valentin tried to recollect when and where he had seen this little old man before he was thin fastidiously cravatted booted and spurred like oneandtwenty he crossed his arms and clinked his spurs as if he possessed all the wanton energy of youth he seemed to move about without constraint or difficulty he had carefully buttoned up his fashionable coat which disguised his powerful elderly frame and gave him the appearance of an antiquated coxcomb who still follows the fashions

for raphael this animated puppet possessed all the interest of an apparition he gazed at it as if it had been some smokebegrimed rembrandt recently restored and newly framed this idea found him a clue to the truth among his confused recollections he recognized the dealer in antiquities the man to whom he owed his calamities

a noiseless laugh broke just then from the fantastical personage straightening the line of his lips that stretched across a row of artificial teeth that laugh brought out for raphaels heated fancy a strong resemblance between the man before him and the type of head that painters have assigned to goethes mephistopheles a crowd of superstitious thoughts entered raphaels sceptical mind he was convinced of the powers of the devil and of all the sorcerers enchantments embodied in mediaeval tradition and since worked up by poets shrinking in horror from the destiny of faust he prayed for the protection of heaven with all the ardent faith of a dying man in god and the virgin a clear bright radiance seemed to give him a glimpse of the heaven of michael angelo or of raphael of urbino a venerable whitebearded man a beautiful woman seated in an aureole above the clouds and winged cherub heads now he had grasped and received the meaning of those imaginative almost human creations they seemed to explain what had happened to him to leave him yet one hope

but when the greenroom of the italiens returned upon his sight he beheld not the virgin but a very handsome young person the execrable euphrasia in all the splendor of her toilette with its orient pearls had come thither impatient for her ardent elderly admirer she was insolently exhibiting herself with her defiant face and glittering eyes to an envious crowd of stockbrokers a visible testimony to the inexhaustible wealth that the old dealer permitted her to squander

raphael recollected the mocking wish with which he had accepted the old mans luckless gift and tasted all the sweets of revenge when he beheld the spectacle of sublime wisdom fallen to such a depth as this wisdom for which such humiliation had seemed a thing impossible the centenarian greeted euphrasia with a ghastly smile receiving her honeyed words in reply he offered her his emaciated arm and went twice or thrice round the greenroom with her the envious glances and compliments with which the crowd received his mistress delighted him he did not see the scornful smiles nor hear the caustic comments to which he gave rise

in what cemetery did this young ghoul unearth that corpse of hers asked a dandy of the romantic faction

euphrasia began to smile the speaker was a slender fairhaired youth with bright blue eyes and a moustache his short dress coat hat tilted over one ear and sharp tongue all denoted the species

how many old men said raphael to himself bring an upright virtuous and hardworking life to a close in folly his feet are cold already and he is making love

well sir exclaimed valentin stopping the merchants progress while he stared hard at euphrasia have you quite forgotten the stringent maxims of your philosophy

ah i am as happy now as a young man said the other in a cracked voice i used to look at existence from a wrong standpoint one hour of love has a whole life in it

the playgoers heard the bell ring and left the greenroom to take their places again raphael and the old merchant separated as he entered his box the marquis saw foedora sitting exactly opposite to him on the other side of the theatre the countess had probably only just come for she was just flinging off her scarf to leave her throat uncovered and was occupied with going through all the indescribable manoeuvres of a coquette arranging herself all eyes were turned upon her a young peer of france had come with her she asked him for the lorgnette she had given him to carry raphael knew the despotism to which his successor had resigned himself in her gestures and in the way she treated her companion he was also under the spell no doubt another dupe beating with all the might of a real affection against the womans cold calculations enduring all the tortures from which valentin had luckily freed himself

foedoras face lighted up with indescribable joy after directing her lorgnette upon every box in turn to make a rapid survey of all the dresses she was conscious that by her toilette and her beauty she had eclipsed the loveliest and bestdressed women in paris she laughed to show her white teeth her head with its wreath of flowers was never still in her quest of admiration her glances went from one box to another as she diverted herself with the awkward way in which a russian princess wore her bonnet or over the utter failure of a bonnet with which a bankers daughter had disfigured herself

all at once she met raphaels steady gaze and turned pale aghast at the intolerable contempt in her rejected lovers eyes not one of her exiled suitors had failed to own her power over them valentin alone was proof against her attractions a power that can be defied with impunity is drawing to its end this axiom is as deeply engraved on the heart of woman as in the minds of kings in raphael therefore foedora saw the deathblow of her influence and her ability to please an epigram of his made at the opera the day before was already known in the salons of paris the biting edge of that terrible speech had already given the countess an incurable wound we know how to cauterize a wound but we know of no treatment as yet for the stab of a phrase as every other woman in the house looked by turns at her and at the marquis foedora would have consigned them all to the oubliettes of some bastille for in spite of her capacity for dissimulation her discomfiture was discerned by her rivals her unfailing consolation had slipped from her at last the delicious thought i am the most beautiful the thought that at all times had soothed every mortification had turned into a lie

at the opening of the second act a woman took up her position not very far from raphael in a box that had been empty hitherto a murmur of admiration went up from the whole house in that sea of human faces there was a movement of every living wave all eyes were turned upon the stranger lady the applause of young and old was so prolonged that when the orchestra began the musicians turned to the audience to request silence and then they themselves joined in the plaudits and swelled the confusion excited talk began in every box every woman equipped herself with an opera glass elderly men grew young again and polished the glasses of their lorgnettes with their gloves the enthusiasm subsided by degrees the stage echoed with the voices of the singers and order reigned as before the aristocratic section ashamed of having yielded to a spontaneous feeling again assumed their wonted politely frigid manner the welltodo dislike to be astonished at anything at the first sight of a beautiful thing it becomes their duty to discover the defect in it which absolves them from admiring it—the feeling of all ordinary minds yet a few still remained motionless and heedless of the music artlessly absorbed in the delight of watching raphaels neighbor

valentin noticed taillefers mean obnoxious countenance by aquilinas side in a lower box and received an approving smirk from him then he saw emile who seemed to say from where he stood in the orchestra just look at that lovely creature there close beside you lastly he saw rastignac with mme de nucingen and her daughter twisting his gloves like a man in despair because he was tethered to his place and could not leave it to go any nearer to the unknown fair divinity

raphaels life depended upon a covenant that he had made with himself and had hitherto kept sacred he would give no special heed to any woman whatever and the better to guard against temptation he used a cunningly contrived operaglass which destroyed the harmony of the fairest features by hideous distortions he had not recovered from the terror that had seized on him in the morning when at a mere expression of civility the magic skin had contracted so abruptly so raphael was determined not to turn his face in the direction of his neighbor he sat imperturbable as a duchess with his back against the corner of the box thereby shutting out half of his neighbors view of the stage appearing to disregard her and even to be unaware that a pretty woman sat there just behind him

his neighbor copied valentins position exactly she leaned her elbow on the edge of her box and turned her face in threequarter profile upon the singers on the stage as if she were sitting to a painter these two people looked like two estranged lovers still sulking still turning their backs upon each other who will go into each others arms at the first tender word

now and again his neighbors ostrich feathers or her hair came in contact with raphaels head giving him a pleasurable thrill against which he sternly fought in a little while he felt the touch of the soft frill of lace that went round her dress he could hear the gracious sounds of the folds of her dress itself light rustling noises full of enchantment he could even feel her movements as she breathed with the gentle stir thus imparted to her form and to her draperies it seemed to raphael that all her being was suddenly communicated to him in an electric spark the lace and tulle that caressed him imparted the delicious warmth of her bare white shoulders by a freak in the ordering of things these two creatures kept apart by social conventions with the abysses of death between them breathed together and perhaps thought of one another finally the subtle perfume of aloes completed the work of raphaels intoxication opposition heated his imagination and his fancy become the wilder for the limits imposed upon it sketched a woman for him in outlines of fire he turned abruptly the stranger made a similar movement startled no doubt at being brought in contact with a stranger and they remained face to face each with the same thought

pauline

m raphael

each surveyed the other both of them petrified with astonishment raphael noticed paulines daintily simple costume a womans experienced eyes would have discerned and admired the outlines beneath the modest gauze folds of her bodice and the lily whiteness of her throat and then her more than mortal clearness of soul her maidenly modesty her graceful bearing all were unchanged her sleeve was quivering with agitation for the beating of her heart was shaking her whole frame

come to the hotel de saintquentin tomorrow for your papers she said i will be there at noon be punctual

she rose hastily and disappeared raphael thought of following pauline feared to compromise her and stayed he looked at foedora she seemed to him positively ugly unable to understand a single phrase of the music and feeling stifled in the theatre he went out and returned home with a full heart

jonathan he said to the old servant as soon as he lay in bed give me half a drop of laudanum on a piece of sugar and dont wake me tomorrow till twenty minutes to twelve

i want pauline to love me he cried next morning looking at the talisman the while in unspeakable anguish

the skin did not move in the least it seemed to have lost its power to shrink doubtless it could not fulfil a wish fulfilled already

ah exclaimed raphael feeling as if a mantle of lead had fallen away which he had worn ever since the day when the talisman had been given to him so you are playing me false you are not obeying me the pact is broken i am free i shall live then was it all a wretched joke but he did not dare to believe in his own thought as he uttered it

he dressed himself as simply as had formerly been his wont and set out on foot for his old lodging trying to go back in fancy to the happy days when he abandoned himself without peril to vehement desires the days when he had not yet condemned all human enjoyment as he walked he beheld pauline—not the pauline of the hotel saintquentin but the pauline of last evening here was the accomplished mistress he had so often dreamed of the intelligent young girl with the loving nature and artistic temperament who understood poets who understood poetry and lived in luxurious surroundings here in short was foedora gifted with a great soul or pauline become a countess and twice a millionaire as foedora had been when he reached the worn threshold and stood upon the broken step at the door where in the old days he had had so many desperate thoughts an old woman came out of the room within and spoke to him

you are m raphael de valentin are you not

yes good mother he replied

you know your old room then she replied you are expected up there

does mme gaudin still own the house raphael asked

oh no sir mme gaudin is a baroness now she lives in a fine house of her own on the other side of the river her husband has come back my goodness he brought back thousands and thousands they say she could buy up all the quartier saintjacques if she liked she gave me her basement room for nothing and the remainder of her lease ah shes a kind woman all the same she is no more proud today than she was yesterday

raphael hurried up the staircase to his garret as he reached the last few steps he heard the sounds of a piano pauline was there simply dressed in a cotton gown but the way that it was made like the gloves hat and shawl that she had thrown carelessly upon the bed revealed a change of fortune

ah there you are cried pauline turning her head and rising with unconcealed delight

raphael went to sit beside her flushed confused and happy he looked at her in silence

why did you leave us then she asked dropping her eyes as the flush deepened on his face what became of you

ah i have been very miserable pauline i am very miserable still

alas she said filled with pitying tenderness i guessed your fate yesterday when i saw you so well dressed and apparently so wealthy but in reality eh m raphael is it as it always used to be with you

valentin could not restrain the tears that sprang to his eyes

pauline he exclaimed i——

he went no further love sparkled in his eyes and his emotion overflowed his face

oh he loves me he loves me cried pauline

raphael felt himself unable to say one word he bent his head the young girl took his hand at this she pressed it as she said half sobbing and half laughing—

rich rich happy and rich your pauline is rich but i oh i ought to be very poor today i have said times without number that i would give all the wealth upon this earth for those words he loves me o my raphael i have millions you like luxury you will be glad but you must love me and my heart besides for there is so much love for you in my heart you dont know my father has come back i am a wealthy heiress both he and my mother leave me completely free to decide my own fate i am free—do you understand

seized with a kind of frenzy raphael grasped paulines hands and kissed them eagerly and vehemently with an almost convulsive caress pauline drew her hands away laid them on raphaels shoulders and drew him towards her they understood one another—in that close embrace in the unalloyed and sacred fervor of that one kiss without an afterthought—the first kiss by which two souls take possession of each other

ah i will not leave you any more said pauline falling back in her chair i do not know how i come to be so bold she added blushing

bold my pauline do not fear it it is love love true and deep and everlasting like my own is it not

speak she cried go on speaking so long your lips have been dumb for me

then you have loved me all along

loved you mon dieu how often i have wept here setting your room straight and grieving for your poverty and my own i would have sold myself to the evil one to spare you one vexation you are my raphael today really my own raphael with that handsome head of yours and your heart is mine too yes that above all your heart—o wealth inexhaustible well where was i she went on after a pause oh yes we have three four or five millions i believe if i were poor i should perhaps desire to bear your name to be acknowledged as your wife but as it is i would give up the whole world for you i would be your servant still now and always why raphael if i give you my fortune my heart myself today i do no more than i did that day when i put a certain fivefranc piece in the drawer there and she pointed to the table oh how your exultation hurt me then

oh why are you rich raphael cried why is there no vanity in you i can do nothing for you

he wrung his hands in despair and happiness and love

when you are the marquise de valentin i know that the title and the fortune for thee heavenly soul will not be worth——

one hair of your head she cried

i have millions too but what is wealth to either of us now there is my life—ah that i can offer take it

your love raphael your love is all the world to me are your thoughts of me i am the happiest of the happy

can any one overhear us asked raphael

nobody she replied and a mischievous gesture escaped her

come then cried valentin holding out his arms

she sprang upon his knees and clasped her arms about his neck

kiss me she cried after all the pain you have given me to blot out the memory of the grief that your joys have caused me and for the sake of the nights that i spent in painting handscreens——

those handscreens of yours

now that we are rich my darling i can tell you all about it poor boy how easy it is to delude a clever man could you have had white waistcoats and clean shirts twice a week for three francs every month to the laundress why you used to drink twice as much milk as your money would have paid for i deceived you all round—over firing oil and even money o raphael mine dont have me for your wife i am far too cunning she said laughing

but how did you manage

i used to work till two oclock in the morning i gave my mother half the money made by my screens and the other half went to you

they looked at one another for a moment both bewildered by love and gladness

some day we shall have to pay for this happiness by some terrible sorrow cried raphael

perhaps you are married said pauline oh i will not give you up to any other woman

i am free my beloved

free she repeated free and mine

she slipped down upon her knees clasped her hands and looked at raphael in an enthusiasm of devotion

i am afraid i shall go mad how handsome you are she went on passing her fingers through her lovers fair hair how stupid your countess foedora is how pleased i was yesterday with the homage they all paid to me she has never been applauded dear when i felt your arm against my back i heard a vague voice within me that cried he is there and i turned round and saw you i fled for i longed so to throw my arms about you before them all

how happy you are—you can speak raphael exclaimed my heart is overwhelmed i would weep but i cannot do not draw your hand away i could stay here looking at you like this for the rest of my life i think happy and content

o my love say that once more

ah what are words answered valentin letting a hot tear fall on paulines hands some time i will try to tell you of my love just now i can only feel it

you she said with your lofty soul and your great genius with that heart of yours that i know so well are you really mine as i am yours

for ever and ever my sweet creature said raphael in an uncertain voice you shall be my wife my protecting angel my griefs have always been dispelled by your presence and my courage revived that angelic smile now on your lips has purified me so to speak a new life seems about to begin for me the cruel past and my wretched follies are hardly more to me than evil dreams at your side i breathe an atmosphere of happiness and i am pure be with me always he added pressing her solemnly to his beating heart

death may come when it will said pauline in ecstasy i have lived

happy he who shall divine their joy for he must have experienced it

i wish that no one might enter this dear garret again my raphael said pauline after two hours of silence

we must have the door walled up put bars across the window and buy the house the marquis answered

yes we will she said then a moment later she added our search for your manuscripts has been a little lost sight of and they both laughed like children

pshaw i dont care a jot for the whole circle of the sciences raphael answered

ah sir and how about glory

i glory in you alone

you used to be very miserable as you made these little scratches and scrawls she said turning the papers over

my pauline——

oh yes i am your pauline—and what then

where are you living now

in the rue saint lazare and you

in the rue de varenne

what a long way apart we shall be until—— she stopped and looked at her lover with a mischievous and coquettish expression

but at the most we need only be separated for a fortnight raphael answered

really we are to be married in a fortnight and she jumped for joy like a child

i am an unnatural daughter she went on i give no more thought to my father or my mother or to anything in the world poor love you dont know that my father is very ill he returned from the indies in very bad health he nearly died at havre where we went to find him good heavens she cried looking at her watch it is three oclock already i ought to be back again when he wakes at four i am mistress of the house at home my mother does everything that i wish and my father worships me but i will not abuse their kindness that would be wrong my poor father he would have me go to the italiens yesterday you will come to see him tomorrow will you not

will madame la marquise de valentin honor me by taking my arm

i am going to take the key of this room away with me she said isnt our treasurehouse a palace

one more kiss pauline

a thousand mon dieu she said looking at raphael will it always be like this i feel as if i were dreaming

they went slowly down the stairs together step for step with arms closely linked trembling both of them beneath their load of joy each pressing close to the others side like a pair of doves they reached the place de la sorbonne where paulines carriage was waiting

i want to go home with you she said i want to see your own room and your study and to sit at the table where you work it will be like old times she said blushing

she spoke to the servant joseph before returning home i am going to the rue de varenne it is a quarterpast three now and i must be back by four oclock george must hurry the horses and so in a few moments the lovers came to valentins abode

how glad i am to have seen all this for myself pauline cried creasing the silken bedcurtains in raphaels room between her fingers as i go to sleep i shall be here in thought i shall imagine your dear head on the pillow there raphael tell me did no one advise you about the furniture of your hotel

no one whatever

really it was not a woman who——

pauline

oh i know i am fearfully jealous you have good taste i will have a bed like yours tomorrow

quite beside himself with happiness raphael caught pauline in his arms

oh my father she said my father——

i will take you back to him cried valentin for i want to be away from you as little as possible

how loving you are i did not venture to suggest it——

are you not my life

it would be tedious to set down accurately the charming prattle of the lovers for tones and looks and gestures that cannot be rendered alone gave it significance valentin went back with pauline to her own door and returned with as much happiness in his heart as mortal man can know

when he was seated in his armchair beside the fire thinking over the sudden and complete way in which his wishes had been fulfilled a cold shiver went through him as if the blade of a dagger had been plunged into his breast—he thought of the magic skin and saw that it had shrunk a little he uttered the most tremendous of french oaths without any of the jesuitical reservations made by the abbess of andouillettes leant his head against the back of the chair and sat motionless fixing his unseeing eyes upon the bracket of the curtain pole

good god he cried every wish every desire of mine poor pauline——

he took a pair of compasses and measured the extent of existence that the morning had cost him

i have scarcely enough for two months he said

a cold sweat broke out over him moved by an ungovernable spasm of rage he seized the magic skin exclaiming

i am a perfect fool

he rushed out of the house and across the garden and flung the talisman down a well

vogue la galere cried he the devil take all this nonsense

so raphael gave himself up to the happiness of being beloved and led with pauline the life of heart and heart difficulties which it would be somewhat tedious to describe had delayed their marriage which was to take place early in march each was sure of the other their affection had been tried and happiness had taught them how strong it was never has love made two souls two natures so absolutely one the more they came to know of each other the more they loved on either side there was the same hesitating delicacy the same transports of joy such as angels know there were no clouds in their heaven the will of either was the others law

wealthy as they both were they had not a caprice which they could not gratify and for that reason had no caprices a refined taste a feeling for beauty and poetry was instinct in the soul of the bride her lovers smile was more to her than all the pearls of ormuz she disdained feminine finery a muslin dress and flowers formed her most elaborate toilette

pauline and raphael shunned every one else for solitude was abundantly beautiful to them the idlers at the opera or at the italiens saw this charming and unconventional pair evening after evening some gossip went the round of the salons at first but the harmless lovers were soon forgotten in the course of events which took place in paris their marriage was announced at length to excuse them in the eyes of the prudish and as it happened their servants did not babble so their bliss did not draw down upon them any very severe punishment

one morning towards the end of february at the time when the brightening days bring a belief in the nearness of the joys of spring pauline and raphael were breakfasting together in a small conservatory a kind of drawingroom filled with flowers on a level with the garden the mild rays of the pale winter sunlight breaking through the thicket of exotic plants warmed the air somewhat the vivid contrast made by the varieties of foliage the colors of the masses of flowering shrubs the freaks of light and shadow gladdened the eyes while all the rest of paris still sought warmth from its melancholy hearth these two were laughing in a bower of camellias lilacs and blossoming heath their happy faces rose above lilies of the valley narcissus blooms and bengal roses a mat of plaited african grass variegated like a carpet lay beneath their feet in this luxurious conservatory the walls covered with a green linen material bore no traces of damp the surfaces of the rustic wooden furniture shone with cleanliness a kitten attracted by the odor of milk had established itself upon the table it allowed pauline to bedabble it in coffee she was playing merrily with it taking away the cream that she had just allowed the kitten to sniff at so as to exercise its patience and keep up the contest she burst out laughing at every antic and by the comical remarks she constantly made she hindered raphael from perusing the paper he had dropped it a dozen times already this morning picture seemed to overflow with inexpressible gladness like everything that is natural and genuine

raphael still pretending to read his paper furtively watched pauline with the cat—his pauline in the dressinggown that hung carelessly about her his pauline with her hair loose on her shoulders with a tiny white blueveined foot peeping out of a velvet slipper it was pleasant to see her in this negligent dress she was delightful as some fanciful picture by westall halfgirl halfwoman as she seemed to be or perhaps more of a girl than a woman there was no alloy in the happiness she enjoyed and of love she knew as yet only its first ecstasy when raphael absorbed in happy musing had forgotten the existence of the newspaper pauline flew upon it crumpled it up into a ball and threw it out into the garden the kitten sprang after the rotating object which spun round and round as politics are wont to do this childish scene recalled raphael to himself he would have gone on reading and felt for the sheet he no longer possessed joyous laughter rang out like the song of a bird one peal leading to another

i am quite jealous of the paper she said as she wiped away the tears that her childlike merriment had brought into her eyes now is it not a heinous offence she went on as she became a woman all at once to read russian proclamations in my presence and to attend to the prosings of the emperor nicholas rather than to looks and words of love

i was not reading my dear angel i was looking at you

just then the gravel walk outside the conservatory rang with the sound of the gardeners heavily nailed boots

i beg your pardon my lord marquis—and yours too madame—if i am intruding but i have brought you a curiosity the like of which i never set eyes on drawing a bucket of water just now with due respect i got out this strange saltwater plant here it is it must be thoroughly used to water anyhow for it isnt saturated or even damp at all it is as dry as a piece of wood and has not swelled a bit as my lord marquis certainly knows a great deal more about things than i do i thought i ought to bring it and that it would interest him

therewith the gardener showed raphael the inexorable piece of skin there were barely six square inches of it left

thanks vaniere raphael said the thing is very curious

what is the matter with you my angel you are growing quite white pauline cried

you can go vaniere

your voice frightens me the girl went on it is so strangely altered what is it how are you feeling where is the pain you are in pain—jonathan here call a doctor she cried

hush my pauline raphael answered as he regained composure let us get up and go some flower here has a scent that is too much for me it is that verbena perhaps

pauline flew upon the innocent plant seized it by the stalk and flung it out into the garden then with all the might of the love between them she clasped raphael in a close embrace and with languishing coquetry raised her red lips to his for a kiss

dear angel she cried when i saw you turn so white i understood that i could not live on without you your life is my life too lay your hand on my back raphael mine i feel a chill like death the feeling of cold is there yet your lips are burning how is your hand—cold as ice she added

mad girl exclaimed raphael

why that tear let me drink it

o pauline pauline you love me far too much

there is something very extraordinary going on in your mind raphael do not dissimulate i shall very soon find out your secret give that to me she went on taking the magic skin

you are my executioner the young man exclaimed glancing in horror at the talisman

how changed your voice is cried pauline as she dropped the fatal symbol of destiny

do you love me he asked

do i love you is there any doubt

then leave me go away

the poor child went

so cried raphael when he was alone in an enlightened age when we have found out that diamonds are a crystallized form of charcoal at a time when everything is made clear when the police would hale a new messiah before the magistrates and submit his miracles to the academie des sciences—in an epoch when we no longer believe in anything but a notarys signature—that i forsooth should believe in a sort of mene tekel upharsin no by heaven i will not believe that the supreme being would take pleasure in torturing a harmless creature—let us see the learned about it

between the halle des vins with its extensive assembly of barrels and the salpetriere that extensive seminary of drunkenness lies a small pond which raphael soon reached all sorts of ducks of rare varieties were there disporting themselves their colored markings shone in the sun like the glass in cathedral windows every kind of duck in the world was represented quacking dabbling and moving about—a kind of parliament of ducks assembled against its will but luckily without either charter or political principles living in complete immunity from sportsmen under the eyes of any naturalist that chanced to see them

that is m lavrille said one of the keepers to raphael who had asked for that high priest of zoology

the marquis saw a short man buried in profound reflections caused by the appearance of a pair of ducks the man of science was middleaged he had a pleasant face made pleasanter still by a kindly expression but an absorption in scientific ideas engrossed his whole person his peruke was strangely turned up by being constantly raised to scratch his head so that a line of white hair was left plainly visible a witness to an enthusiasm for investigation which like every other strong passion so withdraws us from mundane considerations that we lose all consciousness of the i within us raphael the student and man of science looked respectfully at the naturalist who devoted his nights to enlarging the limits of human knowledge and whose very errors reflected glory upon france but a shecoxcomb would have laughed no doubt at the break of continuity between the breeches and striped waistcoat worn by the man of learning the interval moreover was modestly filled by a shirt which had been considerably creased for he stooped and raised himself by turns as his zoological observations required

after the first interchange of civilities raphael thought it necessary to pay m lavrille a banal compliment upon his ducks

oh we are well off for ducks the naturalist replied the genus moreover as you doubtless know is the most prolific in the order of palmipeds it begins with the swan and ends with the zinzin duck comprising in all one hundred and thirtyseven very distinct varieties each having its own name habits country and character and every one no more like another than a white man is like a negro really sir when we dine off a duck we have no notion for the most part of the vast extent——

he interrupted himself as he saw a small pretty duck come up to the surface of the pond

there you see the cravatted swan a poor native of canada he has come a very long way to show us his brown and gray plumage and his little black cravat look he is preening himself that one is the famous eider duck that provides the down the eiderdown under which our fine ladies sleep isnt it pretty who would not admire the little pinkish white breast and the green beak i have just been a witness sir he went on to a marriage that i had long despaired of bringing about they have paired rather auspiciously and i shall await the results very eagerly this will be a hundred and thirtyeighth species i flatter myself to which perhaps my name will be given that is the newly matched pair he said pointing out two of the ducks one of them is a laughing goose anas albifrons and the other the great whistling duck buffons anas ruffina i have hesitated a long while between the whistling duck the duck with white eyebrows and the shoveler duck anas clypeata stay that is the shoveler—that fat brownish black rascal with the greenish neck and that coquettish iridescence on it but the whistling duck was a crested one sir and you will understand that i deliberated no longer we only lack the variegated blackcapped duck now these gentlemen here unanimously claim that that variety of duck is only a repetition of the curvebeaked teal but for my own part—and the gesture he made was worth seeing it expressed at once the modesty and pride of a man of science the pride full of obstinacy and the modesty well tempered with assurance

i dont think it is he added you see my dear sir that we are not amusing ourselves here i am engaged at this moment upon a monograph on the genus duck but i am at your disposal

while they went towards a rather pleasant house in the rue du buffon raphael submitted the skin to m lavrilles inspection

i know the product said the man of science when he had turned his magnifying glass upon the talisman it used to be used for covering boxes the shagreen is very old they prefer to use skates skin nowadays for making sheaths this as you are doubtless aware is the hide of the raja sephen a red sea fish

but this sir since you are so exceedingly good——

this the man of science interrupted as he resumed this is quite another thing between these two shagreens sir there is a difference just as wide as between sea and land or fish and flesh the fishs skin is harder however than the skin of the land animal this he said as he indicated the talisman is as you doubtless know one of the most curious of zoological products

but to proceed—— said raphael

this replied the man of science as he flung himself down into his armchair is an ass skin sir

yes i know said the young man

a very rare variety of ass found in persia the naturalist continued the onager of the ancients equus asinus the koulan of the tartars pallas went out there to observe it and has made it known to science for as a matter of fact the animal for a long time was believed to be mythical it is mentioned as you know in holy scripture moses forbade that it should be coupled with its own species and the onager is yet more famous for the prostitutions of which it was the object and which are often mentioned by the prophets of the bible pallas as you know doubtless states in his act petrop tome ii that these bizarre excesses are still devoutly believed in among the persians and the nogais as a sovereign remedy for lumbago and sciatic gout we poor parisians scarcely believe that the museum has no example of the onager

what a magnificent animal he continued it is full of mystery its eyes are provided with a sort of burnished covering to which the orientals attribute the powers of fascination it has a glossier and finer coat than our handsomest horses possess striped with more or less tawny bands very much like the zebras hide there is something pliant and silky about its hair which is sleek to the touch its powers of sight vie in precision and accuracy with those of man it is rather larger than our largest domestic donkeys and is possessed of extraordinary courage if it is surprised by any chance it defends itself against the most dangerous wild beasts with remarkable success the rapidity of its movements can only be compared with the flight of birds an onager sir would run the best arab or persian horses to death according to the father of the conscientious doctor niebuhr whose recent loss we are deploring as you doubtless know the ordinary average pace of one of these wonderful creatures would be seven thousand geometric feet per hour our own degenerate race of donkeys can give no idea of the ass in his pride and independence he is active and spirited in his demeanor he is cunning and sagacious there is grace about the outlines of his head every movement is full of attractive charm in the east he is the king of beasts turkish and persian superstition even credits him with a mysterious origin and when stories of the prowess attributed to him are told in thibet or in tartary the speakers mingle solomons name with that of this noble animal a tame onager in short is worth an enormous amount it is wellnigh impossible to catch them among the mountains where they leap like roebucks and seem as if they could fly like birds our myth of the winged horse our pegasus had its origin doubtless in these countries where the shepherds could see the onager springing from one rock to another in persia they breed asses for the saddle a cross between a tamed onager and a sheass and they paint them red following immemorial tradition perhaps it was this custom that gave rise to our own proverb surely as a red donkey at some period when natural history was much neglected in france i think a traveler must have brought over one of these strange beasts that endures servitude with such impatience hence the adage the skin that you have laid before me is the skin of an onager opinions differ as to the origin of the name some claim that chagri is a turkish word others insist that chagri must be the name of the place where this animal product underwent the chemical process of preparation so clearly described by pallas to which the peculiar graining that we admire is due martellens has written to me saying that chaagri is a river——

i thank you sir for the information that you have given me it would furnish an admirable footnote for some dom calmet or other if such erudite hermits yet exist but i have had the honor of pointing out to you that this scrap was in the first instance quite as large as that map said raphael indicating an open atlas to lavrille but it has shrunk visibly in three months time——

quite so said the man of science i understand the remains of any substance primarily organic are naturally subject to a process of decay it is quite easy to understand and its progress depends upon atmospherical conditions even metals contract and expand appreciably for engineers have remarked somewhat considerable interstices between great blocks of stone originally clamped together with iron bars the field of science is boundless but human life is very short so that we do not claim to be acquainted with all the phenomena of nature

pardon the question that i am about to ask you sir raphael began half embarrassed but are you quite sure that this piece of skin is subject to the ordinary laws of zoology and that it can be stretched

certainly——oh bother—— muttered m lavrille trying to stretch the talisman but if you sir will go to see planchette he added the celebrated professor of mechanics he will certainly discover some method of acting upon this skin of softening and expanding it

ah sir you are the preserver of my life and raphael took leave of the learned naturalist and hurried off to planchette leaving the worthy lavrille in his study all among the bottles and dried plants that filled it up

quite unconsciously raphael brought away with him from this visit all of science that man can grasp a terminology to wit lavrille the worthy man was very much like sancho panza giving to don quixote the history of the goats he was entertaining himself by making out a list of animals and ticking them off even now that his life was nearing its end he was scarcely acquainted with a mere fraction of the countless numbers of the great tribes that god has scattered for some unknown end throughout the ocean of worlds

raphael was well pleased i shall keep my ass well in hand cried he sterne had said before his day let us take care of our ass if we wish to live to old age but it is such a fantastic brute

planchette was a tall thin man a poet of a surety lost in one continual thought and always employed in gazing into the bottomless abyss of motion commonplace minds accuse these lofty intellects of madness they form a misinterpreted race apart that lives in a wonderful carelessness of luxuries or other peoples notions they will spend whole days at a stretch smoking a cigar that has gone out and enter a drawingroom with the buttons on their garments not in every case formally wedded to the buttonholes some day or other after a long time spent in measuring space or in accumulating xs under aagg they succeed in analyzing some natural law and resolve it into its elemental principles and all on a sudden the crowd gapes at a new machine or it is a handcart perhaps that overwhelms us with astonishment by the apt simplicity of its construction the modest man of science smiles at his admirers and remarks what is that invention of mine nothing whatever man cannot create a force he can but direct it and science consists in learning from nature

the mechanician was standing bolt upright planted on both feet like some victim dropped straight from the gibbet when raphael broke in upon him he was intently watching an agate ball that rolled over a sundial and awaited its final settlement the worthy man had received neither pension nor decoration he had not known how to make the right use of his ability for calculation he was happy in his life spent on the watch for a discovery he had no thought either of reputation of the outer world nor even of himself and led the life of science for the sake of science

it is inexplicable he exclaimed ah your servant sir he went on becoming aware of raphaels existence how is your mother you must go and see my wife

and i also could have lived thus thought raphael as he recalled the learned man from his meditations by asking of him how to produce any effect on the talisman which he placed before him

although my credulity must amuse you sir so the marquis ended i will conceal nothing from you that skin seems to me to be endowed with an insuperable power of resistance

people of fashion sir always treat science rather superciliously said planchette they all talk to us pretty much as the incroyable did when he brought some ladies to see lalande just after an eclipse and remarked be so good as to begin it over again what effect do you want to produce the object of the science of mechanics is either the application or the neutralization of the laws of motion as for motion pure and simple i tell you humbly that we cannot possibly define it that disposed of unvarying phenomena have been observed which accompany the actions of solids and fluids if we set up the conditions by which these phenomena are brought to pass we can transport bodies or communicate locomotive power to them at a predetermined rate of speed we can project them divide them up in a few or an infinite number of pieces accordingly as we break them or grind them to powder we can twist bodies or make them rotate modify compress expand or extend them the whole science sir rests upon a single fact

you see this ball he went on here it lies upon this slab now it is over there what name shall we give to what has taken place so natural from a physical point of view so amazing from a moral movement locomotion changing of place what prodigious vanity lurks underneath the words does a name solve the difficulty yet it is the whole of our science for all that our machines either make direct use of this agency this fact or they convert it this trifling phenomenon applied to large masses would send paris flying we can increase speed by an expenditure of force and augment the force by an increase of speed but what are speed and force our science is as powerless to tell us that as to create motion any movement whatever is an immense power and man does not create power of any kind everything is movement thought itself is a movement upon movement nature is based death is a movement whose limitations are little known if god is eternal be sure that he moves perpetually perhaps god is movement that is why movement like god is inexplicable unfathomable unlimited incomprehensible intangible who has ever touched comprehended or measured movement we feel its effects without seeing it we can even deny them as we can deny the existence of a god where is it where is it not whence comes it what is its source what is its end it surrounds us it intrudes upon us and yet escapes us it is evident as a fact obscure as an abstraction it is at once effect and cause it requires space even as we and what is space movement alone recalls it to us without movement space is but an empty meaningless word like space like creation like the infinite movement is an insoluble problem which confounds human reason man will never conceive it whatever else he may be permitted to conceive

between each point in space occupied in succession by that ball continued the man of science there is an abyss confronting human reason an abyss into which pascal fell in order to produce any effect upon an unknown substance we ought first of all to study that substance to know whether in accordance with its nature it will be broken by the force of a blow or whether it will withstand it if it breaks in pieces and you have no wish to split it up we shall not achieve the end proposed if you want to compress it a uniform impulse must be communicated to all the particles of the substance so as to diminish the interval that separates them in an equal degree if you wish to expand it we should try to bring a uniform eccentric force to bear on every molecule for unless we conform accurately to this law we shall have breaches in continuity the modes of motion sir are infinite and no limit exists to combinations of movement upon what effect have you determined

i want any kind of pressure that is strong enough to expand the skin indefinitely began raphael quite of out patience

substance is finite the mathematician put in and therefore will not admit of indefinite expansion but pressure will necessarily increase the extent of surface at the expense of the thickness which will be diminished until the point is reached when the material gives out——

bring about that result sir raphael cried and you will have earned millions

then i should rob you of your money replied the other phlegmatic as a dutchman i am going to show you in a word or two that a machine can be made that is fit to crush providence itself in pieces like a fly it would reduce a man to the conditions of a piece of waste paper a man—boots and spurs hat and cravat trinkets and gold and all——

what a fearful machine

instead of flinging their brats into the water the chinese ought to make them useful in this way the man of science went on without reflecting on the regard man has for his progeny

quite absorbed by his idea planchette took an empty flowerpot with a hole in the bottom and put it on the surface of the dial then he went to look for a little clay in a corner of the garden raphael stood spellbound like a child to whom his nurse is telling some wonderful story planchette put the clay down upon the slab drew a pruningknife from his pocket cut two branches from an elder tree and began to clean them of pith by blowing through them as if raphael had not been present

there are the rudiments of the apparatus he said then he connected one of the wooden pipes with the bottom of the flowerpot by way of a clay joint in such a way that the mouth of the elder stem was just under the hole of the flowerpot you might have compared it to a big tobaccopipe he spread a bed of clay over the surface of the slab in a shovelshaped mass set down the flowerpot at the wider end of it and laid the pipe of the elder stem along the portion which represented the handle of the shovel next he put a lump of clay at the end of the elder stem and therein planted the other pipe in an upright position forming a second elbow which connected it with the first horizontal pipe in such a manner that the air or any given fluid in circulation could flow through this improvised piece of mechanism from the mouth of the vertical tube along the intermediate passages and so into the large empty flowerpot

this apparatus sir he said to raphael with all the gravity of an academician pronouncing his initiatory discourse is one of the great pascals grandest claims upon our admiration

i dont understand

the man of science smiled he went up to a fruittree and took down a little phial in which the druggist had sent him some liquid for catching ants he broke off the bottom and made a funnel of the top carefully fitting it to the mouth of the vertical hollowed stem that he had set in the clay and at the opposite end to the great reservoir represented by the flowerpot next by means of a wateringpot he poured in sufficient water to rise to the same level in the large vessel and in the tiny circular funnel at the end of the elder stem

raphael was thinking of his piece of skin

water is considered today sir to be an incompressible body said the mechanician never lose sight of that fundamental principle still it can be compressed though only so very slightly that we should regard its faculty for contracting as a zero you see the amount of surface presented by the water at the brim of the flowerpot

yes sir

very good now suppose that that surface is a thousand times larger than the orifice of the elder stem through which i poured the liquid here i am taking the funnel away——

granted

well then if by any method whatever i increase the volume of that quantity of water by pouring in yet more through the mouth of the little tube the water thus compelled to flow downwards would rise in the reservoir represented by the flowerpot until it reached the same level at either end

that is quite clear cried raphael

but there is this difference the other went on suppose that the thin column of water poured into the little vertical tube there exerts a force equal say to a pound weight for instance its action will be punctually communicated to the great body of the liquid and will be transmitted to every part of the surface represented by the water in the flowerpot so that at the surface there will be a thousand columns of water every one pressing upwards as if they were impelled by a force equal to that which compels the liquid to descend in the vertical tube and of necessity they reproduce here said planchette indicating to raphael the top of the flowerpot the force introduced over there a thousandfold and the man of science pointed out to the marquis the upright wooden pipe set in the clay

that is quite simple said raphael

planchette smiled again

in other words he went on with the mathematicians natural stubborn propensity for logic in order to resist the force of the incoming water it would be necessary to exert upon every part of the large surface a force equal to that brought into action in the vertical column but with this difference—if the column of liquid is a foot in height the thousand little columns of the wide surface will only have a very slight elevating power

now said planchette as he gave a fillip to his bits of stick let us replace this funny little apparatus by steel tubes of suitable strength and dimensions and if you cover the liquid surface of the reservoir with a strong sliding plate of metal and if to this metal plate you oppose another solid enough and strong enough to resist any test if furthermore you give me the power of continually adding water to the volume of liquid contents by means of the little vertical tube the object fixed between the two solid metal plates must of necessity yield to the tremendous crushing force which indefinitely compresses it the method of continually pouring in water through a little tube like the manner of communicating force through the volume of the liquid to a small metal plate is an absurdly primitive mechanical device a brace of pistons and a few valves would do it all do you perceive my dear sir he said taking valentin by the arm there is scarcely a substance in existence that would not be compelled to dilate when fixed in between these two indefinitely resisting surfaces

what the author of the lettres provinciales invented it raphael exclaimed

he and no other sir the science of mechanics knows no simpler nor more beautiful contrivance the opposite principle the capacity of expansion possessed by water has brought the steamengine into being but water will only expand up to a certain point while its incompressibility being a force in a manner negative is of necessity infinite

if this skin is expanded said raphael i promise you to erect a colossal statue to blaise pascal to found a prize of a hundred thousand francs to be offered every ten years for the solution of the grandest problem of mechanical science effected during the interval to find dowries for all your cousins and second cousins and finally to build an asylum on purpose for impoverished or insane mathematicians

that would be exceedingly useful planchette replied we will go to spieghalter tomorrow sir he continued with the serenity of a man living on a plane wholly intellectual that distinguished mechanic has just completed after my own designs an improved mechanical arrangement by which a child could get a thousand trusses of hay inside his cap

then goodbye till tomorrow

till tomorrow sir

talk of mechanics cried raphael isnt it the greatest of the sciences the other fellow with his onagers classifications ducks and species and his phials full of bottled monstrosities is at best only fit for a billiardmarker in a saloon

the next morning raphael went off in great spirits to find planchette and together they set out for the rue de la sante—auspicious appellation arrived at spieghalters the young man found himself in a vast foundry his eyes lighted upon a multitude of glowing and roaring furnaces there was a storm of sparks a deluge of nails an ocean of pistons vices levers valves girders files and nuts a sea of melted metal baulks of timber and barsteel iron filings filled your throat there was iron in the atmosphere the men were covered with it everything reeked of iron the iron seemed to be a living organism it became a fluid moved and seemed to shape itself intelligently after every fashion to obey the workers every caprice through the uproar made by the bellows the crescendo of the falling hammers and the shrill sounds of the lathes that drew groans from the steel raphael passed into a large clean and airy place where he was able to inspect at his leisure the great press that planchette had told him about he admired the castiron beams as one might call them and the twin bars of steel coupled together with indestructible bolts

if you were to give seven rapid turns to that crank said spieghalter pointing out a beam of polished steel you would make a steel bar spurt out in thousands of jets that would get into your legs like needles

the deuce exclaimed raphael

planchette himself slipped the piece of skin between the metal plates of the allpowerful press and brimful of the certainty of a scientific conviction he worked the crank energetically

lie flat all of you we are dead men thundered spieghalter as he himself fell prone on the floor

a hideous shrieking sound rang through the workshops the water in the machine had broken the chamber and now spouted out in a jet of incalculable force luckily it went in the direction of an old furnace which was overthrown enveloped and carried away by a waterspout

ha remarked planchette serenely the piece of skin is as safe and sound as my eye there was a flaw in your reservoir somewhere or a crevice in the large tube——

no no i know my reservoir the devil is in your contrivance sir you can take it away and the german pounced upon a smiths hammer flung the skin down on an anvil and with all the strength that rage gives dealt the talisman the most formidable blow that had ever resounded through his workshops

there is not so much as a mark on it said planchette stroking the perverse bit of skin

the workmen hurried in the foreman took the skin and buried it in the glowing coal of a forge while in a semicircle round the fire they all awaited the action of a huge pair of bellows raphael spieghalter and professor planchette stood in the midst of the grimy expectant crowd raphael looking round on faces dusted over with iron filings white eyes greasy blackened clothing and hairy chests could have fancied himself transported into the wild nocturnal world of german ballad poetry after the skin had been in the fire for ten minutes the foreman pulled it out with a pair of pincers

hand it over to me said raphael

the foreman held it out by way of a joke the marquis readily handled it it was cool and flexible between his fingers an exclamation of alarm went up the workmen fled in terror valentin was left alone with planchette in the empty workshop

there is certainly something infernal in the thing cried raphael in desperation is no human power able to give me one more day of existence

i made a mistake sir said the mathematician with a penitent expression we ought to have subjected that peculiar skin to the action of a rolling machine where could my eyes have been when i suggested compression

it was i that asked for it raphael answered

the mathematician heaved a sigh of relief like a culprit acquitted by a dozen jurors still the strange problem afforded by the skin interested him he meditated a moment and then remarked

this unknown material ought to be treated chemically by reagents let us call on japhet—perhaps the chemist may have better luck than the mechanic

valentin urged his horse into a rapid trot hoping to find the chemist the celebrated japhet in his laboratory

well old friend planchette began seeing japhet in his armchair examining a precipitate how goes chemistry

gone to sleep nothing new at all the academie however has recognized the existence of salicine but salicine asparagine vauqueline and digitaline are not really discoveries——

since you cannot invent substances said raphael you are obliged to fall back on inventing names

most emphatically true young man

here said planchette addressing the chemist try to analyze this composition if you can extract any element whatever from it i christen it diaboline beforehand for we have just smashed a hydraulic press in trying to compress it

lets see lets have a look at it cried the delighted chemist it may perhaps be a fresh element

it is simply a piece of the skin of an ass sir said raphael

sir said the illustrious chemist sternly

i am not joking the marquis answered laying the piece of skin before him

baron japhet applied the nervous fibres of his tongue to the skin he had skill in thus detecting salts acids alkalis and gases after several experiments he remarked

no taste whatever come we will give it a little fluoric acid to drink

subjected to the influence of this ready solvent of animal tissue the skin underwent no change whatsoever

it is not shagreen at all the chemist cried we will treat this unknown mystery as a mineral and try its mettle by dropping it in a crucible where i have at this moment some red potash

japhet went out and returned almost immediately

allow me to cut away a bit of this strange substance sir he said to raphael it is so extraordinary——

a bit exclaimed raphael not so much as a hairsbreadth you may try though he added half banteringly half sadly

the chemist broke a razor in his desire to cut the skin he tried to break it by a powerful electric shock next he submitted it to the influence of a galvanic battery but all the thunderbolts his science wotted of fell harmless on the dreadful talisman

it was seven oclock in the evening planchette japhet and raphael unaware of the flight of time were awaiting the outcome of a final experiment the magic skin emerged triumphant from a formidable encounter in which it had been engaged with a considerable quantity of chloride of nitrogen

it is all over with me raphael wailed it is the finger of god i shall die—— and he left the two amazed scientific men

we must be very careful not to talk about this affair at the academie our colleagues there would laugh at us planchette remarked to the chemist after a long pause in which they looked at each other without daring to communicate their thoughts the learned pair looked like two christians who had issued from their tombs to find no god in the heavens science had been powerless acids so much clear water red potash had been discredited the galvanic battery and electric shock had been a couple of playthings

a hydraulic press broken like a biscuit commented planchette

i believe in the devil said the baron japhet after a moments silence

and i in god replied planchette

each spoke in character the universe for a mechanician is a machine that requires an operator for chemistry—that fiendish employment of decomposing all things—the world is a gas endowed with the power of movement

we cannot deny the fact the chemist replied

pshaw those gentlemen the doctrinaires have invented a nebulous aphorism for our consolation—stupid as a fact

your aphorism said the chemist seems to me as a fact very stupid

they began to laugh and went off to dine like folk for whom a miracle is nothing more than a phenomenon

valentin reached his own house shivering with rage and consumed with anger he had no more faith in anything conflicting thoughts shifted and surged to and fro in his brain as is the case with every man brought face to face with an inconceivable fact he had readily believed in some hidden flaw in spieghalters apparatus he had not been surprised by the incompetence and failure of science and of fire but the flexibility of the skin as he handled it taken with its stubbornness when all means of destruction that man possesses had been brought to bear upon it in vain—these things terrified him the incontrovertible fact made him dizzy

i am mad he muttered i have had no food since the morning and yet i am neither hungry nor thirsty and there is a fire in my breast that burns me

he put back the skin in the frame where it had been enclosed but lately drew a line in red ink about the actual configuration of the talisman and seated himself in his armchair

eight oclock already he exclaimed today has gone like a dream

he leaned his elbow on the arm of the chair propped his head with his left hand and so remained lost in secret dark reflections and consuming thoughts that men condemned to die bear away with them

o pauline he cried poor child there are gulfs that love can never traverse despite the strength of his wings

just then he very distinctly heard a smothered sigh and knew by one of the most tender privileges of passionate love that it was paulines breathing

that is my death warrant he said to himself if she were there i should wish to die in her arms

a burst of gleeful and hearty laughter made him turn his face towards the bed he saw paulines face through the transparent curtains smiling like a child for gladness over a successful piece of mischief her pretty hair fell over her shoulders in countless curls she looked like a bengal rose upon a pile of white roses

i cajoled jonathan said she doesnt the bed belong to me to me who am your wife dont scold me darling i only wanted to surprise you to sleep beside you forgive me for my freak

she sprang out of bed like a kitten showed herself gleaming in her lawn raiment and sat down on raphaels knee

love what gulf were you talking about she said with an anxious expression apparent upon her face

death

you hurt me she answered there are some thoughts upon which we poor women that we are cannot dwell they are death to us is it strength of love in us or lack of courage i cannot tell death does not frighten me she began again laughingly to die with you both together tomorrow morning in one last embrace would be joy it seems to me that even then i should have lived more than a hundred years what does the number of days matter if we have spent a whole lifetime of peace and love in one night in one hour

you are right heaven is speaking through that pretty mouth of yours grant that i may kiss you and let us die said raphael

then let us die she said laughing

towards nine oclock in the morning the daylight streamed through the chinks of the window shutters obscured somewhat by the muslin curtains it yet sufficed to show clearly the rich colors of the carpet the silks and furniture of the room where the two lovers were lying asleep the gilding sparkled here and there a ray of sunshine fell and faded upon the soft down quilt that the freaks of live had thrown to the ground the outlines of paulines dress hanging from a cheval glass appeared like a shadowy ghost her dainty shoes had been left at a distance from the bed a nightingale came to perch upon the sill its trills repeated over again and the sounds of its wings suddenly shaken out for flight awoke raphael

for me to die he said following out a thought begun in his dream my organization the mechanism of flesh and bone that is quickened by the will in me and makes of me an individual man must display some perceptible disease doctors ought to understand the symptoms of any attack on vitality and could tell me whether i am sick or sound

he gazed at his sleeping wife she had stretched her head out to him expressing in this way even while she slept the anxious tenderness of love pauline seemed to look at him as she lay with her face turned towards him in an attitude as full of grace as a young childs with her pretty halfopened mouth held out towards him as she drew her light even breath her little pearly teeth seemed to heighten the redness of the fresh lips with the smile hovering over them the red glow in her complexion was brighter and its whiteness was so to speak whiter still just then than in the most impassioned moments of the waking day in her unconstrained grace as she lay so full of believing trust the adorable attractions of childhood were added to the enchantments of love

even the most unaffected women still obey certain social conventions which restrain the free expansion of the soul within them during their waking hours but slumber seems to give them back the spontaneity of life which makes infancy lovely pauline blushed for nothing she was like one of those beloved and heavenly beings in whom reason has not yet put motives into their actions and mystery into their glances her profile stood out in sharp relief against the fine cambric of the pillows there was a certain sprightliness about her loose hair in confusion mingled with the deep lace ruffles but she was sleeping in happiness her long lashes were tightly pressed against her cheeks as if to secure her eyes from too strong a light or to aid an effort of her soul to recollect and to hold fast a bliss that had been perfect but fleeting her tiny pink and white ear framed by a lock of her hair and outlined by a wrapping of mechlin lace would have made an artist a painter an old man wildly in love and would perhaps have restored a madman to his senses

is it not an ineffable bliss to behold the woman that you love sleeping smiling in a peaceful dream beneath your protection loving you even in dreams even at the point where the individual seems to cease to exist offering to you yet the mute lips that speak to you in slumber of the latest kiss is it not indescribable happiness to see a trusting woman halfclad but wrapped round in her love as by a cloak—modesty in the midst of dishevelment—to see admiringly her scattered clothing the silken stocking hastily put off to please you last evening the unclasped girdle that implies a boundless faith in you a whole romance lies there in that girdle the woman that it used to protect exists no longer she is yours she has become you henceforward any betrayal of her is a blow dealt at yourself

in this softened mood raphaels eyes wandered over the room now filled with memories and love and where the very daylight seemed to take delightful hues then he turned his gaze at last upon the outlines of the womans form upon youth and purity and love that even now had no thought that was not for him alone above all things and longed to live for ever as his eyes fell upon pauline her own opened at once as if a ray of sunlight had lighted on them

goodmorning she said smiling how handsome you are bad man

the grace of love and youth of silence and dawn shone in their faces making a divine picture with the fleeting spell over it all that belongs only to the earliest days of passion just as simplicity and artlessness are the peculiar possession of childhood alas loves springtide joys like our own youthful laughter must even take flight and live for us no longer save in memory either for our despair or to shed some soothing fragrance over us according to the bent of our inmost thoughts

what made me wake you said raphael it was so great a pleasure to watch you sleeping that it brought tears to my eyes

and to mine too she answered i cried in the night while i watched you sleeping but not with happiness raphael dear pray listen to me your breathing is labored while you sleep and something rattles in your chest that frightens me you have a little dry cough when you are asleep exactly like my fathers who is dying of phthisis in those sounds from your lungs i recognized some of the peculiar symptoms of that complaint then you are feverish i know you are your hand was moist and burning——darling you are young she added with a shudder and you could still get over it if unfortunately——but no she cried cheerfully there is no unfortunately the disease is contagious so the doctors say

she flung both arms about raphael drawing in his breath through one of those kisses in which the soul reaches its end

i do not wish to live to old age she said let us both die young and go to heaven while flowers fill our hands

we always make such designs as those when we are well and strong raphael replied burying his hands in paulines hair but even then a horrible fit of coughing came on one of those deep ominous coughs that seem to come from the depths of the tomb a cough that leaves the sufferer ghastly pale trembling and perspiring with aching sides and quivering nerves with a feeling of weariness pervading the very marrow of the spine and unspeakable languor in every vein raphael slowly laid himself down pale exhausted and overcome like a man who has spent all the strength in him over one final effort paulines eyes grown large with terror were fixed upon him she lay quite motionless pale and silent

let us commit no more follies my angel she said trying not to let raphael see the dreadful forebodings that disturbed her she covered her face with her hands for she saw death before her—the hideous skeleton raphaels face had grown as pale and livid as any skull unearthed from a churchyard to assist the studies of some scientific man pauline remembered the exclamation that had escaped from valentin the previous evening and to herself she said

yes there are gulfs that love can never cross and therein love must bury itself

on a march morning some days after this wretched scene raphael found himself seated in an armchair placed in the window in the full light of day four doctors stood round him each in turn trying his pulse feeling him over and questioning him with apparent interest the invalid sought to guess their thoughts putting a construction on every movement they made and on the slightest contractions of their brows his last hope lay in this consultation this court of appeal was about to pronounce its decision—life or death

valentin had summoned the oracles of modern medicine so that he might have the last word of science thanks to his wealth and title there stood before him three embodied theories human knowledge fluctuated round the three points three of the doctors brought among them the complete circle of medical philosophy they represented the points of conflict round which the battle raged between spiritualism analysis and goodness knows what in the way of mocking eclecticism

the fourth doctor was horace bianchon a man of science with a future before him the most distinguished man of the new school in medicine a discreet and unassuming representative of a studious generation that is preparing to receive the inheritance of fifty years of experience treasured up by the ecole de paris a generation that perhaps will erect the monument for the building of which the centuries behind us have collected the different materials as a personal friend of the marquis and of rastignac he had been in attendance on the former for some days past and was helping him to answer the inquiries of the three professors occasionally insisting somewhat upon those symptoms which in his opinion pointed to pulmonary disease

you have been living at a great pace leading a dissipated life no doubt and you have devoted yourself largely to intellectual work queried one of the three celebrated authorities addressing raphael he was a squareheaded man with a large frame and energetic organization which seemed to mark him out as superior to his two rivals

i made up my mind to kill myself with debauchery after spending three years over an extensive work with which perhaps you may some day occupy yourselves raphael replied

the great doctor shook his head and so displayed his satisfaction i was sure of it he seemed to say to himself he was the illustrious brisset the successor of cabanis and bichat head of the organic school a doctor popular with believers in material and positive science who see in man a complete individual subject solely to the laws of his own particular organization and who consider that his normal condition and abnormal states of disease can both be traced to obvious causes

after this reply brisset looked without speaking at a middlesized person whose darkly flushed countenance and glowing eyes seemed to belong to some antique satyr and who leaning his back against the corner of the embrasure was studying raphael without saying a word doctor cameristus a man of creeds and enthusiasms the head of the vitalists a romantic champion of the esoteric doctrines of van helmont discerned a lofty informing principle in human life a mysterious and inexplicable phenomenon which mocks at the scalpel deceives the surgeon eludes the drugs of the pharmacopoeia the formulae of algebra the demonstrations of anatomy and derides all our efforts a sort of invisible intangible flame which obeying some divinely appointed law will often linger on in a body in our opinion devoted to death while it takes flight from an organization well fitted for prolonged existence

a bitter smile hovered upon the lips of the third doctor maugredie a man of acknowledged ability but a pyrrhonist and a scoffer with the scalpel for his one article of faith he would consider as a concession to brisset that a man who as a matter of fact was perfectly well was dead and recognize with cameristus that a man might be living on after his apparent demise he found something sensible in every theory and embraced none of them claiming that the best of all systems of medicine was to have none at all and to stick to facts this panurge of the clinical schools the king of observers the great investigator a great sceptic the man of desperate expedients was scrutinizing the magic skin

i should very much like to be a witness of the coincidence of its retrenchment with your wish he said to the marquis

where is the use cried brisset

where is the use echoed cameristus

ah you are both of the same mind replied maugredie

the contraction is perfectly simple brisset went on

it is supernatural remarked cameristus

in short maugredie made answer with affected solemnity and handing the piece of skin to raphael as he spoke the shriveling faculty of the skin is a fact inexplicable and yet quite natural which ever since the world began has been the despair of medicine and of pretty women

all valentins observation could discover no trace of a feeling for his troubles in any of the three doctors the three received every answer in silence scanned him unconcernedly and interrogated him unsympathetically politeness did not conceal their indifference whether deliberation or certainty was the cause their words at any rate came so seldom and so languidly that at times raphael thought that their attention was wandering from time to time brisset the sole speaker remarked good just so as bianchon pointed out the existence of each desperate symptom cameristus seemed to be deep in meditation maugredie looked like a comic author studying two queer characters with a view to reproducing them faithfully upon the stage there was deep unconcealed distress and grave compassion in horace bianchons face he had been a doctor for too short a time to be untouched by suffering and unmoved by a deathbed he had not learned to keep back the sympathetic tears that obscure a mans clear vision and prevent him from seizing like the general of an army upon the auspicious moment for victory in utter disregard of the groans of dying men

after spending about half an hour over taking in some sort the measure of the patient and the complaint much as a tailor measures a young man for a coat when he orders his wedding outfit the authorities uttered several commonplaces and even talked of politics then they decided to go into raphaels study to exchange their ideas and frame their verdict

may i not be present during the discussion gentlemen valentin had asked them but brisset and maugredie protested against this and in spite of their patients entreaties declined altogether to deliberate in his presence

raphael gave way before their custom thinking that he could slip into a passage adjoining whence he could easily overhear the medical conference in which the three professors were about to engage

permit me gentlemen said brisset as they entered to give you my own opinion at once i neither wish to force it upon you nor to have it discussed in the first place it is unbiased concise and based on an exact similarity that exists between one of my own patients and the subject that we have been called in to examine and moreover i am expected at my hospital the importance of the case that demands my presence there will excuse me for speaking the first word the subject with which we are concerned has been exhausted in an equal degree by intellectual labors—what did he set about horace he asked of the young doctor

a theory of the will

the devil but thats a big subject he is exhausted i say by too much brainwork by irregular courses and by the repeated use of too powerful stimulants violent exertion of body and mind has demoralized the whole system it is easy gentlemen to recognize in the symptoms of the face and body generally intense irritation of the stomach an affection of the great sympathetic nerve acute sensibility of the epigastric region and contraction of the right and left hypochondriac you have noticed too the large size and prominence of the liver m bianchon has besides constantly watched the patient and he tells us that digestion is troublesome and difficult strictly speaking there is no stomach left and so the man has disappeared the brain is atrophied because the man digests no longer the progressive deterioration wrought in the epigastric region the seat of vitality has vitiated the whole system thence by continuous fevered vibrations the disorder has reached the brain by means of the nervous plexus hence the excessive irritation in that organ there is monomania the patient is burdened with a fixed idea that piece of skin really contracts to his way of thinking very likely it always has been as we have seen it but whether it contracts or no that thing is for him just like the fly that some grand vizier or other had on his nose if you put leeches at once on the epigastrium and reduce the irritation in that part which is the very seat of mans life and if you diet the patient the monomania will leave him i will say no more to dr bianchon he should be able to grasp the whole treatment as well as the details there may be perhaps some complication of the disease—the bronchial tubes possibly may be also inflamed but i believe that treatment for the intestinal organs is very much more important and necessary and more urgently required than for the lungs persistent study of abstract matters and certain violent passions have induced serious disorders in that vital mechanism however we are in time to set these conditions right nothing is too seriously affected you will easily get your friend round again he remarked to bianchon

our learned colleague is taking the effect for the cause cameristus replied yes the changes that he has observed so keenly certainly exist in the patient but it is not the stomach that by degrees has set up nervous action in the system and so affected the brain like a hole in a window pane spreading cracks round about it it took a blow of some kind to make a hole in the window who gave the blow do we know that have we investigated the patients case sufficiently are we acquainted with all the events of his life

the vital principle gentlemen he continued the archeus of van helmont is affected in his case—the very essence and centre of life is attacked the divine spark the transitory intelligence which holds the organism together which is the source of the will the inspiration of life has ceased to regulate the daily phenomena of the mechanism and the functions of every organ thence arise all the complications which my learned colleague has so thoroughly appreciated the epigastric region does not affect the brain but the brain affects the epigastric region no he went on vigorously slapping his chest no i am not a stomach in the form of a man no everything does not lie there i do not feel that i have the courage to say that if the epigastric region is in good order everything else is in a like condition——

we cannot trace he went on more mildly to one physical cause the serious disturbances that supervene in this or that subject which has been dangerously attacked nor submit them to a uniform treatment no one man is like another we have each peculiar organs differently affected diversely nourished adapted to perform different functions and to induce a condition necessary to the accomplishment of an order of things which is unknown to us the sublime will has so wrought that a little portion of the great all is set within us to sustain the phenomena of living in every man it formulates itself distinctly making each to all appearance a separate individual yet in one point coexistent with the infinite cause so we ought to make a separate study of each subject discover all about it find out in what its life consists and wherein its power lies from the softness of a wet sponge to the hardness of pumicestone there are infinite fine degrees of difference man is just like that between the spongelike organizations of the lymphatic and the vigorous iron muscles of such men as are destined for a long life what a margin for errors for the single inflexible system of a lowering treatment to commit a system that reduces the capacities of the human frame which you always conclude have been overexcited let us look for the origin of the disease in the mental and not in the physical viscera a doctor is an inspired being endowed by god with a special gift—the power to read the secrets of vitality just as the prophet has received the eyes that foresee the future the poet his faculty of evoking nature and the musician the power of arranging sounds in an harmonious order that is possibly a copy of an ideal harmony on high

there is his everlasting system of medicine arbitrary monarchical and pious muttered brisset

gentlemen maugredie broke in hastily to distract attention from brissets comment dont let us lose sight of the patient

what is the good of science raphael moaned here is my recovery halting between a string of beads and a rosary of leeches between dupuytrens bistoury and prince hohenlohes prayer there is maugredie suspending his judgment on the line that divides facts from words mind from matter mans it is and it is not is always on my track it is the carymary carymara of rabelais for evermore my disorder is spiritual carymary or material carymara shall i live they have no idea planchette was more straightforward with me at any rate when he said i do not know

just then valentin heard maugredies voice

the patient suffers from monomania very good i am quite of that opinion he said but he has two hundred thousand a year monomaniacs of that kind are very uncommon as for knowing whether his epigastric region has affected his brain or his brain his epigastric region we shall find that out perhaps whenever he dies but to resume there is no disputing the fact that he is ill some sort of treatment he must have let us leave theories alone and put leeches on him to counteract the nervous and intestinal irritation as to the existence of which we all agree and let us send him to drink the waters in that way we shall act on both systems at once if there really is tubercular disease we can hardly expect to save his life so that——

raphael abruptly left the passage and went back to his armchair the four doctors very soon came out of the study horace was the spokesman

these gentlemen he told him have unanimously agreed that leeches must be applied to the stomach at once and that both physical and moral treatment are imperatively needed in the first place a carefully prescribed rule of diet so as to soothe the internal irritation—here brisset signified his approval and in the second a hygienic regimen to set your general condition right we all therefore recommend you to go to take the waters in aix in savoy or if you like it better at mont dore in auvergne the air and the situation are both pleasanter in savoy than in the cantal but you will consult your own taste

here it was cameristus who nodded assent

these gentlemen bianchon continued having recognized a slight affection of the respiratory organs are agreed as to the utility of the previous course of treatment that i have prescribed they think that there will be no difficulty about restoring you to health and that everything depends upon a wise and alternate employment of these various means and——

and that is the cause of the milk in the cocoanut said raphael with a smile as he led horace into his study to pay the fees for this useless consultation

their conclusions are logical the young doctor replied cameristus feels brisset examines maugredie doubts has not man a soul a body and an intelligence one of these three elemental constituents always influences us more or less strongly there will always be the personal element in human science believe me raphael we effect no cures we only assist them another system—the use of mild remedies while nature exerts her powers—lies between the extremes of theory of brisset and cameristus but one ought to have known the patient for some ten years or so to obtain a good result on these lines negation lies at the back of all medicine as in every other science so endeavor to live wholesomely try a trip to savoy the best course is and always will be to trust to nature

it was a month later on a fine summerlike evening that several people who were taking the waters at aix returned from the promenade and met together in the salons of the club raphael remained alone by a window for a long time his back was turned upon the gathering and he himself was deep in those involuntary musings in which thoughts arise in succession and fade away shaping themselves indistinctly passing over us like thin almost colorless clouds melancholy is sweet to us then and delight is shadowy for the soul is half asleep valentin gave himself up to this life of sensations he was steeping himself in the warm soft twilight enjoying the pure air with the scent of the hills in it happy in that he felt no pain and had tranquilized his threatening magic skin at last it grew cooler as the red glow of the sunset faded on the mountain peaks he shut the window and left his place

will you be so kind as not to close the windows sir said an old lady we are being stifled——

the peculiarly sharp and jarring tones in which the phrase was uttered grated on raphaels ears it fell on them like an indiscreet remark let slip by some man in whose friendship we would fain believe a word which reveals unsuspected depths of selfishness and destroys some pleasing sentimental illusion of ours the marquis glanced with the cool inscrutable expression of a diplomatist at the old lady called a servant and when he came curtly bade him

open that window

great surprise was clearly expressed on all faces at the words the whole roomful began to whisper to each other and turned their eyes upon the invalid as though he had given some serious offence raphael who had never quite managed to rid himself of the bashfulness of his early youth felt a momentary confusion then he shook off his torpor exerted his faculties and asked himself the meaning of this strange scene

a sudden and rapid impulse quickened his brain the past weeks appeared before him in a clear and definite vision the reasons for the feelings he inspired in others stood out for him in relief like the veins of some corpse which a naturalist by some cunningly contrived injection has colored so as to show their least ramifications

he discerned himself in this fleeting picture he followed out his own life in it thought by thought day after day he saw himself not without astonishment an absent gloomy figure in the midst of these lively folk always musing over his own fate always absorbed by his own sufferings seemingly impatient of the most harmless chat he saw how he had shunned the ephemeral intimacies that travelers are so ready to establish—no doubt because they feel sure of never meeting each other again—and how he had taken little heed of those about him he saw himself like the rocks without unmoved by the caresses or the stormy surgings of the waves

then by a gift of insight seldom accorded he read the thoughts of all those about him the light of a candle revealed the sardonic profile and yellow cranium of an old man he remembered now that he had won from him and had never proposed that the other should have his revenge a little further on he saw a pretty woman whose lively advances he had met with frigid coolness there was not a face there that did not reproach him with some wrong done inexplicably to all appearance but the real offence in every case lay in some mortification some invisible hurt dealt to selflove he had unintentionally jarred on all the small susceptibilities of the circle round about him

his guests on various occasions and those to whom he had lent his horses had taken offence at his luxurious ways their ungraciousness had been a surprise to him he had spared them further humiliations of that kind and they had considered that he looked down upon them and had accused him of haughtiness ever since he could read their inmost thoughts as he fathomed their natures in this way society with its polish and varnish grew loathsome to him he was envied and hated for his wealth and superior ability his reserve baffled the inquisitive his humility seemed like haughtiness to these petty superficial natures he guessed the secret unpardonable crime which he had committed against them he had overstepped the limits of the jurisdiction of their mediocrity he had resisted their inquisitorial tyranny he could dispense with their society and all of them therefore had instinctively combined to make him feel their power and to take revenge upon this incipient royalty by submitting him to a kind of ostracism and so teaching him that they in their turn could do without him

pity came over him first of all at this aspect of mankind but very soon he shuddered at the thought of the power that came thus at will and flung aside for him the veil of flesh under which the moral nature is hidden away he closed his eyes so as to see no more a black curtain was drawn all at once over this unlucky phantom show of truth but still he found himself in the terrible loneliness that surrounds every power and dominion just then a violent fit of coughing seized him far from receiving one single word—indifferent and meaningless it is true but still containing among wellbred people brought together by chance at least some pretence of civil commiseration—he now heard hostile ejaculations and muttered complaints society there assembled disdained any pantomime on his account perhaps because he had gauged its real nature too well

his complaint is contagious

the president of the club ought to forbid him to enter the salon

it is contrary to all rules and regulations to cough in that way

when a man is as ill as that he ought not to come to take the waters——

he will drive me away from the place

raphael rose and walked about the rooms to screen himself from their unanimous execrations he thought to find a shelter and went up to a young pretty lady who sat doing nothing minded to address some pretty speeches to her but as he came towards her she turned her back upon him and pretended to be watching the dancers raphael feared lest he might have made use of the talisman already that evening and feeling that he had neither the wish nor the courage to break into the conversation he left the salon and took refuge in the billiardroom no one there greeted him nobody spoke to him no one sent so much as a friendly glance in his direction his turn of mind naturally meditative had discovered instinctively the general grounds and reasons for the aversion he inspired this little world was obeying unconsciously perhaps the sovereign law which rules over polite society its inexorable nature was becoming apparent in its entirety to raphaels eyes a glance into the past showed it to him as a type completely realized in foedora

he would no more meet with sympathy here for his bodily ills than he had received it at her hands for the distress in his heart the fashionable world expels every suffering creature from its midst just as the body of a man in robust health rejects any germ of disease the world holds suffering and misfortune in abhorrence it dreads them like the plague it never hesitates between vice and trouble for vice is a luxury illfortune may possess a majesty of its own but society can belittle it and make it ridiculous by an epigram society draws caricatures and in this way flings in the teeth of fallen kings the affronts which it fancies it has received from them society like the roman youth at the circus never shows mercy to the fallen gladiator mockery and money are its vital necessities death to the weak that is the oath taken by this kind of equestrian order instituted in their midst by all the nations of the world everywhere it makes for the elevation of the rich and its motto is deeply graven in hearts that wealth has turned to stone or that have been reared in aristocratic prejudices

assemble a collection of schoolboys together that will give you a society in miniature a miniature which represents life more truly because it is so frank and artless and in it you will always find poor isolated beings relegated to some place in the general estimations between pity and contempt on account of their weakness and suffering to these the evangel promises heaven hereafter go lower yet in the scale of organized creation if some bird among its fellows in the courtyard sickens the others fall upon it with their beaks pluck out its feathers and kill it the whole world in accordance with its character of egotism brings all its severity to bear upon wretchedness that has the hardihood to spoil its festivities and to trouble its joys

any sufferer in mind or body any helpless or poor man is a pariah he had better remain in his solitude if he crosses the boundaryline he will find winter everywhere he will find freezing cold in other mens looks manners words and hearts and lucky indeed is he if he does not receive an insult where he expected that sympathy would be expended upon him let the dying keep to their bed of neglect and age sit lonely by its fireside portionless maids freeze and burn in your solitary attics if the world tolerates misery of any kind it is to turn it to account for its own purposes to make some use of it saddle and bridle it put a bit in its mouth ride it about and get some fun out of it

crotchety spinsters ladies companions put a cheerful face upon it endure the humors of your socalled benefactress carry her lapdogs for her you have an english poodle for your rival and you must seek to understand the moods of your patroness and amuse her and—keep silence about yourselves as for you unblushing parasite uncrowned king of unliveried servants leave your real character at home let your digestion keep pace with your hosts laugh when he laughs mingle your tears with his and find his epigrams amusing if you want to relieve your mind about him wait till he is ruined that is the way the world shows its respect for the unfortunate it persecutes them or slays them in the dust

such thoughts as these welled up in raphaels heart with the suddenness of poetic inspiration he looked around him and felt the influence of the forbidding gloom that society breathes out in order to rid itself of the unfortunate it nipped his soul more effectually than the east wind grips the body in december he locked his arms over his chest set his back against the wall and fell into a deep melancholy he mused upon the meagre happiness that this depressing way of living can give what did it amount to amusement with no pleasure in it gaiety without gladness joyless festivity fevered dreams empty of all delight firewood or ashes on the hearth without a spark of flame in them when he raised his head he found himself alone all the billiard players had gone

i have only to let them know my power to make them worship my coughing fits he said to himself and wrapped himself against the world in the cloak of his contempt

next day the resident doctor came to call upon him and took an anxious interest in his health raphael felt a thrill of joy at the friendly words addressed to him the doctors face to his thinking wore an expression that was kind and pleasant the pale curls of his wig seemed redolent of philanthropy the square cut of his coat the loose folds of his trousers his big quakerlike shoes everything about him down to the powder shaken from his queue and dusted in a circle upon his slightly stooping shoulders revealed an apostolic nature and spoke of christian charity and of the selfsacrifice of a man who out of sheer devotion to his patients had compelled himself to learn to play whist and trictrac so well that he never lost money to any of them

my lord marquis said he after a long talk with raphael i can dispel your uneasiness beyond all doubt i know your constitution well enough by this time to assure you that the doctors in paris whose great abilities i know are mistaken as to the nature of your complaint you can live as long as methuselah my lord marquis accidents only excepted your lungs are as sound as a blacksmiths bellows your stomach would put an ostrich to the blush but if you persist in living at high altitude you are running the risk of a prompt interment in consecrated soil a few words my lord marquis will make my meaning clear to you

chemistry he began has shown us that mans breathing is a real process of combustion and the intensity of its action varies according to the abundance or scarcity of the phlogistic element stored up by the organism of each individual in your case the phlogistic or inflammatory element is abundant if you will permit me to put it so you generate superfluous oxygen possessing as you do the inflammatory temperament of a man destined to experience strong emotions while you breath the keen pure air that stimulates life in men of lymphatic constitution you are accelerating an expenditure of vitality already too rapid one of the conditions for existence for you is the heavier atmosphere of the plains and valleys yes the vital air for a man consumed by his genius lies in the fertile pasturelands of germany at toplitz or badenbaden if england is not obnoxious to you its misty climate would reduce your fever but the situation of our baths a thousand feet above the level of the mediterranean is dangerous for you that is my opinion at least he said with a deprecatory gesture and i give it in opposition to our interests for if you act upon it we shall unfortunately lose you

but for these closing words of his the affable doctors seeming goodnature would have completely won raphael over but he was too profoundly observant not to understand the meaning of the tone the look and gesture that accompanied that mild sarcasm not to see that the little man had been sent on this errand no doubt by a flock of his rejoicing patients the floridlooking idlers tedious old women nomad english people and fine ladies who had given their husbands the slip and were escorted hither by their lovers—one and all were in a plot to drive away a wretched feeble creature to die who seemed unable to hold out against a daily renewed persecution raphael accepted the challenge he foresaw some amusement to be derived from their manoeuvres

as you would be grieved at losing me said he to the doctor i will endeavor to avail myself of your good advice without leaving the place i will set about having a house built tomorrow and the atmosphere within it shall be regulated by your instructions

the doctor understood the sarcastic smile that lurked about raphaels mouth and took his leave without finding another word to say

the lake of bourget lies seven hundred feet above the mediterranean in a great hollow among the jagged peaks of the hills it sparkles there the bluest drop of water in the world from the summit of the cats tooth the lake below looks like a stray turquoise this lovely sheet of water is about twentyseven miles round and in some places is nearly five hundred feet deep

under the cloudless sky in your boat in the midst of the great expanse of water with only the sound of the oars in your ears only the vague outline of the hills on the horizon before you you admire the glittering snows of the french maurienne you pass now by masses of granite clad in the velvet of green turf or in lowgrowing shrubs now by pleasant sloping meadows there is always a wilderness on the one hand and fertile lands on the other and both harmonies and dissonances compose a scene for you where everything is at once small and vast and you feel yourself to be a poor onlooker at a great banquet the configuration of the mountains brings about misleading optical conditions and illusions of perspective a pinetree a hundred feet in height looks to be a mere weed wide valleys look as narrow as meadow paths the lake is the only one where the confidences of heart and heart can be exchanged there one can live there one can meditate nowhere on earth will you find a closer understanding between the water the sky the mountains and the fields there is a balm there for all the agitations of life the place keeps the secrets of sorrow to itself the sorrow that grows less beneath its soothing influence and to love it gives a grave and meditative cast deepening passion and purifying it a kiss there becomes something great but beyond all other things it is the lake for memories it aids them by lending to them the hues of its own waves it is a mirror in which everything is reflected only here with this lovely landscape all around him could raphael endure the burden laid upon him here he could remain as a languid dreamer without a wish of his own

he went out upon the lake after the doctors visit and was landed at a lonely point on the pleasant slope where the village of saintinnocent is situated the view from this promontory as one may call it comprises the heights of bugey with the rhone flowing at their foot and the end of the lake but raphael liked to look at the opposite shore from thence at the melancholy looking abbey of hautecombe the buryingplace of the sardinian kings who lie prostrate there before the hills like pilgrims come at last to their journeys end the silence of the landscape was broken by the even rhythm of the strokes of the oar it seemed to find a voice for the place in monotonous cadences like the chanting of monks the marquis was surprised to find visitors to this usually lonely part of the lake and as he mused he watched the people seated in the boat and recognized in the stern the elderly lady who had spoken so harshly to him the evening before

no one took any notice of raphael as the boat passed except the elderly ladys companion a poor old maid of noble family who bowed to him and whom it seemed to him that he saw for the first time a few seconds later he had already forgotten the visitors who had rapidly disappeared behind the promontory when he heard the fluttering of a dress and the sound of light footsteps not far from him he turned about and saw the companion and guessing from her embarrassed manner that she wished to speak with him he walked towards her

she was somewhere about thirtysix years of age thin and tall reserved and prim and like all old maids seemed puzzled to know which way to look an expression no longer in keeping with her measured springless and hesitating steps she was both young and old at the same time and by a certain dignity in her carriage showed the high value which she set upon her charms and perfections in addition her movements were all demure and discreet like those of women who are accustomed to take great care of themselves no doubt because they desire not to be cheated of love their destined end

your life is in danger sir do not come to the club again she said stepping back a pace or two from raphael as if her reputation had already been compromised

but mademoiselle said raphael smiling please explain yourself more clearly since you have condescended so far——

ah she answered unless i had had a very strong motive i should never have run the risk of offending the countess for if she ever came to know that i had warned you——

and who would tell her mademoiselle cried raphael

true the old maid answered she looked at him quaking like an owl out in the sunlight but think of yourself she went on several young men who want to drive you away from the baths have agreed to pick a quarrel with you and to force you into a duel

the elderly ladys voice sounded in the distance

mademoiselle began the marquis my gratitude—— but his protectress had fled already she had heard the voice of her mistress squeaking afresh among the rocks

poor girl unhappiness always understands and helps the unhappy raphael thought and sat himself down at the foot of a tree

the key of every science is beyond cavil the mark of interrogation we owe most of our greatest discoveries to a why and all the wisdom in the world perhaps consists in asking wherefore in every connection but on the other hand this acquired prescience is the ruin of our illusions

so valentin having taken the old maids kindly action for the text of his wandering thoughts without the deliberate promptings of philosophy must find it full of gall and wormwood

it is not at all extraordinary that a gentlewomans gentlewoman should take a fancy to me said he to himself i am twentyseven years old and i have a title and an income of two hundred thousand a year but that her mistress who hates water like a rabid cat—for it would be hard to give the palm to either in that matter—that her mistress should have brought her here in a boat is not that very strange and wonderful those two women came into savoy to sleep like marmots they ask if day has dawned at noon and to think that they could get up this morning before eight oclock to take their chances in running after me

very soon the old maid and her elderly innocence became in his eyes a fresh manifestation of that artificial malicious little world it was a paltry device a clumsy artifice a piece of priests or womans craft was the duel a myth or did they merely want to frighten him but these petty creatures impudent and teasing as flies had succeeded in wounding his vanity in rousing his pride and exciting his curiosity unwilling to become their dupe or to be taken for a coward and even diverted perhaps by the little drama he went to the club that very evening

he stood leaning against the marble chimneypiece and stayed there quietly in the middle of the principal saloon doing his best to give no one any advantage over him but he scrutinized the faces about him and gave a certain vague offence to those assembled by his inspection like a dog aware of his strength he awaited the contest on his own ground without necessary barking towards the end of the evening he strolled into the cardroom walking between the door and another that opened into the billiardroom throwing a glance from time to time over a group of young men that had gathered there he heard his name mentioned after a turn or two although they lowered their voices raphael easily guessed that he had become the topic of their debate and he ended by catching a phrase or two spoken aloud

you

yes i

i dare you to do it

let us make a bet on it

oh he will do it

just as valentin curious to learn the matter of the wager came up to pay closer attention to what they were saying a tall strong goodlooking young fellow who however possessed the impertinent stare peculiar to people who have material force at their back came out of the billiardroom

i am deputed sir he said coolly addressing the marquis to make you aware of something which you do not seem to know your face and person generally are a source of annoyance to every one here and to me in particular you have too much politeness not to sacrifice yourself to the public good and i beg that you will not show yourself in the club again

this sort of joke has been perpetrated before sir in garrison towns at the time of the empire but nowadays it is exceedingly bad form said raphael drily

i am not joking the young man answered and i repeat it your health will be considerably the worse for a stay here the heat and light the air of the saloon and the company are all bad for your complaint

where did you study medicine raphael inquired

i took my bachelors degree on lepages shootingground in paris and was made a doctor at ceriziers the king of foils

there is one last degree left for you to take said valentin study the ordinary rules of politeness and you will be a perfect gentlemen

the young men all came out of the billiardroom just then some disposed to laugh some silent the attention of other players was drawn to the matter they left their cards to watch a quarrel that rejoiced their instincts raphael alone among this hostile crowd did his best to keep cool and not to put himself in any way in the wrong but his adversary having ventured a sarcasm containing an insult couched in unusually keen language he replied gravely

we cannot box mens ears sir in these days but i am at a loss for any word by which to stigmatize such cowardly behavior as yours

thats enough thats enough you can come to an explanation tomorrow several young men exclaimed interposing between the two champions

raphael left the room in the character of aggressor after he had accepted a proposal to meet near the chateau de bordeau in a little sloping meadow not very far from the newly made road by which the man who came off victorious could reach lyons raphael must now either take to his bed or leave the baths the visitors had gained their point at eight oclock next morning his antagonist followed by two seconds and a surgeon arrived first on the ground

we shall do very nicely here glorious weather for a duel he cried gaily looking at the blue vault of sky above at the waters of the lake and the rocks without a single melancholy presentiment or doubt of the issue if i wing him he went on i shall send him to bed for a month eh doctor

at the very least the surgeon replied but let that willow twig alone or you will weary your wrist and then you will not fire steadily you might kill your man instead of wounding him

the noise of a carriage was heard approaching

here he is said the seconds who soon descried a caleche coming along the road it was drawn by four horses and there were two postilions

what a queer proceeding said valentins antagonist here he comes posthaste to be shot

the slightest incident about a duel as about a stake at cards makes an impression on the minds of those deeply concerned in the results of the affair so the young man awaited the arrival of the carriage with a kind of uneasiness it stopped in the road old jonathan laboriously descended from it in the first place to assist raphael to alight he supported him with his feeble arms and showed him all the minute attentions that a lover lavishes upon his mistress both became lost to sight in the footpath that lay between the highroad and the field where the duel was to take place they were walking slowly and did not appear again for some time after the four onlookers at this strange spectacle felt deeply moved by the sight of valentin as he leaned on his servants arm he was wasted and pale he limped as if he had the gout went with his head bowed down and said not a word you might have taken them for a couple of old men one broken with years the other worn out with thought the elder bore his age visibly written in his white hair the younger was of no age

i have not slept all night sir so raphael greeted his antagonist

the icy tone and terrible glance that went with the words made the real aggressor shudder he know that he was in the wrong and felt in secret ashamed of his behavior there was something strange in raphaels bearing tone and gesture the marquis stopped and every one else was likewise silent the uneasy and constrained feeling grew to a height

there is yet time he went on to offer me some slight apology and offer it you must or you will die sir you rely even now on your dexterity and do not shrink from an encounter in which you believe all the advantage to be upon your side very good sir i am generous i am letting you know my superiority beforehand i possess a terrible power i have only to wish to do so and i can neutralize your skill dim your eyesight make your hand and pulse unsteady and even kill you outright i have no wish to be compelled to exercise my power the use of it costs me too dear you would not be the only one to die so if you refuse to apologize to me not matter what your experience in murder your ball will go into the waterfall there and mine will speed straight to your heart though i do not aim it at you

confused voices interrupted raphael at this point all the time that he was speaking the marquis had kept his intolerably keen gaze fixed upon his antagonist now he drew himself up and showed an impassive face like that of a dangerous madman

make him hold his tongue the young man had said to one of his seconds that voice of his is tearing the heart out of me

say no more sir it is quite useless cried the seconds and the surgeon addressing raphael

gentlemen i am fulfilling a duty has this young gentleman any final arrangements to make

that is enough that will do

the marquis remained standing steadily never for a moment losing sight of his antagonist and the latter seemed like a bird before a snake to be overwhelmed by a wellnigh magical power he was compelled to endure that homicidal gaze he met and shunned it incessantly

i am thirsty give me some water—— he said again to the second

are you nervous

yes he answered there is a fascination about that mans glowing eyes

will you apologize

it is too late now

the two antagonists were placed at fifteen paces distance from each other each of them had a brace of pistols at hand and according to the programme prescribed for them each was to fire twice when and how he pleased but after the signal had been given by the seconds

what are you doing charles exclaimed the young man who acted as second to raphaels antagonist you are putting in the ball before the powder

i am a dead man he muttered by way of answer you have put me facing the sun——

the sun lies behind you said valentin sternly and solemnly while he coolly loaded his pistol without heeding the fact that the signal had been given or that his antagonist was carefully taking aim

there was something so appalling in this supernatural unconcern that it affected even the two postilions brought thither by a cruel curiosity raphael was either trying his power or playing with it for he talked to jonathan and looked towards him as he received his adversarys fire charles bullet broke a branch of willow and ricocheted over the surface of the water raphael fired at random and shot his antagonist through the heart he did not heed the young man as he dropped he hurriedly sought the magic skin to see what another mans life had cost him the talisman was no larger than a small oakleaf

what are you gaping at you postilions over there let us be off said the marquis

that same evening he crossed the french border immediately set out for auvergne and reached the springs of mont dore as he traveled there surged up in his heart all at once one of those thoughts that come to us as a ray of sunlight pierces through the thick mists in some dark valley—a sad enlightenment a pitiless sagacity that lights up the accomplished fact for us that lays our errors bare and leaves us without excuse in our own eyes it suddenly struck him that the possession of power no matter how enormous did not bring with it the knowledge how to use it the sceptre is a plaything for a child an axe for a richelieu and for a napoleon a lever by which to move the world power leaves us just as it finds us only great natures grow greater by its means raphael had had everything in his power and he had done nothing

at the springs of mont dore he came again in contact with a little world of people who invariably shunned him with the eager haste that animals display when they scent afar off one of their own species lying dead and flee away the dislike was mutual his late adventure had given him a deep distaste for society his first care consequently was to find a lodging at some distance from the neighborhood of the springs instinctively he felt within him the need of close contact with nature of natural emotions and of the vegetative life into which we sink so gladly among the fields

the day after he arrived he climbed the pic de sancy not without difficulty and visited the higher valleys the skyey nooks undiscovered lakes and peasants huts about mont dore a country whose stern and wild features are now beginning to tempt the brushes of our artists for sometimes wonderfully fresh and charming views are to be found there affording a strong contrast to the frowning brows of those lonely hills

barely a league from the village raphael discovered a nook where nature seemed to have taken a pleasure in hiding away all her treasures like some glad and mischievous child at the first sight of this unspoiled and picturesque retreat he determined to take up his abode in it there life must needs be peaceful natural and fruitful like the life of a plant

imagine for yourself an inverted cone of granite hollowed out on a large scale a sort of basin with its sides divided up by queer winding paths on one side lay level stretches with no growth upon them a bluish uniform surface over which the rays of the sun fell as upon a mirror on the other lay cliffs split open by fissures and frowning ravines great blocks of lava hung suspended from them while the action of rain slowly prepared their impending fall a few stunted trees tormented by the wind often crowned their summits and here and there in some sheltered angle of their ramparts a clump of chestnuttrees grew tall as cedars or some cavern in the yellowish rocks showed the dark entrance into its depths set about by flowers and brambles decked by a little strip of green turf

at the bottom of this cup which perhaps had been the crater of an oldworld volcano lay a pool of water as pure and bright as a diamond granite boulders lay around the deep basin and willows mountainash trees yellowflag lilies and numberless aromatic plants bloomed about it in a realm of meadow as fresh as an english bowlinggreen the fine soft grass was watered by the streams that trickled through the fissures in the cliffs the soil was continually enriched by the deposits of loam which storms washed down from the heights above the pool might be some three acres in extent its shape was irregular and the edges were scalloped like the hem of a dress the meadow might be an acre or two acres in extent the cliffs and the water approached and receded from each other here and there there was scarcely width enough for the cows to pass between them

after a certain height the plant life ceased aloft in air the granite took upon itself the most fantastic shapes and assumed those misty tints that give to high mountains a dim resemblance to clouds in the sky the bare bleak cliffs with the fearful rents in their sides pictures of wild and barren desolation contrasted strongly with the pretty view of the valley and so strange were the shapes they assumed that one of the cliffs had been called the capuchin because it was so like a monk sometimes these sharppointed peaks these mighty masses of rock and airy caverns were lighted up one by one according to the direction of the sun or the caprices of the atmosphere they caught gleams of gold dyed themselves in purple took a tint of glowing rosecolor or turned dull and gray upon the heights a drama of color was always to be seen a play of evershifting iridescent hues like those on a pigeons breast

oftentimes at sunrise or at sunset a ray of bright sunlight would penetrate between two sheer surfaces of lava that might have been split apart by a hatchet to the very depths of that pleasant little garden where it would play in the waters of the pool like a beam of golden light which gleams through the chinks of a shutter into a room in spain that has been carefully darkened for a siesta when the sun rose above the old crater that some antediluvian revolution had filled with water its rocky sides took warmer tones the extinct volcano glowed again and its sudden heat quickened the sprouting seeds and vegetation gave color to the flowers and ripened the fruits of this forgotten corner of the earth

as raphael reached it he noticed several cows grazing in the pastureland and when he had taken a few steps towards the water he saw a little house built of granite and roofed with shingle in the spot where the meadowland was at its widest the roof of this little cottage harmonized with everything about it for it had long been overgrown with ivy moss and flowers of no recent date a thin smoke that did not scare the birds away went up from the dilapidated chimney there was a great bench at the door between two huge honeysuckle bushes that were pink with blossom and full of scent the walls could scarcely be seen for branches of vine and sprays of rose and jessamine that interlaced and grew entirely as chance and their own will bade them for the inmates of the cottage seemed to pay no attention to the growth which adorned their house and to take no care of it leaving to it the fresh capricious charm of nature

some clothes spread out on the gooseberry bushes were drying in the sun a cat was sitting on a machine for stripping hemp beneath it lay a newly scoured brass caldron among a quantity of potatoparings on the other side of the house raphael saw a sort of barricade of dead thornbushes meant no doubt to keep the poultry from scratching up the vegetables and potherbs it seemed like the end of the earth the dwelling was like some birdsnest ingeniously set in a cranny of the rocks a clever and at the same time a careless bit of workmanship a simple and kindly nature lay round about it its rusticity was genuine but there was a charm like that of poetry in it for it grew and throve at a thousand miles distance from our elaborate and conventional poetry it was like none of our conceptions it was a spontaneous growth a masterpiece due to chance

as raphael reached the place the sunlight fell across it from right to left bringing out all the colors of its plants and trees the yellowish or gray bases of the crags the different shades of the green leaves the masses of flowers pink blue or white the climbing plants with their belllike blossoms and the shot velvet of the mosses the purpletinted blooms of the heather—everything was either brought into relief or made fairer yet by the enchantment of the light or by the contrasting shadows and this was the case most of all with the sheet of water wherein the house the trees the granite peaks and the sky were all faithfully reflected everything had a radiance of its own in this delightful picture from the sparkling micastone to the bleached tuft of grass hidden away in the soft shadows the spotted cow with its glossy hide the delicate waterplants that hung down over the pool like fringes in a nook where blue or emerald colored insects were buzzing about the roots of trees like a sandbesprinkled shock of hair above grotesque faces in the flinty rock surface—all these things made a harmony for the eye

the odor of the tepid water the scent of the flowers and the breath of the caverns which filled the lonely place gave raphael a sensation that was almost enjoyment silence reigned in majesty over these woods which possibly are unknown to the taxcollector but the barking of a couple of dogs broke the stillness all at once the cows turned their heads towards the entrance of the valley showing their moist noses to raphael stared stupidly at him and then fell to browsing again a goat and her kid that seemed to hang on the side of the crags in some magical fashion capered and leapt to a slab of granite near to raphael and stayed there a moment as if to seek to know who he was the yapping of the dogs brought out a plump child who stood agape and next came a whitehaired old man of middle height both of these two beings were in keeping with the surroundings the air the flowers and the dwelling health appeared to overflow in this fertile region old age and childhood thrived there there seemed to be about all these types of existence the freedom and carelessness of the life of primitive times a happiness of use and wont that gave the lie to our philosophical platitudes and wrought a cure of all its swelling passions in the heart

the old man belonged to the type of model dear to the masculine brush of schnetz the countless wrinkles upon his brown face looked as if they would be hard to the touch the straight nose the prominent cheekbones streaked with red veins like a vineleaf in autumn the angular features all were characteristics of strength even where strength existed no longer the hard hands now that they toiled no longer had preserved their scanty white hair his bearing was that of an absolutely free man it suggested the thought that had he been an italian he would have perhaps turned brigand for the love of the liberty so dear to him the child was a regular mountaineer with the black eyes that can face the sun without flinching a deeply tanned complexion and rough brown hair his movements were like a birds—swift decided and unconstrained his clothing was ragged the white fair skin showed through the rents in his garments there they both stood in silence side by side both obeying the same impulse in both faces were clear tokens of an absolutely identical and idle life the old man had adopted the childs amusements and the child had fallen in with the old mans humor there was a sort of tacit agreement between two kinds of feebleness between failing powers wellnigh spent and powers just about to unfold themselves

very soon a woman who seemed to be about thirty years old appeared on the threshold of the door spinning as she came she was an auvergnate a highcolored comfortablelooking straightforward sort of person with white teeth her cap and dress the face full figure and general appearance were of the auvergne peasant stamp so was her dialect she was a thorough embodiment of her district its hardworking ways its thrift ignorance and heartiness all met in her

she greeted raphael and they began to talk the dogs quieted down the old man went and sat on a bench in the sun the child followed his mother about wherever she went listening without saying a word and staring at the stranger

you are not afraid to live here good woman

what should we be afraid of sir when we bolt the door who ever could get inside oh no we arent afraid at all and besides she said as she brought the marquis into the principal room in the house what should thieves come to take from us here

she designated the room as she spoke the smokeblackened walls with some brilliant pictures in blue red and green an end of credit a crucifixion and the grenadiers of the imperial guard for their sole ornament the furniture here and there the old wooden fourpost bedstead the table with crooked legs a few stools the chest that held the bread the flitch that hung from the ceiling a jar of salt a stove and on the mantleshelf a few discolored yellow plaster figures as he went out again raphael noticed a man halfway up the crags leaning on a hoe and watching the house with interest

thats my man sir said the auvergnate unconsciously smiling in peasant fashion he is at work up there

and that old man is your father

asking your pardon sir he is my mans grandfather such as you see him he is a hundred and two and yet quite lately he walked over to clermont with our little chap oh he has been a strong man in his time but he does nothing now but sleep and eat and drink he amuses himself with the little fellow sometimes the child trails him up the hillsides and he will just go up there along with him

valentin made up his mind immediately he would live between this child and old man breathe the same air eat their bread drink the same water sleep with them make the blood in his veins like theirs it was a dying mans fancy for him the prime model after which the customary existence of the individual should be shaped the real formula for the life of a human being the only true and possible life the lifeideal was to become one of the oysters adhering to this rock to save his shell a day or two longer by paralyzing the power of death one profoundly selfish thought took possession of him and the whole universe was swallowed up and lost in it for him the universe existed no longer the whole world had come to be within himself for the sick the world begins at their pillow and ends at the foot of the bed and this countryside was raphaels sickbed

who has not at some time or other in his life watched the comings and goings of an ant slipped straws into a yellow slugs one breathinghole studied the vagaries of a slender dragonfly pondered admiringly over the countless veins in an oakleaf that bring the colors of a rose window in some gothic cathedral into contrast with the reddish background who has not looked long in delight at the effects of sun and rain on a roof of brown tiles at the dewdrops or at the variously shaped petals of the flowercups who has not sunk into these idle absorbing meditations on things without that have no conscious end yet lead to some definite thought at last who in short has not led a lazy life the life of childhood the life of the savage without his labor this life without a care or a wish raphael led for some days space he felt a distinct improvement in his condition a wonderful sense of ease that quieted his apprehensions and soothed his sufferings

he would climb the crags and then find a seat high up on some peak whence he could see a vast expanse of distant country at a glance and he would spend whole days in this way like a plant in the sun or a hare in its form and at last growing familiar with the appearances of the plantlife about him and of the changes in the sky he minutely noted the progress of everything working around him in the water on the earth or in the air he tried to share the secret impulses of nature sought by passive obedience to become a part of it and to lie within the conservative and despotic jurisdiction that regulates instinctive existence he no longer wished to steer his own course

just as criminals in olden times were safe from the pursuit of justice if they took refuge under the shadow of the altar so raphael made an effort to slip into the sanctuary of life he succeeded in becoming an integral part of the great and mighty fruitproducing organization he had adapted himself to the inclemency of the air and had dwelt in every cave among the rocks he had learned the ways and habits of growth of every plant had studied the laws of the watercourses and their beds and had come to know the animals he was at last so perfectly at one with this teeming earth that he had in some sort discerned its mysteries and caught the spirit of it

the infinitely varied forms of every natural kingdom were to his thinking only developments of one and the same substance different combinations brought about by the same impulse endless emanations from a measureless being which was acting thinking moving and growing and in harmony with which he longed to grow to move to think and act he had fancifully blended his life with the life of the crags he had deliberately planted himself there during the earliest days of his sojourn in these pleasant surroundings valentin tasted all the pleasures of childhood again thanks to the strange hallucination of apparent convalescence which is not unlike the pauses of delirium that nature mercifully provides for those in pain he went about making trifling discoveries setting to work on endless things and finishing none of them the evenings plans were quite forgotten in the morning he had no cares he was happy he thought himself saved

one morning he had lain in bed till noon deep in the dreams between sleep and waking which give to realities a fantastic appearance and make the wildest fancies seem solid facts while he was still uncertain that he was not dreaming yet he suddenly heard his hostess giving a report of his health to jonathan for the first time jonathan came to inquire after him daily and the auvergnate thinking no doubt that valentin was still asleep had not lowered the tones of a voice developed in mountain air

no better and no worse she said he coughed all last night again fit to kill himself poor gentleman he coughs and spits till it is piteous my husband and i often wonder to each other where he gets the strength from to cough like that it goes to your heart what a cursed complaint it is he has no strength at all i am always afraid i shall find him dead in his bed some morning he is every bit as pale as a waxen christ dame i watch him while he dresses his poor body is as thin as a nail and he does not feel well now but no matter its all the same he wears himself out with running about as if he had health and to spare all the same he is very brave for he never complains at all but really he would be better under the earth than on it for he is enduring the agonies of christ i dont wish that myself sir it is quite in our interests but even if he didnt pay us what he does i should be just as fond of him it is not our own interest that is our motive

ah mon dieu she continued parisians are the people for these dogs diseases where did he catch it now poor young man and he is so sure that he is going to get well that fever just gnaws him you know it eats him away it will be the death of him he has no notion whatever of that he does not know it sir he sees nothing——you mustnt cry about him m jonathan you must remember that he will be happy and will not suffer any more you ought to make a neuvaine for him i have seen wonderful cures come of the nine days prayer and i would gladly pay for a wax taper to save such a gentle creature so good he is a paschal lamb——

as raphaels voice had grown too weak to allow him to make himself heard he was compelled to listen to this horrible loquacity his irritation however drove him out of bed at length and he appeared upon the threshold

old scoundrel he shouted to jonathan do you mean to put me to death

the peasant woman took him for a ghost and fled

i forbid you to have any anxiety whatever about my health raphael went on

yes my lord marquis said the old servant wiping away his tears

and for the future you had very much better not come here without my orders

jonathan meant to be obedient but in the look full of pity and devotion that he gave the marquis before he went raphael read his own deathwarrant utterly disheartened brought all at once to a sense of his real position valentin sat down on the threshold locked his arms across his chest and bowed his head jonathan turned to his master in alarm with my lord——

go away go away cried the invalid

in the hours of the next morning raphael climbed the crags and sat down in a mossy cleft in the rocks whence he could see the narrow path along which the water for the dwelling was carried at the base of the hill he saw jonathan in conversation with the auvergnate some malicious power interpreted for him all the womans forebodings and filled the breeze and the silence with her ominous words thrilled with horror he took refuge among the highest summits of the mountains and stayed there till the evening but yet he could not drive away the gloomy presentiments awakened within him in such an unfortunate manner by a cruel solicitude on his account

the auvergne peasant herself suddenly appeared before him like a shadow in the dusk a perverse freak of the poet within him found a vague resemblance between her black and white striped petticoat and the bony frame of a spectre

the damp is falling now sir said she if you stop out there you will go off just like rotten fruit you must come in it isnt healthy to breathe the damp and you have taken nothing since the morning besides

tonnerre de dieu old witch he cried let me live after my own fashion i tell you or i shall be off altogether it is quite bad enough to dig my grave every morning you might let it alone in the evenings at least——

your grave sir i dig your grave—and where may your grave be i want to see you as old as father there and not in your grave by any manner of means the grave that comes soon enough for us all in the grave——

that is enough said raphael

take my arm sir

no

the feeling of pity in others is very difficult for a man to bear and it is hardest of all when the pity is deserved hatred is a tonic—it quickens life and stimulates revenge but pity is death to us—it makes our weakness weaker still it is as if distress simpered ingratiatingly at us contempt lurks in the tenderness or tenderness in an affront in the centenarian raphael saw triumphant pity a wondering pity in the childs eyes an officious pity in the woman and in her husband a pity that had an interested motive but no matter how the sentiment declared itself death was always its import

a poet makes a poem of everything it is tragical or joyful as things happen to strike his imagination his lofty soul rejects all halftones he always prefers vivid and decided colors in raphaels soul this compassion produced a terrible poem of mourning and melancholy when he had wished to live in close contact with nature he had of course forgotten how freely natural emotions are expressed he would think himself quite alone under a tree whilst he struggled with an obstinate coughing fit a terrible combat from which he never issued victorious without utter exhaustion afterwards and then he would meet the clear bright eyes of the little boy who occupied the post of sentinel like a savage in a bent of grass the eyes scrutinized him with a childish wonder in which there was as much amusement as pleasure and an indescribable mixture of indifference and interest the awful brother you must die of the trappists seemed constantly legible in the eyes of the peasants with whom raphael was living he scarcely knew which he dreaded most their unfettered talk or their silence their presence became torture

one morning he saw two men in black prowling about in his neighborhood who furtively studied him and took observations they made as though they had come there for a stroll and asked him a few indifferent questions to which he returned short answers he recognized them both one was the cure and the other the doctor at the springs jonathan had no doubt sent them or the people in the house had called them in or the scent of an approaching death had drawn them thither he beheld his own funeral heard the chanting of the priests and counted the tall wax candles and all that lovely fertile nature around him in whose lap he had thought to find life once more he saw no longer save through a veil of crape everything that but lately had spoken of length of days to him now prophesied a speedy end he set out the next day for paris not before he had been inundated with cordial wishes which the people of the house uttered in melancholy and wistful tones for his benefit

he traveled through the night and awoke as they passed through one of the pleasant valleys of the bourbonnais view after view swam before his gaze and passed rapidly away like the vague pictures of a dream cruel nature spread herself out before his eyes with tantalizing grace sometimes the allier a liquid shining ribbon meandered through the distant fertile landscape then followed the steeples of hamlets hiding modestly in the depths of a ravine with its yellow cliffs sometimes after the monotony of vineyards the watermills of a little valley would be suddenly seen and everywhere there were pleasant chateaux hillside villages roads with their fringes of queenly poplars and the loire itself at last with its wide sheets of water sparkling like diamonds amid its golden sands attractions everywhere without end this nature all astir with a life and gladness like that of childhood scarcely able to contain the impulses and sap of june possessed a fatal attraction for the darkened gaze of the invalid he drew the blinds of his carriage windows and betook himself again to slumber

towards evening after they had passed cesne he was awakened by lively music and found himself confronted with a village fair the horses were changed near the marketplace whilst the postilions were engaged in making the transfer he saw the people dancing merrily pretty and attractive girls with flowers about them excited youths and finally the jolly wineflushed countenances of old peasants children prattled old women laughed and chatted everything spoke in one voice and there was a holiday gaiety about everything down to their clothing and the tables that were set out a cheerful expression pervaded the square and the church the roofs and windows even the very doorways of the village seemed likewise to be in holiday trim

raphael could not repress an angry exclamation nor yet a wish to silence the fiddles annihilate the stir and bustle stop the clamor and disperse the illtimed festival like a dying man he felt unable to endure the slightest sound and he entered his carriage much annoyed when he looked out upon the square from the window he saw that all the happiness was scared away the peasant women were in flight and the benches were deserted only a blind musician on the scaffolding of the orchestra went on playing a shrill tune on his clarionet that piping of his without dancers to it and the solitary old man himself in the shadow of the limetree with his curmudgeons face scanty hair and ragged clothing was like a fantastic picture of raphaels wish the heavy rain was pouring in torrents it was one of those thunderstorms that june brings about so rapidly to cease as suddenly the thing was so natural that when raphael had looked out and seen some pale clouds driven over by a gust of wind he did not think of looking at the piece of skin he lay back again in the corner of his carriage which was very soon rolling upon its way

the next day found him back in his home again in his own room beside his own fireside he had had a large fire lighted he felt cold jonathan brought him some letters they were all from pauline he opened the first one without any eagerness and unfolded it as if it had been the graypaper form of application for taxes made by the revenue collector he read the first sentence

gone this really is a flight my raphael how is it no one can tell me where you are and who should know if not i

he did not wish to learn any more he calmly took up the letters and threw them in the fire watching with dull and lifeless eyes the perfumed paper as it was twisted shriveled bent and devoured by the capricious flames fragments that fell among the ashes allowed him to see the beginning of a sentence or a halfburnt thought or word he took a pleasure in deciphering them—a sort of mechanical amusement

sitting at your door—expected—caprice—i obey—rivals—i never—thy pauline—love—no more of pauline—if you had wished to leave me for ever you would not have deserted me—love eternal—to die——

the words caused him a sort of remorse he seized the tongs and rescued a last fragment of the letter from the flames

i have murmured so pauline wrote but i have never complained my raphael if you have left me so far behind you it was doubtless because you wished to hide some heavy grief from me perhaps you will kill me one of these days but you are too good to torture me so do not go away from me like this there i can bear the worst of torment if only i am at your side any grief that you could cause me would not be grief there is far more love in my heart for you than i have ever yet shown you i can endure anything except this weeping far away from you this ignorance of your——

raphael laid the scorched scrap on the mantelpiece then all at once he flung it into the fire the bit of paper was too clearly a symbol of his own love and luckless existence

go and find m bianchon he told jonathan

horace came and found raphael in bed

can you prescribe a draught for me—some mild opiate which will always keep me in a somnolent condition a draught that will not be injurious although taken constantly

nothing is easier the young doctor replied but you will have to keep on your feet for a few hours daily at any rate so as to take your food

a few hours raphael broke in no no i only wish to be out of bed for an hour at most

what is your object inquired bianchon

to sleep for so one keeps alive at any rate the patient answered let no one come in not even mlle pauline de wistchnau he added to jonathan as the doctor was writing out his prescription

well m horace is there any hope the old servant asked going as far as the flight of steps before the door with the young doctor

he may live for some time yet or he may die tonight the chances of life and death are evenly balanced in his case i cant understand it at all said the doctor with a doubtful gesture his mind ought to be diverted

diverted ah sir you dont know him he killed a man the other day without a word—nothing can divert him

for some days raphael lay plunged in the torpor of this artificial sleep thanks to the material power that opium exerts over the immaterial part of us this man with the powerful and active imagination reduced himself to the level of those sluggish forms of animal life that lurk in the depths of forests and take the form of vegetable refuse never stirring from their place to catch their easy prey he had darkened the very sun in heaven the daylight never entered his room about eight oclock in the evening he would leave his bed with no very clear consciousness of his own existence he would satisfy the claims of hunger and return to bed immediately one dull blighted hour after another only brought confused pictures and appearances before him and lights and shadows against a background of darkness he lay buried in deep silence movement and intelligence were completely annihilated for him he woke later than usual one evening and found that his dinner was not ready he rang for jonathan

you can go he said i have made you rich you shall be happy in your old age but i will not let you muddle away my life any longer miserable wretch i am hungry—where is my dinner how is it—answer me

a satisfied smile stole over jonathans face he took a candle that lit up the great dark rooms of the mansion with its flickering light brought his master who had again become an automaton into a great gallery and flung a door suddenly open raphael was all at once dazzled by a flood of light and amazed by an unheardof scene

his chandeliers had been filled with waxlights the rarest flowers from his conservatory were carefully arranged about the room the table sparkled with silver gold crystal and porcelain a royal banquet was spread—the odors of the tempting dishes tickled the nervous fibres of the palate there sat his friends he saw them among beautiful women in full evening dress with bare necks and shoulders with flowers in their hair fair women of every type with sparkling eyes attractively and fancifully arrayed one had adopted an irish jacket which displayed the alluring outlines of her form one wore the basquina of andalusia with its wanton grace here was a halfclad dian the huntress there the costume of mlle de la valliere amorous and coy and all of them alike were given up to the intoxication of the moment

as raphaels deathpale face showed itself in the doorway a sudden outcry broke out as vehement as the blaze of this improvised banquet the voices perfumes and lights the exquisite beauty of the women produced their effect upon his senses and awakened his desires delightful music from unseen players in the next room drowned the excited tumult in a torrent of harmony—the whole strange vision was complete

raphael felt a caressing pressure on is own hand a womans white youthful arms were stretched out to grasp him and the hand was aquilinas he knew now that this scene was not a fantastic illusion like the fleeting pictures of his disordered dreams he uttered a dreadful cry slammed the door and dealt his heartbroken old servant a blow in the face

monster he cried so you have sworn to kill me and trembling at the risks he had just now run he summoned all his energies reached his room took a powerful sleeping draught and went to bed

the devil cried jonathan recovering himself and m bianchon most certainly told me to divert his mind

it was close upon midnight by that time owing to one of those physical caprices that are the marvel and the despair of science raphael in his slumber became radiant with beauty a bright color glowed on his pale cheeks there was an almost girlish grace about the forehead in which his genius was revealed life seemed to bloom on the quiet face that lay there at rest his sleep was sound a light even breath was drawn in between red lips he was smiling—he had passed no doubt through the gate of dreams into a noble life was he a centenarian now did his grandchildren come to wish him length of days or on a rustic bench set in the sun and under the trees was he scanning like the prophet on the mountain heights a promised land a faroff time of blessing

here you are

the words uttered in silver tones dispelled the shadowy faces of his dreams he saw pauline in the lamplight sitting upon the bed pauline grown fairer yet through sorrow and separation raphael remained bewildered by the sight of her face white as the petals of some water flower and the shadow of her long dark hair about it seemed to make it whiter still her tears had left a gleaming trace upon her cheeks and hung there yet ready to fall at the least movement she looked like an angel fallen from the skies or a spirit that a breath might waft away as she sat there all in white with her head bowed scarcely creasing the quilt beneath her weight

ah i have forgotten everything she cried as raphael opened his eyes i have no voice left except to tell you i am yours there is nothing in my heart but love angel of my life you have never been so beautiful before your eyes are blazing—— but come i can guess it all you have been in search of health without me you were afraid of me—— well——

go go leave me raphael muttered at last why do you not go if you stay i shall die do you want to see me die

die she echoed can you die without me die but you are young and i love you die she asked in a deep hollow voice she seized his hands with a frenzied movement cold she wailed is it all an illusion

raphael drew the little bit of skin from under his pillow it was as tiny and as fragile as a periwinkle petal he showed it to her

pauline he said fair image of my fair life let us say goodbye

goodbye she echoed looking surprised

yes this is a talisman that grants me all my wishes and that represents my span of life see here this is all that remains of it if you look at me any longer i shall die——

the young girl thought that valentin had grown lightheaded she took the talisman and went to fetch the lamp by its tremulous light which she shed over raphael and the talisman she scanned her lovers face and the last morsel of the magic skin as pauline stood there in all the beauty of love and terror raphael was no longer able to control his thoughts memories of tender scenes and of passionate and fevered joys overwhelmed the soul that had so long lain dormant within him and kindled a fire not quite extinct

pauline pauline come to me——

a dreadful cry came from the girls throat her eyes dilated with horror her eyebrows were distorted and drawn apart by an unspeakable anguish she read in raphaels eyes the vehement desire in which she had once exulted but as it grew she felt a light movement in her hand and the skin contracted she did not stop to think she fled into the next room and locked the door

pauline pauline cried the dying man as he rushed after her i love you i adore you i want you pauline i wish to die in your arms

with unnatural strength the last effort of ebbing life he broke down the door and saw his mistress writhing upon a sofa pauline had vainly tried to pierce her heart and now thought to find a rapid death by strangling herself with her shawl

if i die he will live she said trying to tighten the knot that she had made

in her struggle with death her hair hung loose her shoulders were bare her clothing was disordered her eyes were bathed in tears her face was flushed and drawn with the horror of despair yet as her exceeding beauty met raphaels intoxicated eyes his delirium grew he sprang towards her like a bird of prey tore away the shawl and tried to take her in his arms

the dying man sought for words to express the wish that was consuming his strength but no sounds would come except the choking deathrattle in his chest each breath he drew sounded hollower than the last and seemed to come from his very entrails at the last moment no longer able to utter a sound he set his teeth in paulines breast jonathan appeared terrified by the cries he had heard and tried to tear away the dead body from the grasp of the girl who was crouching with it in a corner

what do you want she asked he is mine i have killed him did i not foresee how it would be1embed"
