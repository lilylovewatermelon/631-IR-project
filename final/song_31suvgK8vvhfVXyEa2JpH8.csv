verse 1
im giving you my testimony line for line
im giving you the best of me its wrong or right
somebody tell the kids they need to calm it down
i wanna hear your heart pump pound for pound
show me everything i need to see on my blind side
show me you gon be there for the love of a real boy
i just wanna be there for my dogs they need me
i just wanna be there for the game thats easy
