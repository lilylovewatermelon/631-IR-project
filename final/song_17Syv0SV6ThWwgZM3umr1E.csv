never know how much i love you
never know how much i care
when you put your arms around me
i get a fever thats so hard to bear
you give me fever when you kiss me
fever when you hold me tight
fever in the morning
fever all through the night

verse 2
sun lights up the daytime
moon lights up the night
i light up when you call my name
and you know im gonna treat you right
you give me fever when you kiss me
fever when you hold me tight
fever in the the morning
fever all through the night

captain smith and pocahontas
had a very mad affair
when her daddy tried to kill him
she said daddy no dont you dare
he gives me fever with his kisses
fever when he holds me tight
fever im his missus
oh daddy wont you treat him right

verse 5
now youve listened to my story
heres the point i have made
chicks were born to give you fever
be it fahrenheit or centigrade
they give you fever when you kiss them
fever if you live and learn
fever till you sizzle
what a lovely way to burn
outro
what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burn
what a lovely way to burnembed"
