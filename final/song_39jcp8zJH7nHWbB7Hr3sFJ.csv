oh

verse 1
oh im scared if i look in your eyes i might see your soul
i know love is the loneliest place when you fall alone

prechorus
sitting by the phone holding onto hope
spending all night wondering why you let me go you let me go
i wish you had felt how youre feeling two years ago
oh nah

chorus
hurts me to hurt you baby
lying awake and everything has changed
keeping our distance lately
kills me to kill you when i tell you
that i felt it once i cant feel it twice
its more than i can take baby
hurts me to tell you i dont feel the same

verse 2
i can feel you still staring at me when i look away
cant imagine the pain that you feel when i kiss his face

thats when you said
how can i be your friend when i know the way you taste
its almost 2 am and i cant ask you to stay
i dont know whats worse getting broken or making it break
oh ah

chorus
hurts me to hurt you baby
lying awake and everything has changed
keeping our distance lately
kills me to kill you when i tell you
that i felt it once i cant feel it twice
its more than i can take baby
hurts me to tell you i dont feel the same

chorus
hurts me to hurt you babe
feels like theres nothing i can say
hurts me to hurt you babe
kills me i have to walk away
cause i felt it once i cant feel it twice
its more than i can take baby
hurts me to tell you i dont feel the same
