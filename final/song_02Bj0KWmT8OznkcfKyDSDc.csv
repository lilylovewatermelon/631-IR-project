some day youll see
surrounded by angels
floating atop of the sea
on bended knee
dont go where they go
dont sing all the songs they sing

chorus
nobody knows you
the way you know you
but i think i do
well i thought i knew
yeah i thought i knew

nobody knows you
the way you know you
but i think i do
well i thought i knew
yeah i thought i knew

verse 2
between these walls
her barkstripped limbs
casts shadows frighteningly tall
i slow to a crawl
i jump and i yell
and she hears nothing at all

nobody knows you
the way you know you
but i think i do
well i thought i knew
yeah i thought i knew

nobody knows you
the way you know you
but i think i do
well i thought i knew
yeah i thought i knew

verse 3
stay stay the same
cause everything else will change
and ill always be to blame
so please just stay the same

the current has pulled me in
the tide has reached my chin
my seaweed tickled skin
just let the water win

im freezing to the bone
youll never feel at home
just watch your body go
just watch your body go
chorus
nobody knows you
the way you know you
but i think i do
well i thought i knew
yeah i thought i knew

nobody knows you
the way you know you
but i think i do
well i thought i knew
yeah i thought i knew5embed"
