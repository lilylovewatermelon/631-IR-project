keep you in the dark you know they all pretend
keep you in the dark and so it all began

verse 1
send in your skeletons
sing as their bones go marchin in again
the need you buried deep
the secrets that you keep are ever ready
are you ready
im finished makin sense
done pleading ignorance that whole defense
spinning infinity boy
the wheel is spinnin me its never ending never ending
same old story

chorus
what if i say im not like the others
what if i say im not just another one of your plays
youre the pretender
what if i say i will never surrender
what if i say im not like the others
what if i say im not just another one of your plays
youre the pretender
what if i say that ill never surrender
