aint no line around the corner no security
no velvet rope no dress code everybodys vip
you can wear your hat dance in your bare feet
no credit card no roll of cash just byob

chorus
woah oh oh chilling on a back porch
little hottie swinging up in the swings
them good old boys picking six strings
woah oh oh leave your trouble at the door
no cover charge get in for free
no last call lets party on a back porch
chilling on the back porch oh yeah
chilling on the back porch oh yeah

verse 2
got a tin roof on the top just in case it rains
got a kiddy pool off the deck for those hot as hell days
got beer on ice all day all night
now if that sounds like something you like come on

outro
on a back porch
little hottie swinging up in the swings
them good old boys picking six strings
no cover charge get in for free
no last call so lets party on a back porch
