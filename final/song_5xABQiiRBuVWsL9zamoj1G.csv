you rise you fall you’re down and you rise again
what dont kill you make you more strong
you rise you fall you’re down and you rise again
what dont kill you make you more strong
rise fall down rise again
what dont kill you make you more strong
rise fall down rise again
what dont kill you make you more strong
through black days through black nights
through pitch black insides

chorus
breaking your teeth on the hard life coming
show your scars
cutting your feet on the hard earth running
show your scars
breaking your life broken beat and scarred
but we die hard

verse 2
the dawn the death the fight to the final breath
what dont kill you make you more strong
the dawn the death the fight to the final breath
what dont kill you make you more strong
dawn death fight final breath
what dont kill you make you more strong
dawn death fight final breath
what dont kill you make you more strong
they scratch me they scrape me
they cut and rape me

breaking your teeth on the hard life coming
show your scars
cutting your feet on the hard earth running
show your scars
breaking your life broken beat and scarred
but we die hard

outro
breaking your teeth on the hard life coming
show your scars
cutting your feet on the hard earth running
show your scars
bleeding your soul in a hard luck story
show your scars
spilling your blood in the hot suns glory
show your scars
breaking your life broken beat and scarred
we die hard
we die hard
we die hard4embed"
