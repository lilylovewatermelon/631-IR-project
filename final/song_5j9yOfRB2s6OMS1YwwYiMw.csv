theres no sunshine this impossible year
only black days and sky grey and clouds full of fear
and storms full of sorrow that wont disappear
just typhoons and monsoons this impossible year
verse 2
theres no good times this impossible year
just a beachfront of bad blood and a coast thats unclear
all the guests at the party theyre so insincere
they just intrude and exclude this impossible year
verse 3
theres no you and me this impossible year
only heartache and heartbreak and gin made of tears
the bitter pill i swallow  the scars souvenir
that tattoo your last bruise this impossible year
bridge
theres never air to breathe theres never inbetweens
these nightmares always hang on past the dream
outro
theres no sunshine
theres no you and me
theres no good times
