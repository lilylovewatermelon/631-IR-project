she wouldnt care if he walked in and caught her
shes come to dance a dance or two
and do no tellin what by the time the night is through

she found out the hard way about him
shes out to find out how shell do without him
her hands are shakin her hearts pounding
by the way shes drinking his memorys drownin

shes not the cheatin kind
shes been cheated one too many times
oh shes never fooled around
cause hes still lyin shes through cryin
shes not foolin now

she walks by and every head turns
you can see how hot her fire burns
he didnt know what a good thing he had
its too late and thats too bad

shes not the cheatin kind
shes been cheated one too many times
oh shes never fooled around
cause hes still lyin shes through cryin
shes not foolin now
see brooks  dunn liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likeshes not the cheatin kind
shes been cheated one too many times
oh shes never fooled around
cause hes still lyin shes through cryin
shes not foolin now

shes not the cheatin kind
shes been cheated one too many times
oh shes never fooled around
cause hes still lyin shes through cryin
shes not foolin now1embed"
