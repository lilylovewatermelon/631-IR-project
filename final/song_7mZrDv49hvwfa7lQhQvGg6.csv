i wont maintain insane get it up
you always play the blame game no shame had enough
i dont wanna maintain insane get it up
you always play the blame game no shame had enough

verse 1
fresher
like its the 1st semester
rock it like queen when im under pressure
while the rest of these cats all siesta
i get loose like change when its on your dresser
boom here comes the real volume
loud enough to wake up and shake this tomb
i connect like skate decks in concrete rooms
youre about to face what makes this move

prechorus
people used to tell me that im on my own
they said id never make a difference on this microphone
cause theres a million other people who could sing this song
i said well thanks for the push cause you all were wrong

chorus
you wanna try to take me under
ill never bow till im six feet under
listen to the sound of rolling thunder
you cant break me
youll never take me down

explosion
dig it like rust corrosion
when it goes in gush like a busted nose and
competitors
i was born to set it off
they wrapped me in cloth
i grabbed a mic and went on tour
smash it
back in school i was a hazard
cause i never saw the grass
never just looked past it
had a passion that burned like battery acid
peter parker bit by some radioactive
shake this place in

prechorus
people used to tell me that im on my own
they said id never make a difference on this microphone
cause theres a million other people who could sing this song
i said well thanks for the push cause you all were wrong

chorus
you wanna try to take me under
ill never bow till im six feet under
listen to the sound of rolling thunder
you cant break me
youll never take me down
bridge
if you wanna rise up start with me
if you wanna stand up heres one for free
if you wanna rise up start with me
if you wanna stand up heres one for free
if you wanna rise up start with me
if you wanna stand up heres one for free
feel the movement feel the pressure
if you wanna rise up start with me
if you wanna stand up heres one for free
feel the movement feel the pressure
feel the movement feel the pressure

chorus
you wanna try to take me under
ill never bow till im six feet under
listen to the sound of rolling thunder
you cant break me
youll never take me down
you wanna try to take me under
ill never bow till im six feet under
listen to the sound of rolling thunder
you cant break me
youll never take me down4embed"
