and i cant move on babydoll
waitin on calls flippin through stations
im outclassed and its outrageous ooh
and ill take it all babydoll
whatevers been weighin you down eeh

verse
find me on miami concrete
lookin for somebody different cause my daddy was a pimp ooh ooh ooh
my mama had her issues but i miss her anyway
oh babydoll ooh oohooh
please dont call me for the wrong reasons
we both know exactly what im thinkin
weeks pass and i never grow tired
cause i never said never and i barely ever lie
im on the road to an original place in outer space
i didnt make it up but you cant find it on a phone or a globe
and i can take you with me if you really wanna go
oh babydoll i cant move on

chorus
and i cant move on babydoll
waitin on calls flippin through stations
im outclassed and its outrageous ooh
and ill take it all babydoll
