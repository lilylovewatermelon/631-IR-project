as i walk through the valley of the
shadow of la
the footsteps that were next to me have
gone their separate ways
ive seen enough now to know that beautiful things dont
always stay that way
ive done enough now to know this beautiful place isnt
everything they say

prechorus joel madden
i heard that evil comes disguised
like the city of angels im walking towards the light

chorus joel madden
baptized in the river
ive seen a vision of my life and i want to be delivered
in the city was a sinner
ive done a lot of things wrong but i swear im a believer

postchorus joel madden
like the prodigal son i was out on my own
now im trying to find my way back home
baptized in the river
im delivered im delivered

youre from a small town youre going to grow up fast
underneath these lights
down in hollywood on the boulevard the
dead come back to life
to the praying mother and the worried father let your
children go
if they come back theyll come home stronger and if they
dont youll know

prechorus joel madden
they say that evil comes disguised
like the city of angels im walking towards the light

chorus joel madden
baptized in the river
ive seen a vision of my life and i want to be delivered
in the city was a sinner
ive done a lot of things wrong but i swear im a believer

postchorus joel madden
like the prodigal son i was out on my own
now im trying to find my way back home
baptized in the river
im delivered im delivered
