you are far
when i could have been your star
you listened to people
who scared you to death
and from my heart
strange that you were strong enough
to even make a start
youll never find peace of mind
till you listen to your heart

verse 2
people you can never change the way they feel
better let them do just what they will
for they will if you let them
steal your heart from you
people will always make a lover feel a fool
but you knew i loved you
we could have shown them all
we should have seen love through

bridge
fooled me with the tears in your eyes
covered me with kisses and lies
so bye
but please dont take my heart
you might also likeverse 3
you are far
im never gonna be your star
ill pick up the pieces
and mend my heart
strange that i was wrong enough
to think youd love me too
you must have been kissin a fool
i said you must have beena kissin a fool

verse 4
but remember this every other kiss
that youll ever give long as we both live
when you need the hand of another man
one you really can surrender with
i will wait for you like i always do
theres something there
that cant compare
with any other

outro
you are far
when i could have been your star
you listened to people
who scared you to death
and from my heart
strange that i was wrong enough
to think youd love me too
you must have been kissin a fool
you must have been kissin a fool
you must have been kissin a foolembed"
