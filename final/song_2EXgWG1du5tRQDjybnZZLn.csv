haha

verse 1
call it education
it was somewhere in between
you gave me some sound advice
but i wasnt listening
after we had capsized
i could tell you how youd fall
well im not sure if i lay to rest
on the ceiling or the wall

verse 2
not quite conversation
it was somewhere in between
you said everything is taught
and i listened patiently
all this dog and pony
were still monkeys the whole time
we could not help from flingin shit
in our modern suits and ties

verse 3
our instincts they were cringin
about how we lived our lives
it didnt seem wed lived enough
to even get to die
all these dense distractions
so beautifully complex
well i love lifes surprises so much
i dont want to know whats ahead â€”ead

verse 4
hardly education
it was somewhere in between
oh i hit the roof but i had
aimed for the ceiling

verse 5
hardly education
all them books i didnt read
they just sat there on my shelf
lookin much smarter than me

he knew the whole damn time

stubborn shouted and said
i dont do what you do i dont know
