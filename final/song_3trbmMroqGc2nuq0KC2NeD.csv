yeah yeah
oh oh oh listen

verse 1
boy its been a long time
since the last time i saw you
feels like nothin changed
since weve been together
i must admit that i go crazy bout you
and i can see it in your eyes
that theres somethin you wanna say to me
cause usually right now youd be holdin on to me
but instead youre tellin me

prechorus
that things have changed theyre not the same
and recently you found someone that you
decided to dedicate your whole life to
and what we had has got to be through

chorus
and baby what hurts the most is letting go
i just want you to know that i love you so
i know things are different now
youve gone and settled down
i thought for sure youd always wait for me
ill tell you what hurts the most is i should have took the chance
boy when you came to me and offered me your hand
and offered me
silly of me i thought id always have your heart
i had the chance to have all the love
oh how im missing you now

and theres no one else in this world for me but you
