baby blue
i know how things have changed for you
remember that the days are numbered
springtime turns to summer
with or without you
little man
the autumn came and changed up your plans
remember now their dead had gone
no one wants you singing along

chorus
more and more and more and more
more and more and more and more and more

verse 2
baby blue
ive been making changes too
remember now the times been spent up
theres no place left to rent out
there aint much else for you to do
skyless moon
maybe spring will change up your tune
remember now its dead had gone
memories keep singing their songs
