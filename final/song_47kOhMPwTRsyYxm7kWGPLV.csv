i wanna move on wanna let go of sorrow
i wanna live on i wanna change tomorrow
you picked me apart its all so hard im moving forward
i wanna let go of all the shame i live in
its all coming back because you always give it
im falling apart when the heart break starts im moving forward

chorus
all these things i cant stop running through my head
these things i cant stop running through everything
im not the man i used to be
i’m not the man i used to be

verse 2
i wanna move on wanna let go of grieving
i wanna be home without all the screaming
im taking life back like a heart attack im moving forward
now ive moved on you know that im not leaving
its time to let go time to start believing
im running away to stop all the pain im moving forward

chorus
all these things i cant stop running through my head
these things i cant stop running through everything
im not the man i used to be
all these things i can’t stop running through my head
these things i can’t stop running through everything
i’m not the man i used to be
