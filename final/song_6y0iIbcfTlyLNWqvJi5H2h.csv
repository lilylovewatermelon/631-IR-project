i dont know too much about too much of my old man
i know he walked right out the door we never saw him again
last i heard he was at the bar doing himself in
i know ive got that same disease i guess i got that from him

prechorus
this is the story of my old man
just like his father before him
im telling you do anything you can
so you dont end up just like them like them

chorus
monday he woke up and hated life
drank until wednesday and left his wife
thursday through saturday lost everything
woke up on sunday miserable again

verse 2
i remember baseball games and working on the car
he told that he loved me and that i would go far
showed me how to work hard and stick up for myself
i wish he wasnt too hard to listen to himself

prechorus
this is the story of my old man
just like his father before him
im telling you do anything you can
so you dont end up just like them like them

someday hell wish that he made things right made things right

remember the days he had everything everything
now hes alone and miserable againembed"
