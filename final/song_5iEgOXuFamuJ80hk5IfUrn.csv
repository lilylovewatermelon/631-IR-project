my better days i go buy the hard sell
but i feel like im working with barbed wire and moth wings
cause i cant really get a hold of many things
im one deep breath away from a breakdown
my nerves are wrecked and coming unwound
the world is hostile and im fragile and i need
someone to kiss the cuts and tell me to keep trying

is it me  is it really just me
does everybody have it together or are we all pretending
is it me  is it really just me
holding it together with one loose string
that i cant stop i cant stop
i cant stop pulling
i rip myself apart at the seams
i find one weak spot and start unraveling
hoping i can find a better me
a fresh new start buried under me

is it me  is it really just me
does everybody have it together or are we all pretending
is it me  is it really just me
holding it together with one loose string
that i cant stop i cant stop
i cant stop pulling
see the crane wives liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likecan we stop pretending now
can we stop pretending now
can we all admit that we dont have it figured out

can we stop pretending now
can we stop pretending now
can we all admit that we dont have it figured out

is it me  is it really just me
does everybody have it together or are we all pretending
is it me  is it really just me
holding it together with one loose string
that i cant stop i cant stop
i cant stop pulling
i cant stop pulling
i cant stop pullingembed"
