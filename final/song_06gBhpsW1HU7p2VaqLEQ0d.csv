livin in the city
hard to see the sky
water gettin cloudy
concrete riverbank is dry

theres people all around
but theyre so far apart
movin past the outskirts
for to get a brand new start

help these streets keep closing in on me
you know theres somewhere else id rather be

verse 3
clouds wont rain down
tensions runnin high
i cant find a stranger way
the load as i go by

chorus
help these streets keep closing in on me
you know theres somewhere elsе id rather be
