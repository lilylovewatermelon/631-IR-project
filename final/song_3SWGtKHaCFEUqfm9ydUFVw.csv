let me just set the scene
id just left the party at blakes and its halloween
had the keys to my car in my hand but i didnt leave
cause the potential of us it was keeping me up all night long
i left a text you wont read all night long

chorus
this could be a disaster
theres so many factors like what if you freak out
and then were losin it all at the critical chapter
where i say i love you and you dont say it after
this could be a disaster
im pedaling backwards by sayin that im drunk
i really shouldnt have called im a little bit plastered
you call me a liar now im fallin in faster
this could be a disaster

postchorus
ohohoh disaster
ohohoh disaster

verse 2
let me just lose my mind
is it purely platonic to call me like every night
you know ashley believes that theres something between you and i
but if im readin it wrong then itd be better off if i died oh
and if youre readin the text all night long
