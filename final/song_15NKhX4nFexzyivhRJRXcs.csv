chorus ti  pharrell williams
but shes a freak though
she got angel eyes with the baby face

i want my momma and daddy to meet her maybe have my name
but shes a freak though
they keep talking about you
because they cant keep up with your pace
youre my super freak super freak
youre my super freak

verse 1 ti
my momma taught me everything fine aint the finest
and everything that shine aint a diamond
they say that change come wit time and im finding
that most bitches take your kindness for blindness
yeah it feel good laying her beside you
diggin deep ol nine up beside you
but we cant kick out in public gotta hide you
cause all my partnaz in the hood done tried you
its true that you cant turn a ho into a house wife
well listen shorty maybe i dont want a house wife
they say that you a freak im thinking that they bout right
because that pussys so good and your mouth tight
a pretty face slim waist and her stout nice
juicy ass that them niggas in the south like
she super sexy got a nigga thinking bout a wife
wearing all white being wit her for life

verse 2 ti
the main thing making niggas judge you
is the same thing that make me wanna love you
from the smell of ya hair i wanna hug you
to the way you yell give it to me when i fuck you
plus you aint tripping off a nigga cause he thuggin
thats why im twice as happy as relationships that wasnt
but my partna say you trickin wit his cousin
but nevermind i dont listen they be buggin
they find it hard to understand how could tip love
this girl when her man is out at strip clubs
maybe cause tip girls leaving wit girls
and in the morning theyll be waking up with six girls
they dont know we more like homies when we pick girls
why you worried bout it he aint gotta make you his girl
fuck what he think about you i think you the shit girl
make me wanna bring another kid in the world

verse 3 ti
now i been told every nigga in the streets know
she aint nothing but a freak ho
but when i look in her pretty eyes i dont see it though
now she done showed me some shit that i aint seen before
but what we do behind closed doors is for me to know
all in all ive decided im a keep her though
im a fucking grown man what im creeping for
just try me by the four thats what im toting heaters for
id die by that for her a real good reason though
thats how i feel let my partnaz and my momma know
keep it real all the disrespect has got to go
i disrespect she is selfish she dont hide it
though she may have been a tad misguided
all she need is a little affection a lot of direction
a nigga wit a constant erection
and i done wasted plenty time contemplating second guessing
procrastinating i wanna buy a ring and pop the question
chorus ti  pharrell williams
but shes a freak though
she got angel eyes with the baby face
but shes a freak though
i want my momma and daddy to meet her maybe have my name
but shes a freak though
they keep talking about you
because they cant keep up with your pace
youre my super freak super freak
youre my super freak1embed"
