she was born in limbo
with the need to be as simple
as her makers and the made up things she dreamed
falling from high buildings til she
was numb to the feeling really
she would never be quite what she seemed
she was just as hollow as the
earth opened up swallowing her
off the grid and into paradise her whole life

hook
on a ride
her whole life is on a ride
on a ride
life is on a ride

verse 2
sailing through the cosmic sea
her celestial frequency
was needed to fulfill the prophecy
she was too real to believe in
though if they would she could free them
from the truth that theyve been told a lie their whole life

hook
on a ride
your whole life is on a ride
on a ride
life is on a ride
your whole life is on a ride
your whole life is on a ride

your whole life is on a ride always wondered why
used to be so different you were not this type of guy
always set aside all your extra pride
then you started tripping different bitches on the side
and i am not surprised no i am not surprised
you always demanded things that i could not supply
and i could not survive
if you dont have survival then i cannot take that ride
your whole life is on a ride your whole life is on a ride

outro
she was just as basic as the universal language of love
necessary to keep him alive16embed"
