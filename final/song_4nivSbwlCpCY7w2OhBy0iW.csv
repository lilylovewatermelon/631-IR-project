verse 1
this is the ultimate journey of your life 
where the weak die and the strong survive 
prepare to suffer 40 days and 40 nights 
strap on your boots because you got a long hike 

chorus
just another journey another journey into time
cmon now
just another journey who ever thought id cross this line
ohohohohoh

verse 2
walking through the dirty streets of jersey jersey 
a dollar to my name searchin for that key 
im tryin not to reincorinate my past 
im tired from the game took another path 
destination 95 dirty south 
where the devil tried to realter my route 
creator took me by the hand and led the wayay 
to make the story short thats why im here today 
see akon liveget tickets as low as 84you might also likechorus
just another journey another journey into time
another journey into time
just another journey who ever thought id cross this line
cross this line ohohohohoh

verse 3
what about that day you said
i wouldnt amount to shit
and about that day you kicked me out onto the bricks 
what about that time you said
i wouldnt make a dime 
and about that time you said
i couldnt make you mine 
destination to the bank overseas 
where akons treated like royalty 
cause theres so much in this world i have to seee 
the wagons rolling so jump in a follow mee 

breakdown
born and raised in africa trying to make a scene 
trying to make a scene 
the best way to get to you is by this music thing 
and you might believe

just another journey who ever thought id cross this line
