burn it down till the embers smoke on the ground
and start new when your heart is an empty room
with walls of the deepest blue

verse 2
homes face how it ages when youre away
and spring blooms then you find a love thats true
but you dont know what now to do

prechorus
cause the chase is all you know
and she stopped running months ago

chorus
and all you see is where else you could be when youre at home
and out on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone

verse 3
the flames and smoke climbed out of every window
and disappeared with everything that you held dear
but you shed not a single tear for the things that you didnt need
cause you knew you were finally free

chorus
cause all you see is where else you could be when youre at home
and out on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone
and all you see is where else you could be when youre at home
and there on the street are so many possibilities to not be alonesee death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also like4embed"
