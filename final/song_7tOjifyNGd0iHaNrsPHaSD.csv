coccotti

coccotti

coccotti looks at him

cliff

he needed some quick cash for a honeymoon so he asked if he could
borrow five hundred dollars i wanted to help him out so i wrote out a
check we went to breakfast and thats the last i saw of him so help me
god they never thought to tell me where they were goin and i never
thought to ask

coccotti looks at him for a long moment he then gives virgil a look virgil
quick as greased lightning grabs cliffs hand and turns it palm up he then
whips out a butterfly knife and slices cliffs palm open and pours chivas regal
on the wound cliff screams

coccotti puffs on a chesterfield

toothpic vic returns to the trailer and reports in italian that theres nothing in
the car

virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel cliff holds his bleeding palm
in agony virgil hands him the dishtowel cliff uses it to wrap up his hand

coccotti
sicilians are great liars the best in the world im a sicilian and my old
man was the world heavyweight champion of sicilian liars and from
growin up with him i learned the pantomime now there are seventeen
different things a guy can do when he lies to give him away a guy has
seventeen pantomimes a womans got twenty but a guys got seventeen
and if you know em like ya know your own face they beat lie detectors to
hell what we got here is a little game of show and tell you dont wanna
show me nothin but youre tellin me everything now i know you know
where they are so tell me before i do some damage you wont walk away
from

the awful pain in cliffs hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart
he looks deep into coccottis eyes

cliff
could i have one of those chesterfields now

coccotti
sure

coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke

cliff
got a match

cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter

cliff
oh dont bother i got one
he lights the cigarette
so youre a sicilian huh

coccotti
intensly
uhhuh

cliff
you know i read a lot especially things that have to do with history i find
that shit fascinating in fact i dont know if you know this or not sicilians
were spawned by niggers

all the men stop what they were doing and look at cliff except for toothpic
vic who doesnt speak english and so isnt insulted coccotti cant believe what
hes hearing

coccotti
come again

cliff
its a fact sicilians have nigger blood pumpin through their hearts if you
dont believe me look it up you see hundreds and hundreds of years ago
the moors conquered sicily and moors are niggers way back then
sicilians were like the wops in northern italy blond hair blue eyes but
once the moors moved in there they changed the whole country they did
so much fuckin with the sicilian women they changed the bloodline for
ever from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin i find it

pastures were not negotiatin i dont like to barter i dont like to dicker

you could hear a pin drop once clarence starts talking marty goes on full
alert drexl stops eating and the whores stop breathing all eyes are on drexl
drexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope its empty

drexl

clarence flashes a wide cheshire cat grin that says thats right asshole

silence

drexl

got here motherfuckin charles bronson is that who you supposed to be
mr majestyk looky here charlie none of this shit is necessary i aint
got no hold on alabama i just tryin to lend the girl a helpin hand √

before drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at
clarence catching him of guard

marty comes up behind clarence and throws his arm around his neck putting
him in a tight choke hold

clarence with his free arm hits marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus
well never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment drexl
takes a flying leap and tackles the two guys

all of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold
records all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of lps

marty whos on the bottom of the pile hasnt let go of clarence

since drexls on top he starts slamming fists into clarences face

clarence whos sandwiched between these two guys cant do a whole lot about
it

drexl
ya wanna fuck with me
hits clarence
ya wanna fuck with me
hits clarence
ill show ya who youre fuckin wit

he hits clarence hard in the face with both fists

clarence who has no leverage whatsoever grabs hold of drexls face and digs
his nails in he sticks his thumb in drexls mouth grabs a piece of cheek and
starts twisting

marty whos in an even worse position can do nothing but tighten his grip
aroud clarences neck until clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of
his head

drexls face is getting torn up but hes also biting down hard on clarences
thumb

clarence raises his head and brings it down fast crunching martys face and
busting his nose

marty loosens his grip around clarences neck clarence wiggles free and gets
up on his knees

drexl and clarence are now on an even but awkward footing the two are
going at each other like a pair of alley cats not aiming their punches keeping
them coming fast and furious theyre not doing much damage to each other
because of their positions its almost like a hockey fight

marty sneaks up behind clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of
lps this disorients clarence marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to
his feet

drexl socks him in the face one two three then he kicks him hard in the balls

marty lets go and clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes he curls up
into a fetal position and holds his balls tears coming out of his eyes

drexls face is torn up from clarences nails

marty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt

drexl
to marty

marty

drexl kicks clarence whos still on the ground hurting

and pulls out the 38 he stick the barrel between drexls legs drexl whos
standing over clarence looks down just in time to see clarence pull the trigger
and blow his balls to bits tiny spots of blood speckle clarences face

drexl shrieks in horror and pain and falls to the ground

marty
off

marty steps into the room

clarence doesnt hesitate he shoots marty four times in the chest

two of three hookers have run out of the front door screaming the other
hooker is curled up in the corner shes too stoned to run but stoned enough to
be terrified

drexl still alive is laying on the ground howling holding whats left of his
balls and his dick

clarence points the gun at the remaining hooker

clarence

clarence

the hooker tears of fear ruining her mascara grabs a suitcase from under the
bed and on her hands and knees pushes it along the floor to clarence

clarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to drexl whos curled up like
a pillbug

closeup √ alabamas face virgils right she doesnt have anything to lose
virgils also right about his being the moment of truth the ferocity in women
that comes out at certain times and is just here under the surface in many
women all of the time is unleashed the absolute feeling of helplessness she felt
only a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into ill
take this motherfucker with me if its the last thing i do seething hatred

letting out a bloodcurling yell she raises the knfe high above her head then
drops to her knees and plunges it deep into virgils right foot

closeup √ virgils face

talk about bloodcurling yells

virgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot tears running
down his face

while virgils bent down alabama smashes an elvis presley whiskey decanter
that clarence bought her in oklahoma over his head its only made of plaster
so it doesnt kill him

virgils moving toward alabama limping on his bad foot

virgil
ok no more mr niceguy

alabama picks up the hotel tv and tosses it to him he instinctively catches it
and with his arms full of television alabama coldcocks him with her fist in the
nose breaking it

her eyes go straight to the door then to the sawedoff shotgun by it she runs to
it bends over the chair for the gun virgils left foot kicks her in the back
sending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door

virgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over alabama
alabamas lying on the ground laughing virgil has killed a lot of people but
not one of them has ever laughed before he did it

virgil
whats so fuckin funny

alabama
laughing
you look so ridiculous

she laughs louder virgils insane he picks her off the floor then lifts her off
the ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom

virgil
laugh it up cunt you were in hysterics a minute ago why aint you
laughing now

alabama lying in the bathtub grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and
squeezes it out in her hand

virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair

alabama rubs the shampoo in his face he lets go of her and his hands go to his
eyes

virgil
oh jesus

she grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face

virgil
oh mary help me

the battered and bruised and bloody alabama emerges from the shower shes
clutching a big bloody piece of broken glass shes vaguely reminiscent of a
tasmanian devil poor virgil cant see very well but he sees her figure coming
toward him he lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks
her into the toilet

ahe recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the
toilet tank

virgil whips out a 45 automatic from his shoulder holster just as alabama
brings the lid down on his head hes pressed up against the wall with this toilet
lid hitting him he cant get a good shot in this tight environment but he fires
anyway hitting the floor the all the toilet and the sink

the toilet lid finally shatters against virgils head he falls to the ground

alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of final net
hairspray she pulls a bic lighter out of her pocket and just as virgil raises his
gun at her she flicks the bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame
which results in a big ball of fire that hits virgil right in the face

he fires off two shots one hits the wall another hits the sink pipe sending
water spraying

upon getting his face fried virgil screams and jumps up knocking alabama
down and runs out of the bathroom

virgil collapses on the floor of the living room then he sees the sawedoff
laying on the ground he crawls toward it

alabama in the bathroom sees where hes heading she picks up the 45
automatic and fires at him its empty shes on her feet and into the room

he reaches the shotgun his hands grasp it

alabama spots and picks up the bloody swiss army knife she takes a knifefirst
runningdive at virgils back she hits him

he arches up firing the sawedoff into the ceiling dropping the gun and
sending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room

alabama snatches the shotgun

arched over on his back virgil and alabama make eye contact

the first blast hits him in the shoulder almost tearing his arm off the second
hits him in the knee the third plays hell with his chest

alabama then runs at him hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun

ever since hes been firing its as if some other part of her brain has been
functioning independently shes been absentmindedly saying the prayer of
saint francis of assisi

alabama
lord make me an instrument of thy peace
where there is hatred let me sow love
where there is injury pardon
where there is doubt faith
where there is despair hope
where there is darkness light
and where there is sadness joy
o divine master grant that i may not
so much seek to be consoled as to console
to be understood as to understand
to be loved as to love
for it is in giving that we receive
it is pardoning that we are pardoned
and it is in dying that we are born
to eternal life

clarence whos been hearing gunshots bursts through the door gun drawn
only to see alabama hitting a dead guy on the head with a shotgun

clarence
honey

she continues he puts his gun away

clarence
sweetheart cops are gonna be here any minute

she continues he takes the gun away from her and she falls to the ground she
lies on the floor trembling continuing with the downward swings of her arms

clarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine and tosses alabama over his
shoulder

it youre so cool
