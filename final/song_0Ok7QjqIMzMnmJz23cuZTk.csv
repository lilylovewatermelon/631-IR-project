she had a bright future ahead of her she couldve go on to to enormous possibilities
 the sky

verse 1 violent j
i climbed up the tree in the back and got on my roof top
with my 22 its hot with little pops
started bustin off shots aimin all at the sky
i emptied out the gun bustin all at the sky
then i went and stole the bow and arrow from my dad
to the arrow tips i tied gasoline soaked rags
climbed up with the zippo lit em off in the sky
a trail of black smoke leading off in the sky
i bought some chinese stars from the kungfu surplus
they had em under the glass i made the purchase
climbed up and i whizzed em off in the sky
even stood up on the chimney whizzed em off in the sky
then i found a double barrel with shells at walmart
i threw it in next to the faygo in my shopping cart
i got home climbed up and blew it off in the sky
320 in the morning bustin off at the sky
i got a blow gun too a real one at that
i dip the tips in poison lay up on my back
and now theyre piercing through the air straight up into the sky
its like the only thing you hear is phew into the sky
i bought a harpoon off the internet and went up
and tried to shoot it but the fuckin rip off it got stuck
i said fuck it and i threw the spear up into the sky
as fuckin hard as i could i threw it into the sky
im sprayin mace up there i throw m80s up there
im shootin everything i got i sit and wait in my chair
because i hate the sky above whether moon or sun
whether rain or snow since the pain begun
im tryin to aim for the heavens up into the sky
tell me why the love of my life had to die
hows she gonna leave me and not even say bye
i know that shes an angel and theyre lettin her fly
every plan i thought we made together was a lie
she could of hung on i bet she didnt even try
she left me dry and that no one can deny
and when she fall from the sky im askin her why
