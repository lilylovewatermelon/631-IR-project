and there made just like anything else through hard work
thats the price we gotta pay to achieve our goal
lets get it
last of a dying breed heart of a lion
all of my soldiers with me we all right
aint no stopping once the red light turn green
i will not lose i know they heard me
i go hard still fly were the birds be
if he tryna stop me then he gon need surgery
they cant serve me waiter or hater
on my way to glory baby i see you later
aint nobody promise this
please check my accomplishments
better find your niche cause you ridin in the wrong lane
call me anything besides a king you callin me by the wrong name
im like lebron james here and it wont change
see this is my life this is not a game
i jam the court if they let me
ask me if we ready for war ima tell you
we ready fresh off the block
we ready coming for the top spot
we ready thats right we came to win
im going in im going in
we ready fresh off the block
we ready coming for the top spot
we ready thats right we came to win
im going in im going in
i got it done when they said i couldnt do it
i never stopped for bullshit i kept it moving
this is why i grind like ali in his prime
i put in the work so this is why i shine
dont tell me im great i hear that all the time
you just tell a friend and spread the word while i climb
and if i dont get the crown for some reason
i be back to put it down for next season
its on my soul i put my heart in it
you say you want it real when im so authentic
yall wont finish cause yall so timid
every pass every play every yard i been in
we ready fresh off the block
we ready coming for the top spot
we ready thats right we came to win
im going in im going in
we ready fresh off the block
we ready coming for the top spot
we ready thats right we came to win
im going in im going in
everybodys got a dream repeat after me
not right now but on three
one two three say we ready
one two three say we ready
go for the crown dont never back down
every city you hit make it jump down
we run that city run that city
say i run this city i run this city
follow the leader i show you how its done
i never let us down we remain number one
all the greats before me gave me the stamp
remember that name ya boy your true champ
we ready fresh off the block
we ready coming for the top spot
we ready thats right we came to win
im going in im going in
we ready fresh off the block
we ready coming for the top spot
we ready thats right we came to win
im going in im going in
yb im goin in its the lack of fate
that makes people afraid of taking chances
i believe in myself how bout you
its not a game its more than a game we readyyou might also likeembed"
