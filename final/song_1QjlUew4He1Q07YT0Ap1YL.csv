when you have certain experiences
we respond with various emotions
stimulus responses
just as this is stimulus
produces this sort of involuntary muscle response
well thatâ€™s a rather simplified suggestion
of a complex mental process
but you get the idea
cause effect
nature endows us at birth with three general patterns of emotional response
rageis the response to the primary stimulus of thwarting
something interfering with our behavior our action
fearis the response to loud noises or loss of support
and the emotional response to love
is usually the result of a show of affection or favors
