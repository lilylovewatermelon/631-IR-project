when your legs dont work like they used to before
and i cant sweep you off of your feet
will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
and darlin i will be lovin you till were seventy
and baby my heart could still fall as hard at twentythree

prechorus
and im thinkin bout how
people fall in love in mysterious ways
maybe just the touch of a hand
well me i fall in love with you every single day
and i just wanna tell you i am

chorus
so honey now take me into your lovin arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
and place your head on my beatin heart im thinkin out loud
maybe we found love right where we are

verse 2
when my hairs all but gone and my memory fades
and the crowds dont remember my name
when my hands dont play the strings the same way mmm
i know you will still love me the same
cause honey your soul who could never grow old its evergreen
and baby your smiles forever in my mind and memory
