for a chemical imbalance you sure know how to ride a train
your revolution is a deathbed and the music is your maid
when someone comes aknockin with a needle on a tray
only your lonesome lies beside you for you told me not to stay
you are somebodys baby some mother held you near
no its not important theyre just pretty words my dear
there is no distraction that can make me disappear
no theres nothin that wont remind you i will always be right here

chorus
and you spit the blood back spit the blood back baby
im amazed that youre alright
oh so long prison boy
i wont be home with you tonight

verse 2
were both very sick our muscles all worn down
its as if we are one hundred know i wont still be around
because ive fallen yes ive fallen right into the love ive found
long before i reach one hundred ill have fallen to the ground
and for generations theyll romance us make us more
or much less than ever was before the chelsea and the floor
make us stand before the masses like two speakers for the poor
when there was no revolution nothin we were fighting for
you might also likechorus
and you spit the blood back spit the blood back baby
im amazed that youre alright
oh so long prison boy
i wont be home i wont be home
i wont be home with you tonight

bridge
and you can call the service bell
when we stay at the chelsea hotel
and ill stay out of my own hell

outro
oh so long prison boy
i wont be home i wont be home
i wont be home with you tonight
