i was pulling out my hair the day i got the deal
chemically calm
was i meant to feel happy that my life
was just about to change
one life pretending to be
the cat who got the cream
oh everybody said marina is a dreamer
people like to tell you

prechorus
what youre gonna be
its not my problem if you dont see what i see
and i do not give a damn if you dont believe
my problem its my problem that i never am happy
its my problem its my problem on how fast i will succeed

chorus
are you satisfied with an average life
do i need to lie to make my way in life

verse 2
high achiever dont you see
baby nothing comes for free
they say im a control freak
driven by a greed to succeed
nobody can stop me

cause its my problem if i wanna pack up and run away
its my business if i feel the need to smoke and drink and sway
its my problem its my problem if i feel the need to hide
and its my problem if i have no friends and feel i want to die

chorus
are you satisfied with an average life
do i need to lie to make my way in life
are you satisfied with an easy ride
once you cross the line will you be satisfied

bridge
sad inside in this life
unsatisfied praying
sad inside in this life
unsatisfied waiting

chorus
are you satisfied with an average life
do i need to lie to make my way in life
are you satisfied with an easy ride
once you cross the line will you be satisfied

outro

are you satisfied are you satisfied
black white
are you satisfied are you satisfied
black white
are you satisfied are you satisfied
black white
are you satisfied are you satisfied45embed"
