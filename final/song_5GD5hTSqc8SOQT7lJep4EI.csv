got four bitches on my digits aks in my kitchen
cocaine on my dishes from my older uncles business
a minute turns to minutes
a vision turns to visits from a witness on a mission from the feds that got him snitchin
religion of the sixes turnin bitches into witches
got a hit list with a few i wan lay down up in some ditches
fuck em all burn them bridges
sus motherfuckers with a sickness
45 tucked in my britches
uicide be the voice of the misfits hoe

verse 2 yung now
now leopard creeping the icicle demon
im breathin this weed in
my gaudy pack freezin my shawty keep sneezin
i told her yung now keep it cold like im changin the seasons
that codeine im bleedin
all of these hoes see me gleamin im leaking gold
we can go see the globe but need to keep it slow
that was a week ago she aint know now leopard had at least three or so alteregos that the reaper know
oh no i keep her so closeâ€”now she reach for rope
tie me up now she hope that yung plague wont be shown
my skull started tweaking my skin started bleeding
my heart stopped its beating
my eyes disappear now the devil is near
oh yeah she feels the fearsee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like16embed"
