what if i squeeze myself into any shape
and i still dont fit
what if i bend myself so much that i break
and i cant mend it
what if i burn so bright that the fire goes out
and i cant stay lit
whats the point in it
i could get good at crying crocodile tears
just to get along
i could carry on telling you what you wanna hear
til my voice is gone
but if i finally get to the place that i think is home
and i dont belong
whats the point in it wheres the benefit
when im gaining all but im losin it

chorus
its not worth having
if its too much to hold
you can dig so deep
that youre left with a hole
thirsty in a desert with a bag full of gold
dont wanna end up like pirate bones
what i thought was precious just a pile o stones
i might have the treasure but id be lying alone
just a pile of pirate bones

uh yeah oh oh
if i forfeit my soul it aint worth having
uh yeah oh oh
if its something i stole it aint worth having

verse 2
what if i stake everything i am on a dream
and its counterfeit
if i reach the end that justifies the means
could i live with it
and if its true that havin too much of any good thing
can only make me sick
whats the point in it wheres the benefit
when im gaining all but im losing it oh

chorus
its not worth having its not
if its too much to hold
you can dig so deep
that youre left with a hole
thirsty in a desert with a bag full of gold
dont wanna end up like pirate bones
what i thought was precious just a pile o stones
i might have the treasure but id be lyin alone
pirate bones

uh yeah oh oh
if i forfeit my soul it aint worth having

if its something i stole it aint worth having

bridge
its not worth that much to me
if losin out is what it means
to swim in shallow victory is empty empty
its just not worth the price
its only a fools paradise
if its draining every drop of life
til im dry like pirate bones

chorus
its not worth having its not worth having
if its too much to hold too much to hold
you can dig so deep
that youre left with a hole
thirsty in a desert with a bag full of gold oh yeah
dont wanna end up like pirate bones
what i thought was precious just a pile o stones just a pile o stones
i might have the treasure but id be lying alone
just a pile of pirate bones
if i forfeit my soul if i forfeit my soul it aint worth having whoa oh oh
if its something i stole it aint worth having pirate bones

if i forfeit my soul it aint worth having
