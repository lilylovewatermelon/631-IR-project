verse 1
and i thought about you today
and i thought about the things you used to say
and i thought about the things we did
and i thought about your newest kid
and damn that makes two now
oh what do i do now
cause if we ever got together
id have to be them niggas steppops forever
and well that aint my thing cause i
i aint even got my own
and i aint really got no home
no place to put these things i own
and i thought about the things you used to say
and i thought about the games you used to play
and i thought about that little kid
and i thought about the things we did
i always thought that we would be together
i always knew that we would be together
but i dont wanna wait forever
i dont wanna wait forever

verse 2
on the rebound like a book back
on the rebound like a put back
dont just sit back bitch get on it
time fly by way too quick dont it
reflection bring regrets dont it
rejection makes you defensive
so you protect your pride with your reflexes
but life is a game with no reset on the end
