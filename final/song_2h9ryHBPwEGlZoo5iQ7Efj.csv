well how many times must we go through this
you always been mine woman i thought you knew this
how many times must we go through this
youll always be mine cupid only misses sometimes
mmhmm mmhmm

outro
but we could end up brokenhearted
if we dont remember why this all started
and if they try to tell you love fades with time
tell them theres no such thing as time
its our time its our time
its our time its our timesee jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also like1embed"
