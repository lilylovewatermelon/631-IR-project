just do it every way
love just love away
just do it every day

verse 1
all my friends they pretend
the end is just around the bend
but since you came along
im not believing it
sunshine destiny
the birds and bees and centipedes
until you came along
i never needed it

chorus
love just love away
just do it every day
just do it every way
love just love away
just do it every day
just do it every way

money power a man of means
chasing down irrational dreams
but when you came along
i was freed of it
throw your tv out the door
one two three four on the floor
and if you sing a song
youll believe in it

chorus
love just love away
just do it every day
just do it every way
love just love away
just do it every day
just do it every way
