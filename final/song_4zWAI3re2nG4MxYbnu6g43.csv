uh let me get a turkey sandwich uh woo lettuce tomato bitch

verse 1
my name mac miller who the fuck are you
well my crew too live but i aint uncle luke
and i aint no hipster but girl i can make your hips stir
from pittsburgh smoke papers or a swisher
welcome woo to the cam rellim chronicles
lookin out my monocle
im dodgin obstacles i gamble like the bellagio
you cockaroach im heroin cause everything i talk is dope
type to leave it clean and fuckin shiny word to mop  glo
tryin to get a mansion ain’t nobody here gon find my room
money gon be green i guarantee you that my slide stay blue
so press play i start from scratch and never use no template
the next day these losers always goin with whats trendy
my pen game is somethin these motherfuckers have never seen
all city champion everybody is secondstring
no need to testify testify for the best is i best is i
and anybody in my way gon be left to die

chorus
ima feed the world you can put it on my tab
run until my legs go numb i dont plan on lookin back back
anything you need you can find it at the market
if you don’t hold me down for all i care you can starve bitch
ima feed the world you can put it on my tab
run until my legs go numb i dont plan on lookin back back
anything you need you can find it at the market
anything you need you can find it at the market

i got my own stickers now so literally i’m everywhere
hundred different shoes still feel the need to cop a fresher pair
these motherfuckers treat me like it’s just my second year
fool you better get prepared
dont know bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
frick park market where we kickin out the garbage
sick bars i’ve been a boss so stick around and watch it
didnt fit around no college campus chillin writin on top of planet earth
fuck whos first it’s just bout who the hardest
on my own too fuck whos sayin different
every time i rhyme i get that punxsutawney feelin
i’m the starter you a fillin
you a martyr i’m just killin
gettin harder with each time i write
wish i could rewind last night
i had so much fun just kickin it and goin in
don’t call me malcolm if you didnt fuckin know me then
and if you lonely girl i could be your only friend
you got some shit to say i suggest you hold it in bitch

chorus
ima feed the world you can put it on my tab
run until my legs go numb i dont plan on lookin back back
anything you need you can find it at the market
if you dont hold me down for all i care you can starve bitch
ima feed the world you can put it on my tab
run until my legs go numb i dont plan on lookin back back
anything you need you can find it at the market
anything you need you can find it at the market
