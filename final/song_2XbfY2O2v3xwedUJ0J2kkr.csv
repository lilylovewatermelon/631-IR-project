closer closer
closer closer woo

verse 1
turn the lights off in this place
and she shines just like a star
and i swear i know her face
i just dont know who you are
turn the music up in here
i still hear her loud and clear
like shes right there in my ear
tellin me that she wants to own me
to control me

prechorus
come closer come closer
come closer

chorus
and i just cant pull myself away
under a spell i cant break
i just cant stop i just cant stop
i just cant stop i just cant stop
and i just cant bring myself no way
but i dont want to escape
i just cant stop i just cant stop
i just cant stop i just cant stop
i just cant stop

i can feel her on my skin
i can taste her on my tongue
shes the sweetest taste of sin
the more i get the more i want
she wants to own me

prechorus
come closer come closer
she says come closer

and i just cant pull myself away

i just cant stop i just cant stop
