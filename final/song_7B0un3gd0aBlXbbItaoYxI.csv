verse 1
hey you dont wanna love you on the telephone
youre hanging up and i am all alone
baby you got me doin dirt doin dirt doin dirt
and now i wanna find you but youre on the run
my hearts exploding like a burning sun
i know you like it when it hurts when it hurts when it hurts

chorus

youre shining like a neon light
i light you up when i get inside
so wont you touch me
cause everybodys watching us now
were putting on a show for the crowd
so turn it up baby make it loud

verse 2
hey you say that youre only havin fun and then
you call me up at 3 am again
baby you got me doin dirt doin dirt doin dirt
and now now all that i got is just a microphone
to let you know that i am all alone
i know you like it when it hurts when it hurts when it hurts oh
