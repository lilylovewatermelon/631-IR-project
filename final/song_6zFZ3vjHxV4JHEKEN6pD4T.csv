holy man tiptoes his way across the ganges
the sound of magic music in his ears
videoed by a busload of tourists
shiny shell suits on and drinking lemonade
now i got a funny feeling which i bought mail order
from a man in a teepee in california
said he once was that great game show performer
then he blew all his money away blew it all away

chorus
so take me home dont leave me alone
im not that good but im not that bad
no psycho killer hooligan guerilla
i dream to riot oh you should try it
ill eat parole get gold card soul
my joy of life is on a roll
and well all be the same in the end
cause then youre on your own
then youre on your own

verse 2
well we all go happy dayglow in the discos
the sound of magic music in our brains
someone stumbles to the bathroom with the horrors
says lord give me time for ive jumped into space im in outer space

my joy of life is on a roll
and well all be the same in the end
cause then youre on your own
