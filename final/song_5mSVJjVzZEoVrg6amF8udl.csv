please just dont play with me
my paper heart will bleed
this wait for destiny wont do
be with me please i beseech you
simple things that make you run away
catch you if i can

verse 1
tears fall down your face
the taste is something new
something that
i know moving on is
easiest when i am around you

prechorus
so bottle up old love
and throw it out to sea
watch it away as you cry
a year has passed
the seasons go

chorus 1
please just dont play with me
my paper heart will bleed
this wait for destiny wont do
be with me please i beseech you
simple things that make you run away
catch you if i can

waiting day to day it goes through
my lips are sealed for her
my tongue is
tied to a dream of being with you
to settle for less is not what i prefer

prechorus
so bottle up old love
and throw it out to sea
watch it away as you cry
a year has passed
the seasons go

chorus 1
please just dont play with me
my paper heart will bleed
this wait for destiny wont do
be with me please i beseech you
simple things that make you run away
catch you if i can

chorus 2
summer time the nights are so long
the leaves fall down and so do i into the arms of a friend
winter nights
my bedside is cold for i am gone
and spring blossoms you to me
summer time the nights are so long
the leaves fall down and so do i into the arms of a friend
winter nights
my bedside is cold for i am gone
and spring blossoms you to me3embed"
