just a stiff one and waylon are the only two things i desire
its been a damn long year and it really dont help
that i really aint been to good to myself
cause i cant get past all this pain and depression im in

so sing me sing me to sleep
and pour me another drink
well i dont know what happened between bourbon and man
but ill be at the gates with a glass in my hand
and tell old saint peter quite frankly i dont give a damn
im sure one day ill pay for my sins

ive been angry and loathsomе but that really aint no excuse
to bе putting myself through all of this substance abuse
but ill still take a trip to that old liquor store
buy a bottle of rye and end up on the floor
they call it addiction but i see it as an old friend

so sing me sing me to sleep
and pour me another drink
well i dont know what happened between bourbon and man
but ill be at the gates with a glass in my hand
and tell old saint peter quite frankly i dont give a damn
im sure one day ill pay for my sins
you might also likeso sing me sing me to sleep
and pour me another drink
well i dont know what happened between bourbon and man
but ill be at the gates with a glass in my hand
and tell old saint peter quite frankly i dont give a damn
im sure one day ill pay for my sins
im sure one day ill pay for my sins
im sure one day ill pay for my sinsembed"
