city lights its on tonight

verse 1
out on the street
im looking for the celebration
come roll with me
together we can crash the party and
get on the floor
dj please play my song
and we can do this all night long
once again it is on
im on a high
i feel like im on medications
im open wide
and we dont need no complications cause
i feel alright
and all i see is red lights
and blue lights it feel like
and its real like its out of sight

chorus
im under the city lights
its on its on tonight
my mood is right

its after dark
another storys in the morning
i can see the stars
crimson cars in the boulevard and now
im so inspired
cause i wanna buy me a lexus
or maybe ill get me a beamer
or a hummer for summer
its never too late
theres always more fascination
just turn the page
and i wont be hesitating cause
i can hardly wait
to do my dance to wave my hands
hear my jam you can count me in
i wish tonight would never end
