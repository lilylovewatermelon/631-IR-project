verse 1 childish gambino  kari faux
all i see is zombies
walking all around us
you can hear them coming
they come to take your life
you can hear them breathing
breathing down your spine oh

hear them screaming louder
they can smell your money
and they want your soul
here they come behind you
try to stay alive
