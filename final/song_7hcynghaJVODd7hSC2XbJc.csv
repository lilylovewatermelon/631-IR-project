to get there you follow highway 58 going northeast of the city and it is a good highway and new or was new that day we went up it you look up the highway and it is straight for miles coming at you with the black line down the center coming at and at you black and slick and tarry shining against the white of the slab and the heat dazzles up from the white slab so that only the black line is clear coming at you with the whine of the tires and if you dont quit staring at that line and dont take a few deep breaths and slap yourself hard on the back of the neck youll hypnotize yourself and youll come to just at the moment when the right font wheel hookers over into the black dirt shoulder off the slab and youll try to jerk her back on but you cant because the slab is high like a curb and maybe youll try to reach to turn off course then a nigger chopping cotton a mile away hell look up and see the little column of black smoke standing up above the vitriolic arsenical green of the cotton rows and up against the violent metallic throbbing blue of the sky and hell say lawd god hits anudder one done done hit and the next nigger down the next row hell say lawd god and the first nigger will giggle and the hoe will lift again and the blade will flash in the sun like a heliograph then a few days later the boys from the highway department will mark the spot with a little metal square on a metal rod stuck in the black dirt off the shoulder the metal square painted white and on it in black a skull and crossbones later on love vine will climb up it out of the weeds
but if you wake up in time and dont hook your wheel off the slab youll go whipping on into the dazzle and will pass you with a snatching sound as though godalmighty had ripped a tin roof loose with his bare hands way off ahead you at the horizon where the cotton fields are blurred into the light the slab will glitter and gleam like water as though the road were flooded youll go whipping toward it but it will always be ahead of you that bright flooded place like a mirage youll go past the little white metal squares set on metal rods with the skull and crossbones on them to mark the spot for this is the country where the age of internal combustion engine has come into its own where every boy is barney oldfield and the girls wear organdy and batiste and eyelet embroidery and no panties on account of the climate and have smooth little faces to break your heart and when the wind of the cars speed lifts up their hair at the temples you see the sweet little beads of perspiration nestling there and they sit low in the seat with their little spines crooked and their bent knees high toward the dashboard and not too close together for the cool if you could call it that from the hood ventilator where the smell of gasoline and the burning brake bands and redeye is sweeter than myrrh where the eightcylinder jobs come roaring round the curves in the
￼red hills and scatter the gravel like spray and when they ever get down in the flat country and hit the new slab god have mercy on the mariner
on up number 58 and the country breaks the flat country and the big cotton fields are gone now and the grove of live oats way off yonder where the big house is and the whitewashed shacks all just alike set in a row by the cotton fields with the cotton growing up to the doorstep where the pickaninny sits like a black billiken and sucks its thumb and watches you go by thats all left behind now it is red hill now not high with blackberry bushes along the fence rows and blackjack clumps in the bottoms and now and then a place where the secondgrowth pines stand close together if they havent burned over for sheep grass and if they have burned over there are black stubs the cotton patches cling to the hillsides and the gullies cut across the cotton patches the corn blades hang stiff and are streaked with yellow
there were pine forests here a long time ago but they are gone the bastards got in here and set up the mills and laid the narrowgauge tracks and knocked together the company commissaries and paid a dollar a day and folks swarmed out of the bush for the dollar and folks came from god knows where riding in wagons with a chest of drawers and a bedstead canted together and the old woman hunched on the wagon seat with a poke bonnet on her head and snuff on her gums and a young one hanging on her tit the saws sang soprano and the clerk in the commissary passed out the blackstrap molasses and the sowbelly and wrote in his big book and the yankee dollar and the confederate dumbness collaborated to heal the wounds of four years of fratricidal strife and all was merry as a marriage bell till all of a sudden there werent any more pine trees they stripped the mills the narrowgauge tracks got covered with grass folks tore down the commissaries for kindling wood there wasnt any more dollar a day the big boys were gone with diamond rings on their fingers and broadcloth on their backs but a good many of the folks stayed right on and watched the gullies eat deeper into the red clay and a handful of these folks and their heirs and assigns stayed in mason city four thousand of them more or less
you come in on number 58 and pass the cotton gin and the power station and the fringe of nigger shacks and bump across the railroad track and down a street where there are a lot of little houses painted white one time with the sad valentine lace of gingerbread work around the eaves of the veranda and tin roofs and where the leaves on the trees in the yards hand straight down in the heat and above the mannerly whisper of your eightyhorsepower valveinhead or whatever it is drifting at forty you hear the july flies grinding away in the verdure
that was the way it was last time i saw mason city nearly three years ago back in the summer of 1936 i was in the first car the cadillac with the boss and mr duffy and the bosss wife and son and sugarboy in the second car which lacked our quiet elegance reminiscent of a cross between a hearse and an ocean liner but which still wouldnt make your cheeks burn with shame in the countryclub parking lot there were some reporters and a photograph and sadie burke the bosss secretary to see they got there sober enough to do what they were supposed to do
sugarboy was driving the cadillac and it was a pleasure to watch him or it would have been if you could detach your imagination from the picture of what near a couple of tons of expensive mechanism looks like after its turned turtle three times at eighty and could give you undivided attention to the exhibition of muscular coordination satanic humor and splitsecond timing which was sugarboys when he whipped around a hat wagon in the face of an oncoming gasoline truck and went through the rapidly diminishing aperture close enough to give the truck driver heart failure with one rear fender and wipe the snot off a mules nose with the other but the boss loved
￼it he always sat up front with sugarboy and looked at the speedometer and down the road and grinned to sugarboy after they got through between the mules nose and the gasoline truck and sugarboys head would twitch the way it always did when the words were piling up inside of him and couldnt get out and then he start the bbbbb– he would manage to get out and the saliva would spray from his lips like flit from a flit gun the bbbbbastud–he seen me ccc– and here hed spray the inside of the windshield–cccoming sugarboy couldnt talk but he could express himself when he got his foot on the accelerator he wouldnt win any debating contests in high school but then would ever want to debate with sugarboy not anybody who knew him and had seen him do tricks with the38 special which rode under his left armpit like a tumor
no doubt you thought sugarboy was a negro from his name but he wasnt he was irish from the wrong side of the tracks he was about fivefeettwo and he was getting bald though he wasnt more than twentyseven or eight years old and he wore red ties and under the red tie and his shirt he wore a little papist medal on a chain and i always hoped to god it was st christopher and that st christopher was on the job his name was osheean but they called him sugarboy because he ate sugar every time he went to a restaurant he took all the cube sugar there was in the bowl he went around with his pockets stuffed with sugar cubes and when he took one out to pop into his mouth you saw little pieces of gray lint sticking to it the kind of lint there always is loose in your pocket and shreds of tobacco from cigarettes hes pop the cube in over the barricade of his twisted black little teeth and then youd see the thin little mystic irish cheeks cave in as he sucked the sugar so that he looked like an undernourished leprechaun
the boss was sitting in the front seat with sugarboy and watching the speedometer with his kid tom up there with him tom was then about eighteen or nineteen–i forgot which–but you would have thought he was older he wasnt so big but he was built like a man and his head sat on his shoulders like a mans head without the gangly craning look a kids head has he had been a highschool football and the fall before he had been the flashiest thing on the freshman team at state he got his name in the papers because he was really good he knew he was good he knew he was the nuts as you could tell from one look at his slickskinned handsome brown face with the jawbone working insolently and slow over a little piece of chewing gum and his blue eyes under halflowered lids working insolently and slow over you or the whole damned world but that day when he was up in the front seat with willie stark who was the boss i couldnt see his face i remembered thinking his head the shape and the way it was set on his shoulders was just like his old mans head
mrs stark–lucy stark the wife of the boss–tiny duffy and i were in the back seat–lucy stark between tiny and me it wasnt exactly a gay little gathering the temperature didnt make for chit chat in the first place in the second place i was watching out for the hay wagons and gasoline trucks in the third place duffy and lucy stark never were exactly chummy so she sat between duffy and me and gave herself to her thoughts i reckon she had plenty to think about for one thing she could think about all that had happened since she was a girl teaching her first year in the school at manson city and had married a redfaced and rednecked farm boy with big slow hands and a shock of dark brown hair coming down over his brow you can look at the wedding picture which has been in the papers along with a thousand other pictures of willie and a look of doglike devotion and wonder in his eyes when they fixed on her she would have had a lot to think about as she sat in the hurtling cadillac for there had been a lot of changes
we tooled down the street where the little onetimewhite houses were and hit the square it
￼￼was saturday afternoon and the square was full of folks the wagons and the crates were parked solid around the patch of grass roots in the middle of which stood the courthouse a redbrick box well weathered and needing paint for it had been there since before the civil war with a little tower with a clock face on each side on the second look you discovered that the clock faces werent real they were just painted on and they all said five oclock and not eightseventeen the way those big painted watches in front of thirdstring jewelry stores used to we eased into the ruck of folks come in to do their trading and sugarboy leaned on his horn and his head twitched and he said bbbbbastuds and the spit flew
we pulled up in front of the drugstore and the kid tom got out and the boss before sugarboy could get around to the door i got out and helped out lucy stark who came up from the depths of heat and meditation long enough to say tank you she stood there on the pavement a second touching her skirt into place around her hips which had a little more beam on them than no doubt had been the case when she won the heart of willie stark the farm boy
mr duffy debouched massively from the cadillac and we all entered the drugstore the boss holding the door open so lucy stark could go in and then following her and the rest of us trailing in there were a good many folks in the store men in overalls lined up along the soda fountain and women hanging around the counters where the junk and glory was and kids hanging on skirts with one hand and clutching icecream cones with the other and staring out over their own wet noses at the world of men from eyes which resembled painted china marbles the boss just stood modestly back of the gang of customers at the soda fountain with his hat in his hand and the damp hair hanging down over his forehead he stood that way a minute maybe and then one of the girls ladling up ice cream happened to see him and got a look on her face as though her garter belt had busted in church and dropped her ice cream scoop and headed for the back of the store with her hips pumping hellforleather under the lettucegreen smock
then a second later a little baldheaded fellow wearing a white coat which ought to have been in the weeks wash came plunging through the crowd from the back of the store waving his hand and bumping the customers and yelling its willie the fellow ran up to the boss and the boss took a couple of steps to meet him and the fellow with the white coat grabbed willies hand as though he were drowning he didnt shake willies hand not by ordinary standards he just hung into it and twitched all over and gargled the sacred syllables of willie then when the attack had passed he turned to the crowd which was ringing around at a polite distance and staring and announced my god folks its willie
the remark was superfluous one look at the faces rallied around and you knew that if any citizen over the age of three didnt know that the strongset man standing there in the palm beach suit was willie stark that citizen was a halfwit in the first place all he would have to do would be to lift his eyes to the big picture high up there above the soda fountain a picture about six times life size which showed the same face the big eyes which in the picture had the suggestion of a sleepy and inward look the eyes of the man in the palm beach suit didnt have that look now but ive seen it the pouches under the eyes and the jowls beginning to sag off and the meaty lips which didnt sag but if you looked very close were laid one on top of the other like a couple of bricks and the tousle of hair hanging down on the not very high squarish forehead under the picture was the legend mt study is the heart of the people in quotation marks and signed willie stark i had seen that picture in a thousand places pool halls to palaces
somebody back in the crowd yelled hi willie the boss lifted his right hand and waved in
￼
￼acknowledgment to the unknown admirer then the boss spied a fellow at the far end of the soda fountain a tall gauntshanked malarial leatherfaced side of jerked venison wearing jean pants and a brace of mustaches hanging off the kind of face see in photographs of general forrests cavalrymen and the boss started toward him and put out his hand old leatherface didnt show maybe he shuffled one of his broken brogans on the tiles and his adams apple jerked one or twice and the eyes were watchful out of that face which resembled the seat of an old saddle left out in the weather but when the boss got close his hand came up from the elbow as though it didnt belong to old leatherface but was operating on its own and the boss took it
how you making it malaciah the boss asked
the adams apple worked a couple of times and the boss shook the hand which was hanging
out there in the air as if it didnt belong to anybody and old leatherface said wes grabblen hows your boy the boss asked

naw old leatherface allowed jail
my god the boss said what they doing round here putting good boys in jail

tough tiddy the boss said

glad to seen you the boss said tell your boy to keep his tail over the dashboard he aint complainen old leatherface said
the boss started to turn away to the rest of us who after a hundred miles in the dazzle were looking at that soda fountain as though it were a mirage but old leatherface said willie
huh the boss answered
yore pitcher old leatherface allowed and jerked his head creakily toward the sixtimes
lifesize photograph over the soda fountain yore pitcher he said hit dont do you no credit willie
hell no the boss said studying the picture cocking his head to one side and squinting at it but i was porely when they took it it was like id had the cholera morbus get in there busting some sense into that legislature and it leaves a man worsen the summer complaint
git in thar and bust em willie somebody yelled from back in the crowd which was thickening out now for folks were trying to get in from the street ill bust em willie said and turned around to the little man with the white coat give us some cokes doc he said for gods sake
it looked as if doc would have heart failure getting around to the other side of the sofa fountain the tail of that white coat was flat on the air behind him when he switched the corner and started clawing past the couple of girls in the lettucegreen smocks so he could do the drawing he got the first one set up and passed it to the boss who handed it to his wife the he started drawing the next one and kept on saying its on the house willie its on the house the boss took that one
￼himself and doc kept on drawing them and saying its on the house willie its on the house he kept on drawing them till he got about five too many
by that time folks were packed outside the door solid to the middle of the street faces were pressed up against the screen door the way you do when you try to see through a screen into a dim room outside they kept yelling speech willie speech
my god the boss said in the direction of doc who was hanging on to one of the nickel plated spouts of the fountain and watching every drop of the coke go down the bosss gullet my god the boss said i didnt come here to make a speech i came here to go out and see my pappy
speech willie speech they were yelling out there
the boss set his little glass on the marble
its on the house doc uttered croakingly with what strength was left in him after the rapture
thanks doc the boss said he turned away to head toward the door then looked back you better get back in here and sell a lot of aspirin doc he said to make up for the charity
then he plowed out the door and the crowd fell back and we tailed after him
mr duffy stepped up beside the boss and asked him was he going to make a speech but the boss didnt even look at him he kept walking slow and steady right on across the street into the crowd as though the crowd hadnt been there the red long faces with the eyes in them watching like something wary and wild and watchful in a thicket fell back and there wasnt a sound the crowd creamed back from his passage and we followed in his wake all of us who had been in the
cadillac and the others who had been in the second car the crowd closed behind
the boss kept walking straight ahead his head bowed a little the way a man bows his head when he is out walking by himself and has something on his mind his hair fell down over his forehead for he was carrying his hat in his hand i knew his hair was down over his forehead for i saw him give his head a quick jerk once or twice the way he always did when he was walking alone and it fell down toward his eyes the kind of motion a horse gives just after the bit is in and
hes full of beans
he walked straight across the street and across the patch of grass roots and up the steps of the
courthouse nobody else followed him up the steps at the top he turned around slow to face the crowd he simply looked at them blinking his big eyes a little jus as though he had just stepped out of the open doors and the dark hall of the courthouse behind him and was blinking to get his eyes adjusted to the light he stood up there blinking the hair down on his forehead and the dark sweat patch showing under each arm of his palm beach coat the he gave his head a twitch and his eyes bulged wide suddenly even if the light was hitting him full in the face and you could see the glitter in them
its coming i thought
you saw the eyes bulge suddenly like that as tough something had happened inside him and
there was the glitter you knew something had happened inside him and thought its coming it was always that way there was the bulge and the glitter and there was the cold grip way down in the stomach as though somebody had laid hold of something in there in the dark which is you with a cold hand in a cold rubber glove it was like the second when you come home late at night and see the yellow envelope of the telegram sticking out from under your door and you lean and pick it up but dont open it yet not for a second while you stand there in the hall with the envelope in your hand you feel theres an eye on you a great big eye looking straight at you from
￼￼￼miles and dark and through walls and houses and through your coat and vest and hide and sees you huddled up way inside in the dark which is you inside yourself like a clammy sad little fetus you carry around inside yourself the eye knows whats in the envelope and it is watching you to see you when you open it and know too but the clammy sad little fetus which is you way down in the dark which is you too lifts up its sad little face and its eyes are blind and it shivers cold inside you for it doesnt want to know what is in that envelope it wants to lie in the dark and not know and be warm in its notknowing the end of man is knowledge but there is one thing he cant know he cant know whether knowledge will save him or kill him he will be killed all right but he cant know whether he is killed because of the knowledge which he has got or because the knowledge which he hasnt got and which if he had it would save him theres the cold in your stomach but you open the envelope for the end of man is to know
the boss stood up there quiet with the bulge and glitter in the eyes and there wasnt sound in the crowd you could hear one insane and irrelevant july fly sawing away up in one of the catalpa trees in the square then that sound stopped and there wasnt anything but the waiting then the boss lounged a step forward easy and softfooted
im not going to make any speech the boss said and grinned but the eyes were still big and the glitter was in them i didnt come here to make any speech i came up here to go out and see my pappy and see if hes got anything left in the smokehouse fit to eat im gonna say pappy now what about all that smoked sausage you wuz bragging about what about all that ham you wuz bragging about all last winter what about– thats what he was saying but the voice was different going up in his nose and coming flat with that little break theyve got in the red hills saying pappy now what about–
but the glitter was still there and i thought maybe its coming maybe it was not too late you never could tell suddenly it might be there he might say it
but he was saying –and so i not going to make any speech– in his old voice his own voice or was that his voice which was his true voice which one of all the voices you would wonder
he was saying and i didnt come here to ask you to give me anything not even a vote the good book says there are three things that are never satisfied yea four things say not it is enough–  and the voice was different now–  the grave and the barren womb the earth that is not filled with water and the fire that saith not it is enough but solomon might have added just one little item he might have just made his little list complete and added the politician who never stops saying gimme
he was lounging back on himself now and his head was cocked a little to one side and his eyes blinked the he grinned and said if they had politicians back in those days they said gimme just like all of us politician do gimme gimme my names jimmie but im not a politician today im taking the day off im not even going to ask you to vote for me to tell the gods unvarnished and unbuckled truth i dont have to ask you not today i still got quite a little hitch up there in the big house with the white columns two stories high on the front porch and peach ice cream for breakfast not that a passel of those statesmen wouldnt like to throw me out you know– and he leaned forward a little now as if to tell them a secret–its funny how i just cant make friend with some folks no matter how hard i try i been just as polite i said please but please didnt do any good but it looks like they got to put up with me a spell longer and you have before you get shet of me so you better just grin and bear it its not any worsen boils now is it
he stopped and looked all around right down at them moving his head slow so that he seemed
￼￼to look right in a face here and stop for just a split second and then to move on to another one a little further then he grinned and his eyes blinked and he said huh whats the matter can got yore tongue
boils on the tail somebody yelled back in the crowd
dammit willie yelled back lie on yore stummick and go to sleep somebody laughed
and yelled willie thank the good lord who in his everlasting mercy saw fit to make something with a back side and a front side to it out of the skimpy little piece of material provided in your case
you tell em willie somebody yelled back in the crowd then they started to laugh
the boss lifted up his right hand about as high as his head out in front of him palm down and waited till they stopped laughing and whistling then he said no im not here to ask you for anything a vote or anything else i reckon ill be back later for that if i keep on relishing that peach ice cream for breakfast in the big house but i dont expect all of you to vote for me my god if all of you went and voted for willie what the hell would you find to argue about there
wouldnt be anything left but the weather and you cant vote on that
no he said and it was another voice quiet and easy and coming slow and from a distance
im not here to ask for anything today im taking the day off and ive come home a man goes away from his home and it is in him to do it he lies in strange beds in the dark and the wind is different in the trees he walks in the street and there are the faces in front of his eyes but there are no names for the faces the voices he hears are not the voices he carried away in his ears a long time back when he went away the voices he hears are loud they are so loud he does not hear for a long time at a stretch those voices he carried away in his ears but there comes a minute when it is quiet and he can hear those voices he carried away in his ears a long time back he can make out what they say and they say come back they say come back boy so he comes back
his voice just stopped it didnt trail off like a voice coming to a stop one second it was there going on word by word in the stillness which filled the square and the crowd in front of the courthouse and was stiller for the grinding of the july flies in the two catalpas rising above the heads of the people who had crowded up on the patch of grass roots the voice was going there word by word then suddenly it was not there there was only the sound of the july flies which seems to be inside your head as though it were the grind and whir of the springs and cogs which are you and which will not stop no matter what you say until they are good and ready
he stood there a half minute not saying a word and not moving he didnt even seem to be noticing the crowd down there then he seemed all at once to discover them and grinned so he comes back he said grinning now when he gets half a day off and he says hello folks how you making it and thats what im saying
thats what he said he looked down grinning and his head turned as his eyes went down in the crowd and seemed to stop a face there and then go on to stop on another face
then he started walking down the steps as if he had just come out of that duskydark hallway beyond the big open doors behind him and was walking down the steps by himself with nobody there in front of him and no eyes on him he came straight down the steps toward where his gang was standing lucy stark and the rest of us and nodded at us as though he were simply passing us on the street and didnt know us any too well anyway and kept right on walking straight into the crowd as though the crowd werent there the people fell back a little to make a passage for him
￼￼with their eyes looking right at him and the rest of us in his gang followed behind him and the crowd closed up behind us
people were clapping now and yelling somebody kept yelling hi willie
the boss walked straight across the street through the crowd and got into the cadillac and sat down we got in with him and the photographer and the others went back to their car sugarboy started up and nosed out into the street people didnt get out of the way very fast they couldnt they were so jammed in when we nosed out into the crowd the faces were right there outside the car not more that a foot or so away the faces looked right in at us but they were out there and we were inside now the eyes in the red slickskinned long faces or the brown crinkled faces
looked in at us
sugarboy kept pecking at his horn the words were piling up inside him his lips started to
work i could see his face in the drivers mirror and the lips were working the bbbbastuds he said and the spit flew
the boss had sunk in on himself now
the bbbbastuds sugarboy said and pecked at his horn but we were easing out of the
square now to a side street where there werent any people we were doing forty by the time we passed the brick schoolhouse on the outskirts of town seeing the schoolhouse made me remember how i first met willie about fourteen years before back in 1922 when he wasnt anything but the county treasurer of mason county and had come down to the city to see about the bound issue to build that schoolhouse then i remembered how i had met him in the back room of slades pool hall where slade sold the needle beer and we were sitting at one of those little marbletopped tables with wirework legs the kind they used to have in drugstores when you were a boy and took your highschool sweeties down on saturday night to get that chocolate banana split and rub knees under the table and the wirework would always get in the way
there were four of us there was tiny duffy who was almost as big back then as he was to get to be he didnt need any sign to let you know what he was if the wind was right you knew he was a cityhall slob long before you could see the whites of his eyes he had the belly and he sweated through his shirt just above the belt buckle and he had the face which was creamed and curded like a cow patty in a spring pasture only it was the color of biscuit dough and in the middle was his grin with the gold teeth he was tax assessor and he wore a flat hard straw on the back of his head there was a striped band on the hat
then there was alex michel who was a country boy from up in mason county but who was learning fast he had learned fast enough to get to be a deputy sheriff but he wasnt that long he wasnt anything for he got in the gut by a cokefrisky piano player in a cribhouse where he had gone to take out a little in trade on his protection account alex was as i have said from up in mason county
duffy and i had been in the back room of slades place waiting for alex with whom i had the hope of transacting a little business i was a newspaperman and alex knew something i wanted to know duffy had called him in for duffy was a friend of mine at least he knew that i worked for the chronicle which at that time was supporting the joe harrison outfit joe harrison was governor then and duffy was one of joe harrison boys
so i was sitting in the back room of slades place one hot morning in june or july back in 1922 waiting for alex michel to turn up and listening to the silence in the back room of slades place a funeral parlor at midnight is earsplitting compared to the effect you get in the middle of
￼￼the morning in the back room of a place like slades if you are the first man there you sit there and think how cozy it was last night with the effluvium of brotherly bodies and the hawhaw of camaraderie and you look at the floor where now there are little parallel trails of damp sawdust the old broom left this morning when the unenthusiastic old negro man cleaned up and the general impression is that you are alone with the alone and it is his move so i sat there in silence duffy was never talkative in the morning before he had worried down two or three drinks and listened to my tissues break down and the beads of perspiration explode delicately out of the ducts embedded in the ample flesh of my companion
alex came in with a fellow with him and i knew my little conversation was not promising my mission was of some delicacy not fit for the ear of a stranger i figured that might be the reason alex had his friend in tow maybe it was foe alex was cagey in an amateurish sort of way in any case he had the boss with him
only it was not the boss not to the crude eye of the homme sensuel metaphysically it was the boss but how was i to know fate come walking through the door and it is five feet eleven inches tall and heavyish in the chest and shortish in the leg and is wearing a sevenfifty seersucker suit which is too long in the pants so the cuffs crumple down over the high black shoes which could do with a polishing and a stiff high collar like a sundayschool superintendent and a blue stripe tie which you know his wife gave him last christmas and which he has kept in tissue paper with the holly card merry xmas to my darling willie from your loving wife until he got ready to go up the city and a gray felt hat with the sweat stains showing through the band it comes in just like that and how are you to know it comes in trailing behind alex michel who is or was before the piano player got him sixfeettwo of beautifully articulated bone and gristle with a hard bony bakedlooking face and two little quick brown eyes which dont belong above that classic torso and in that face and which keep fidgeting around like a brace of mexican jumping beans so fate trails modestly along behind alex michel who approaches the table with an air of command which would deceive no one
alex shook my hand and said hi pal and slapped me on the shoulder with a palm that was tough enough to crack a black walnut and paid proper obeisance to mr duffy who extended a hand without rising and then as a sort of afterthought alex jerked a thumb toward his trailing companion and said this is willie stark gents from up home at mason city me and willie was in school together yeah and willie and he was a bookworm he was teachers pet wuznt you willie and alex whickered like a stallion in full appreciation of his own delicious humor and nudged the teachers pet in the ribs then controlling himself he added and hes still teachers pet aint you willie aint you
and he turned to duffy and me and explained before mirth again took him and slades back room again resounded with the cheerful note of the breeding paddock willie–willie–he married a schoolteacher
that idea seemed monstrously funny to alex meanwhile willie unable to complete the amenities of the situation bowed to the blast and stood there with the old gray felt hat in his hand with the sweat showing around the band outside where it had soaked through willies large face above the stiff country collar didnt show a thing
yeah–yeah–he married a schoolteacher alex reaffirmed with undiminished relish
well said mr duffy whose experience and tact were equal to any situation they tells me schoolteachers are made with it in the same place mr duffy lifted his lips to expose the gold
￼￼but made no sound for mr duffy being a man of the world and serene in confidence his style was to put forth his sally and let it make its way on its intrinsic worth and to leave the applause to the public
alex provided the applause in good measure i contributed only a grin which felt sickly on my face and willie was blank
gawd alex managed when breath had returned to him gawd mr duffy you are a card you shoregawd are and again he vigorously nudged the teachers pet in the ribs to spur his laggard humor when he got no result he nudged again and demanded flatly of his ward now aint mr duffy a card
yes willie replied looking at mr duffy innocently judicially dispassionately yes he said mr duffy is a card and as the admission was made albeit belatedly and with some ambiguity of inflection the slight cloud which had gathered upon mr duffys brow was dissipated with no trace of rancor left behind
willie took advantage of the momentary lull to wind up the ritual of introduction which alexs high spirits had interrupted he transferred his old gray hat to his left hand and took the two steps necessary to bring him to the table and gravely extended his hand to me so much water has flowed beneath the bridges since alex has jerked his thumb toward the stranger from the country and said this is willie stark that i had almost forgotten i hadnt known willie all my life so i didnt catch on right away that he was out to shake hands i must have looked at his outstretched hand inquiringly and then given him a blank look and he just showed me his dead pan–it was just another pan at first glance anyway–and kept on holding his hand out then i came to and not to be undone in courtesy of the old school i hitched my chair back from the table and almost stood all the way up and groped for his hand it was a pretty goodsized hand when you first took it you figured it was on the soft side and the palm a little too moist–which is something however you dont hold against a man in certain latitudes–then you discovered it has a solid substructure it was like the hand of a farm boy who has not too recently given up the plow for a job in the crossroad store willies hand gave mine three decorous pumphandle motions and he said glad to meetcha mr burden like something he had memorized and then i could have sworn he gave me a wink then looking into that dead pan i wasnt sure about twelve years later at a time when the problem of willies personality more imperiously occupied my rare hours of speculation i asked him boss do you remember the time we first got acquainted in the back room of slades joint
he said he did which wasnt remarkable for he was like the circus elephant he never forgot anything the fellow who gave him the peanut or the fellow who put snuff in his trunk
you remember when we shook hands i asked him
yeah he said well boss i demanded did you or didnt you wink at me
boy– he said and toyed with his glass of scotch and soda and dug the heel of one of his unpolished thirtydollar chastely designed benchmade shoes into the best bedspread the st regis hotel could afford boy he said and smiled at me paternally over his glass that is a mystery
dont you remember i said
sure he said i remember
well i demanded suppose i just had something in my eye he said well damn it you just had something in your eye ten
￼￼suppose i didnt have anything in my eye
then maybe you winked because you figured you and me had some views in common about
the tone of the gathering
maybe he said it aint any secret that my old schoolmate alex was a heel and it aint any
secret that tiny duffy is as sebaceous a fatass as ever made the spring groan in a swivel chair he is an s o b i affirmed
he is the boss agreed cheerfully but he is a useful citizen if you know what to do with him
yeah i said and i suppose you think you know what to do with him you made him lieutenant governor for that was in the bosss last term when tiny was his understudy
sure the boss nodded somebodys got to be lieutenant governor
yeah i said tiny duffy
sure he said tiny duffy the beauty about tiny is that nobody can trust him and you know
it you get somebody somebody can trust maybe and you got to sit up nights worrying whether you are the somebody you get tiny and you can get a nights sleep all you got to do is keep the albumen scared out of his urine
boss did you wink at me that time back at slades
boy he said if i was to tell you then you wouldnt have anything to think about so i never did know
but i did see willie shake hands that morning with tiny duffy and fail to wink at him he just stood there in front of mr duffy and when the great man not rising finally extended his hand with the reserved air of the pope offering his toe to the kiss of a campbellite willie took it and gave it the three pumps which seemed to be regulation up in mason city
alex sat down at the table and willie just stood there as though waiting to be invited till alex kicked the fourth chair over a few inches with his foot and said git off yore dogs willie
willie sat down and laid his gray felt hat on the marble top in front of him the edges of the brim crinkled and waved up all around off the marble like a piecrust before grandma trims it willie just sat there behind his hat and his bluestriped christmas tie and waited with his hands laid in his lap
slade came in from the front and said beer
all round mr duffy ordered
not for me thank you kindly willie said
m duffy with some surprise and no trace of pleasure turned his gaze upon willie who seemed
unaware of the significance of the event sitting upright in his little chair behind the hat and the tie then mr duffy looked up at slade and jerking his head toward willie said aw give him some beer
no thanks willie said with no more emotion that you would put into the multiplication table too strong for you mr duffy demanded
no willie replied but no thank you
maybe the schoolteacher dont let him drink nuthen alex offered
lucy dont favor drinking willie said quietly for a fact what she dont know dont hurt her mr duffy said
git him some beer alex said to slade
all round mr duffy repeated with the air of closing an issue
￼￼slade looked at alex and he looked at mr duffy and he looked at willie he flicked his towel halfheartedly in the direction of a cruising fly and said i sells beer to them as wants it i aint making nobody drink it
perhaps that was the moment when slade made his fortune how life is strange and changeful and the crystal is in the steel at the point of fracture and the toad bears a jewel in its forehead and the meanings of moments passes like the breeze that scarcely ruffles the leaf of the willow
well anyway when repeal came and mailmen had to use mack trucks to haul the application for licenses over to the city hall slade got a license he got a license immediately and he got a swell location and he got the jack to put in leather chairs kind to the femurs and a circular bar and slade who never had a dime in his life after he paid rent and protection now stands in the shadows under the murals of undressed dames in the midst of the glitter of chromium and tinted mirrors wearing a doublebreasted blue suit with whats left of his hair plastered over his skull and keeps one eye on the black boys in white jackets who tote the poison and the other on the blonde at the cash register who knows that her duties are not concluded when the lights are turned off at 200 am and the strains of a threepiece string ensemble soothe the nerves of the customers
how did slade get the license so quickly how did he get the lease when half the big boys in the business were after that corner how did he get the jack for the leather chairs and the string ensemble slade never confided in me but i figure slade got his reward for being an honest man
anyway slades statement of principle about the beer question closed the subject that morning tiny duffy lifted a face to slade with the expression worn by the steer when you give it the hammer then as sensation returned he took refuge in his dignity alex permitted himself the last luxury of irony says alex well maybe you got some orange pop for him and when the whicker of his mirth had died away slade said i reckin i have if he wants it
yes willie said i think ill take some orange pop
the beer came and the bottle of pop the bottle of pop had two straws in it willie lifted his two hands out of his lap where they had decorously lain during the previous conversation and took the bottle between them and affixed his lips to the straws his lips were a little bit meaty but they werent loose not exactly maybe at first glance you might think so you might think he had a mouth like a boy not quite shaped up and that was the way he looked that minute all right leaning over the bottle and the straws stuck in his lips which were just puckered up but if you stuck around long enough youd see something a little different you would see that they were hung together all right even if they were meaty his face was a little bit meaty too but thin skinned and had freckles hs eyes were big big and brown and hed look right at you out of the middle of that thinskinned and freckled and almost pudgy face at first you would think it was pudgy then you would change your mind and the dark brown thick hair was tousled and crinkled down over his forehead which wasnt very high in the first place and the hair was a little moist there was little willie there was cousin willie from the country from up at mason city with his christmas tie and maybe you would take him out to the park and show him the swans
alex leaned toward duffy and said confidingly willie–hes in polytics
duffys features exhibited the slightest twitch of interest but the twitch was dissipated into the vast oleaginous blankness which was the face of duffy in response he did not even look at willie yeah alex continued leaning closer and nodding sideways at willie yeah in polyticks up
in mason city
￼￼￼mr duffys head did a massive quarterrevolution in the direction of willie and the paleblue eyes focused upon him from the great distance not that the mention of mason city was calculated to impress mr duffy but the fact that willie could be in politics anywhere even in mason city where no doubt the hogs scratched themselves against the underpinnings of the post office raised certain problems which merit passing attention so mr duffy gave his attention to willie and solved the problem he solved by deciding that there wasnt any problem willie was not in politics not in mason city or anywhere else alex michel was a liar and the truth was not in him you could look at willie and see that he never had been and never would be in politics willie could look at willie and deduce the fact that willie was not in politics so he said yeah with heavy irony and incredulity was obvious upon his face
not that i much blame duffy duffy was face to face with the margin of mystery where all our calculations collapse where the stream of time dwindles into the sands of eternity where the formula fails in the test tube where chaos and old night hold sway and we hear the laughter in the ether dream but he didnt know he was and so he said yeah
yeah alex echoed without irony and added up in mason city willie is county treasurer aint you willie
yes willie said county treasurer
my god duffy breather with the air of a man who discovers that he has built upon sands and dwelt among mock shows
yeah alex iterated and willie id down here on business for mason country aint you willie
willie nodded
about a bond issue they got up there alex continued they gonna build a schoolhouse and
its a bond issue
duffys lips worked and you could catch the discreet glimmer of the gold in the bridgework but
no words came forth the moment was too full for sound of foam
but it was true willie was the county treasurer and he was that day long ago in the city on
business about the bond issue for the schoolhouse and the bond were issued and the schoolhouse built and more than a dozen years later the big black cadillac with the boss whipped past the schoolhouse and then sugarboy really put his foot down on the gas and we headed out still on the almost new slab of number 58
we had done about a mile and not a word spoken when the boss turned around from the front sea and looked at me and said jack make a note to find out something about malaciahs boy and the killing
whats his name i asked
hell i dont know but hes a good boy
malaciahs name i mean i said
malaciah wynn the boss said
i had my notebook out now and wrote it down and wrote down stabbing
find out when the trial is set and get a lawyer down a good one and i mean a good one thatll
know how to handle it and let him know he goddamn well better handle it but dont get a guy that wants his name in lights
albert evans i said he ought to do
uses hair oil the boss said uses hair oil and slicks it back till the top of his head looks like
￼the black ball on a pool table get somebody looks like he didnt sing with a dance band you losing your mind
all right i said and wrote in my notebook abe lincoln type i didnt have to remind myself about that i just wrote because i had got in the habit you can build up an awful lot of habits in six years and you can fill an awful lot of little black books in that time and put them in a safetydeposit box when they get full because they arent something to leave around and because they would be worth their weight in gold to some parties to get their hands on not that they ever got their hands on them a mans got to carry something besides a corroded liver with him out of that dark backward and abysm of time and it might as well be the little black books the little black books lie up there in the safetydeposit box and there are your works of days and hands all cozy in the dark in the little box and the worlds great axis grinds
you pick him the boss said but keep out of sight put one of your pals on him and pick your pal
i got you i replied for i got him
the boss was just about to turn around and divide his attention between the highway and sugar boys speedometer when duffy cleared this throat and said boss
yeah the boss said
you know who it was got cut
no the boss said getting ready to turn around and i dont care if it was the sainted uncut maiden aunt of the apostle paul
mr duffy cleared his throat the way he always did in late years when he was congested with phlegm and an idea i happened to notice in the paper he began i happened to notice back when it happened and the feller got cut was the son of a doctor up in this neighborhood i dont recall what his name was but he was a doctor the paper said so now– mr duffy was going right on talking to the back of the bosss head the boss hadnt paid any mind it seemed now it would appear to me mr duffy said and cleared his pipes again it would appear to me maybe that doctor might be pretty big around here you know how a doctor is in the country they think he is somebody and maybe it got out how you was mixed up with trying to get the feller wynns boy off and it wouldnt do you any good you know politics he explained you know how politics is now it–
the boss whipped his head around to look at mr duffy so fast all of a sudden there wasnt anything but a blur it was as though his big brown pop eyes were looking out the back of his head through the hair everything blurred up together that is slightly hyperbolic but you get what i mean the boss was like that he gave you the impression of being a slow and deliberate man to look at him and he had a way of sitting loose as though he had sunk inside himself and was going down for the third time and his eyes would blink like an owls in a cage then all of a sudden he would make a move it might just be to reach out and grab a fly out of the air that was bothering him that trick i saw an old brokendown pug do once who hung around a saloon he would make bets he could catch a fly out of the air with his fingers and he could the boss could do that or he would whip his head at you when you said something he hadnt seemed to be listening to he whipped his head round now to duffy and fixed his gaze on him for an instant before he said quite simply and expressively jesus then he said tiny you dont know a goddamned thing in the first place ive known malaciah wynn all my life and his boy is a good boy and i dont care who he cut in the second place it was a fair fight and he had bad luck and when its like that by the
time the trial comes up folks are always feeling for the feller whos being tried for murder when he just had bad luck because the fellow died in the third place if you had picked the wax out of your ears youd heard me tell jack to prime the lawyer through a pal and to get one didnt want his name in lights as far as that lawyer knows or anybody else knows hes been sent by the pope and all he wants to know anyway is whether the foliage he gets out of it has those little silk threads in it is all that clear or do you want me to draw a picture
i get you mr duffy said and wet his lips
but the boss wasnt listening now he had turned back to the highway and the speedometer and
had said to sugarboy gods sake you think we want to admire the landscape were late now then you felt sugarboy take up that last extra stitch
but not for long in about half a mile we hit the turnoff sugarboy turned off on the gravel and we sprayed along with the rocks crunching and popping up against the underside of the fender like grease in a skillet we left a tail of dust for the other car to ride into
then we saw the house
it was set on a little rise a biggish box of a house twostory rectangular gray and unpainted
with a tin roof unpainted too and giving off blazes under the sun for it was new and the rust hadnt bitten down into it yet and a big chimney at each end we pulled up to the gate the house was set up close to the road with a good hogwire fence around the not very big yard and with some crepe myrtles in bloom the color of raspberry ice cream and looking cool in the heat in the corner of the yard and one live oak nothing to brag on and dying on one side in front of the house and a couple of magnolias off to one side with rustylooking tinny leaves there wasnt much grass in the yard and a half dozen hens wallowed and fluffed and cuckcucked in the dust under the magnolia trees a big white hairy dog like a collie or a shepherd was lying on the front porch a little onestory front porch that looked stuck on the box of the house like an afterthought
it looked like those farmhouses you ride by in the country in the middle of the afternoon with the chickens under the trees and the dog asleep and you know the only person in the house is the woman who has finished washing up the dishes and has swept the kitchen and has gone upstairs to lie down for half an hour and has pulled off her dress and kicked off her shoes and is lying there on her back on the bed in the shadowy room with her eyes closed and a strand of her hair still matted down on her forehead with the perspiration she listens to the flies cruising around the room then she listens to your motor getting big out on the road then it shrinks off into the distance and she listens to the flies that was the kind of house it was
one time i had wondered why the boss never had the house painted after he got his front feet in the trough and a dollar wasnt the reason you got up in the morning any more then i figured the boss knew best suppose he had painted it up then the next fellow down the road would be saying to the next one seen old man stark got his house painted yeah putten on airs hit looks lak hit wuz good enuff fer him to live in all his life lak hit wuz and his boy gits up thar in the cappytell and hit aint good enuff no more fust thing you know and old man starkll be going to be privy in the house and maken em cook cabbige out behind the barn as a matter of fact old man stark was going to the privy in the house for the boss had put in running water and a bathroom water pumped by a little automatic electric pump but you cant see a commode from the road when you pass by it doesnt hit you in the eye or run out and bite you in the leg and what the voter doesnt know doesnt prey on his mind
anyway if he had painted the house it wouldnt have made half as good picture as it was going
to make that day with willie and his old man on the front steps with lucy starks and the boy and the old white dog
the old man was on the front steps now by the time we got through the front gate which had a couple of old plow points hung on a wire to pull it shut and clank to announce the visitor and had started up the path the old man had come out of the door he stopped on the steps and waited a not very tall old man and thin wearing blue jean pants and a blue shirt washed so much that it had a powdery pastel shade to it and a black bow tie the kind that comes readytied on an elastic band we got up close and could see his face brown and tooledlooking with the skin and flesh thin on the bone and hanging down from the bone to give that patient look old mens faces have and his gray hair plastered down on his narrow eggthin old skull–the hair still wet as though he had given it a dab with the wet brush when he heard the car just to be looking right at the last minuteand slow blue eyes in the middle of the brown folded skin the blue of the eyes was pale and washed out like the blue of the shirt he didnt have any whiskers or mustache and you could see that he had shaved pretty recently for there were two or three little nicks with the little crusts of blood on them where the razor had got tangled in the folds of the brown dry skin
he stood on the steps and for any sign he gave we might as well have been back in the city then the boss went up to him and put out his hand and said hello pappy how you making
it
gitten along the old man said and shook hands or rather putting out his hand with that same
motion from the elbow which old leatherface had had in the drugstore back in mason city he let the boss shake it
lucy stark went up to him not saying anything and kissed him on his left cheek he didnt say anything either when she did it he just reached his right arm a little around her shoulder not quite a hug just putting his arm there and you could see his knobby crooked brown old hand which looked too big for the wristbone and the hand gave her shoulder two or three little tired apologetic pats then the hand dropped away and hung at his side beside the blue jean pants leg and lucy stark stepped back the he said not very loud howdy lucy
howdy papa she said and the hand hanging beside the jean pants jerked as though it were getting ready to reach out and pat her again but it didnt
i suppose it didnt have to anyway not to tell lucy stark what lucy stark already knew and had known without words ever since the days when she had married willie stark and had come out here and had sat by the fire at night with the old man whose wife had been dead a long time then and who hadnt had a woman in the house for a long time that they had something in common old man stark and lucy stark who had loved and married willie stark the willie stark who at that moment when she and the old man sat wordlessly before the fire was upstairs in his room with his face bent down over a law book his face puzzled and earnest and the tousle of hair hanging and who was not with them by the fire but was up there in that room but not even in that room either but in a room a world inside himself where something was swelling and growing painfully and dully and imperceptibly like a great potato in a dark damp cellar what they had in common was a word of wordless silence by the fire a world which could absorb effortlessly and perfectly the movements of their day and their occupations and of all the days they had lived and of the days that were to come for them to move about in and do the thing which were the life for which they were made so they sat there in their common knowledge while the chunk on the hearth stewed and hissed and crumbled and were together in the down beat and pause of the rhythm of
￼￼their lives that was what they had in common now and nothing could take that away but they had something else in common they had in common the knowledge that they did not have what they had
the boss was introducing mr duffy who was delighted to meet mr stark yes sir and introducing the gang who had just come up in the second car then the boss jerked a thumb at me and said to his father you recollect jack burden dont you
i recollect the old man said and we shook hands
we all went into the parlor and sat around on a few pieces of stuffed horsehair furniture which
had an acid mummy smell in your parchedout nostrils or on straight splitbottom chairs which old man stark and the boss had fetched in from the kitchen and the motes of dust swam on the rays of light striking in under the shades of the western windows of the room through the onetime white but now yellowish lace curtains which looped uncertainly from their rods like fish nets hung up to wait for mending the gang of us sat around and moved our thighs on the horsehair or on the splitbottom and stared down at the unpainted boards of the floor or at the design on the linoleum mat in the middle of the floor as though we were still brightreds and tans and blues slick and varnishedlooking–a kind of glib impertinent geometrical island floating there in the midst of the cornerless shadows and the acid mummy smell and the slow swell of time which had fed into this room day by day since long back as into a landlocked sea where the fish were dead and the taste was brackish on your tongue you had the feeling that if the boss and mr duffy and sadie burke and the photographer and the reporters and you and the rest got cuddled up together on that linoleum mat it would lift off the floor by magic and scoop you all up together and make a lazy preliminary circuit of the room and whisk right out of the door or out the roof like the floating island of gulliver or the carpet in the arabian nights and carry you off where you and it belonged and leave old man stark sitting there as though nothing had happened very clean and razor nicked with his gray hair plastered down damp sitting there by the table where the big bible and the lamp and the plushbound album were under the blank devouring gaze of the whiskered face in the big crayon portrait above the mantel shelf
then the nigger woman brought in a pitcher of water on a tray with three glasses slipping her feet in old tennis shoes dryly along the board lucy stark took one glass and sadie burke another and the rest of us just passed around the third glass
then the photographer took a secret look at his watch and cleared his throat and said governor–
yeah the boss answered
i just reckoned–if you and mrs stark is rested and all– he made a sittingdown bow in the
direction of lucy stark a bow from the waist that was quite a feat and gave the impression he had had a couple too many for the heat and was passing out in the chair–if you all–
the boss stood up all right he said grinning i just reckon i get you then he looked at his wife questioningly
lucy stark stood up too
all set pappy the boss said to the old man and the old man stood up too
the boss led the way out to the front porch we all tailed him out like a procession the photographer went to the second car and unpacked a tripod and the rest of his plunder and got it rigged up facing the steps the boss was standing on the steps blinking and grinning as though he were half asleep and knew what kind of a dream he was going to have
￼
￼￼well just take you first governor the photographer said and the rest of us eased off the porch and out of range
the photographer hid his head under the black cloth then he popped out again agog with an idea the dog he said get the dog in there with you governor you be petting the dog or something right there on the steps itll be swell it will be the nuts you be petting that dog hes pawing up on you like he was glad to see you when you come home see it will be nuts
sure the nuts the boss said
then he turned toward the old white dog which hadnt moved a muscle since the cadillac
pulled up at the gate and was lying over to one side of the porch like a wornout fur rug here buck the boss said and snapped his fingers
but the dog didnt show a thing here buck the boss called
tom stark prodded the dog with his toe for a little encouragement but he might just as well have been prodding a bolster
buck is gitten on old man stark said he aint right spry any more then the old man went to the steps and stooped down with a motion which made you expect to hear the sound of old rusty hinges on a barn door hi buck hi buck the old man wheedled without optimism he gave up and lifted his gaze to the boss if s hongry now he said and shook hid head if he was hongry we could guile him but he aint hongry his teeth gone bad
the boss looked at me and i knew what i was paid to do
jack the boss said get the hairy bastard up here and make him look like he was glad to see
me
i was supposed to do a lot of different things and one of them was to lift up fifteenyearold
hundredandthirtyfive pound hairy white dogs on summer afternoons and paint an expression of unutterable bliss upon their faithful features as they gaze deep deep into the bosss eyes i got hold of bucks forelegs as though i were girding myself to shove a wheelbarrow and heaved it didnt work i got his front end up for a second but just as i got him up he breathed out and i breathed in one gust of buck was enough it was like a gust from a buzzards nest i was paralyzed buck hit the porch boards and lay there like the old polarbear rug he resembled
then tom stark and one of the reporters shoved on the tail end and i heaved on the front end and held my breath and we got buck the seven feet to the boss the boss braced himself and we heaved up the front end and the boss got a gust of buck
that gust was enough
gods sake pappy the boss demanded as soon as he had mastered his spasm what you been feeding this dog
he aint any appetite old man stark said
he aint any appetite for violets the boss said and spat on the ground
the reason he fell the photographer observed was because his hind legs gave down once we get him propped we got to work fast
we the boss said we what the hell you mean we you come kiss him one whiff would curdle milk and strip pine tree we hell
the boss took a deep breath and we heaved again it didnt work buck didnt have any starch in him we tried six or seven times but it was no sale finally the boss had to sit down on the steps and we dragged buck up and laid the faithful head on the bosss knee the boss put his hand on
￼￼bucks head and looked at the photographers birdie the photographer shot it and said it is the nuts and the boss said yeah the nuts
the boss sat there a few seconds with his hand on bucks head a dog the boss said is mans best friend old buck hes the best friend i ever had he scratched the brutes head yeah good old buck the boss said the best friend i ever had but god damn it he said and stood up so quick that bucks head slid off his knee he dont smell a bit bettern the rest of em
is that for the record boss one of the reporters asked sure the boss said he smells just like the rest of em
then we cleared bucks carcass off the steps and the photographer settled into the grind he took the boss and the family in every possible combination then he got his rig together and said governor you know we want a picture of you upstairs in the room you used to have when you were a kid it will be nuts
yeah the boss said the nuts
that was my idea it would be nuts all right the boss sitting there with an old schoolbook in his hands a good example for the tots so we went upstairs
it was a little room with bare board floor and tongueand groove beaded walls which had been painted yellow one time but had the paint crazing off the wood now in sections where any paint was left there was a big wooden bed with a high head and foot standing somewhat off the perpendicular and a white counterpane on the bed there was a table–a pine table–and a couple of straight chairs and a stove–the kind of tin stove they call a trashburner pretty rusty now–and against the wall beyond the stove a couple of homemade bookcases crammed with books third readers and geographies and algebras and such in one of them and a lot of crummy old law books in the other
the boss stood in the middle of the floor and took a good look all around while the rests of us hung around the door bunched up like sheep and waited jesus the boss said put the old white thundermug under the bed and itll look just like home
i looked over at the bed and the crockery wasnt there it was the only prop missing that and a kid with a pudgy face and freckles on his face and sandy hair falling down on his forehead bending down at the table by a coaloil lamp–it must have been a coaloil lamp then–and a pencil in his hand tooth marks on the pencil where hed been gnawing at it and the fire in the trash burner getting low and the wind pounding on the north side of the house pounding down off the dakotas a thousand miles away and across the plains which were icy and pearlblind with the snow polished hard under the wind and glimmering in the dark and across the river bottoms and across the hills where the pine trees had stood once and moaned in the wind but where wasnt anything to break the wind now the sash in the window on the north wall of the room would rattle under the wind and the flame in the coaloil lamp would bend and shiver in what current of air sneaked in but the kid wouldnt look up he would gnaw his pencil and hunch down then after a while he would blow out the lamp and pull off his clothes and get into bed wearing his underwear the sheets would be cold to the skin and stifffeeling he would lie there and shiver in the dark the wind would come down a thousand miles and pound on the house and the sash would rattle and inside him something would be big and coiling slow and clotting till he would hold his breath and the blood would beat in his head with s hollow sound as though his head were a cave as big as the dark outside he wouldnt have any name for what was big inside him maybe there isnt any name
that was all there was missing from the room the kid and the thundermug otherwise it was
perfect
yeah the boss was saying its sure gone but its o k by me maybe sitting over running
water puts phlegm on your gut like the old folks say but it would sure have made learning law a hell of a lot more comfortable and you wouldnt have to waste so much time
the boss was a slow mover manys the time weve settled affairs of state through a bathroom door the boss on the inside and me on the outside on a chair with my little black notebook on my knee and the telephone ringing to beat the hell
but now the photographer started arranging things he got the boss to sit at the table and pore over a dogeared reader and he fired off his flash bulb and got that and he got a half dozen more the boss sitting in a chair by the trashburner holding an old law book on his knees and god knows what else
i wandered off downstairs and left them preparing the documents for posterity
when i got to the bottom of the stairs i could hear voices in the parlor and i figured it was the old man and lucy stark and sadie burke and the kid i went out the back way to the back porch i could hear the nigger woman puttering around in the kitchen humming to herself about her and
jesus i walked across the back yard where there wasnt any grass when the falls rain came there wouldnt be anything here but a loblolly with the crazy marks made in it by hens feet but it was dust now there was a chinaberry tree beside the gate letting you into the back lot and as i went through the gate the berries scattered on the ground crunched under my feet like bugs
i went on down the lot past a row of gableshaped chicken coops made of wood which had been split out like shingles and set on cypress chunks to keep them out of the wet i went on down to the barn and stable lot where a couple of ablebodied but motheaten mules hung their heads in the unflagging shame of their species beside a big iron pot the kind they use for cooking up molasses the pot was a water trough now there was a pipe sticking up beside it with a faucet on it one of the bosss modern improvements you couldnt see from the road
i went on past the stables which were built of log but with a good tin roof and leaned on the fence looking off down the rise back of the barn the ground was washed and gullied somewhat with piles of brush chucked into the washes here and there to stop the process as though it ever would a hundred yards off at the foot of the rise there was a patch of woods scrub oak and such the ground must have been swampy down there for the grass and weeds at the edge of the trees were lush and tropical green against the bare ground beyond it looked too green to be natural i could see a couple of hogs lounging down there on their sides like big gray blisters popped up out of the ground
it was getting toward sunset now i leaned on the fence and looked off west across the country where the light was stretching out and breathed in that dry clean ammoniac smell you get around stables at sunset on a summer day i figured they would find me when they wanted me i didnt have the slightest notion when that would be the boss and his family i reckoned would spend the night at his pappys place the reporters and the photographer and sadie would get on back to the city mr duffy–maybe he was supposed to put up in mason city at the hotel or maybe he and i were supposed to stay at pappys place too if they put us in the same bed though i was just going to start walking in to mason city then there was sugarboy but i quit thinking about it i didnt give a damn what they did
i leaned on the fence and the posture bowed my tail out so that the cloth of my pants pulled tight and pressed the pint against my left hip i thought about that for a minute and admired the
￼sunset colorations and breathed the dry clean ammoniac smell and then i pulled out the bottle i took a drink and put it back i leaned on the fence and waited for the sunset colorations to explode in my stomach which they did
i heard somebody open and shut the gate to the barn lot but i didnt look around if i didnt look around it would not be true that somebody opened the gate with the creaky hinges and that is a wonderful principle for a man to get hold of i had got hold of the principle out of a book when i was in college and i had hung on to it for grim death i owed my success in life to that principle it had put me where i was what you dont know dont hurt you for it aint real they called that idealism in my book i had when i was in college and after i got hold of that principle i became an idealist i was a brassbound idealist in those days if you are an idealist it does not matter what you do or what goes on around you because it isnt real anyway
the steps came closer and closer padded in the soft dust i didnt look up then i felt the wire of the fence creak and give because somebody else was leaning against it and admiring the sunset mr x and i admired the sunset together for a couple of minutes and nothing said except for the sound of his breathing i wouldnt have known he was there
then there was a moment and the wire shifted when mr x took his weight off it then the hand patted my left hip and the voice said gimme a slug it was the bosss voice
take it i said you know where it lives
he lifted up my coattail and pulled out the bottle i could hear the gurgle as he did the damage
the wire shifted again as he leaned against it
i figured youd come down here he said
and you wanted a drink i replied without bitterness
yeah he said and pappy doesnt favor drinking never did i looked up at him he was leaning on the fence bearing down on the wire in a way not to do it any good with the bottle held in both hands corked and his forearms propped over the wire
it used to be lucy didnt favor it either i said
things change he said he uncorked the bottle and took another pull and corked it again
but lucy he said i dont know whether she changed or not i dont know whether she favors it or not now she never touches it herself maybe she sees it eases a mans nerves
i laughed you havent any nerves i told him im a bundle of nerves he said and grinned
we kept leaning against the fence watching the light lying across the country and hitting the clump of trees down the rise the boss leaned his head a little forward and let a big globule of spit form at his lips and let it fall through the space between his forearms down to the board hog through just over the fence from us the trough was dry with a few odd red grains of corn and a few shreds of shucks lying in it and on the ground by it
things dont change much around here though the boss said that didnt seem to demand any response and so i didnt give it any
i bet i dumped ten thousand gallons of swill into that trough he said one time and another he let another glob of spit fall into the trough i bet i slopped five hundred head of hogs out of this trough he said and he said by god im still doing it pouring swill
well i said swill is what they live on isnt it he didnt say anything to that
the hinges of the gate up the lot creaked again and i looked around there wasnt any reason
￼not to now it was sadie burke she was plowing her white oxfords through the dust as though she meant business and every time she took a stride it looked as though she were going to pop the skirt of her bluestriped seersucker suit she was in such a rush the boss turned around looked at the bottle in his hand then passed it to me whats up he asked her when she got within ten feet
she didnt answer right away but came up close she was breathing hard from the rush the light hit her on her slightly pockmarked face which was damp now with perspiration and her choppedoff black hair was wild and electric on her head and her big deep powerful black eyes burned right out of her face into the sunlight
whats up the boss demanded again
judge irwin she managed to get out with what breath she had after the rush
yeah the boss said he was still lounging against the wire but he was looking at sadie as though she might draw a gun and he was planning on beating her to the draw
matlock called up–long distance from town–and he said the afternoon paper–
spill it the boss said spill it
damn it sadie said ill spill it when i get good and ready ill spill it when i get my breath if
im good and ready and if you–
youre using up a lot of breath right now the boss said with a tone of voice which made you
think of rubbing your hand down a cats back just as soft
its my breath sadie snapped at him and nobodys bought it i damned near break myself
down running out here to tell you something and then you say spill it spill it before i can get my breath and ill just tell you when i get my breath and–
you dont sound exactly windbroke the boss observed leaning back on the hog wire and grinning
you think its so damned funny sadie said oh yeah so damned funny
the boss didnt answer that he just kept leaning on the wire as though he had all day before him and kept on grinning when he grinned like that it didnt do much to soothe sadies feelings i
had observed in the past and the symptoms seemed to be running true to form
so i decorously withdrew my gaze from the pair and resumed my admiration of the dying day on the other side of the hog lot and the elegiac landscape not that they would have bothered about me if they had anything on their minds–neither one of them powers thrones and dominations might be gathered round and if sadie felt like it she would cut loose and the boss wasnt precisely of a shrinking disposition theyd get started like that over nothing at all sometimes the boss just lying back and grinning and working sadie up till those big black glittering eyes of hers would separate from the tangle and hang down by her face so shed have to swipe it back with the back of the hand she would say plenty while she got worked up but the boss wouldnt say much hed just grin at her he seemed to take a relish in getting her worked up that way and lying back and watching it even when she slapped him once a good hard one he kept on looking at her that way as though she were a hula girl doing a dance for him he relished her getting worked up all right unless she finally landed on a sore spot she was the only one who knew the trick o had the nerve then the show would really start they wouldnt care who was there certainly not if i was there and there wasnt any reason for me to avert my face out of delicacy i had been a piece of furniture a long time but some taint of the manners my grandma taught me still hung on and now and then got the better of my curiosity sure i was a piece of furniture–with two legs and a pay check
coming–but i looked off at the sunset anyway
oh its so damned funny sadie was saying but you wont think its so damned funny when i tell you she stopped then said judge irwin has come out for callahan
there wasnt any sound for what must have been three seconds but seemed like a week while a mourning dove down in the clump of trees in the bottom where the hogs were gave a couple of tries at breaking his heart and mine
then i heard the boss say the bastard
it was in the afternoon paper–the endorsement sadie elaborated matlock telephoned from
town to let you know
the twotiming bastard the boss said
then he heaved up off the wire and i turned around i figured the conclave was about to break up it was come on the boss said and started moving up the hill toward the house sadie by his side popping her seersucker skirt to keep up with him and i trailing
about the time we got to the gate where the chinaberry tree was and the berries on the ground popped under your feet the boss said to sadie get em cleared out
tiny was figuring on having supper out here sadie said and sugarboy was gonna drive him to mason city in time for the eightoclock train to town you asked him
im unasking him the boss replied clear em all out
itll be a privilege sadie said and i reckoned she spoke from the heart
she cleared them out and fast their car went off down the gravel road with the springs flat on the rear axle and human flesh oozing out the windows then the evening quiet descended upon us i went to the other side of the house where a hammock made out of wire and barrel staves the kind they rig up in that part of the world was swung between a post and the live oak i took off my coat and hung it on the post and dropped my bottle into the side pocket so it wouldnt break my hip bone when i lay down and climbed into the hammock
the boss was down at the other end of the yard where the crepe myrtles were prowling up and down on the dusty grass stems well it was all his baby and he could give it suck i just lay there in the hammock i lay there and watched the undersides of the oak leaves dry and grayish and dustygreen and some of them i saw had rustycorrodedlooking spots on them those were the ones which would turn loose their grip on the branch before long–not in any breeze the fibers would just relax in the middle of the day maybe with the sunshine bright and the air so still it aches like the place where the tooth was on the morning after youve been to the dentist or aches like your heart in the bosom when you stand on the street corner waiting for the light to change and happen to recollect how things once were and how they might have been yet if what happened had not happened
then while i was watching the leaves i heard a dry cracking sound down toward the barnyard then it came again then i figured out what it was it was sugarboy off down in the lot playing with his38 special again he would set up a tin can or a bottle on a post and turn his back to the post and start walking away carrying his baby in his left hand by the barrel the safety on just walking steadily away on his stumpy little legs with his always blue serge pants bagging around his underslung behind and with the last rays of the evening sun faintly glittering on his bald spot among the scrubby patches of hair like bleached lichen then al of a sudden he would stop walking and grab the butt of the playpretty with his right hand and wheel–all in a quick awkward motion as though a spring had exploded inside him–and the playpretty would go bang and the tin can would jump off the post or the bottle would spray off in all directions or most
￼likely then sugarboy would say the bbbbastud and shake his head and the spit would fly
there would be a single cracking sound and a long wait that meant he had hit it the first try and was trudging back to the post to set up another then after a spell there would be another crack and a wait then one time there came two cracks close together that meant sugarboy had missed the first try and had got it on the second
then i must have dozed off for i came to with the boss standing there saying time to eat so we went in and ate
we sat down at the table old man stark at one end and lucy at the other lucy wiped the perspirationsoaked wisp of hair back from her face and gave that lastminute look around the table to see if anything was missing like a general inspecting troops she was in her element all right she had been out of it for a long time but when you dropped her back in it she hit running like a cat out of a sack
the jaws got to work around the table and she watched them work she sat there not eating much and keeping a sharp eye out for a vacant place on any plate and watching the jaws work and as she sat there her face seemed to smooth itself out and relax with an inner faith in happiness the way the face of the chief engineer does when he goes down to the engine room at night and the big wheel is blurred out with its speed and the pistons plunge and return and the big steel throws are leaping in their perfect orbits like a ballet and the whole place under the electric glare hums and glitters and sings like the eternal insides of gods head and the ship is knocking off twentytwo knots on a glassy starlit sea
so the jaw muscles pumped all around the table and lucy stark sat there in the bliss of self fulfillment
i had just managed to get down the last spoonful of chocolate ice cream which i had had to tamp down into my gullet like wet concrete in a posthole when the boss who was a powerful and systematic eater took his last bite lifted up his head wiped off the lower half of his face with a napkin and said well it looks like jack and sugarboy and me are going to take the night air down the highway
lucy stark looked up at the boss right quick then looked away and straightened a salt shaker at first guess it might have been the look any wife gives her husband when he shoves back after supper and announces he thinks hell step down for a minute then you knew it wasnt that it didnt have any question or protest or rebuke or command or selfpity or whine or ohsoyou dontlovemeanymore in it it just didnt have anything in it and that was what made it remarkable it was a feat any act of pure perception is a feat and if you dont believe it try it sometime
but old man stark looked at the boss and said i sorta reckined–i reckined you was gonna stay out here tonight there wasnt any trouble figuring out what he said though the child come home and the parent puts the hooks in him the old man or the woman as the case may be hasnt got anything to say to the child all he wants is to have that child sit in a chair for a couple of hours and then go off to bed under the same roof its not love i am not saying that there is not such a thing as love i am merely pointing to something which is different from love but which sometimes goes by the name of love it may well be that without this thing which i am talking about there would not be any love but this thing in itself is not love it is just something in the blood it is a kind of blood greed and it is the fate of a man it is the thing which man has which
distinguishes him from the happy brute creation when you get born your father and mother lost something out of themselves and they are going to bust a hame trying to get it back and you are it they know they cant get it all back but they will get as big a chunk out of you as they can and the good old family reunion with picnic dinner under the maples is very much like diving into the octopus tank at the aquarium anyway that is what i would have said back then that evening
so old man stark swallowed his adams apple a couple of times and lifted his misty sad old blue eyes to the boss who happened to be flesh of his flesh though youd never guess it and threw in the hook but it didnt snag a thing not on willie
nope the boss said i gotta shove
i sorta reckined– the old man began the surrendered and tailed off but ifn its business–
it is not business the boss said it is pure pleasure at least im aiming for it to be before im
through then he laughed and got up from the table and gave his wife a smack of a kiss on the left cheek slapped his son on the shoulder in that awkward way fathers have of slapping their sons on the shoulder there is always a kind of apology in it and anybody even the boss who slapped tom stark on the shoulder had better apologize for he was an arrogant bastard and when his father that night slapped him on the shoulder he didnt even bother to look up then the boss said dont wait up and started out the door sugarboy and i followed that was the first news i had had that i was going to take the night air but it was all the warning you usually got from the boss i knew enough to know that
the boss already sitting up in the front by the drivers seat when i got to the cadillac so i got in the back and prepared my soul for the experience of being hurled from one side to the other when we hit the curves sugarboy crawled under the wheel and touched the starter and began to make a sound like whwhwhwh– a sound like an owl tuning up off in the swamp at night if he had enough time and the spit held out he would ask where to but the boss didnt wait he said burdens landing
so that was it burdens landing well i ought to have guessed that
burdens landing is one hundred and thirty miles from mason city off to the southeast if you
multiply one hundred and thirty by two it makes two hundred and sixty miles it was near nine oclock and the stars were out and the ground mist was beginning to show in low places god knew what time it would be when we got back to bed and up the next morning to face a hearty breakfast and the ride back to the capital
i lay back in the seat and closed my eyes the gravel sprayed on the undersides of the fenders and then it stopped spraying and the tail of the car lurched to one side and me with it and i knew we were back on the slab and leveling out for the job
we would go gusting along the slab which would be pale in the starlight between the patches of woods and the dark fields where the mist was rising way off from the road a barn would stick up out of the mist like a house sticking out of the rising water when the river breaks the levee close to the road a cow would stand kneedeep in the mist with horns damp enough to have a pearly shine in the starlight and it would look at the black blur we were as we went whirling into the blazing corridor of light which we could never quite get into for it would be always splitting the dark just in front of us the cow would stand there kneedeep in the mist and look at the black blur and the blaze and then not turning his head at the place where the black blur and blaze had been
￼￼with the remote massive unvindictive indifference of godallmighty or fate or me if i were standing there kneedeep in the mist and the blur and the blaze whizzed past and withered on off between the fields and the patches of woods
but i wasnt standing there in the field in the dark with the mist turning slow around my knees and the ticking nonoise of the night inside my head i was in a car headed back to burdens landing which was named for the people from whom i got my name and which was the place where i had been born and raised
we would go on between the fields until we hit a town the houses would be lined up along the streets under the trees with their light going out now until we hit the main street where the lights would be bright around the doorway of the movie house and the bugs would be zooming against the bulbs and would ricochet off to hit the concrete pavement and make a dry crunch when somebody stepped on them the men standing in front of the pool hall would look up and see the big black crate ghost down the street and one of them would spit on the concrete and say the bastard he reckins hes somebody and wish that he was in a big black car as big as a hearse and the springs soft as mammas breast and the engine breathing without a rustle at seventyfive going off into the dark somewhere well i was going somewhere i was going back to burdens landing
we would come into burdens landing by the new boulevard by the bay the air would smell salty with maybe a taint of the fishy sad sweet smell of the tidelands to it but fresh nevertheless i would be nearly midnight then and the light would be off in the three blocks of downtown the beyond the downtown and the little houses there would be other houses along the bay set back in the magnolias and oaks with the white walls showing glimmeringly beyond the darkness of the trees and the jalousies which in the daytime would be green looking dark against the white walls folks would be lying back in the rooms behind the jalousies with nothing but a sheet over them well id put in a good many nights behind those jalousies from the time i was little enough to wet the bed id been born in one of these rooms behind the jalousies and behind one set of them my mother would be lying up there tonight with a little fluting of lace on the straps of her nightgown and her face smooth like a girls except for the little lines which you wouldnt be able to make out in the shadow anyway at the corners of her mouth and eyes and one bare arm laid out on the sheet with the sharp brittlelooking agebetraying hand showing the painted nails theodore murrell would be lying there too breathing with a slightly adenoidal sibilance under his beautiful blonde mustache well it was all legal for she was married to theodore murrell who was a lot younger than my mother and who had beautiful yellow hair scrolled on top of his round skull like taffy and who was my stepfather well he wasnt the first the first stepfather i had had
then on down the row behind its own live oaks and magnolias there would be the stanton house locked up and nobody behind the jalousies for anne and adam were in town now and grown up and never went fishing with me anymore and the old man was dead then on down the row where the open country began would be the house of judge irwin we wouldnt stop before we got there but wed make a little call on the judge
boss i said
the boss turned around and saw the chunky black shape of his head against the brightness of
our headlights
what you gonna say to him i asked
boy you never know till the time comes he said hell he amended maybe i wont say anything to him atall i dont know as ive got anything to say to him i just want to look at him good
the judge wont scare easy i said no i didnt reckon the judge would scare easy thinking of
the straight back of the man who used to swing off the saddle and drop the bridle over a paling on the stanton fence and walk up the shell walk to the veranda with his panama in his hand and the coarse darkred hair bristling off his high skull like a mane and the hooked red nose jutting off his face and the yellow irises of his eyes bright and hardlooking as topaz that was nearly twenty years before all right and maybe the back wasnt as straight now as it had been then a thing like that happens so slowly you dont notice it and maybe the yellow were a little bleary lately but i still didnt reckon the judge would scare easy that was one thing on which i figured i could bet he wouldnt scare if he did it was going to be a disappointment to me
no i dont count on him scaring easy the boss said i just want to look at him
well god damn it i popped out and came up off my shoulder blades before i knew it
youre crazy to think you can scare him
take it easy the boss said and laughed i couldnt see his face it was just a black blob against
the glare of the headlights with the laugh coming out of it
i just want to look at him the boss said like i told you
well you sure picked a hell of a time and a hell of a long way to go look at him i said not feeling anything but peevish now and falling back on my shoulder blades where i belonged why dont you get him to see you in town sometime
sometime aint ever now the boss said
its a hell of a thing i said for you to be doing
so you think its beneath my dignity huh the boss asked well youre governor they tell me
yeah im governor jack and the trouble with governors is they think they got to keep their dignity but listen here there aint anything worth doing a man can do and keep his dignity can you figure out a single thing you really pleasegod like to do you can do and keep your dignity the human frame just aint built that way
all right i said
and when i get to be president if i want to see somebody im gonna right out and see em sure i said in the middle of the night but when you do i hope you leave me at home to get a
nights sleep maybe
the hell i will he said when im president im gonna take you with me im gonna keep you
and sugarboy right in the white house so i can have you all handy sugarboy can have him a pistol range in the back hall and a brace of republican congressmen to be caddy for him and set up the tin cans and you can bring your girls right in the big front door and theres gonna be a member of the cabinet to hold their coats and pick up hair pins after em theres gonna be a special member of the cabinet to do it hes gonna be the secretary of the bedchamber of jack burden and he will keep the telephone numbers straight and send back any little pink silk articles to the right address when they happen to get left behind tints got the build so im gonna get him a little operation and put flowing silk pants on him and a turban and give him a tin scimitar like he was a high grand shriner or something and he can sit on a tuffet outside your door and be the secretary of the bedchamber and how you like that boy huh and he reached back over the back of the front seat and slapped me on the knee he had to reach a long way back for it was a long way from the front seat of the cadillac to my knee even if i was lying on my shoulder blades
￼￼you will go down in history i said
boy wouldnt i and he started to laugh he turned round to watch the litup road and kept on laughing
then we hit a little town and beyond it a filling station and lunch stand sugarboy got some gas and brought the boss and me a couple of cokes then we went on
the boss didnt say another word till we hit burdens landing all he said then was jack you tell sugarboy how to find the house its your pals live down here
yes my pals lived down there or had lived down there adam and anne stanton had lived down there in the white house where their widowed father the governor lived they had been my friends anne and adam adam and i had fished and sailed all over that end of the gulf of mexico and anne who was bigeyed and quietfaced and thin had been with us close and never saying a word and adam and i had hunted and camped all over the country and anne had been there a thinlegged little girl about four years younger than we were and we had sat by the fire in the stanton house–or in my house–and had played with toys or read books while anne sat there then after a long time anne wasnt a little girl any more she was a big girl and i was so much in love with her that i lived in a dream in that dream my heart seemed to be ready to burst for it seemed that the whole world was inside it swelling to get out and the world but that summer came to an end time passed and nothing happened that we had felt so certain at one time would happen so now anne was an old maid living in the city and even if she did look pretty good yet and wore clothes that didnt hurt her any her laugh was getting brittle and there was a drawn look on her face as though she were trying to remember something what was anne trying to remember well i didnt have to try to remember i could remember but i didnt want to remember if the human race didnt remember anything it would be perfectly happy i was student of history once in a university and if i learned anything from studying history that was what i learned or to be more exact that was what i thought i had learned
we would go down the row–the line of houses facing the bay–and that was the place where all my pals had been anne who was an old maid or damned near it adam who was a famous surgeon and who was nice to me but didnt go fishing with me any more and judge irwin who lived in the last house and who had been a friend of my family and who used to take me hunting with him and taught me to shoot and taught me to ride and read history to me from leatherbound books in the big study in his house after ellis burden went away he was more of a father to me than those men who had married my mother and come to live in ellis burdens house and the judge was a man
so i told sugarboy how to get through town and to the row where all my pals lived or had lived we pulled through the town where the lights were out except for the bulbs hanging from the telephone poles and on out the bay road where the houses were bonewhite back among the magnolias and live oaks
at night you pass through a little town where you once lived and you expect to see yourself wearing knee pants standing all alone on the street corner under the hanging bulbs where the bugs bang on the tin reflectors and splatter to the pavement to lie stunned you expect to see that boy standing there under the street lamp out too late and you feel like telling he ought to go on home to bed or there will be hell to pay but maybe you are home in bed and sound asleep and not dreaming and nothing has ever happened that seem to have happened but then who the hell is this in the back seat of the big black cadillac that comes ghosting through the town why this is
￼jack burden dont you remember little jack burden he used to go out in his boat in the afternoon on the bay to fish and come home and eat his supper and kiss his beautiful mother good night and say his prayers and go to bed at ninethirty oh you mean old ellis burdens boy yeah and that woman he married out of texas–or was it arkansas–that bigeyed thinfaced woman who lives up there in that old burden place now with that man she got herself what ever happened to ellis burden hell i dont know nobody around here had any word going on years he was a queer un damn if he wasnt queer going off and leaving a real looker like that woman out of arkansas maybe he couldnt give her what she craved well he give her that boy that jack burden yeah
you come into the town at night and there are the voices
we had got to the end of the row and i saw the house bonewhite back among the dark oak
boughs
here it is i said
park out here the boss said and then to me theres a light the bugger aint in bed you go
on and knock on the door and tell him i want to see him
suppose he wont open up
he will the boss said but if he wont you make him what the hell do i pay you for
i got out of the car and went in the gate and started up the shell walk under the black trees then
i heard the boss coming after me we went up the walk with him just behind me and up the gallery steps
the boss stood to one side and i pulled open the screen and knocked on the door i knocked again then looking in through the glass by the door i saw a door open off the hall–where the library was i remembered–then a side light come on in the hall he was coming to the door i could see him through the glass while he fumbled with the lock
yes he asked
good evening judge i said
he stood there blinking into the dark outside trying to make out my face its jack burden i said
well well jack–well ill be jiggered and he put out his hand come in he even looked glad to see me
i shook hands and stepped inside where the mirrors in the peeling gold frames glimmered on the walls in the rays of the not bright side light and the glass of the big hurricane lamps glimmered on the marbletop stands
what can i do for you jack he asked me and gave me a look out of his yellow eyes they hadnt changed much even if the rest of him had
well i began and didnt know how i was going to end i just wanted to see if you were up and could talk to–
sure jack come on in you arent in any trouble son let me shut the door first and–
he turned to shut the door and if his ticker hadnt been in good shape for all his near three scores and ten hed have dropped dead for the boss was standing there in the door he hadnt
made a sound
as it was the judge didnt drop dead and his face didnt show a thing but i felt him stiffen
you turn to shut a door some night and find somebody standing there out of the dark and youll take a jump too
￼￼￼no the boss said easy and grinning taking his hat off his head and stepping inside just as though hed been invited which he hadnt been no jack isnt in any trouble not that i know of nor me either
the judge was looking at me now i beg your pardon he said to me in a voice he knew how to make cold and rasping like an old phonograph needle scraping on an old record i had forgotten for the moment how well your needs are provided for
oh jacks making out the boss said
and you sir– the judge turned on the boss and slanted his yellow eyes down on him–for he
was a half a head taller–and i could see the jaw muscles twitch and knot under the folds of red rusty and seamed skin on his long jaw do you wish to say something to me
well i dont know as i do the boss remarked offhand not at the moment
well the judge said in that case–
oh something might develop the boss broke in you never can tell if we get the weight off
our arches
in that case the judge resumed and it was an old needle and an old record and it was scraping
like a file on cold tin and nothing human i may say that i was about to retire
oh its early yet the boss said and took his time giving judge irwin the onceover from head to toe the judge was wearing an oldfashioned velvet smoking jacket and tuxedo pants and a boiled shirt but he had taken off his collar and tie and the collar button was shining just under the big old red adams apple yeah the boss went on after hed finished the onceover and youll
sleep better if you wait before going to bed and give that fine dinner you had a chance to digest and he just began walking down the hall toward the door where the light was the door to the
library
judge irwin looked at the bosss back as the boss just walked away the palm beach coat all
crumpled up where it had crawled on the bosss shoulders and the old sweatstains of the afternoon showing dark at the armpits the judges yellow eyes were near to popping out of his face and the blood was up in his face till it was the color of calfs liver in a butcher shop then he began to walk down the hall after the boss
i followed the pair of them
the boss was already sitting in a big old scuffed leather easy chair when i went in i stood there against the wall under the bookshelves that went up to the ceiling full of old leather books a lot of them law books that got lost in the shadows up above and made the room smell musty like old cheese well the room hadnt changed any i could remember that smell from the long afternoons i had spent in that room reading by myself or hearing the judges voice reading to me while a log crackled on the hearth and the clock in the corner a big grandfathers clock in the corner a big grandfathers clock offered us the slow small individual pellets of time it was the same room there were the big steel engravings on the wall–by piranesi in the heavy scrollwork frames the tiber the colosseum some ruined temple and the riding crops on the mantel and on the desk and the silver cups the judges dogs had won in the field trials and the judge had won shooting the gun rack over in the shadow by the door was out of the light from the big brass reading on the desk but i knew every gun in it and knew the guns feel
the judge didnt sit down he stood in the middle of the floor and looked down at the boss who had his legs stuck out on the red carpet and the judge didnt say anything something was going on inside his head you knew that if he had a little glass window in the side of that tall skull where ￼￼the onetime thick darkred manelike hair was thinned out now and faded you could see inside and see the wheels and springs and cogs and ratchets working away and shining like a beautiful lot of wellkept mechanism but maybe somebody had pushed the wrong button maybe it was just going to run on and on till something cracked or the spring ran down and nothing was going to happen
but the boss said something he jerked his head sideways to indicate the silver tray with the bottle and the pitcher of water and a silver bowl and two used glasses and three or four clean ones which sat on the desk and said judge i trust you dont mind jack pouring me a slug you know southern hospitality
judge irwin didnt answer him he turned to me and i said i didnt realize jack that your duties included those of a body servant but of course if i am mistaken–
i could have slapped his face i could have slapped that goddamned handsome eaglebeaked strongboned rubiginoushided high old face in which the eyes werent old but were hard and bright without any depth to them and were an insult to look into and the boss laughed and i could have slapped his goddamned face i could have walked right out and felt the two of them there alone in that cheesesmelling room together till hell froze over and just kept on walking but i didnt and perhaps it was just as well for maybe you cannot ever really walk away from the things you want most to walk away from
oh nuts the boss said and stopped laughing and heaved himself up out of the leather chair and made a pass at the bottle and sloshed out some whisky into a glass and poured in some water then he turned round and grinning up to the judge stepped toward me and held out the glass here jack he said have a drink
i cant say that i took the drink it got shoved into my hand and i stood there holding it not drinking it and watched the boss look up at the judge irwin and say sometimes jack pours me a drink and sometimes i pour him a drink and– he stepped toward the desk again–sometimes i pour myself a drink
he poured the drink added water and looked again at the judge leering with a kind of comic cunning whether im asked or not he said and added theres lots of things you never get judge if you wait till you are asked and i am an impatient man i am a very impatient man judge that is why i am not a gentleman judge
really replied the judge he stood in the middle of the floor and studied the scene beneath him
from my spot by the wall i looked at both of them to hell with them i thought to hell with both of them when they talked like that it was to hell with both of them
yeah the boss was saying youre a gent and so you dont ever get impatient not even for your likker you arent even impatient for your drink right now and its likker your money paid for but youll get a drink judge im asking you to have one have a drink with me judge
judge irwin didnt answer a word he stood very erect in the middle of the floor
aw have a drink the boss said and laughed and sat again in the big chair and stuck out his
legs on the red carpet
the judge didnt pour himself a drink and he didnt sit down
the boss looked up at him from the chair and said judge you happen to have an evening paper round here
the paper was lying over on another chair by the fireplace with the judges collar and tie on top
of it and his white jacket hung on the back of the chair i saw the judges eyes snap over there to it and then back at the boss
yes the judge said as a matter of fact i have
i havent had a chance to see one rushing around the country today mind if i take a look
not in the slightest judge irwin said and the sound was the file scraping on that cold tin again but perhaps i can relieve your curiosity on one point the paper publishes my endorsement of callahan for the senate nomination if that is of interest to you
just wanted to hear you say it judge somebody told me but you know how rumor hath a thousand tongues and how the newspaper boys tend to exaggeration and the truth aint in em
there was no exaggeration in this case the judge said just wanted to hear you say it with your own silver tongue
well youve heard it the judge said standing straight in the middle of the floor an in that case at your leisure– the judges face was the color of calfs liver again even if the word did come out cold and spaced–if you have finished your drink–
why thanks judge the boss said sweet as chess pie i reckon i will take another spot and he heaved himself in the direction of the bottle
he did his work and said thanks
when he was back in the leather chair with the fresh load in the glass he said yeah judge
ive heard you say it but i just wanted to hear you say something else are you sure you took it to the lord in prayer huh
i have settled the matter in my own mind the judge said
well if i recollect right– the boss ruminatively turned the glass in his hands–back in town
when we had our little talk you sort of felt my boy masters was all right
i made no commitment the judge said sharply i didnt make any commitment except to my
conscience
you been messing in politics a long time judge the boss said easy and– he took a drag
from the glass–so has your conscience
i beg your pardon the judge snapped
nuts the boss said and grinned but what got you off masters certain features of his career came to my attention
somebody dug up some dirt for you huh
if you choose to call it that the judge said
dirts a funny thing t he boss said come to think of it there aint a thing but dirt on this green gods globe except whats under water and thats dir too its dirt makes the grass grow a diamond aint a thing in the world but a piece of dirt that got awful hot and godamighty picked up a handful of dirt and blew on it and made you and me and george washington and mankind blessed in faculty and apprehension it all depends on what you do with the dirt that right
that doesnt alter the fact the judge said from way up there where his head was above the rays of the desk lamp that masters doesnt strike me as a responsible man
he better be responsible the boss said or ill break his goddamned neck thats the trouble masters would be responsible to you
its a fact the boss admitted ruefully lifting his face under the light and shaking his face in fatalistic sadness mastersd be responsible to me i cant help it but callahan–now take callahan–it sort of seems to me hes gonna be responsible to you and alta power and god knows ￼￼who else before hes through and whats the difference huh well–
well hell the boss popped straight up in the chair with that inner explosiveness he had when all of a sudden he would snatch a fly out of the air or whip his head at you and his eyes would snap open he popped up and his heels dug into the red carpet some of the liquor sloshed out of his glass onto his palm beach pants well ill tell you the difference judge i can deliver masters and you cant deliver callahan and thats a big difference
ill have to take my chance the judge said from way up there
chance and the boss laughed judge he said and quit laughing you havent got but one
chance you been guessing right in this state going on forty years you been sitting back here in this room and nigger boys been singlefooting in here bringing you toddies and you been guessing right you been sitting back here and grinning to yourself while the rest of em were out sweating on the stump and snapping their suspenders and when you wanted anything you just reached out and took it oh if you had a little time off from duck hunting and corporation law you might do a hitch as attorney general so you did or play at being a judge you been a judge a long time how it would feel not to be a judge any more
no man judge irwin said and stood up there straight in the middle of the floor has ever been able to intimidate me
well i never tried the boss said yet and im not trying now im going to give you a chance you say somebody gave you some dirt on masters well just suppose i gave you some dirt on callahan–oh dont interrupt keep your shirt on–and he held up his hand i havent been doing any digging but i might and if i went out in the barn lot and stuck my shovel in and brought you in some of the sweetsmelling and put it under the nose of your conscience then do you know what your conscience would tell you to do it would tell you to withdraw your endorsement of callahan and the newspaper boys would be over here thickern bluebottle flies on dead dog and you could tell em all about you and your conscience you wouldnt even have to back masters you and your conscience could just go off arm in arm and have a fine time telling each other how much you think of each other
i have endorsed callahan the judge said he didnt flicker
i maybe could give you the dirt the boss said speculatively callahans been playing around
for a long time and he who touches pitch shall be defiled and little boys just will walk barefoot in the cow pasture he looked up at judge irwins face squinting studying it cocking his own head to one side
the grandfathers clock in the corner of the room i suddenly realized wasnt getting any younger it would drop out a tick and the tick would land inside my head like a rock dropped in a well and the ripples would circle out and stop and the tick would sink down the dark for a piece of time which was no long or short and might not even be time there wouldnt be anything then the tock would drop down the well and the ripples would circle out and finish
the boss quit studying judge irwins face which didnt show anything he let himself sink in the chair shrugged his shoulders and lifted the glass up for a drink then he said suit yourself judge but you know there is another way to play it maybe somebody might give callahan a little shovelful on somebody else and callahan might grow a conscience all of a sudden and repudiate his endorser you know when this conscience business starts aint no telling where itll stop and
when you start the digging–
ill thank you sir– judge irwin took a step toward the big chair and his face wasnt the color
of calfs liver now–it was long past that and streaked white back from the base of the jutting nose–ill thank you sir to get out of that chair and get out of this house
the boss didnt lift his head off the leather he looked up at the judge sweet and trusting and then cocked his eyes over to me jack he said you were sure right the judge dont scare easy
get out the judge said not loud this time
those old bones dont move fast the boss murmured sadly but now i have tried to do my
bounden duty let me go then he drained his glass set it on the floor beside the chair and rose he stood in front of the judge looking up at him squinting again cocking his head to one side again like a farmer getting ready to buy a horse
i set my glass on the shelf of the bookcase behind me i discovered that i hadnt touched it not since the first sip well to hell with it i thought and let it stand some nigger boy would get it in the morning
then as though he had decided against buying the horse the boss shook his head and passed around the judge as though the judge werent a man at all or even a horse as though he were the corner of a house or a tree and headed for the hall door putting his feet down slow and easy on the red carpet no hurry
for a second or two the judge didnt even move his head then he swung round and watched the boss going toward the door and his eyes glittered up there in the shadow above the lamp
the boss laid his hand on the doorknob opened the door and then with his hand still on the knob he looked back well judge he said more in pain than wrath i go and if your conscience decides it could gag at callahan just let me know in of course– and he grinned–a reasonable time
then he looked over to me and said lets haul ass jack and started down toward the front door out of sight
before i could get into lower gear the judge swung his face in my direction and focused his eyes on me and his upper lip lifted under that nose to form a smile of somewhat massive irony and he said your employer is calling you mr burden
i dont use any ear trumpet yet i said and pulled off toward the door and thought to myself christ jack you talk like a snot christ you are a smart guy
i had just about made the door when he said im dining with your mother this week shall i tell her you still like your work
why wont he lay off i thought but he wouldnt and that lip lifted up again
so i said suit yourself judge but if i were you i wouldnt go around advertising this visit to anybody in case you changed your mind somebody might figure you had stooped to a low
political deal with the boss in the dark of night
and i went out the door and down the hall and out the hall door and left it open but let the
screen door slam
god damn him why hadnt he laid off me but he hadnt scared
we left the bay and lost the salt sad sweet fishy smell of the tidelands out of our nostrils we headed north again it was darker now the ground mist lay heavier on the fields and in the dips of the road the mist frayed out over the slab and blunted the headlights now and then a pair of eyes
￼￼would burn at us out of the dark ahead i knew that they were the eyes of a cow–a poor dear stoic old cow with a cud standing on the highway shoulder for there wasnt any stock law–but her eyes burned at us out of the dark as though her skull were full of blazing molten metal like blood and we could see inside the skull into that bloody hot brightness in that moment when the reflection was right before we picked up her shape which is so perfectly formed to be pelted with clods and knew what she was and knew that inside that unlovely knotty head there wasnt anything but a handful of coldly coagulated gray mess in which something slow happened as we went by we were something slow happening inside the cold brain of a cow thats what the cow would say if she were a brassbound idealist like little jackie burden
the boss said well jackie it looks like you got a job cut out for you and i said callahan
and he said nope irwin
and i said i dont reckon you will find anything on irwin
and he said you find it
we bored into the dark for another twenty miles and eighteen minutes the ectoplasmic fingers
of the mist reached out of the swamp threading out from the blackness of the cypresses to snag us but didnt have any luck a possum came out of the swamp and started across the road and might have made it too if sugarboy hadnt been too quick for him sugarboy just shaded the steering wheel delicately to the left just a fraction there wasnt even a jounce or twitch but something thumped against the underside of the left front fender and sugarboy said the bbb bbastud sugarboy could thread a needle with that cadillac
at about the end of that eighteen minutes and twenty miles i said but suppose i dont find anything before election day
the boss said to hell with election day i can deliver masters prepaid special handling but if it takes ten years you find it
we clocked off five miles more and i said but suppose there isnt anything to find and the boss said there is always something
and i said maybe not on the judge
and he said man is conceived in sin and born in corruption and he passeth from the stink of the didie to the stench of the shroud there is always something
two miles more and he said and make it stick
and that was all a good while ago and masters is dead now as dead as mackerel but the boss
was right and he went to the senate and callahan is not dead but he has wished he were no doubt for he used up his luck a long time back and being dead was not part of it and adam stanton is dead now too who used to go fishing with me and who lay on the sand in the hot sunshine with me and with anne stanton and judge irwin is dead who leaned toward me among the stems of the tall gray marsh grass in the gray damp wintry dawn and said you ought to have led that duck more jack you got to lead a duck son and the boss is dead who said to me and make it stick
little jackie made it stick all rightembed"
