verse 1
lord when i die pacify crucify me
i rock a devil cross ones for the soul ones for the body
if im built then god dies i wanna see god cry
real tears from a burned out life in ten years
i swore i got the devil in me with no fear
if i hear i cant see if i see i cant hear
its the eerie little thing between deathness and blindness
weakness and kindness rejects and primaz
im on this when im hollerin dear lord take me one of us
baby cause i aint really happy here can you blame me
this game done changed me made me an animal
i cant even laugh no more my kids smile for me now
