you put your best red dress on
and came here tonight all alone
he must have really hurt you bad
ordered up a double coke and rum
and hope itll turn into fun
he must have really hurt you bad

bridge
i dont know your story but it aint hard to see
youve got a heart thats broken as a heart can be

verse 2
its probably not like you at all
to mix loneliness and alcohol
he must have really hurt you bad
now its 1 am and here you are
with some stranger at the bar
he must have really hurt you bad

verse 3
across town in some motel room
hell try to heal your past
while the one thats lying next to you
is only there for laughs
he must have really hurt you bad

now im the joe that sees you up then cuts you off
and calls a cab when you need me to
and id like to say that only once in a while
i see someone going what youre going through

verse 5
well i need the tips but ill be all right
if i dont see you tomorrow night
stay home girl
he must have really hurt you bad
he must have really hurt you bad1embed"
