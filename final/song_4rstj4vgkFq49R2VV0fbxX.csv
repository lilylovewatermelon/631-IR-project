its these substandard motels on the lalalalala
corner of 4th and fremont street
appealing only cause theyre just that unappealing
any practiced catholic would cross themselves upon entering
the rooms have a hint of asbestos
and maybe just a dash of formaldehyde
and the habit of decomposing
right before your very lalalala eyes

chorus
along with the people inside
what a wonderful caricature of intimacy
inside what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

postchorus
tonights tenants range from a lawyer and a virgin
accessorizing with a rosary tucked inside her lingerie
shes getting a job at the firm come monday
the missus will stay with the cheating attorney
moonlighting aside she really needs his money
a wonderful caricature of intimacy
yeah yeah

verse 2
and not to mention the constable
and his proposition for that virgin
yes the one the lawyer met with on strictly business
as he said to the missus
well only hours before after he had left
she was fixing her face in a compact
there was a terrible crash
there was a terrible crash
between her and the badge
she spilled her purse and her bag
and held a purse of a different kind

along with the people inside
what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

there are no
raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
its sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
at the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
and a few more of your least favorite things

its sleeping with roaches and taking best guesses
at the shade of the sheets and before all the stains
and a few more of your least favorite things
