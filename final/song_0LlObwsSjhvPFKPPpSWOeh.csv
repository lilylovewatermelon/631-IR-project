verse 1 justin timberlake
i know you see me lookin girl go on and act right
a little closer let me see you in the spotlight
now turn around and let me see just what you curve like
go grab your friends and yall can come to the back ooh
why dont you take a sip up on this champagne
relax take your coat off and let me get your name
i love that hourglass shape you got up on that frame
i like the way you talk your game we might be one and the same
now i know you got a buzz off that alcohol
i got a house that can entertain all of yall
maybe later on ill give you a phone call
about to slide out but ill get back at ya ooh
and when i call dont give me the runaround
i aint gon have ya tryna play me like a silly clown
dont second guess it girl there aint nothin to think about
cause ya got me fiendin but girl ya dont hear me

verse 2 timbaland  justin timberlake
youre kinda cute baby are you new in town
my name is tim aka thomas crown
i heard youre lost do you know your way around
if you got a problem baby i can hold you now oh
i can be your navigator or your compass
better yet a genie baby make your first wish
you the party baby im just the guest list
i think i need some tylenol you got me restless
so grab your friends and lets take ya back to my hive
lets watch sex and the city or desperate housewives
simon says touch yours while you touch mine
parental discretion is advised oh
yall can be the star in my freaky spot light
studio 54 if we get the props right
all we need right now is a little bit of little bit of act right
yall lookin shy but yall act like yall dont hear me

verse 3 dj paul
yeah see girl you stronger then the strongest drug i ever had
you can mix em all together you still would be twice as bad
cause youre the worst best girlfriend i ever had
harder to kick than cigarettes and green bags
harder to escape than jail cells and bills
man you had me lost since the minute girl and pig tails
like michael jackson how you do me this way
got me cryin rivers like timbaland and timberlake yeah

verse 4 juicy j
they call me juicy j straight up out the three 6 mafia
ghetto fab player all these freaks im tryna holler at ya
quit playin games girl you got my head spinnin round
i aint gon chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town
i just wanna pick you up and take you to a wrestling match
is it good is it good and have a lil smack fest
so if you never call me ill be somewhere down in tennessee
washin away my sorrows in a cold cup of hennessy
chorus justin timberlake  timbaland
little lady lady lady
