i painted your room at midnight
so id know yesterday was over
i put all your books on the top shelf
even the one with the fourleaf clover
man im gettin older

verse 2
i took all your pictures off the wall
and wrapped them in a newspaper blanket
i havent slept in what seems like a century
and now i can barely breathe

chorus
just like a crow chasing the butterfly
dandelions lost in the summer sky
when you and i were gettin high as outer space
i never thought youd slip away
i guess i was just a little too late

verse 3
your words still serenade me
your lullabies wont let me sleep
ive never heard such a haunting melody
oh its killin me
you know i can barely breathe

just like a crow chasing the butterfly
dandelions lost in the summer sky
when you and i were gettin high as outer space
i never thought youd slip away
i guess i was just a little too late

just like a crow chasing the butterfly

i never thought youd slip away

chorus
