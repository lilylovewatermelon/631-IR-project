oh my god whats going on
this night got fuckin weird
drove so fast my brain got buzzed
and now im standin here
met so many faces that
will probably forget me
boy i bet i look so grown up
shirt tucked in my jeans

chorus ryan met
and now after it all i just really wanna call
my dad
my dad
i feel so broke up i wanna go home
no i feel so broke up i wanna go home

verse 2 ryan met
we went dancing on the roof
and took some girls uptown
they started fighting with my friend
and i cant find him now
hit some bars and saw some brawls
and found a house to sleep
forgot my retainer
could you not be mad at me

cause now after it all im just standing here to call
my dad
my dad
i feel so broke up i wanna go home

no i feel so broke up i wanna go home5embed"
