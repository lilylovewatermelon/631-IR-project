its all an illusion
theres too much confusion
its all an illusion
theres too much confusion

verse 1
down down down in your heart
find find find the secret
turn turn turn your head around
baby we can do it we can do it all right

prechorus
do you believe in love at first sight
its an illusion i dont care
do you believe i can make you feel better
too much confusion come on over here

i really i really wanna be with you
come on check it out with me
i hope you i hope you feel the same way too

verse 2
i searched i searched i searched my whole life
to find find find the secret
