look around look around at how lucky we are
to be alive right now
look around look around…

hamilton
how long have you known

eliza
a month or so

hamilton
eliza you should have told me

eliza
i wrote to the general a month ago

hamilton
no

eliza
i begged him to send you home

hamilton
you should have told me
you might also likeeliza
i’m not sorry

eliza  hamilton
i knew you’d fight
until the war was won
the war’s not done
but you deserve a chance to meet your son
look around look around at how lucky we are
to be alive right now

hamilton
will you relish being a poor man’s wife
unable to provide for your life

eliza
i relish being your wife
look around look around…
look at where you are
look at where you started
the fact that you’re alive is a miracle
just stay alive that would be enough
and if this child
shares a fraction of your smile
or a fragment of your mind look out world
that would be enough
i don’t pretend to know
the challenges you’re facing
the worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

but i’m not afraid
i know who i married
so long as you come home at the end of the day
that would be enough
we don’t need a legacy
we don’t need money
if i could grant you peace of mind
if you could let me inside your heart…
oh let me be a part of the narrative
in the story they will write someday
let this moment be the first chapter
where you decide to stay
and i could be enough
and we could be enough
that would be enough19embed"
