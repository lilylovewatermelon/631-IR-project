to this day when i hear that song
i see you standin there on that lawn
discount shades store bought tan
flip flops and cutoff jeans
somewhere between that setting sun
im on fire and born to run
you looked at me and i was done
and were were just getting started

verse 2
i was singin to you you were singin to me
i was so alive never been more free
fired up my daddys lighter and we sang
oohh
stayed there til they forced us out
and took the long way to your house
i can still hear the sound of you sayin dont go

chorus
when i think about you i think about 17
i think about my old jeep
i think about the stars in the sky
funny how a melody sounds like a memory
like the soundtrack to a july saturday night

see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likeverse 3
i bumped into you by happenstance
you probably wouldnt even know who i am
but if i whispered your name i bet thered still be a spark
back when i was gasoline
and this old tattoo had brand new ink
and we didnt care what your mom would think
about your name on my arm

verse 4
baby is it spring or is it summer
the guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
you hear sometimes late at night
on your radio
even though youre a million miles away
when you hear born in the usa
you relive those glory days
so long ago

chorus
when you think about me do you think about 17
do you think about my old jeep
think about the stars in the sky
funny how a melody sounds like a memory
like a soundtrack to a july saturday night
