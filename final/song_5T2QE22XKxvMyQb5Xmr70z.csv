have you been to jesus for the cleansing power
are you washed in the blood of the lamb
are you fully trusting in his grace this hour
are you washed in the blood of the lamb

chorus
are you washed in the blood
in the soulcleansing blood of the lamb
are your garments spotless are they white as snow
are you washed in the blood of the lamb

verse 2
lay aside the garments that are stained with sin
and be washed in the blood of the lamb
theres a fountain flowing for the soul unclean
o be washed in the blood of the lamb
