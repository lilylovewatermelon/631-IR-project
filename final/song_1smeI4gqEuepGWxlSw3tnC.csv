intro orlogin  cold crush brothers
call me
call me
oh my god oh my god

verse 1 raindrop walka
ayy another day waiting for death
every day that i waste on my list of regrets so i tell myself
its okay day after next well make all these arrangements to change—you can better yourself uhoh
i know im wasting my breath as i inhale
i know im escaping my death as i inhale
i i cant recall why im suffocating
my lungs are failing

how can i
forgive you
oh my god oh my god
verse 2 lil cut throat
step into the mind of a cut throat
empty streets cold weather all alone
blackness grey air just snow
feelings low being followed by crows
call list overflowed with hotlines
drug help mental uicide
feel tired feel dried and you wanna die
pride fried closed eyes and you start to cry
swear i spent a lifetime tryna get it right
still isolated still outta sight
keep my dreads swingin like they in a fight
i just wanna kill everyone in sight
take the money take the bitches take the drugs take the gold
baby let me decompose
never names said more shade spit
ima see you one day thats a promise
