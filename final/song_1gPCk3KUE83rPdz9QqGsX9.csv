corks off its on
the partys just begun
i promise this drink is my last one
i know i fucked up again
cause i lost my only friend
god forgive my sins

prechorus
dont leave me i
oh ill hate myself until i die

chorus
my heart would break without you
might not awake without you
been hurting low from living high for so long
im sorry and i love you
sing with me bell bottom blue
ill keep on searching for an answer cause i need you more than dope

postchorus
i need you more than dope
need you more than dope
need you more than dope
i need you more than dope

toast one last puff and two last regrets
three spirits and twelve lonely steps
up heavens stairway to gold
mine myself like coal
a mountain of his soul

prechorus
each day i cry
oh i feel so low from living high

chorus
my heart would break without you
might not awake without you
been hurting low from living high for so long
im sorry and i love you
sing with me bell bottom blue
ill keep on searching for an answer cause i need you more than dope

postchorus
i need you more than dope
i need you more than dope
i need you more than dope
i need you more than dope

i need you more
need you more
i need you more than dope39embed"
