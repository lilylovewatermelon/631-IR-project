no food to eat
all the moneys been wasted from last week
i cant even leave
so i sit in the basement making up rad beats
hot cup of tea
its four oclock in the middle of the night and i cant sleep
its all on the peak
so bad i can taste it while it eats me

chorus
how can i sleep if i dont have dreams
i just have nightmares
how can it be
i still believe something is out there

verse 2
some part of me
feels a little bit naked and empty
im stuck underneath
a few dirty old blankets to comfort me

chorus
how can i sleep if i dont have dreams
i just have nightmares
how can it be
i still believe something is out there
how can i sleep if i dont have dreams
i just have nightmares
how can it be
i still believe something is out there

and then theres a light
and i can see why im still alive
mommy wont lie
cause if she did i wouldve died
all the time i sit and try
you think id be tired
every night im sippin wine
ohh im staying up this time

chorus
how can i sleep if i dont have dreams
i just have nightmares
how can it be
i still believe something is out there
how can i sleep if i dont have dreams
i just have nightmares
how can it be
i still believe something is out there
something is out there31embed"
