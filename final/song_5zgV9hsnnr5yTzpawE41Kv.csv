i wanna tear it up before we tear it down
i wanna light it up before we burn it down
we gonna get fucked up drink till we all black out
so fucking start it up cause you know its going down

verse 1 funny man
tricked out swag yeah we keep it the same
mad dog dubdub in the back of the range

verse 2 charlie scene
girl youre so hot you could spark a match
and me and funny wanna flip you like an acrobat
and you can go back home in a cadillac
put my name in your phone its the man in black
you got a big ol mouth and an ass to match
youve got my back in a scrap and im a fan of that
we can go home and open up a can of that
ill put my prize in your box like cracker jacks
oh wait thats just me being shitfaced
lemme pull out my bluetooth and briefcase
and replace everything that i said wrong
but then it wont be a hollywood undead song
