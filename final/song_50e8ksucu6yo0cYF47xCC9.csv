sunday wake up give me a cigarette
last nights love affair is looking vulnerable in my bed
silk sheet blue dawn
colgate tongue warm

prechorus
wont you quit your crying i cant sleep
one minute im a little sweetheart
and next minute you are an absolute creep

chorus
weve got obsessions
i want to wipe out all the sad ideas
that come to me when i am holding you
weve got obsessions
all you ever think about are sick ideas
involving me involving you

verse 2
supermarket oh what packet of crackers to pick
theyre all the same one brand one name but really theyre not
look look just choose something quick
people are staring time tickerquicking skin is on fire
just choose something something something
pressure overwhelming
next minute i am turning out of the door
facing one week without food
a day a day when things things are pretty bad
but dont let it make you feel sad
the crackers were probably bad luck anyway
see marina liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeprechorus
cant let your cold heart be free
when you act like youve got an ocd

chorus
weve got obsessions
i wanna erase every nasty thought
that bugs me every day of every week
weve got obsessions
you never told me what it was that made you strong
and what it was that made you weak

interlude

chorus
weve got obsessions
i want to erase every nasty thought
that bugs me every day of every week
weve got obsessions
you never told me what it was that made you strong
and what it was that made you weak

postchorus
weve got obsessions
that made you weak made you weak
made you weak
weve got obsessions
made you weak made you weak made you
outro
sunday wake up give me a cigarette
last nights love affair is looking vulnerable again27embed"
