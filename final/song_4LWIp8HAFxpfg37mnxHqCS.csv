i promise that one day ill be around
ill keep you safe ill keep you sound
right now its pretty crazy
and i dont know how to stop or slow it down

and i cant stay
just let me hold you for a little longer now

take a piece of my heart
and make it all your own
so when we are apart
youll never be alone
youll never be alone
