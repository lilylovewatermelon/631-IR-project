walk out before you make it worse on yourself
nows not the time for that elegant laugh
daggers from the people once by your side
once by your side but now that is over
have to pick up
and just start again start again

verse 2
youve fallen to earth and youre collared in ice
but burning yourself aint no challenge to winter
gotta clip the lines and move for yourself
just move for yourself love
now that its over have to pick up
and just watch your back watch your back

chorus
and close your eyes to run
far far
trap doors to endless fields of young land
have we grown too tired on our land to fight

verse 3
look valentine if you want it to end
your life at this temperature life underwater
youve gotta let these fools all trample themselves
they trample themselves just dying to enter
youre preaching to the choir
so turn around turn around
you might also likechorus
and close your eyes to run
far far
trap doors to endless fields of young land
have we grown too tired on our land to fight

and close your eyes to run
far far
trap doors to endless fields of young land
have we grown too tired on our land to fightembed"
