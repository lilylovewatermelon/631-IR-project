sool we got one nigga

chorus
she dont care about my attitude cause my racks large
im just tryna put another foreign in my backyard
man i know that nigga pussy he just act hard
trust me you dont wanna see them boys in all black charge
hop out the whip and turn the shooter to a track star
im from where they hustle kill niggas and they crack cards
keep a pistol on me its too soon to spit my last bars
i know some niggas who left early but they had heart

verse 1
white folks starin like i dont belong
what about them nights i had to suffer
like they tryna make me feel insecure about my color
ever since i made a play been tryna educate my brothers
heaven aint the only way we can escape up out the gutter
and i been through so much that it be hard to say i love her
poppin all that ecstasy im still tryna recover
war ready i got lethal weapons like im danny glover
designer match my racks yeah im one stuntin motherfucker
im getting money but still hurting thats why im bipolar
i never gave up on my team put em on my shoulders
got ptsd from that battlefield im a soldier
in section 8 we was going through it and them nights got colder uh

verse 2
call up the plug just to help me with my challenges
keep tryna fight off all this depression that im battling
stressin while im dreamin i keep getting sleep paralysis
goated like im pac go from a gangster to an activist
all this medication shit might have me on dialysis
keep my hand firm on this grip this how we handle shit
got me sipping dussé it hurt to see them candles lit
screaming fuck the system swear im missin all my savages
i was brought up on that block but i hopped off the porch late
you would think its basketball season all these court dates
v12 engine pushtostart make the floors shake
hit bad bitches in my top ten like a sports play

chorus
she dont care about my attitude cause my racks large
im just tryna put another foreign in my backyard

trust me you dont wanna see them boys in all black charge

keep a pistol on me its too soon to spit my last bars
