my grandpa fought in world war ii
he was such a noble dude
i cant even finish school
missed my mom and left too soon
his dad was a fireman
who fought fires so violent
i think i bored my therapist
while playing him my violin

prechorus
oh my god thats so insane
oh my god thats such a shame
next to them my shit dont feel so grand
but i cant help myself from feeling bad
i kinda feel like two things can be sad one two three four

chorus
the worlds smallest violin
really needs an audience
so if i do not find somebody soon thats right thats right
ill blow up into smithereens
and spew my tiny symphony
just let me play my violin for you you you you
instrumental break

my grandpa fought in world war ii
and he was such a noble dude
man i feel like such a fool
i got so much left to prove
all my friends have vaping friends
theyrе so good at making friends
im so scared of caving in
is that entеrtaining yet

prechorus
oh my god thats so insane
oh my god thats such a shame
next to them my shit dont feel so grand
but i cant help myself from feeling bad
i kinda feel like two things can be sad one two three four

chorus
the worlds smallest violin
really needs an audience
so if i do not find somebody soon thats right thats right
ill blow up into smithereens
and spew my tiny symphony
just let me play my violin for you you you you

instrumental break
bridge
somewhere in the universe
somewhere someones got it worse
wish that made it easier
wish i didnt feel the hurt

chorus
the worlds smallest violin
really needs an audience
so if i do not find somebody soon

outro
ill blow up into smithereens
and spew my tiny symphony
all up and down a city street
while tryna put my mind at ease
like finishing this melody
this feels like a necessity
so this could be the death of me
or maybe just a better me
now come in with the timpanis
and take a shot of hennessy
i know im not there mentally
but you could be the remedy
so let me play my violin for you40embed"
