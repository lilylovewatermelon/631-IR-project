do you feel like youre alone will do you have a soulmate
somebody who challenges you
im talking about someone who opens up things for you—touches your soul
you cant give back to them you know
youll never have that kind of relationship in a world where
youre always afraid to take the first step
because all you see is every negative thing ten miles down the road
but you can do anything you want you are bound by nothing

verse 1 mac miller
yeah are you my soulmate
my angel what do you want with me
too high too high slow pace slow pace
my eyes closed your body all i see
i think youre too divine for my human mind
when im with you what do you do bring me to life
no matter what one day everyone dies oh oh oh woahoh
you think you a god til you run out of time oh oh oh woahoh
yeah said when youre gone gone what will you leave behind
yeah do i belong sometime soon where goes my mind oh oh oh woahoh

chorus mac miller with unknown woman
you the one to show me
divine love love love love love love love
where was you when i was lonely
my divine love love love love love love love
when the stereo plays our song sounds so clear
baby whered you go whats so wrong

yeah why do you stay on my case
i try to make you feel okay
do you know do you know im in pain
i give you clues you misconstrued
you continue to push me far away
why dont you call my name
its like you forgot my face
i just wanna taste of everything you made of
we aint nothing
cut the strings my balloon watch me fly
yeah said when are you comin through to free my mind
are you happy with your life
can i come and satisfy open up let me inside
when you take off all your clothes i am under your control
rollin up you get me high oh oh oh woahoh alright

chorus mac miller with unknown woman
you the one to show me
divine love love love love
where was you when i was lonely
my divine love love love love
when the stereo plays our song sounds so clear
baby whered you go whats so wrong
im right here22embed"
