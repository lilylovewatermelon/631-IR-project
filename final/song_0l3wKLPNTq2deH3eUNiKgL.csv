it aint no mystery im all i have left
im pushing back and runnin you over
ive been thrown down run around
beaten till i hit the ground
im telling you right now that its over
theres no room for mistakes all the parts are in place
say what you will but say it to my face
better back the fuck up better shut the fuck up
ill do what i want and ill never give up

prechorus
i wont be broken
i wont be tortured
i wont be beaten down
i have the answers
i take the pressure
i turn it all around

chorus
lift me up above this the flames and the ashes
lift me up and help me to fly away
lift me up above this
the broken the empty
lift me up and help me to fly away
lift me up

im gonna change history enlighten the world
teach em how to see through my eyes
im gonna lash back check that fatal as a heart attack
stomp out all the ugliest lies

ive had my fill now theres nothing but rage
best get out of my way
cause theres nothing to say
is that all that you got because i aint got all day

prechorus
i wont be broken
i wont be tortured
i wont be beaten down
i have the answers
i take the pressure
i turn it all around

chorus

lift me up and help me to fly away
lift me up above this
the broken the empty
lift me up and help me to fly away
