verse 1
cant help but notice how you glowing i can see in yo face
now i just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
swear i treat you like a queen you put me in his place
so you can give back his ring and the key to his place
tell the nigga one thing that you need your space
selling niggas one thing you dont need to chase
i wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist
hear the sounds that you make and get your knees to shake
holla at me in the a you feel you need to escape
i got a mansion and a gate you with me and you safe
a benz a phantom and a truck with 23s the case
600 gs in the safe how much cheese it take
this a chance you need to take aint no need to wait
say the word we can leave today this songs special
and it feel like fate hate to make a mistake
how the same thing making you sad making you stay

verse 2
can he touch it like that and make it feel like this
how i left and came back and its still like this
do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest
take advantage of what youre concealing in your dress
what he think he too fresh to show that you the best
compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect
give you sex til you sweat tongue kissing on your neck
its been awhile since she got it like this i bet
i can tell you aint just another bitch i met
aint nobody got me open like this not yet
you confused aint decided which way you should go yet
so how you keep saying no with your panties so wet
