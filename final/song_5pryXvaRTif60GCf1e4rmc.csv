in the dark and im right on the middle mark
im just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
and i watch from a distance seventeen
and im short of the others dreams of being golden and on top
its not what you painted in my head
theres so much there instead of all the colors that i saw

chorus
we all are living in a dream
but life aint what it seems
oh everythings a mess
and all these sorrows i have seen
they lead me to believe
that everythings a mess

postchorus
but i wanna dream
i wanna dream
leave me to dream

verse 2
in the eyes of a teenage crystallized
oh the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
and the cries from the strangers out at night
they dont keep us up at night
we have the curtains drawn and closed
see imagine dragons liveget tickets as low as 120you might also likechorus
we all are living in a dream
but life aint what it seems
oh everythings a mess
and all these sorrows i have seen
they lead me to believe
that everythings a mess

postchorus
but i wanna dream
i wanna dream
leave me to dream

bridge
i know all your reasons
to keep me from seeing
everything is actually a mess
but now i am leaving
all of us were only dreaming
everything is actually a mess

chorus
we all are living in a dream
but life aint what it seems
oh everythings a mess
and all these sorrows i have seen
they lead me to believe
that everythings a mess
postchorus
but i wanna dream
i wanna dream
leave me to dream
but i wanna dream
i wanna dream
leave me to dream56embed"
