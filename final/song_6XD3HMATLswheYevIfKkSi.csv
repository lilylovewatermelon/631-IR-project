no sir i aint been drinking
i aint even had one beer
this sweet things got me buzzin
from whispering in my ear
just take a peek up in here
at this little hot mess
mister youll understand
im doing my best

chorus
and i know im all over the road
i cant help but go
a little bit of left a little bit of right
its hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
when shes all over me im all outta control
all over the road

verse 3
dont wanna get no ticket
dont wanna cause no wreck
its hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
i say girl take it easy
she laughs says itll be fine
how am i supposed to keep it between the lines
see easton corbin liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likechorus
yeah i know im all over the road
i cant help but go
a little bit of left a little bit of right
its hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
when shes all over me im all outta control
and all over the road

bridge
something bout these wheels rolling
radio playing gets her going
im trying to get her home as fast as i can go

chorus
and i know im all over the road
i cant help but go
a little bit of left a little bit of right
its hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
have a little mercy on me
sir im sorry i know
im all over the road
all over the road
all over the road5embed"
