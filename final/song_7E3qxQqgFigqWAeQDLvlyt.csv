well im just people watching
the other people watching me
and were all people watching
the other people watching we

were as lonely as we want it to be
were all as lonely as we want it to be
just as lonely as we want it to be
im just you youre just me
its only true if we believe

verse
well there really aint no use in stopping
what nobody never told me not to do
so ill keep people watching watching me now
finding my way back to you

chorus
but were as lonely as we want it to be
were all as lonely as we want it to be
im just as lonely as i want it to be
im just you youre just me
its only true if we believe

bridge
i see so many feet going so many ways
people passing by they got nothing to say
all on our own just watching and confused
but if nobody told me what to do
i cant stop breaking all the rules
