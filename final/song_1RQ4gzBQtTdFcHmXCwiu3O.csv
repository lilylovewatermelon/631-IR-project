give me that breath which i can breathe
if there is nothing left in this life to satisfy
give me all that i need
if only i could find
a symbol or a sign
to let me know everythingâ€™s ok
i guess i finally found
a piece of solid ground
so let me know before you put me down
the life load the work load
what do you have to show
for this life for this life
what gets you going what
keeps your blood flowing
all i need is one song
to keep me moving on
keep me moving on
keep me moving on
what do we have what do we have what do we have
i said we got each otheryou might also likeembed"
