im in this fight and im swingin and my arms are gettin tired
im tryna beat this emptiness but im runnin out of time
im sinkin in the sand and i can barely stand
im lost in this dream i need you to hold me
im scared of lonely
i try to be patient but im hurtin deep inside
and i cant keep waitin i need comfort late at night
and i cant find my way wont you lead me home
cause im lost in this dream i need you to hold me
im scared of lonely

chorus
and im scared of bein the only
shadow i see along the wall of lonely
and im scared the only heartbeat
i hear beatin is my own of lonely
and im scared of being alone
i cant seem to breathe when i am lost in this dream
i need you to hold me
im scared of lonely
im scared of lonely

verse 2
i cry at night cause my babys too far to be by my side
to wipe away these tears of mine so i hold my pillow tight
to imagine you outstretch your hand lookin for mine
cause im lost in this dream i need you to hold me
im scared of lonely
