well i aint never been the barbie doll type
no i cant swig that sweet champagne
id rather drink beer all night
in a tavern
or in a honkytonk
or on a fourwheeldrive tailgate
oh ive got posters on my wall
of skynyrd kid and strait

prechorus
some people look down on me
but i dont give a rip
ill stand barefooted in my own front yard
with a baby on my hip

chorus 1
cause im a redneck woman
i aint no high class broad
im just a product of my raisin
i say hey yall and yeehaw
and i keep my christmas lights on
on my front porch all year long
and i know all the words to every charlie daniels song
so heres to all my sisters
out there keeping it country
let me get a big hell yeah from the redneck girls like me
hell yeah hell yeah

well their stuffs real nice
oh but i can buy the same damn thing
on a walmart shelf halfprice
and still look sexy sexy
just as sexy as those models on tv
no i dont need no designer tag
to make my man want me

you may think im trashy
a little too hard core
but in my neck of the woods
im just the girl next door

chorus 2
hey im a redneck woman
i aint no high class broad
im just a product of my raising
i say hey yall and yeehaw
and i keep my christmas lights on
on my front porch all year long
and i know all the words to every tanya tucker song
so heres to all my sisters
out there keeping it country
let me get a big hell yeah from the redneck girls like me
hell yeah hell yeah
