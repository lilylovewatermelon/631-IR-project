lay daggerdead inside a lonely bed
trying to hide the hole inside my head
watching the stars slide down to reach their end
cause sleep is not my friend

prechorus
drinking champagne to forget yesterday
cause i remember the way the way the way
it ended the day the day the day the day
that i walked away away away away

chorus
drinking champagne made by the angel
who goes by the name of glittering gabriel
drinking champagne made of an angels
tears and pain but i feel celestial

verse 2
elderly stars slide down the morning sky
slipping away to find a place to die
i wonder when the night will reach its end
cause sleep is not my friend

prechorus
drinking champagne meant for a wedding
toast to the bride a fairytale ending
drinking champagne a bottle to myself
savour the taste of fabricated wealth

drinking champagne made by the angel
who goes by the name of glittering gabriel
drinking champagne made of an angels
tears and pain but i feel celestial

chorus
drinking champagne made by the angel
who goes by the name of glittering gabriel

drinking champagne made of an angels
tears and pain but i feel celestial5embed"
