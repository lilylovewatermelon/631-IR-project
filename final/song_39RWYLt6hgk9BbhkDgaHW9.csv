cook that shit up quay

chorus
i cant fuck with shawty know she’ll tell
slim shit look like draya michele
i been goin crazy givin ’em hell
she aint tryna go with me ima pay her
i crush a lot baby girl im a player
connect the dots then i plug up the scale
if we get caught they gon give me the chair
fuck the law make em earn what they pay em

verse 1
aint no back and forth with no bitches this ain’t tennis
rolls royce truck bitch it ain’t rented
and they braggin ’bout bitches i promise we hit em
i flooded my wrist let the bros split a million
at this point im heartless i aint got no feelings
buy every building in the hood for my children
like a drake song got your vibe feelin’ groovy
with no phone we can make us a movie
i aint in my bag i still got my feet out
if we wanted smoke with yall you couldnt be out
free the bros buy my shit off the kiosk
im at the vibe with the spot this the creep house
lil shawty suck it like she just took her teeth out
five percent tint on the whip you cant see out
ready to set it off queen latifah
these niggas talk like bitches see what they be bout
you might also likechorus
i cant fuck with shawty know shell tell
slim shit look like draya michele
i been goin crazy givin em hell
she aint tryna go with me ima pay her
i crush a lot baby girl im a player
connect the dots then i plug up the scale
if we get caught they gon give me the chair
fuck the law make em earn what they pay em

verse 2
aint no complaining money coming in
put it all up do it all again
first you get a mil then its times ten
youngest out the crew amg benz
stand up like a man take it on the chin
they got consequences in this life of sin
laugh about it go in gucci spend a ten
when you come home we gon all win
go in any club and make it thunderstorm this shit reckless
he gon knock you off with his rollie on
drive the rolls royce like a hotbox really came from nothin
only ride with my security because i cant be armed
cant get caught with another gun
they gon know me when im gone
they hear my pain inside my songs
its like a switch i cut it on
pills kick in gettin in my zone
do my job aint see no wrong
im never talkin on them phones
feds gon try to do us wrong
man they got my nigga long
lately i just been alone
my cup my strap this microphone
nobody know whats goin on
just glad i made it off the road
granddaddy showed me life is a gamble
ever since i been on them dice
they gon suck it up like a bowl of rice
ima give it to them niggas every time
chorus
i cant fuck with shawty know shell tell
slim shit look like draya michele
i been goin crazy givin em hell
she aint tryna go with me ima pay her
i crush a lot baby girl im a player
connect the dots then i plug up the scale
if we get caught they gon give me the chair
