verse 1 lupe fiasco
my self portrait shows a man that the wealth tortured
selfabsorbed with his own selfforfeit
a shelf full of awards
worshiping the warships that set sail on my sea of life
when i see my old self i wonder if we still see alike
we was tight seeing lights speaking right and breathing life
now i see my demons and barely even sleep at night
i dont get high life keep me at a decent height
as the old me i predicted all my recent plights
exhausted trying to fall asleep lost inside my recent fights
burdens on my shoulders now burnin all my motives down
inspiration drying up motivation slowing down

verse 2 lupe fiasco
im begging me dont let me go we vow like the letter o
to never go our separate ways and spinoff into separate shows
tired of all the wardrobe changin playing all these extra roles
filled with all these different spirits livin off these separate souls
point in life is getting hollow cant wait for the exit hole
give me room the entry wound let me in and let me go
so i can roam around this wilderness
see it for what it really is unprepared and filterless
magnify the youth in me alibi the shootin spree
amplify the revolution sanitize the lunacy
strip away the justice justify the scrutiny
i can see the lasers shootin out of you and me

bridge lupe fiasco
sometimes i feel like the worldâ€”
sometimes i feel like the world
is against me
and everything that ive done before
i swear we used to be so pure
but we cant be in love no more
cause i dont wanna fight this war
but when i put down my gun
i turn around and pick up one
this uzi weighs a ton
but i think im done
