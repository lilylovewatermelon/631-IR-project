white gown hanging in the closet
black tuxedo that i never got to wear
no invitation sent out anywhere
we dont have any guest to fill the chairs
i believe we couldve been together in a past life
but right now were committed to the fast life
all were waiting for behind these chapel doors
is a crashing course to a bad divorce

verse 1
walking down the aisle to the organ
playing here comes the bridе as a warning
the reality set in
wе dont wanna do this anymore
cant go through with this no more
cold feet someone speak up
or forever hold your peace
stand up say it loud
hear the whispers in the crowd
somebody stop us now
before we say our vows
rice thrown in the air
family cheer and praise praise
droptop drives away
just married on our plates
before we get too far
and this ends the hard way way

just keep your white gown in the closet
and this black tuxedo that i never get to wear
no flower girl to walk with the ring bearer
no grooms and no raising glass in air

verse 2
well now i know well never know what happens
when our love just aint the same no more
theres only divorce were waiting for our time
when emotions run their course

chorus 3
white gown in the closet closet
and these rings that well never get to wear
bridesmaids wont catch bouquets in the air
train of garment wont be dragging down the stairs

outro
our love storys ended way too soon
youre supposed to love me to the tomb
hardly stood a chance to tell the truth
speak baby tell me that you knew
we came all this way to lose

interlude givēons mother
but what i did learn is
love will give you what you need
but also take what you dont appreciate
this is crazy
this is crazy
anyway umm
alright ima get off the phone cause
i got some crying to do
its happy tears though
love you2embed"
