i would climb any mountain
sail across a stormy sea
if thats what it takes me baby
to show you how much you mean to me
and i guess its just the woman in you
that brings out the man in me
i know i cant help myself
youre all in the world to me

chorus
it feels like the first time
it feels like the very first time
it feels like the first time
it feels like the very first time

verse 2
i have waited a lifetime
spent my time so foolishly
but now that ive found you
together well make history
and i know that its just the woman in you
that brings out the man in me
i know i cant help myself
youre all that my eyes can see
