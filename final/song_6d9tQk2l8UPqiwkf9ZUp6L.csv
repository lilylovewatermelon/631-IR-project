theres a hundred miles from you and i
and so many signs to forget you
and though i might be wrong
and though i write shit songs
i know it wont be long til i see you

chorus
sorry but i just cant stop liking you
i hope these other guys wont see you
oh so pretty like i do please dont break my heart
its hard enough to heal arteries without glue
ill see it through if youre down too
ill see you soon cause i miss you

verse
i might go too high though im typing all these typos
cause youre the sight i see when im falling off of my tightrope
and youre the life that flashes through my eyes when i will die
so i apologize its kinda hard for me to losе what i know
and i wont go too low but youre as far as pluto
a hundred sixtythree thousand six hundred yards from my homе
and i hope that you dont get bored of me or my clothes
im kinda broke but making dough from all the songs that i wrote

chorus
sorry but i just cant stop liking you
i hope these other guys wont see you
oh so pretty like i do please dont break my heart
its hard enough to heal arteries without glue
ill see it through if youre down too
ill see you soon cause i miss you
see boywithuke liveget tickets as low as 37you might also likebridge
i know it might seem childish writin all of these songs
ive wrote hundreds bout our love and stayin strong
though it wont be too long righting all of my wrongs
know im on my way if you think somethings off

chorus
sorry but i just cant stop liking you
i hope these other guys wont see you
oh so pretty like i do please dont break my heart
its hard enough to heal arteries without glue
ill see it through if youre down too
ill see you soon cause i miss you
