so many people are on a search to find
within their days for that place
within their minds to hide
and dump the load of this worldly life
and the things that it can make you feel and do
just to pass away your time

chorus

yes you will yeah yeah

verse 2
people have a tendency to think to themselves
that theyre the only ones
going through more things than anyone else
but ohoh i bet youll beg to differ
if you would just consider the much bigger picture
cause then you would see
that most people go through the same things that you do in life

but youll be alright yeah
cause if you can take it
you surely can make it
you youll be alright yeah oh yeah yeah
