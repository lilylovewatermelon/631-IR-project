well i saw you once
then i blew it for the next ten thousand days
shoulda packed away
i needed to go back and show you
i needed to go back  i know its wrong
ill have to get along

chorus
mama just called and said shes tucked away
mama just called and said shes tucked away another day
her mama just called and said shes tucked away
her mama just called and said shes extra sad today

verse 2
well i spent the whole day yesterday on cliches about love
makin me remember when your pushes became shoves
i wanted to go back and show you
i needed to go back i know its wrong
ill have to get along

chorus
mama just called and said shes tucked away
mama just called and said shes tucked away another day
her mama just called and said shes tucked away
her mama just called and said shes extra sad today
see the goo goo dolls liveget tickets as low as 59you might also likebridge
now whyd you go and play my trust
todays the same as yesterday
and im okay
i take a doctors recommended time to get along
since youve been gone
ill get along oh any way at all

outro
mama just called and said shes tucked away
mama just called and said shes tucked away another day
her mama just called and said shes tucked away
her mama just called said shes tucked away another day
tucked away
tucked away
tucked away
