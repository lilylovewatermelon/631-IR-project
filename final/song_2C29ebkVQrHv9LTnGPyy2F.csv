if you love somebody
put a light in the air
from the hood to the stakes
fry your finger in the air
flo rida up in here
wyclef up in here

chorus wyclef jean
if i could i would pull it up and rewind
to the time when it was just me and you
oh how we were inseparable
if i could id pull it up and rewind
to the time before you went away
wish i could go back to yesterday
if i could id pull it up and rewind

verse 1 flo rida
i try sticking to the rivers that im used to
but these tears got me searching for an inner tube
witness my homies life shorter than my inner lose
dont wanna drown in my hurt cause its critical
i pop champagne but still its a damn pain
beedee i love you my sister died but it never changed
my last love that we just ditched in my brain
give up the fortune and the fame to hear you say my name
the ghetto rough while the doff try purple rain
lord knows i wish death never had a name
our last breath that it never had a relevate
wyclef flo rida here to tell it man
to the left move hurt for suffering
i lose myself when i think about my peoples slain
if i could id rewind this whole thing
see flo rida liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likechorus wyclef jean
if i could i would pull it up and rewind
to the time when it was just me and you
oh how we were inseparable
if i could id pull it up and rewind
to the time before you went away
wish i could go back to yesterday
if i could id pull it up and rewind
so i sit down and i had try
are you living up in this life
i know if i could id pull it up and rewind

verse 2 flo rida
if i could take yesterday and place it in my palms
i anticipate the day like a school prom
promise tomorrow what you think til you lose some
big will i know heaven got the futon
face good with the man paid your dues done
whack your shows in japan with me getting drunk
we had plans plans change the new sun
the lord never leave us lonely when you lose one
if i could change the past my people wouldnt pass
i wish life was tivo and you could bring it back
i wish it all was remote and how the day be said
i were ip use it like its pixel flap
pull up the hood times pull up the good times
every day be forever when im puttin down
showing off thats the truth nah
chorus wyclef jean
if i could i would pull it up and rewind
to the time when it was just me and you
oh how we were inseparable
if i could id pull it up and rewind
to the time before you went away
wish i could go back to yesterday
if i could id pull it up and rewind
so i sit down and i had try
are you living up in this life
i know if i could id pull it up and rewind

verse 3 flo rida
if i had the gift be here id cure your mom from cancer
take the breena and stuck em up all with answers
take the crack feen turn her into the prom queen
have her graduate summa cum laude
but she so high that shes riding on drug assist
growing up like the women from the exorcist
her heart stopped in the ambulance

chorus wyclef jean
if i could i would pull it up and rewind
to the time when it was just me and you
oh how we were inseparable
if i could id pull it up and rewind
to the time before you went away
wish i could go back to yesterday
if i could id pull it up and rewind
so i sit down and i had try
are you living up in this life
i know if i could id pull it up and rewindembed"
