or tell me bout my past
my heart is yours to borrow
aint nothin meant to last

i aint lyin
i dont lie
without an alibi

dont ask too many questions
you dont want answers to
you dont like my direction
hell i wont follow you

i aint lyin
i dont lie
without an alibi

i told my dyin daddy that i had to run away
looked him in the eye
said there aint no other way
so woman if i tell you that i love you be okay

cause i aint lyin
i dont lie
without an alibi
you might also likei love you in the mornin and when the day is done
but if you want my freedom you know im bound to run

i aint lyin
i dont lie
without an alibi

i told my dyin daddy that i had to run away
looked him in the eye
said there aint no other way
so woman if i tell you that i love you be okay

cause i aint lyin
i dont lie
without an alibi3embed"
