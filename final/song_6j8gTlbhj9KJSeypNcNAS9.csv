let me know
do i still got time to grow
things aint always set in stone
that be known let me know
let me

chorus
seems like street lights glowing happen to be
just like moments passing in front of me
so i hopped in the cab and i paid my fare
see i know my destination but im just not there
all the street lights glowing happen to be
just like moments passing in front of me
so i hopped in the cab and i paid my fare
see i know my destination but im just not there

refrain
in the streets
in the streets
im just not there in the streets
im just not there
lifes just not fair

chorus
seems like street lights glowing happen to be
just like moments passing in front of me
so i hopped in the cab and i paid my fare
see i know my destination but im just not there
all the street lights glowing happen to be
just like moments passing in front of me
so i hopped in the cab and i paid my fare
see i know my destination but im just not there
all the street lights glowing happen to be
just like moments passing in front of me
so i hopped in the cab and i paid my fare
see i know my destination but im just not there
