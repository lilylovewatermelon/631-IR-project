i stand surrounded by the walls that once confined me
knowing ill be underneath them
when they crumble when they fall
with clarity my scars remind me
ash still simmers just under my skin

prechorus
difference smiles again
so much i hide
how is stepping back a move forward

chorus
now im forced to look behind
im forced to look at you
you wear a thousand faces
tell me tell mewhich is you
broken mirrors paint the floor
why cant you see the truth
you wear a thousand faces
tell me tell me which is you
tell me which is you

verse 2
eerily time made no change
pointing fingers laying blame
lying over and over and over and over
deceiving your mind
dug my grave trash my name
yet here i stand so you wont fade away
see creed liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likeprechorus
difference smiles again
so much i hide
how is stepping back a move forward

chorus
now im forced to look behind
im forced to look at you
you wear a thousand faces
tell me tell me which is you
broken mirrors paint the floor
why cant you see the truth
you wear a thousand faces
tell me tell me which is you
tell me which is you

bridge
i bleed inside
just let it out
just let it out

i bleed inside
just let it out
im going to let it out
just let it out
just let it out
let it die
chorus
now im forced to look behind
im forced to look at you
you wear a thousand faces
tell me tell me which is you
broken mirrors paint the floor
why cant you see the truth
you wear a thousand faces
tell me tell me which is you
tell me tell metell me tell me
tell me which is you

outro
you wear a thousand faces
tell me which is you
tell me which is youembed"
