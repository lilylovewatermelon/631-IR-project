the thriller
you might also likeverse 1 vincent price
darkness falls across the land
the midnight hour is close at hand
creatures crawl in search of blood
to terrorize your neighborhood
and whosoever shall be found
without the soul for getting down
must stand and face the hounds of hell
and rot inside a corpses shell

verse 2 vincent price
the demons squeal in sheer delight
its you they spy so plump so right
for though the groove is hard to beat
yet still you stand with frozen feet
you try to run you try to scream
but no more sun youll ever see
for evil reaches from the crypt
to crush you in its icy grip

verse 3 vincent price
the foulest stench is in the air
the funk of 40000 years
and grisly ghouls from every tomb
are closing in to seal your doom
and though you fight to stay alive
your body starts to shiver
for no mere mortal can resist
the evil of the thriller
