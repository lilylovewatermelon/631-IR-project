its not true
tell me i’ve been lied to
crying isnt like you ooh
what the hell did i do
never been the type to
let someone see right through ooh

chorus
maybe wont you take it back
say you were tryna make me laugh
and nothing has to change today
you didn’t mean to say i love you
i love you and i dont want to ooh

verse 2
up all night on another redeye
i wish we never learned to fly
maybe we should just try
to tell ourselves a good lie
didnt mean to make you cry

chorus
maybe wont you take it back
say you were tryna make me laugh
and nothing has to change today
you didnt mean to say i love you
i love you and i dont want to ooh
you might also likebridge
the smile that you gave me
even when you felt like dying

outro
we fall apart as it gets dark
im in your arms in central park
theres nothing you could do or say
i can’t escape the way i love you
i don’t want to but i love you ooh
ooh ooh
ooh ooh255embed"
