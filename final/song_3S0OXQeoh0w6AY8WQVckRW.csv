well you done done me in you bet i felt it
i tried to be chill but youre so hot that i melted
i fell right through the cracks
now im trying to get back

before the cool done run out
ill be giving it my bestest
nothings going to stop me but divine intervention
i reckon its again my turn to win some or learn some

chorus
but i wont hesitate no more no more
it cannot wait im yours

verse 2
well open up your mind and see like me
open up your plans and damn youre free
look into your heart and youll find
love love love love

listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
were just one big family
and its our godforsaken right to be
loved love love love loved

and i will nibble your ear

verse 3
ive been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
and bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
but my breath fogged up the glass
and so i drew a new face and i laughed

i guess what i be saying is there aint no better reason
to rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
its what we aim to do
our name is our virtue

chorus
but i wont hesitate no more no more
it cannot wait – im yours
outro
well open up your mind and see like me i wont hesitate
open up your plans and damn youre free no more no more
look into your heart and youll find it cannot wait
the sky is yours im sure
so please dont please dont please dont no need to complicate
theres no need to complicate our time is short
cause our time is short this is
this oh this oh this is our fate our fate
im yours135embed"
