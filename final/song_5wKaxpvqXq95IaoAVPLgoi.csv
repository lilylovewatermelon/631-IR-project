i can make anybody pretty
i can make you believe any lie
i can make you pick a fight
with somebody twice your size

verse 2
well ive been known to cause a few break ups
and ive been known to cause a few births
well i can make you new friends
or get you fired from work

chorus 1
and since the day i left milwaukee
lynchburg and bordeaux france
been making the bars
lots of big money
and helping white people dance

chorus 2
i got you in trouble in high school
but college now that was a ball
you had some of the best times
youll never remember with me
