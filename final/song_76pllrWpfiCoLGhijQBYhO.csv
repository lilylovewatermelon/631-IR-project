the other night dear as i lay sleeping
i dreamed i held you in my arms
when i awoke dear i was mistaken
so i bowed my head and i cried

chorus
you are my sunshine my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
youll never know dear how much i love you
please dont take my sunshine away

instrumental break

verse 2
ive always loved you and made you happy
and nothing else could come between
but now youve left me to love another
you have shattered all of my dreams

chorus
you are my sunshine my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are gray
youll never know dear how much i love you
please dont take my sunshine away
you might also likespoken outro
i always hated that third verse
laughter
it was a nice short version
do you wanna uh pick it up
its alright its good
we got a short version
it might have that other verse on it in another take
