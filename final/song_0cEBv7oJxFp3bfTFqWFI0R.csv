see i cant wake up
im living a nightmare
that keeps playing over again
locked in a room
so hung up on you
and youre cool with just being friends

prechorus ryan follese
left on the sidelines
stuck at a red light
waiting for my time
and i cant see

chorus ryan follese

touch me
tell me im your everything
the air you breathe
why dont you love me baby
open up your heart tonight
cause i could be all that you need oh
why dont you love me
