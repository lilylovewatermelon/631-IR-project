verse 1
its always something
its always something
i know youre running and we know hey
i feel my heartbeat
you tell me nothing
you tell me nothing in this town no

chorus
go where you wanna go
when you get there youll be wishing you were back home
oh go where you wanna go
because the sky is lifting and i cant stop drifting along

verse 2
im singing with a lifeline
you want a lifeline
im singing for you softly
and when you got me
i am gone you know

go where you wanna go
when you get there youll be wishing you were back home
oh go where you wanna go
because the sky is lifting and i cant stop drifting along
