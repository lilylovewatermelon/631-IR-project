old intuition on your dock were fishin
come on now give us a grade
a for effort and a b for delivery
c for devotion when the world starts encroaching on your plans
where is the savoir where is the savoir
hes not here right now
where is the savoir where is the savoirfaire

verse 1
embassy row the fumes they lay low
on lanes that are wide where the limousines glide
on the wroughtiron gates and the bone china plates
and dont forget your manners where the anthems play

chorus
in a netherworld of foreign feeds
in a netherworld of foreign feeds
in a netherworld of foreign feeds
im gonna take the crown im gonna take the crown
im gonna take the crown im gonna take a crown

verse 2
maids they are frisked and asses are kissed
i needed a visa i bought off a geezer
political favors could make you a savior
in an open corner where the news is late
you might also likechorus
in a netherworld of foreign feeds
in a netherworld of foreign feeds
in a netherworld of foreign feeds
im gonna take a crown im gonna take a crown
im gonna take a crown im gonna take a crown

verse 3
i need to get born i need to get dead
im sick of the forms im sick of being misread
by men in dashikis and their leftist weeklies
colonized wrath their shining new path
the converted castle of moorish design
if you want to stay the weekend well we wouldnt mind
the plots they are hatching the surface is scratching
in the open corner where the news is late

chorus
in a netherland of foreign beads
in a netherland of foreign beads
in a netherland of foreign beads
im gonna take you down im gonna take the crown
im gonna take the crown im gonna take a crown
im gonna take the crown im gonna take the crown
im gonna take the crown im gonna take a crownembed"
