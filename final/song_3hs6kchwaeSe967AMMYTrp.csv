im looking for a place to start
and everything feels so different now
just grab a hold of my hand
i will lead you through this wonderland
water up to my knees
but sharks are swimming in the sea
just follow my yellow light
and ignore all those big warning signs

verse 2 nanna  ragnar
somewhere deep in the dark
a howling beast hears us talk
i dare you to close your eyes
and see all the colors in disguise
running into the night
the earth is shaking and i see a light
the light is blinding my eyes
as the soft walls eat us alive
