once we start a riot we cant keep quiet
we want all the smoke fuck the peace signs
all gas no brakes we just gon keep slidin ayy
glock cook a nigga he get deepfried
snakes in the grass watch out for rats and all the feline
i cut everybody off keep hittin decline
i swear these painkillers got me on a deep vibe
miss the old days got me wishin i could rewind

verse 1
make sure my phone on dnd i keep my door closed
i been tryna put the rap game in a chokehold
diamonds vvss gucci cuban color rose gold
we got weed pills and lean by the boatload
dont stop at red lights we stuck in go mode
they killin kids wonder why the summer so cold
when your face pop up in my head all i can say is damn
dont try to test us in here like we dont ace exams
for one night she gon turn up to this song like its her favorite jam
and ill slide in that x7 fore i take the lam
critiquing all my movements type of shit that make me hate the gram
know im not perfect just accept me for the way i am

chorus
once we start a riot we cant keep quiet
we want all the smoke fuck the peace signs
all gas no brakes we just gon keep slidin ayy
glock cook a nigga he get deepfried
snakes in the grass watch out for rats and all the feline
i cut everybody off keep hittin decline
i swear these painkillers got me on a deep vibe
miss the old days got me wishin i could rewind

had to make some plays up in that field bitch we got tired of fumblin
hidin them lil shorties who stepped up like who gon slide or somethin
my niggas wont play they hawk shit down til you get tired of runnin
he tripped and fell they stood over him and that nine was dumpin
like taco night we leave them shells sittin inside your stomach
story the same you know the usual we die for nothin
i dressed up for too many funerals im tired of comin
made it out that shit but it left scars im still survivin from it
all them bad thoughts just tore me down feel like my mind was crumblin
i just want all this shit figured out i swear im tired of wonderin
just cause yall rep the same thang dont mean them guys a hundred
i come from starvin fightin cases now im flyin to london

chorus
once we start a riot we cant keep quiet
we want all the smoke fuck the peace signs
all gas no brakes we just gon keep slidin ayy
glock cook a nigga he get deepfried
snakes in the grass watch out for rats and all the feline
i cut everybody off keep hittin decline
i swear these painkillers got me on a deep vibe
miss the old days got me wishin i could rewind21embed"
