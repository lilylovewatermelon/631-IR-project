youve got the keys girl im just a rider
gas it up and get us outta here
put the pedal down i want to fly girl
crank it up and catch another gear
lets go to vegas hit california
or carolina where the southern breeze blows

chorus
you can take me to the moon and back
i can kick my boots off relax in your cadillac
baby take me anywhere you want to go
just dont take me down heartbreak road no
dont take me down heartbreak road

verse 2
baby you had me first time i saw you
i said where youre going take me there
oh girl im in now for the long haul
you can pick the place i dont care

chorus

verse 3
we can drive all night we dont need no plans
remember that youve got my heart in your hands
lets go to vegas hit california
or carolina where the southern breeze blows

i can kick off my boots and relax in your cadillac
you can take me anywhere you want to go
just dont take me down heartbreak road no

you can take me to the moon and back
i can kick my boots off
just lay back in your daddys cadillac babe
you can take me anywhere you want to go
just dont take me down heartbreak road no
just dont take me down heartbreak roadembed"
