so deddy could kick em off and let the mud dry on the porch
they wouldnt stay there long
before i had em inside on
going clickety clack and scratching up mamas floor

next morning hed say lainey bring em here
and id drag em from my room straight to his chair
hed put em on his feet
theyd always bunch up his jeans
well i made it my job to pull em back over the top

of those boots they walk right with the lord
those boots would only drive a ford
those boots made a damn good living
spun my mama all around the kitchen
those boots will never go out of style
one day theyll walk me down the aisle
i pray everyday one day i will
find a man to fill
those boots

yeah twenty years and a couple resoles later
he still makes the time for a combine ride with mama on them forty acres
and hes sure made it hard
to find that kind of heart
the kind that holds it all together
with all that love and leather

those boots would only drive a ford
those boots made a damn good living
spun my mama all around the kitchen
those boots will never go out of style
one day theyll walk me down the aisle
i pray everyday one day i will
find a man to fill
those boots

those beat up ole size tens
they aint nothing without him
but man when he steps in those boots

those boots they walk right with the lord
those boots would only drive a ford
those boots made a damn good living
spun my mama all around the kitchen
those boots will never go out of style
one day theyll walk me down the aisle
i pray everyday one day i will
find a man to fill
those boots
