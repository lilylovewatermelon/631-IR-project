ooh oohooh ooh
ooh oohooh ooh

verse 1
oh theres a river that winds on forever
im gonna see where it leads
oh theres a mountain that no man has mounted
im gonna stand on the peak
out theres a land that time dont command
wanna be the first to arrive
no time for ponderin why im awanderin
not while were both still alive

chorus
to the ends of the earth would you follow me
theres a world that was meant for our eyes to see
to the ends of the earth would you follow me
if you wont i must say my goodbyes to thee

refrain
ooh oohooh ooh
ooh oohooh ooh
ooh oohooh ooh

oh theres an island where all things are silent
im gonna whistle a tune
oh theres a desert that size cant be measured
im gonna count all the dunes

out theres a world that calls for me girl
headin out into the unknown
wayfarin strangers and all kinds of danger
please dont say im going alone

chorus
to the ends of the earth would you follow me
theres a world that was meant for our eyes to see
to the ends of the earth would you follow me
well if you wont i will say my goodbyes to thee

verse 3
i was aready to die for you baby
doesnt mean im ready to stay
what good is livin the life youve been given
if all you do is stand in one place

im on a river that winds on forever
follow til i get where im goin
maybe im headin to die but im still gonna try
i guess im goin alone
