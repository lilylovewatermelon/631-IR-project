not much to say when youre high above the muckymuck

interlude 1
now its time for me to tell you about young nastyman
archrival and nemesis of wonderboy
with powers comparable to wonderboy
what powers you ask
i dont know how about the power of flight
that do anything for ya
thats levitation holmes
how about the power to kill a yak
from 200 yards away
with mindbullets
thats telekinesis kyle
how about the power
to move you
