i know that youre hiding something from me
thats been close to your heart
and i felt it creepin up every day
baby right from the start
i know that look you give when were fighting fighting
were fighting fighting
cause i used to be the one who was lying lying
oh lying lying

chorus
oh is there someone else or not
cause i wanna keep you close
i dont wanna lose my spot
cause i need to know
if youre hurting him or youre hurting me
if i aint with you i dont wanna be
is there someone else or not
ooh or not

verse 2
i dont deservе someone loyal to me
dont you think i see
and i dont want to bе a prisoner to who i used to be
i swear i changed my ways for the better the better
cause i wanna be with you forever forever
