chorus
no matter which way it go
time flow as we come as we leave
we come back with another one theyll never know yeah

in disguise i cant take it
they say its gon get better
but it aint seeming like it it aint seeming like it
they say my problems gon get better yeah
but it aint seeming like it it aint seeming like it yeah

verse 1
youngin in the droptop
