hey hey i bet it must be nice chillin every day
not really doin shit a couple million in the bank
im workin all the time never gettin me a break
but fuck it thats fine not a minute go to waste
i just wanna be a legend every second i gotta be goin in
a part of me wanna chill but a part of me wanna win
no college payin my bills im sayin just what i feel
cause haters be lookin stupid when you just keepin it real
i got too much on my mind to care about the internet bullshit
or them people comin up say im forgettin who i am
just because they random dudes i went to school with
im cool with chillin with some buddha smoke
i always do it big like a jewish nose
cadillacs im tryna get a few of those
fuck stress everythingll be okay like

chorus
how did you know know
i was feelin so under the weather weather
this evenin
if you don’t mind mind
come rest your mind mind
i think its all gon be okay all gon be okay
and they say they love you love you but they kiddin
they say they bought your cd but they didnt
if you don’t mind mind
come rest your mind mind
i think its all gon be okay all gon be okay

do you believe in fairytales dreams come true
one day you gon make it
if they gave you a handout and you were down bad
would you take it
i found that bein famous in reality well it aint shit
cause you could have the world in the palm of your hand
but it dont mean a thing til you change it
listen baby ima be great now
we can watch a movie fuck it stay up late
ima make my way to the top every day i get closer
when i was young they told me to wait until im older
they turned a cold shoulder to me
and now they want tickets to my shows for the free
hey mac can i take a pic can i have an autograph
bitch suck my dick

chorus
how did you know know
i was feelin so under the weather weather
this evenin
if you don’t mind mind
come rest your mind mind
i think its all gon be okay all gon be okay
and they say they love you love you but they kiddin
they say they bought your cd but they didnt
if you don’t mind mind
come rest your mind mind
i think its all gon be okay all gon be okay
