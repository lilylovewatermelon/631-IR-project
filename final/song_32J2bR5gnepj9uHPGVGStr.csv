we were never the same are you outta your mind
i dont like strings no no ties
i dont wanna keep you dreamin you waste your time

you needed somethin to believe in
two hundred miles in the evening
super speeding are you leaving right now
when i pretend that im your boyfriend
ill pour the drinks so dont annoy me

cause ill be gone til the next when the suns up
blame it on me you can blame it on me
feelin your touch and im feelin so sweet ayy
blame it on me you can blame it on me
never turn back when im goin full speed woo
