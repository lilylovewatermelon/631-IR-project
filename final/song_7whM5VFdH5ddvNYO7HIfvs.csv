all those parties and games that all those people play
they tell me this is the place to be
all these beautiful people and nothing to see

sometimes i feel like something is gone here
something is wrong here i dont belong here
sometimes i feel like a stranger in town
and ive lost what ive found itll all turn around

in a little while ill be thinking about you
in a little while ill still be here without you
you never gave me a reason to doubt you
in a little while ill be thinking about you baby
ill be thinking about you baby

on the other side of a coin theres a face
theres a memory somewhere that i cant erase
and theres a place that ill find someday
but sometimes i feel like its slipping away

sometimes i feel like something is gone here
something is wrong here i dont belong here
sometimes i feel like a stranger in town
and ive lost what ive found itll all turn around

in a little while ill still be here without you
you never gave me a reason to doubt you
in a little while ill be thinking about you

some things are lost some left behind
some things are better left for someone else to find
maybe in time i can finally see
i just wonder wonder if you think about me

sometimes i feel like something is gone here
something is wrong here i dont belong here
sometimes i feel like a stranger in town
and ive lost what ive found itll all turn around yeah

in a little while ill be thinking about you
in a little while ill still be here without you
you never gave me a reason to doubt you
in a little while ill be thinking about you baby
ill be thinking about you baby

ill be thinking about you baby
ill be thinking about you baby baby babyembed"
