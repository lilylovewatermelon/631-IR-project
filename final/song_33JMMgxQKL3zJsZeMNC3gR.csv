nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
i am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you i dont know
maybe im just reading into it a little deeper than i should
we would make it easy we would take it slowly if only we could

spoken interlude
hey what are you doing out here youre thinking about everything arent you i know itâ€™s crazy just dont think of it like that nothing has to mean anything come on come back inside

verse
elodie look at me unless youre tryin to hurt me
heavy blow down i go now i just want to let go
is it right is it wrong i dont know
its not the cause im fightin for anymore but it sucks to keep on runnin
eventually there will be a time for clearer thinking
for now i weep cant get to sleep i try to hold a good feeling
i just get one here it comes there it goes
now we just might lose the fight yeah but its alright it wasnt our decision

chorus
nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
i am just here waiting for the perfect time to tell you that i know
every man is happy until happiness is suddenly a goal
ill just be here waiting til the doctor calls and then ill let you knowyou might also like22embed"
