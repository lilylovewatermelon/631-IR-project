a song for the deaf that is for you

verse 1 josh homme
nobodys coming down the hall
and nobody echoes in my head
broken reflection outta luck
nobody ever needed it

chorus josh homme mark lanegan josh homme  mark lanegan
i got what was
i want to take whats left ready now

verse 2 josh homme
beautiful senses are gone
canary in a gilded cage
singin
sweet soft and low
i will poison you all
come closer racin to your tongue

chorus josh homme mark lanegan josh homme  mark lanegan
i got what was
i want to take whats left
no talk will cure
whats lost or save whats left
for the deaf

the blind can go get fucked
lie beside the ditch
this halo round my neck
has torn out every stitch

guitar solo

verse 3 josh homme  mark lanegan
who are you hiding is it safe for the deaf
beautiful cancer infiltrate then forget
yeah i saw you coming and i heard not a thing
a mistake not to listen when i knew where youd been

i want to take whats left
no talk will cure
whats lost or save whats left
for the deaf
