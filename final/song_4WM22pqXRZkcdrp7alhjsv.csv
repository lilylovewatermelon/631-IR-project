verse 1
and theres always been laugh and cry and birth and die
and boys and girls with hearts that take and give and break
and heal and grow and recreate and raise and nurture
but then hurt at times

what will be will be and so it goes

verse 2
and there will always be stop and go and fast and slow
and action reaction asticks and stones and broken bones
those for peace and those for war and god bless these ones not those ones
but these ones make

and it always goes on and on and on and on and on
and on and on and on and on and on it goes
