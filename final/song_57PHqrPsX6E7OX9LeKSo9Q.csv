you were right
and you are gone
tonight
you were free
so alive
you were wrong
you were right

and you were down
you could see
and you wore hearts
for me
and you were sharp
sharp as knives
you were wrong
you were right

shot down said you never had the chance
took a ride on a suicide romance
could have sworn there was somebody home
to facilitate the great unknown
oh woman i aint going to meet you anywhere
dont know where im going yet
but i sure am getting there
see five for fighting liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeshotgun fire anybody home
i got two dimes in the telephone
alright
no its not easy tonight

shotgun fire anybody home
i got two dimes in the telephone
alright
no its not easy tonight

you were bound
you were free
you wear black
for me
you were dark
as dark as night
you were wrong
yet you were right

shot down said you never had the chance
took a ride on a suicide romance
could have sworn there was somebody home
to facilitate the great unknown
oh woman i aint going to meet you anywhere
dont know where im going yet no
but i sure am getting there
shotgun fire anybody home
i got two dimes in the telephone
alright
no its not easy tonight

shotgun fire anybody home
i got two dimes in the telephone
alright
no its not easy tonight

shes in over my head
and its not easy its not easy tonight

shes in over my head
and its not easy its not easy tonight

shotgun fire anybody home
i got two dimes in the telephone
alright
no its not easy tonight
