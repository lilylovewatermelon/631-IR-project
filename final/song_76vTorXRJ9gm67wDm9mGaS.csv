a neverending dream

verse 1
im waiting for the night drifting away
on the waves of my dreams to another day
im standing on a hill and beyond the clouds
the winds blowing still and catching my doubts
im hunting all the night the slave to my dream
an illustrated scene ascends in the steam
were playing fullofvice emotional games
im turning off my eyes and hiding my shame

chorus
a neverending dream a dream of you
i believe i received a sign of you
tonight i wanna hide my feelings too
as you do when i wanna be with you
a neverending dream a dream of you
i believe i received a sign of you
tonight i wanna hide my feelings too
as you do when i wanna be with you

verse 2
im waiting for the night drifting away
on the waves of my dreams to another day
im standing on a hill and beyond the clouds
the winds blowing still and catching my doubts
im watching all the flowers dying away
in heated breath of life at the dawning day
im waking up in spring and kissing your face
a sweet and burning thing i feel your embrace
