she held the world upon a string
but she didnt ever hold me
spun the stars on her fingernails
but it never made her happy
cause she couldnt ever have me
she said shed won the world at a carnival
but she could never win me
cause she couldnt ever catch me

prechorus brendon urie with ryan ross
i i know why
because when i look in her eyes i just see the sky
when i look in her eyes
well i just see the sky

chorus ryan ross
i dont love you im just passing the time
you could love me if i knew how to lie
but who could love me i am out of my mind
throwing a line out to sea to see if i can catch a dream

verse 2 brendon urie with ryan ross
the sun was always in her eyes
she didnt even see me
but that girl had so much love
shed wanna kiss you all the time
yeah shed wanna kiss you all the time
she said shed won the world at a carnival
but im sure i didnt ruin her
it just made her more interesting
im sure i didnt ruin her
just made her more interesting
