can anybody help me im outta plans
guess i left my world in somebodys hands
i dont like to hurt but but everyone gets weak
someone to rely on thats what i really need

prechorus
now here we stay its all that were worth
ive been through the pain and been dragged through the dirt
whatever they tell you were bigger than words
ive been where youre standing i know how it hurts
let this be a song now and this be a day
and we stand together well be okay
cause were survivors were making it work
expecting the best when they hope for the worst

chorus
one love this is the way we found
one love even though theyll let you down
one love nobodys perfect now
one love dont let that hold you down
one love lets stick together now
one love weve got to stand our ground
one love its easy to believe in
one love believe in you and me
one love
