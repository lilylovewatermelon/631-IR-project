street lights along the highway
throwin shadows in the dark
and the memories keep on turnin
to the rhythm of a broken heart

chorus
you only need a roof when its rainin
you only need a fire when its cold
you only need a drink when the whiskey
is the only thing that you have left to hold
sun comes up and goes back down
and fallin feels like flyin til you hit the ground
say the word and ill be there for you
baby i will be your parachute
parachute

verse 2
theres a song that i remember
i never learned to play
and a lifetime of forgotten words
i never got to say

chorus
you only need a roof when its rainin
you only need a fire when it’s cold
you only need a drink when the whiskey
is the only thing that you have left to hold
sun comes up and goes back down
and fallin feels like flyin til you hit the ground
say the word and i’ll be there for you
baby i will be your parachute
parachute

chorus
you only need a roof when its rainin
you only need a fire when its cold
you only need a drink when the whiskey
is the only thing that you have left to hold
sun comes up and goes back down
and fallin feels like flyin til you hit the ground
say the word and ill be there for you
baby i will be your
baby i will be your parachute
