dirt on your heels youve made a mess
down by the carpark high off your head
honey dont worry nobodys angry at any of this
darling be patient stare into the vacancy take a deep breath

verse 2
its like when youre tired youre someone else
dont speak for some time to find those words inside yourself
honey dont worry ill do your laundry covered in dirt
darling be patient its easy to break beneath the weight of the earth
and i said

chorus
always ill wait
for sharp glass when you break
ill be the light that you cant make
ill be your eyes you be my face
cause darling i get scared for you
and im not busy anyway

verse 3
today you looked older than me
hair in your face it fills the space between your teeth
and all of your falling has it got exhausting have you gotten sleep
you said you were sorry that you hadnt called me in over a week
and i said
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likechorus
always ill wait
for sharp glass when you break
ill be the light that you cant make
ill be your eyes you be my face
cause darling i get scared for you
and im not busy anyway

i hope i aint the last of what the world left you
a coat something you only wear in cold weather
i hope i aint the last of what the world left you
a coat something you only wear in cold weather
i hope i aint the last of what the world left you
a coat something you only wear in cold weather oh
and i hope i aint the last of what the world left you
a coat something you only wear in cold weather
you know better
and i said

chorus
always ill wait
for sharp glass when you break
ill be the light that you cant make
ill be your eyes youll be my face
darling i get scared for you
and im not busy anyway2embed"
