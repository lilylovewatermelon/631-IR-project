i cant wait to see your brilliant face
light up the room around the pillowcase
she said can you come over to my la place
i got something to tell you and it just cant wait

verse 2
when i showed up you held the door in tears
sat on the couch under the chandeliers
you said youre having a baby and before i could cry
youre leaving me just when i thought you were mine

prechorus
but i dont see your face
taken by the onehearted race
oh no dont tell your other man
i got a hell of a plan

chorus
failing lights amass one hundred sleepless nights
and i might be holding on too tight
but theres a beast in my heart and he wont let you leave alive

verse 3
nightmares no longer wait for sleep no
crawl on the ground on both your hands and knees
just like a lion and youre the queen of the pride
and we will feast together til the bones are gone
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likeprechorus
but i dont see your face oh no
taken by the one heartedrace
oh now dont tell your other man
heâ€™s not part of the plan

chorus
failing lights amass one hundred sleepless nights
and i might be holding on too tight
but theres a beast in my heart and he wont let you leave alive

bridge
do you still love me i am dying to know
or did you forget what we shared
out of sight out of mind i was never even there

chorus
failing lights amass one hundred sleepless nights
and i might be holding on too tight
but theres a beast in my heart and he wont let you leave alive

outro
this is the price youll pay
thoughts in your head that will never die
so dont you forget what we had
its like i was never even there
