well there’s a river that runs through glasgow
and it makes her but it breaks her
and takes her in two parts
and a current just like my blood flows
down from the hills
round aching bones to my restless heart

chorus
well i would swim but the river is so wide
and i’m scared i won’t make it to the other side
well god knows i’ve failed but he knows that i’ve tried
i long for something that’s safe and warm
but all i have is all that is gone
i’m as helpless and as hopeless as a feather on the clyde

verse 2
on one side all the lights glow
and the folks know and the kids go
where the music and the drinking starts
on the other side where no cars go
up to the hills that stand alone like my restless heart

chorus
well i would swim but the river is so wide
and i’m scared i won’t make it to the other side
well god knows i’ve failed but he knows that i’ve tried
i long for something that’s safe and warm
but all i have is all that is gone
i’m as helpless and as hopeless as a feather on the clyde

the sun sets late in glasgow
and the daylight and the city part
and i think of you in glasgow
cause you’re all that’s safe
you’re all that’s warm in my restless heart4embed"
