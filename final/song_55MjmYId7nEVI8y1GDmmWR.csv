uh huh wake up wake up wake up
dont wake up wake up wake up wake up
uh huh wake up wake up wake up wake up

verse 1
its naughty very naughty necrophilia
without a care im compassionate about killing her
id have my way with whats left of the will in her
cosmopolitans and cocaine and an occasional pill in her

when she spoke i saw a spark but it was dark so
i drove her home when she died sexy suicide
sweet nothings for the numb you feel where im coming from
have no fear everythings fine my girl parties all the time

did you hear what i said
with this ring i thee wed
a body in my bed
she was cool when i met her
but i think i like her better dead

verse 2
the production is progressive but the reason is retro
the chords are coldblooded murder i named it neonecro
i whispered in her ear to hear an echo echococo
i keep her its cheaper i love too much to let go
you might also likewe discussed over dinner how she would die before the day was done
so i caught her just in time to have a little fun
and you could use a little sun
so scream and holler run and play
wish you could die another day

im glad to say that ive
done what i could to revive
my softer side survived
damn that chick was all right when she was alive
ha ha haembed"
