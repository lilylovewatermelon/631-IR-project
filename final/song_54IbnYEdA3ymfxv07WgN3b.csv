im on a roll on my own i came to fight i came to fight

its your teeth in my neck your teeth in my neck

verse 2
some people worship diamonds and pearls silver and gold
just to hold it theyd give anything in the world
kill us all off theyd take our worth they pay us dirt
is it worth it is it worth it
