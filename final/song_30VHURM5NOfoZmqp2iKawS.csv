i was just coastin never really goin anywhere
caught up in a web i was gettin kinda used to stayin there
and out of the blue i fell for you

chorus 1
now youre lifting me up stead of holding me down
stealing my heart stead of stealing my crown
untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
i didnt know him and i didnt know me
cloud nine was always out of reach
now i remember what it feels like to fly
you give me butterflies

verse 2
kiss full of color makes me wonder where youve always been
i was hiding in doubt til you brought me out of my chrysalis
and i came out new
all because of you

chorus 1
and now youre lifting me up stead of holding me down
stealing my heart stead of stealing my crown
untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
i didnt know him and i didnt know me
cloud nine was always out of reach
now i remember what it feels like to fly
you give me butterflies yeah
you give me butterflies
ooh mmm mmm

now youre lifting me up stead of holding me down
youre taking my hand stead of taking my crown
untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
i didnt know him and i didnt know me
cloud nine was always out of reach
now i remember what it feels like to fly
you give me butterflies
you give me butterflies12embed"
