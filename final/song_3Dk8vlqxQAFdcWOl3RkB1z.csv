youre a fuckin poser
thats all youll ever be
dont get any closer
or youll meet the real me

i am who i am
you cant describe me
i am what i am
you cant deny me no

i want out
but i could never surrender
try and break me down
but i wont let you in
you can call me out
but i know youre a pretender
you may think youre god
but i know that im sin
im sin

hook
im sin
im sin
im sin

you are who you are
i cant explain it
you are what you are

chorus
i want out
but i could never surrender
try and break me down
but i wont let you in
you can call me out
but i know youre a pretender
you may think youre god
but i know that im sin
