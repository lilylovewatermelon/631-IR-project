verse 1 mac miller
sometimes i see the world for how fucked up it really is
i tell myself ill be the one to make a change in it
i could die tonight not make it to the sunrise
then i couldnt heal the pain in it
im gettin high to forget about the lows though
get a pay check spend it all on polo
designer brands cover up my insecurities
personally i aint nothin but an average joe though
now im dressin so expensive for no reason
cold world we livin in its below freezin
i got some fam who cant afford a coat
so i leave a little paper there before i go
spent a thousand on a hotel they poor and broke
made me wonder who im prayin to before the show
this a letter to whoever im just tryna set you free
remember love if you cant remember me

dear people on earth after i die
whats the weather like
one two three four
five six seven eight
and i aint perfect but i try
hey i wonder if ill maybe
get a second life
this time ima get it right

verse 2 mac miller
its either god or the devil with these drugs im on
i dont know if we were meant to see it all like this
still plantin seeds so my money long
money addict its a habit that palms gon itch
i wish we could just all get rich
sometimes not havin money is all i miss
and yeah these hoes are all up on my dick
the all american girl thats just a blonde hair bitch
am i supposed to have some thoughts like this
could we figure out what god mightve miss
its funny that these questions never get an answer
life a bitch sometimes you gotta reprimand her
never understand her why should i even try
live forever then youll never feel the need to die
this a letter open it to set you free
remember love and remember me
chorus mac miller
dear people on earth after i die
whats the weather like
one two three four
five six seven eight
and i aint perfect but i try
hey i wonder if ill maybe
get a second life
this time ima get it right

outro mac miller
what does it mean to be a sensation
do you have to be sensational
and how you know you made it
when youre with killa cam watchin paid in full i
never had good grades in school but
shock the world is what i came to do i
got a song i wanna play for you
so can you sing that back to me i said
what does it mean to be a sensation
do you have to be sensational
how you know you made it
when youre with killa cam watchin paid in full i
never had good grades in school but
shock the world is what i came to do i
got a song i wanna play for you
so can you sing that back to me8embed"
