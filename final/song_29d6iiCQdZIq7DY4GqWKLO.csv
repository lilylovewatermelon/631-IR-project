verse 1
when i need to spark a bit of inspiration
and the melody feels like its trapped inside
all i need is a little bit of illumination
so the rhythm can no longer run and hide
well i take a puff from the leaves of the devil
and it carries me onto the other side

chorus
fire it up
i like to fire it up and it feels so right
fire it up
cause when i fire it up i feel like serenity is mine

verse 2
when i need a little bit of relaxation
my medicine isnt too hard to find
when im looking for a bit of rejuvenation
i only partake of the finest kind
and then the mystery begins to unravel
and it helps me break through to the other side

chorus
fire it up
i like to fire it up and it feels so right
fire it up
cause when i fire it up i feel like serenity is mine
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likerefrain
fire it up
fire it up

chorus
fire it up fire it up
i like to fire it up and it feels so right
fire it up
cause when i fire it up i feel like serenity is mine6embed"
