your babys falling
you know im talking now
you know im dancing
you know im racing round
no no youre so juiced
you said youd kick the booze
you know ill get bruised
you know im just a boy

chorus
come back baby dont you cry
dont you drain those big blue eyes
ive been crawling
come back baby dont you cry
just you say the reason why
i can calm you

verse 2
you say im bawling
i say im begging while
you take my photo
i fake my breaking smile
im fucking loco
i cant get through to you
you turn your nose you
spark up and i can go

come back baby dont you cry
dont you drain those big blue eyes
ive been crawling
come back baby dont you cry
just you say the reason why
i can calm you28embed"
