she stoops to conquer or the mistakes of a night

a comedy





to samuel johnson lld

dear sir—by inscribing this slight performance to you i do not mean so much to compliment you as myself it may do me some honour to inform the public that i have lived many years in intimacy with you it may serve the interests of mankind also to inform them that the greatest wit may be found in a character without impairing the most unaffected piety

i have particularly reason to thank you for your partiality to this performance the undertaking a comedy not merely sentimental was very dangerous and mr colman who saw this piece in its various stages always thought it so however i ventured to trust it to the public and though it was necessarily delayed till late in the season i have every reason to be grateful

i am dear sir your most sincere friend and admirer

prologue

by david garrick esq

enter mr woodward dressed in black and holding a handkerchief to his eyes
excuse me sirs i pray—i cant yet speak—
im crying now—and have been all the week
tis not alone this mourning suit good masters
ive that within—for which there are no plasters
pray would you know the reason why im crying
the comic muse long sick is now adying
and if she goes my tears will never stop
for as a player i cant squeeze out one drop
i am undone thats all—shall lose my bread—
id rather but thats nothing—lose my head
when the sweet maid is laid upon the bier
shuter and i shall be chief mourners here
to her a mawkish drab of spurious breed
who deals in sentimentals will succeed
poor ned and i are dead to all intents
we can as soon speak greek as sentiments
both nervous grown to keep our spirits up
we now and then take down a hearty cup
what shall we do  if comedy forsake us
theyll turn us out and no one else will take us
but why cant i be moral—let me try—
my heart thus pressing—fixed my face and eye—
with a sententious look that nothing means
faces are blocks in sentimental scenes
thus i begin all is not gold that glitters
pleasure seems sweet but proves a glass of bitters
when ignorance enters folly is at hand
learning is better far than house and land
let not your virtue trip who trips may stumble
and virtue is not virtue if she tumble
i give it up—morals wont do for me
to make you laugh i must play tragedy
one hope remains—hearing the maid was ill
a doctor comes this night to show his skill
to cheer her heart and give your muscles motion
he in five draughts prepard presents a potion
a kind of magic charm—for be assurd
if you will swallow it the maid is curd
but desperate the doctor and her case is
if you reject the dose and make wry faces
this truth he boasts will boast it while he lives
no poisonous drugs are mixed in what he gives
should he succeed youll give him his degree
if not within he will receive no fee
the college you must his pretensions back
pronounce him regular or dub him quack

act the first

scene—a chamber in an oldfashioned house

enter mrs hardcastle and mr hardcastle

mrs hardcastle i vow mr hardcastle youre very particular is there a creature in the whole country but ourselves that does not take a trip to town now and then to rub off the rust a little theres the two miss hoggs and our neighbour mrs grigsby go to take a months polishing every winter

hardcastle ay and bring back vanity and affectation to last them the whole year i wonder why london cannot keep its own fools at home in my time the follies of the town crept slowly among us but now they travel faster than a stagecoach its fopperies come down not only as inside passengers but in the very basket

mrs hardcastle ay your times were fine times indeed you have been telling us of them for many a long year here we live in an old rumbling mansion that looks for all the world like an inn but that we never see company our best visitors are old mrs oddfish the curates wife and little cripplegate the lame dancingmaster and all our entertainment your old stories of prince eugene and the duke of marlborough i hate such oldfashioned trumpery

hardcastle and i love it i love everything thats old old friends old times old manners old books old wine and i believe dorothy taking her hand youll own i have been pretty fond of an old wife

mrs hardcastle lord mr hardcastle youre for ever at your dorothys and your old wifes you may be a darby but ill be no joan i promise you im not so old as youd make me by more than one good year add twenty to twenty and make money of that

hardcastle let me see twenty added to twenty makes just fifty and seven

mrs hardcastle its false mr hardcastle i was but twenty when i was brought to bed of tony that i had by mr lumpkin my first husband and hes not come to years of discretion yet

hardcastle nor ever will i dare answer for him ay you have taught him finely

mrs hardcastle no matter tony lumpkin has a good fortune my son is not to live by his learning i dont think a boy wants much learning to spend fifteen hundred a year

hardcastle learning quotha a mere composition of tricks and mischief

mrs hardcastle humour my dear nothing but humour come mr hardcastle you must allow the boy a little humour

hardcastle id sooner allow him a horsepond if burning the footmens shoes frightening the maids and worrying the kittens be humour he has it it was but yesterday he fastened my wig to the back of my chair and when i went to make a bow i popt my bald head in mrs frizzles face

mrs hardcastle and am i to blame the poor boy was always too sickly to do any good a school would be his death when he comes to be a little stronger who knows what a year or twos latin may do for him

hardcastle latin for him a cat and fiddle no no the alehouse and the stable are the only schools hell ever go to

mrs hardcastle well we must not snub the poor boy now for i believe we shant have him long among us anybody that looks in his face may see hes consumptive

hardcastle ay if growing too fat be one of the symptoms

mrs hardcastle he coughs sometimes

hardcastle yes when his liquor goes the wrong way

mrs hardcastle im actually afraid of his lungs

hardcastle and truly so am i for he sometimes whoops like a speaking trumpet—tony hallooing behind the scenes—o there he goes—a very consumptive figure truly

enter tony crossing the stage

mrs hardcastle tony where are you going my charmer wont you give papa and i a little of your company lovee

tony im in haste mother i cannot stay

mrs hardcastle you shant venture out this raw evening my dear you look most shockingly

tony i cant stay i tell you the three pigeons expects me down every moment theres some fun going forward

hardcastle ay the alehouse the old place i thought so

mrs hardcastle a low paltry set of fellows

tony not so low neither theres dick muggins the exciseman jack slang the horse doctor little aminadab that grinds the music box and tom twist that spins the pewter platter

mrs hardcastle pray my dear disappoint them for one night at least

tony as for disappointing them i should not so much mind but i cant abide to disappoint myself

mrs hardcastle detaining him you shant go

tony i will i tell you

mrs hardcastle i say you shant

tony well see which is strongest you or i exit hauling her out

hardcastle solus ay there goes a pair that only spoil each other but is not the whole age in a combination to drive sense and discretion out of doors theres my pretty darling kate the fashions of the times have almost infected her too by living a year or two in town she is as fond of gauze and french frippery as the best of them

enter miss hardcastle

hardcastle blessings on my pretty innocence drest out as usual my kate goodness what a quantity of superfluous silk hast thou got about thee girl i could never teach the fools of this age that the indigent world could be clothed out of the trimmings of the vain

miss hardcastle you know our agreement sir you allow me the morning to receive and pay visits and to dress in my own manner and in the evening i put on my housewifes dress to please you

hardcastle well remember i insist on the terms of our agreement and by the bye i believe i shall have occasion to try your obedience this very evening

miss hardcastle i protest sir i dont comprehend your meaning

hardcastle then to be plain with you kate i expect the young gentleman i have chosen to be your husband from town this very day i have his fathers letter in which he informs me his son is set out and that he intends to follow himself shortly after

miss hardcastle indeed i wish i had known something of this before bless me how shall i behave its a thousand to one i shant like him our meeting will be so formal and so like a thing of business that i shall find no room for friendship or esteem

hardcastle depend upon it child ill never control your choice but mr marlow whom i have pitched upon is the son of my old friend sir charles marlow of whom you have heard me talk so often the young gentleman has been bred a scholar and is designed for an employment in the service of his country i am told hes a man of an excellent understanding

miss hardcastle is he

hardcastle very generous

miss hardcastle i believe i shall like him

hardcastle young and brave

miss hardcastle im sure i shall like him

hardcastle and very handsome

miss hardcastle my dear papa say no more kissing his hand hes mine ill have him

hardcastle and to crown all kate hes one of the most bashful and reserved young fellows in all the world

miss hardcastle eh you have frozen me to death again that word reserved has undone all the rest of his accomplishments a reserved lover it is said always makes a suspicious husband

hardcastle on the contrary modesty seldom resides in a breast that is not enriched with nobler virtues it was the very feature in his character that first struck me

miss hardcastle he must have more striking features to catch me i promise you however if he be so young so handsome and so everything as you mention i believe hell do still i think ill have him

hardcastle ay kate but there is still an obstacle its more than an even wager he may not have you

miss hardcastle my dear papa why will you mortify one so—well if he refuses instead of breaking my heart at his indifference ill only break my glass for its flattery set my cap to some newer fashion and look out for some less difficult admirer

hardcastle bravely resolved in the mean time ill go prepare the servants for his reception as we seldom see company they want as much training as a company of recruits the first days muster exit

miss hardcastle alone lud this news of papas puts me all in a flutter young handsome these he put last but i put them foremost sensible goodnatured i like all that but then reserved and sheepish thats much against him yet cant he be cured of his timidity by being taught to be proud of his wife yes and cant i—but i vow im disposing of the husband before i have secured the lover

enter miss neville

miss hardcastle im glad youre come neville my dear tell me constance how do i look this evening is there anything whimsical about me is it one of my welllooking days child am i in face today

miss neville perfectly my dear yet now i look again—bless me—sure no accident has happened among the canary birds or the gold fishes has your brother or the cat been meddling or has the last novel been too moving

miss hardcastle no nothing of all this i have been threatened—i can scarce get it out—i have been threatened with a lover

miss neville and his name—

miss hardcastle is marlow

miss neville indeed

miss hardcastle the son of sir charles marlow

miss neville as i live the most intimate friend of mr hastings my admirer they are never asunder i believe you must have seen him when we lived in town

miss hardcastle never

miss neville hes a very singular character i assure you among women of reputation and virtue he is the modestest man alive but his acquaintance give him a very different character among creatures of another stamp you understand me

miss hardcastle an odd character indeed i shall never be able to manage him what shall i do pshaw think no more of him but trust to occurrences for success but how goes on your own affair my dear has my mother been courting you for my brother tony as usual

miss neville i have just come from one of our agreeable teteatetes she has been saying a hundred tender things and setting off her pretty monster as the very pink of perfection

miss hardcastle and her partiality is such that she actually thinks him so a fortune like yours is no small temptation besides as she has the sole management of it im not surprised to see her unwilling to let it go out of the family

miss neville a fortune like mine which chiefly consists in jewels is no such mighty temptation but at any rate if my dear hastings be but constant i make no doubt to be too hard for her at last however i let her suppose that i am in love with her son and she never once dreams that my affections are fixed upon another

miss hardcastle my good brother holds out stoutly i could almost love him for hating you so

miss neville it is a goodnatured creature at bottom and im sure would wish to see me married to anybody but himself but my aunts bell rings for our afternoons walk round the improvements allons courage is necessary as our affairs are critical

miss hardcastle would it were bedtime and all were well exeunt

scene—an alehouse room several shabby fellows with punch and tobacco tony at the head of the table a little higher than the rest a mallet in his hand

omnes hurrea hurrea hurrea bravo

first fellow now gentlemen silence for a song the squire is going to knock himself down for a song

omnes ay a song a song

tony then ill sing you gentlemen a song i made upon this alehouse the three pigeons

song
let schoolmasters puzzle their brain
with grammar and nonsense and learning
good liquor i stoutly maintain
gives genus a better discerning
let them brag of their heathenish gods
their lethes their styxes and stygians
their quis and their quaes and their quods
theyre all but a parcel of pigeons
toroddle toroddle toroll

when methodist preachers come down
apreaching that drinking is sinful
ill wager the rascals a crown
they always preach best with a skinful
but when you come down with your pence
for a slice of their scurvy religion
ill leave it to all men of sense
but you my good friend are the pigeon
toroddle toroddle toroll

then come put the jorum about
and let us be merry and clever
our hearts and our liquors are stout
heres the three jolly pigeons for ever
let some cry up woodcock or hare
your bustards your ducks and your widgeons
but of all the gay birds in the air
heres a health to the three jolly pigeons
toroddle toroddle toroll


omnes bravo bravo

first fellow the squire has got spunk in him

second fellow i loves to hear him sing bekeays he never gives us nothing thats low

third fellow o damn anything thats low i cannot bear it

fourth fellow the genteel thing is the genteel thing any time if so be that a gentleman bees in a concatenation accordingly

third fellow i likes the maxum of it master muggins what though i am obligated to dance a bear a man may be a gentleman for all that may this be my poison if my bear ever dances but to the very genteelest of tunes water parted or the minuet in ariadne

second fellow what a pity it is the squire is not come to his own it would be well for all the publicans within ten miles round of him

tony ecod and so it would master slang id then show what it was to keep choice of company

second fellow o he takes after his own father for that to be sure old squire lumpkin was the finest gentleman i ever set my eyes on for winding the straight horn or beating a thicket for a hare or a wench he never had his fellow it was a saying in the place that he kept the best horses dogs and girls in the whole county

tony ecod and when im of age ill be no bastard i promise you i have been thinking of bet bouncer and the millers grey mare to begin with but come my boys drink about and be merry for you pay no reckoning well stingo whats the matter

enter landlord

landlord there be two gentlemen in a postchaise at the door they have lost their way upo the forest and they are talking something about mr hardcastle

tony as sure as can be one of them must be the gentleman thats coming down to court my sister do they seem to be londoners

landlord i believe they may they look woundily like frenchmen

tony then desire them to step this way and ill set them right in a twinkling exit landlord gentlemen as they maynt be good enough company for you step down for a moment and ill be with you in the squeezing of a lemon exeunt mob

tony solus fatherinlaw has been calling me whelp and hound this half year now if i pleased i could be so revenged upon the old grumbletonian but then im afraid—afraid of what i shall soon be worth fifteen hundred a year and let him frighten me out of that if he can

enter landlord conducting marlow and hastings

marlow what a tedious uncomfortable day have we had of it we were told it was but forty miles across the country and we have come above threescore

hastings and all marlow from that unaccountable reserve of yours that would not let us inquire more frequently on the way

marlow i own hastings i am unwilling to lay myself under an obligation to every one i meet and often stand the chance of an unmannerly answer

hastings at present however we are not likely to receive any answer

tony no offence gentlemen but im told you have been inquiring for one mr hardcastle in these parts do you know what part of the country you are in

hastings not in the least sir but should thank you for information

tony nor the way you came

hastings no sir but if you can inform us——

tony why gentlemen if you know neither the road you are going nor where you are nor the road you came the first thing i have to inform you is that—you have lost your way

marlow we wanted no ghost to tell us that

tony pray gentlemen may i be so bold so as to ask the place from whence you came

marlow thats not necessary towards directing us where we are to go

tony no offence but question for question is all fair you know pray gentlemen is not this same hardcastle a crossgrained oldfashioned whimsical fellow with an ugly face a daughter and a pretty son

hastings we have not seen the gentleman but he has the family you mention

tony the daughter a tall trapesing trolloping talkative maypole the son a pretty wellbred agreeable youth that everybody is fond of

marlow our information differs in this the daughter is said to be wellbred and beautiful the son an awkward booby reared up and spoiled at his mothers apronstring

tony hehehem—then gentlemen all i have to tell you is that you wont reach mr hardcastles house this night i believe

hastings unfortunate

tony its a damnd long dark boggy dirty dangerous way stingo tell the gentlemen the way to mr hardcastles winking upon the landlord mr hardcastles of quagmire marsh you understand me

landlord master hardcastles lockadaisy my masters youre come a deadly deal wrong when you came to the bottom of the hill you should have crossed down squash lane

marlow cross down squash lane

landlord then you were to keep straight forward till you came to four roads

marlow come to where four roads meet

tony ay but you must be sure to take only one of them

marlow o sir youre facetious

tony then keeping to the right you are to go sideways till you come upon crackskull common there you must look sharp for the track of the wheel and go forward till you come to farmer murrains barn coming to the farmers barn you are to turn to the right and then to the left and then to the right about again till you find out the old mill—

marlow zounds man we could as soon find out the longitude

hastings whats to be done marlow

marlow this house promises but a poor reception though perhaps the landlord can accommodate us

landlord alack master we have but one spare bed in the whole house

tony and to my knowledge thats taken up by three lodgers already after a pause in which the rest seem disconcerted i have hit it dont you think stingo our landlady could accommodate the gentlemen by the fireside with——three chairs and a bolster

hastings i hate sleeping by the fireside

marlow and i detest your three chairs and a bolster

tony you do do you then let me see—what if you go on a mile further to the bucks head the old bucks head on the hill one of the best inns in the whole county

hastings o ho so we have escaped an adventure for this night however

landlord apart to tony sure you bent sending them to your fathers as an inn be you

tony mum you fool you let them find that out to them you have only to keep on straight forward till you come to a large old house by the road side youll see a pair of large horns over the door thats the sign drive up the yard and call stoutly about you

hastings sir we are obliged to you the servants cant miss the way

tony no no but i tell you though the landlord is rich and going to leave off business so he wants to be thought a gentleman saving your presence he he he hell be for giving you his company and ecod if you mind him hell persuade you that his mother was an alderman and his aunt a justice of peace

landlord a troublesome old blade to be sure but a keeps as good wines and beds as any in the whole country

marlow well if he supplies us with these we shall want no farther connexion we are to turn to the right did you say

tony no no straight forward ill just step myself and show you a piece of the way to the landlord mum

landlord ah bless your heart for a sweet pleasant—damnd mischievous son of a whore exeunt









act the second

scene—an oldfashioned house

enter hardcastle followed by three or four awkward servants

hardcastle well i hope you are perfect in the table exercise i have been teaching you these three days you all know your posts and your places and can show that you have been used to good company without ever stirring from home

omnes ay ay

hardcastle when company comes you are not to pop out and stare and then run in again like frightened rabbits in a warren

omnes no no

hardcastle you diggory whom i have taken from the barn are to make a show at the sidetable and you roger whom i have advanced from the plough are to place yourself behind my chair but youre not to stand so with your hands in your pockets take your hands from your pockets roger and from your head you blockhead you see how diggory carries his hands theyre a little too stiff indeed but thats no great matter

diggory ay mind how i hold them i learned to hold my hands this way when i was upon drill for the militia and so being upon drill——

hardcastle you must not be so talkative diggory you must be all attention to the guests you must hear us talk and not think of talking you must see us drink and not think of drinking you must see us eat and not think of eating

diggory by the laws your worship thats parfectly unpossible whenever diggory sees yeating going forward ecod hes always wishing for a mouthful himself

hardcastle blockhead is not a bellyfull in the kitchen as good as a bellyfull in the parlour stay your stomach with that reflection

diggory ecod i thank your worship ill make a shift to stay my stomach with a slice of cold beef in the pantry

hardcastle diggory you are too talkative—then if i happen to say a good thing or tell a good story at table you must not all burst out alaughing as if you made part of the company

diggory then ecod your worship must not tell the story of ould grouse in the gunroom i cant help laughing at that—he he he—for the soul of me we have laughed at that these twenty years—ha ha ha

hardcastle ha ha ha the story is a good one well honest diggory you may laugh at that—but still remember to be attentive suppose one of the company should call for a glass of wine how will you behave a glass of wine sir if you please to diggory—eh why dont you move

diggory ecod your worship i never have courage till i see the eatables and drinkables brought upo the table and then im as bauld as a lion

hardcastle what will nobody move

first servant im not to leave this pleace

second servant im sure its no pleace of mine

third servant nor mine for sartain

diggory wauns and im sure it canna be mine

hardcastle you numskulls and so while like your betters you are quarrelling for places the guests must be starved o you dunces i find i must begin all over again——but dont i hear a coach drive into the yard to your posts you blockheads ill go in the mean time and give my old friends son a hearty reception at the gate exit hardcastle

diggory by the elevens my pleace is gone quite out of my head

roger i know that my pleace is to be everywhere

first servant where the devil is mine

second servant my pleace is to be nowhere at all and so ize go about my business exeunt servants running about as if frightened different ways

enter servant with candles showing in marlow and hastings

servant welcome gentlemen very welcome this way

hastings after the disappointments of the day welcome once more charles to the comforts of a clean room and a good fire upon my word a very welllooking house antique but creditable

marlow the usual fate of a large mansion having first ruined the master by good housekeeping it at last comes to levy contributions as an inn

hastings as you say we passengers are to be taxed to pay all these fineries i have often seen a good sideboard or a marble chimneypiece though not actually put in the bill inflame a reckoning confoundedly

marlow travellers george must pay in all places the only difference is that in good inns you pay dearly for luxuries in bad inns you are fleeced and starved

hastings you have lived very much among them in truth i have been often surprised that you who have seen so much of the world with your natural good sense and your many opportunities could never yet acquire a requisite share of assurance

marlow the englishmans malady but tell me george where could i have learned that assurance you talk of my life has been chiefly spent in a college or an inn in seclusion from that lovely part of the creation that chiefly teach men confidence i dont know that i was ever familiarly acquainted with a single modest woman—except my mother—but among females of another class you know——

hastings ay among them you are impudent enough of all conscience

marlow they are of us you know

hastings but in the company of women of reputation i never saw such an idiot such a trembler you look for all the world as if you wanted an opportunity of stealing out of the room

marlow why man thats because i do want to steal out of the room faith i have often formed a resolution to break the ice and rattle away at any rate but i dont know how a single glance from a pair of fine eyes has totally overset my resolution an impudent fellow may counterfeit modesty but ill be hanged if a modest man can ever counterfeit impudence

hastings if you could but say half the fine things to them that i have heard you lavish upon the barmaid of an inn or even a college bedmaker——

marlow why george i cant say fine things to them they freeze they petrify me they may talk of a comet or a burning mountain or some such bagatelle but to me a modest woman drest out in all her finery is the most tremendous object of the whole creation

hastings ha ha ha at this rate man how can you ever expect to marry

marlow never unless as among kings and princes my bride were to be courted by proxy if indeed like an eastern bridegroom one were to be introduced to a wife he never saw before it might be endured but to go through all the terrors of a formal courtship together with the episode of aunts grandmothers and cousins and at last to blurt out the broad staring question of madam will you marry me no no thats a strain much above me i assure you

hastings i pity you but how do you intend behaving to the lady you are come down to visit at the request of your father

marlow as i behave to all other ladies bow very low answer yes or no to all her demands—but for the rest i dont think i shall venture to look in her face till i see my fathers again

hastings im surprised that one who is so warm a friend can be so cool a lover

marlow to be explicit my dear hastings my chief inducement down was to be instrumental in forwarding your happiness not my own miss neville loves you the family dont know you as my friend you are sure of a reception and let honour do the rest

hastings my dear marlow but ill suppress the emotion were i a wretch meanly seeking to carry off a fortune you should be the last man in the world i would apply to for assistance but miss nevilles person is all i ask and that is mine both from her deceased fathers consent and her own inclination

marlow happy man you have talents and art to captivate any woman im doomd to adore the sex and yet to converse with the only part of it i despise this stammer in my address and this awkward prepossessing visage of mine can never permit me to soar above the reach of a milliners prentice or one of the duchesses of drurylane pshaw this fellow here to interrupt us

enter hardcastle

hardcastle gentlemen once more you are heartily welcome which is mr marlow sir you are heartily welcome its not my way you see to receive my friends with my back to the fire i like give them a hearty reception in the old style at my gate i like to see their horses and trunks taken care of

marlow aside he has got our names from the servants already to him we approve your caution and hospitality sir to hastings i have been thinking george of changing our travelling dresses in the morning i am grown confoundedly ashamed of mine

hardcastle i beg mr marlow youll use no ceremony in this house

hastings i fancy charles youre right the first blow is half the battle i intend opening the campaign with the white and gold

hardcastle mr marlow—mr hastings—gentlemen—pray be under no constraint in this house this is libertyhall gentlemen you may do just as you please here

marlow yet george if we open the campaign too fiercely at first we may want ammunition before it is over i think to reserve the embroidery to secure a retreat

hardcastle your talking of a retreat mr marlow puts me in mind of the duke of marlborough when we went to besiege denain he first summoned the garrison——

marlow dont you think the ventre dor waistcoat will do with the plain brown

hardcastle he first summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men——

hastings i think not brown and yellow mix but very poorly

hardcastle i say gentlemen as i was telling you be summoned the garrison which might consist of about five thousand men——

marlow the girls like finery

hardcastle which might consist of about five thousand men well appointed with stores ammunition and other implements of war now says the duke of marlborough to george brooks that stood next to him—you must have heard of george brooks—ill pawn my dukedom says he but i take that garrison without spilling a drop of blood so——

marlow what my good friend if you gave us a glass of punch in the mean time it would help us to carry on the siege with vigour

hardcastle punch sir aside this is the most unaccountable kind of modesty i ever met with

marlow yes sir punch a glass of warm punch after our journey will be comfortable this is libertyhall you know

hardcastle heres a cup sir

marlow aside so this fellow in his libertyhall will only let us have just what he pleases

hardcastle taking the cup i hope youll find it to your mind i have prepared it with my own hands and i believe youll own the ingredients are tolerable will you be so good as to pledge me sir here mr marlow here is to our better acquaintance drinks

marlow aside a very impudent fellow this but hes a character and ill humour him a little sir my service to you drinks

hastings aside i see this fellow wants to give us his company and forgets that hes an innkeeper before he has learned to be a gentleman

marlow from the excellence of your cup my old friend i suppose you have a good deal of business in this part of the country warm work now and then at elections i suppose

hardcastle no sir i have long given that work over since our betters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other there is no business for us that sell ale

hastings so then you have no turn for politics i find

hardcastle not in the least there was a time indeed i fretted myself about the mistakes of government like other people but finding myself every day grow more angry and the government growing no better i left it to mend itself since that i no more trouble my head about hyder ally or ally cawn than about ally croker sir my service to you

hastings so that with eating above stairs and drinking below with receiving your friends within and amusing them without you lead a good pleasant bustling life of it

hardcastle i do stir about a great deal thats certain half the differences of the parish are adjusted in this very parlour

marlow after drinking and you have an argument in your cup old gentleman better than any in westminsterhall

hardcastle ay young gentleman that and a little philosophy

marlow aside well this is the first time i ever heard of an innkeepers philosophy

hastings so then like an experienced general you attack them on every quarter if you find their reason manageable you attack it with your philosophy if you find they have no reason you attack them with this heres your health my philosopher drinks

hardcastle good very good thank you ha ha your generalship puts me in mind of prince eugene when he fought the turks at the battle of belgrade you shall hear

marlow instead of the battle of belgrade i believe its almost time to talk about supper what has your philosophy got in the house for supper

hardcastle for supper sir aside was ever such a request to a man in his own house

marlow yes sir supper sir i begin to feel an appetite i shall make devilish work tonight in the larder i promise you

hardcastle aside such a brazen dog sure never my eyes beheld to him why really sir as for supper i cant well tell my dorothy and the cookmaid settle these things between them i leave these kind of things entirely to them

marlow you do do you

hardcastle entirely by the bye i believe they are in actual consultation upon whats for supper this moment in the kitchen

marlow then i beg theyll admit me as one of their privy council its a way i have got when i travel i always chose to regulate my own supper let the cook be called no offence i hope sir

hardcastle o no sir none in the least yet i dont know how our bridget the cookmaid is not very communicative upon these occasions should we send for her she might scold us all out of the house

hastings lets see your list of the larder then i ask it as a favour i always match my appetite to my bill of fare

marlow to hardcastle who looks at them with surprise sir hes very right and its my way too

hardcastle sir you have a right to command here here roger bring us the bill of fare for tonights supper i believe its drawn out—your manner mr hastings puts me in mind of my uncle colonel wallop it was a saying of his that no man was sure of his supper till he had eaten it

hastings aside all upon the high rope his uncle a colonel we shall soon hear of his mother being a justice of the peace but lets hear the bill of fare

marlow perusing whats here for the first course for the second course for the dessert the devil sir do you think we have brought down a whole joiners company or the corporation of bedford to eat up such a supper two or three little things clean and comfortable will do

hastings but lets hear it

marlow reading for the first course at the top a pig and prune sauce

hastings damn your pig i say

marlow and damn your prune sauce say i

hardcastle and yet gentlemen to men that are hungry pig with prune sauce is very good eating

marlow at the bottom a calfs tongue and brains

hastings let your brains be knocked out my good sir i dont like them

marlow or you may clap them on a plate by themselves i do

hardcastle aside their impudence confounds me to them gentlemen you are my guests make what alterations you please is there anything else you wish to retrench or alter gentlemen

marlow item a pork pie a boiled rabbit and sausages a florentine a shaking pudding and a dish of tiff—taff—taffety cream

hastings confound your made dishes i shall be as much at a loss in this house as at a green and yellow dinner at the french ambassadors table im for plain eating

hardcastle im sorry gentlemen that i have nothing you like but if there be anything you have a particular fancy to——

marlow why really sir your bill of fare is so exquisite that any one part of it is full as good as another send us what you please so much for supper and now to see that our beds are aired and properly taken care of

hardcastle i entreat youll leave that to me you shall not stir a step

marlow leave that to you i protest sir you must excuse me i always look to these things myself

hardcastle i must insist sir youll make yourself easy on that head

marlow you see im resolved on it aside a very troublesome fellow this as i ever met with

hardcastle well sir im resolved at least to attend you aside this may be modern modesty but i never saw anything look so like oldfashioned impudence exeunt marlow and hardcastle

hastings alone so i find this fellows civilities begin to grow troublesome but who can be angry at those assiduities which are meant to please him ha what do i see miss neville by all thats happy

enter miss neville

miss neville my dear hastings to what unexpected good fortune to what accident am i to ascribe this happy meeting

hastings rather let me ask the same question as i could never have hoped to meet my dearest constance at an inn

miss neville an inn sure you mistake my aunt my guardian lives here what could induce you to think this house an inn

hastings my friend mr marlow with whom i came down and i have been sent here as to an inn i assure you a young fellow whom we accidentally met at a house hard by directed us hither

miss neville certainly it must be one of my hopeful cousins tricks of whom you have heard me talk so often ha ha ha

hastings he whom your aunt intends for you he of whom i have such just apprehensions

miss neville you have nothing to fear from him i assure you youd adore him if you knew how heartily he despises me my aunt knows it too and has undertaken to court me for him and actually begins to think she has made a conquest

hastings thou dear dissembler you must know my constance i have just seized this happy opportunity of my friends visit here to get admittance into the family the horses that carried us down are now fatigued with their journey but theyll soon be refreshed and then if my dearest girl will trust in her faithful hastings we shall soon be landed in france where even among slaves the laws of marriage are respected

miss neville i have often told you that though ready to obey you i yet should leave my little fortune behind with reluctance the greatest part of it was left me by my uncle the india director and chiefly consists in jewels i have been for some time persuading my aunt to let me wear them i fancy im very near succeeding the instant they are put into my possession you shall find me ready to make them and myself yours

hastings perish the baubles your person is all i desire in the mean time my friend marlow must not be let into his mistake i know the strange reserve of his temper is such that if abruptly informed of it he would instantly quit the house before our plan was ripe for execution

miss neville but how shall we keep him in the deception miss hardcastle is just returned from walking what if we still continue to deceive him——this this way——they confer

enter marlow

marlow the assiduities of these good people teaze me beyond bearing my host seems to think it ill manners to leave me alone and so he claps not only himself but his oldfashioned wife on my back they talk of coming to sup with us too and then i suppose we are to run the gantlet through all the rest of the family—what have we got here

hastings my dear charles let me congratulate you—the most fortunate accident—who do you think is just alighted

marlow cannot guess

hastings our mistresses boy miss hardcastle and miss neville give me leave to introduce miss constance neville to your acquaintance happening to dine in the neighbourhood they called on their return to take fresh horses here miss hardcastle has just stept into the next room and will be back in an instant wasnt it lucky eh

marlow aside i have been mortified enough of all conscience and here comes something to complete my embarrassment

hastings well but wasnt it the most fortunate thing in the world

marlow oh yes very fortunate—a most joyful encounter—but our dresses george you know are in disorder—what if we should postpone the happiness till tomorrow—tomorrow at her own house—it will be every bit as convenient—and rather more respectful—tomorrow let it be offering to go

miss neville by no means sir your ceremony will displease her the disorder of your dress will show the ardour of your impatience besides she knows you are in the house and will permit you to see her

marlow o the devil how shall i support it hem hem hastings you must not go you are to assist me you know i shall be confoundedly ridiculous yet hang it ill take courage hem

hastings pshaw man its but the first plunge and alls over shes but a woman you know

marlow and of all women she that i dread most to encounter

enter miss hardcastle as returned from walking a bonnet etc

hastings introducing them miss hardcastle mr marlow im proud of bringing two persons of such merit together that only want to know to esteem each other

miss hardcastle aside now for meeting my modest gentleman with a demure face and quite in his own manner after a pause in which he appears very uneasy and disconcerted im glad of your safe arrival sir im told you had some accidents by the way

marlow only a few madam yes we had some yes madam a good many accidents but should be sorry—madam—or rather glad of any accidents—that are so agreeably concluded hem

hastings to him you never spoke better in your whole life keep it up and ill insure you the victory

miss hardcastle im afraid you flatter sir you that have seen so much of the finest company can find little entertainment in an obscure corner of the country

marlow gathering courage i have lived indeed in the world madam but i have kept very little company i have been but an observer upon life madam while others were enjoying it

miss neville but that i am told is the way to enjoy it at last

hastings to him cicero never spoke better once more and you are confirmed in assurance for ever

marlow to him hem stand by me then and when im down throw in a word or two to set me up again

miss hardcastle an observer like you upon life were i fear disagreeably employed since you must have had much more to censure than to approve

marlow pardon me madam i was always willing to be amused the folly of most people is rather an object of mirth than uneasiness

hastings to him bravo bravo never spoke so well in your whole life well miss hardcastle i see that you and mr marlow are going to be very good company i believe our being here will but embarrass the interview

marlow not in the least mr hastings we like your company of all things to him zounds george sure you wont go how can you leave us

hastings our presence will but spoil conversation so well retire to the next room to him you dont consider man that we are to manage a little teteatete of our own exeunt

miss hardcastle after a pause but you have not been wholly an observer i presume sir the ladies i should hope have employed some part of your addresses

marlow relapsing into timidity pardon me madam i—i—i—as yet have studied—only—to—deserve them

miss hardcastle and that some say is the very worst way to obtain them

marlow perhaps so madam but i love to converse only with the more grave and sensible part of the sex but im afraid i grow tiresome

miss hardcastle not at all sir there is nothing i like so much as grave conversation myself i could hear it for ever indeed i have often been surprised how a man of sentiment could ever admire those light airy pleasures where nothing reaches the heart

marlow its——a disease——of the mind madam in the variety of tastes there must be some who wanting a relish——for——um—a—um

miss hardcastle i understand you sir there must be some who wanting a relish for refined pleasures pretend to despise what they are incapable of tasting

marlow my meaning madam but infinitely better expressed and i cant help observing——a——

miss hardcastle aside who could ever suppose this fellow impudent upon some occasions to him you were going to observe sir——

marlow i was observing madam—i protest madam i forget what i was going to observe

miss hardcastle aside i vow and so do i to him you were observing sir that in this age of hypocrisy—something about hypocrisy sir

marlow yes madam in this age of hypocrisy there are few who upon strict inquiry do not—a—a—a—

miss hardcastle i understand you perfectly sir

marlow aside egad and thats more than i do myself

miss hardcastle you mean that in this hypocritical age there are few that do not condemn in public what they practise in private and think they pay every debt to virtue when they praise it

marlow true madam those who have most virtue in their mouths have least of it in their bosoms but im sure i tire you madam

miss hardcastle not in the least sir theres something so agreeable and spirited in your manner such life and force—pray sir go on

marlow yes madam i was saying——that there are some occasions when a total want of courage madam destroys all the——and puts us——upon a—a—a—

miss hardcastle i agree with you entirely a want of courage upon some occasions assumes the appearance of ignorance and betrays us when we most want to excel i beg youll proceed

marlow yes madam morally speaking madam—but i see miss neville expecting us in the next room i would not intrude for the world

miss hardcastle i protest sir i never was more agreeably entertained in all my life pray go on

marlow yes madam i was——but she beckons us to join her madam shall i do myself the honour to attend you

miss hardcastle well then ill follow

marlow aside this pretty smooth dialogue has done for me exit

miss hardcastle alone ha ha ha was there ever such a sober sentimental interview im certain he scarce looked in my face the whole time yet the fellow but for his unaccountable bashfulness is pretty well too he has good sense but then so buried in his fears that it fatigues one more than ignorance if i could teach him a little confidence it would be doing somebody that i know of a piece of service but who is that somebody—that faith is a question i can scarce answer exit

enter tony and miss neville followed by mrs hardcastle and hastings

tony what do you follow me for cousin con i wonder youre not ashamed to be so very engaging

miss neville i hope cousin one may speak to ones own relations and not be to blame

tony ay but i know what sort of a relation you want to make me though but it wont do i tell you cousin con it wont do so i beg youll keep your distance i want no nearer relationship she follows coquetting him to the back scene

mrs hardcastle well i vow mr hastings you are very entertaining theres nothing in the world i love to talk of so much as london and the fashions though i was never there myself

hastings never there you amaze me from your air and manner i concluded you had been bred all your life either at ranelagh st jamess or tower wharf

mrs hardcastle o sir youre only pleased to say so we country persons can have no manner at all im in love with the town and that serves to raise me above some of our neighbouring rustics but who can have a manner that has never seen the pantheon the grotto gardens the borough and such places where the nobility chiefly resort all i can do is to enjoy london at secondhand i take care to know every teteatete from the scandalous magazine and have all the fashions as they come out in a letter from the two miss rickets of crooked lane pray how do you like this head mr hastings

hastings extremely elegant and degagee upon my word madam your friseur is a frenchman i suppose

mrs hardcastle i protest i dressed it myself from a print in the ladies memorandumbook for the last year

hastings indeed such a head in a sidebox at the playhouse would draw as many gazers as my lady mayoress at a city ball

mrs hardcastle i vow since inoculation began there is no such thing to be seen as a plain woman so one must dress a little particular or one may escape in the crowd

hastings but that can never be your case madam in any dress bowing

mrs hardcastle yet what signifies my dressing when i have such a piece of antiquity by my side as mr hardcastle all i can say will never argue down a single button from his clothes i have often wanted him to throw off his great flaxen wig and where he was bald to plaster it over like my lord pately with powder

hastings you are right madam for as among the ladies there are none ugly so among the men there are none old

mrs hardcastle but what do you think his answer was why with his usual gothic vivacity he said i only wanted him to throw off his wig to convert it into a tete for my own wearing

hastings intolerable at your age you may wear what you please and it must become you

mrs hardcastle pray mr hastings what do you take to be the most fashionable age about town

hastings some time ago forty was all the mode but im told the ladies intend to bring up fifty for the ensuing winter

mrs hardcastle seriously then i shall be too young for the fashion

hastings no lady begins now to put on jewels till shes past forty for instance miss there in a polite circle would be considered as a child as a mere maker of samplers

mrs hardcastle and yet mrs niece thinks herself as much a woman and is as fond of jewels as the oldest of us all

hastings your niece is she and that young gentleman a brother of yours i should presume

mrs hardcastle my son sir they are contracted to each other observe their little sports they fall in and out ten times a day as if they were man and wife already to them well tony child what soft things are you saying to your cousin constance this evening

tony i have been saying no soft things but that its very hard to be followed about so ecod ive not a place in the house now thats left to myself but the stable

mrs hardcastle never mind him con my dear hes in another story behind your back

miss neville theres something generous in my cousins manner he falls out before faces to be forgiven in private

tony thats a damned confounded—crack

mrs hardcastle ah hes a sly one dont you think they are like each other about the mouth mr hastings the blenkinsop mouth to a t theyre of a size too back to back my pretties that mr hastings may see you come tony

tony you had as good not make me i tell you measuring

miss neville o lud he has almost cracked my head

mrs hardcastle o the monster for shame tony you a man and behave so

tony if im a man let me have my fortin ecod ill not be made a fool of no longer

mrs hardcastle is this ungrateful boy all that im to get for the pains i have taken in your education i that have rocked you in your cradle and fed that pretty mouth with a spoon did not i work that waistcoat to make you genteel did not i prescribe for you every day and weep while the receipt was operating

tony ecod you had reason to weep for you have been dosing me ever since i was born i have gone through every receipt in the complete huswife ten times over and you have thoughts of coursing me through quincy next spring but ecod i tell you ill not be made a fool of no longer

mrs hardcastle wasnt it all for your good viper wasnt it all for your good

tony i wish youd let me and my good alone then snubbing this way when im in spirits if im to have any good let it come of itself not to keep dinging it dinging it into one so

mrs hardcastle thats false i never see you when youre in spirits no tony you then go to the alehouse or kennel im never to be delighted with your agreeable wild notes unfeeling monster

tony ecod mamma your own notes are the wildest of the two

mrs hardcastle was ever the like but i see he wants to break my heart i see he does

hastings dear madam permit me to lecture the young gentleman a little im certain i can persuade him to his duty

mrs hardcastle well i must retire come constance my love you see mr hastings the wretchedness of my situation was ever poor woman so plagued with a dear sweet pretty provoking undutiful boy exeunt mrs hardcastle and miss neville

tony singing there was a young man riding by and fain would have his will rang do didlo dee——dont mind her let her cry its the comfort of her heart i have seen her and sister cry over a book for an hour together and they said they liked the book the better the more it made them cry

hastings then youre no friend to the ladies i find my pretty young gentleman

tony thats as i find um

hastings not to her of your mothers choosing i dare answer and yet she appears to me a pretty welltempered girl

tony thats because you dont know her as well as i ecod i know every inch about her and theres not a more bitter cantankerous toad in all christendom

hastings aside pretty encouragement this for a lover

tony i have seen her since the height of that she has as many tricks as a hare in a thicket or a colt the first days breaking

hastings to me she appears sensible and silent

tony ay before company but when shes with her playmate shes as loud as a hog in a gate

hastings but there is a meek modesty about her that charms me

tony yes but curb her never so little she kicks up and youre flung in a ditch

hastings well but you must allow her a little beauty—yes you must allow her some beauty

tony bandbox shes all a madeup thing mun ah could you but see bet bouncer of these parts you might then talk of beauty ecod she has two eyes as black as sloes and cheeks as broad and red as a pulpit cushion shed make two of she

hastings well what say you to a friend that would take this bitter bargain off your hands

tony anon

hastings would you thank him that would take miss neville and leave you to happiness and your dear betsy

tony ay but where is there such a friend for who would take her

hastings i am he if you but assist me ill engage to whip her off to france and you shall never hear more of her

tony assist you ecod i will to the last drop of my blood ill clap a pair of horses to your chaise that shall trundle you off in a twinkling and may he get you a part of her fortin beside in jewels that you little dream of

hastings my dear squire this looks like a lad of spirit

tony come along then and you shall see more of my spirit before you have done with me

singing we are the boys that fears no noise where the thundering cannons roar exeunt









act the third

enter hardcastle alone

hardcastle what could my old friend sir charles mean by recommending his son as the modestest young man in town to me he appears the most impudent piece of brass that ever spoke with a tongue he has taken possession of the easy chair by the fireside already he took off his boots in the parlour and desired me to see them taken care of im desirous to know how his impudence affects my daughter she will certainly be shocked at it

enter miss hardcastle plainly dressed

hardcastle well my kate i see you have changed your dress as i bade you and yet i believe there was no great occasion

miss hardcastle i find such a pleasure sir in obeying your commands that i take care to observe them without ever debating their propriety

hardcastle and yet kate i sometimes give you some cause particularly when i recommended my modest gentleman to you as a lover today

miss hardcastle you taught me to expect something extraordinary and i find the original exceeds the description

hardcastle i was never so surprised in my life he has quite confounded all my faculties

miss hardcastle i never saw anything like it and a man of the world too

hardcastle ay he learned it all abroad—what a fool was i to think a young man could learn modesty by travelling he might as soon learn wit at a masquerade

miss hardcastle it seems all natural to him

hardcastle a good deal assisted by bad company and a french dancingmaster

miss hardcastle sure you mistake papa a french dancingmaster could never have taught him that timid look—that awkward address—that bashful manner—

hardcastle whose look whose manner child

miss hardcastle mr marlows his mauvaise honte his timidity struck me at the first sight

hardcastle then your first sight deceived you for i think him one of the most brazen first sights that ever astonished my senses

miss hardcastle sure sir you rally i never saw any one so modest

hardcastle and can you be serious i never saw such a bouncing swaggering puppy since i was born bully dawson was but a fool to him

miss hardcastle surprising he met me with a respectful bow a stammering voice and a look fixed on the ground

hardcastle he met me with a loud voice a lordly air and a familiarity that made my blood freeze again

miss hardcastle he treated me with diffidence and respect censured the manners of the age admired the prudence of girls that never laughed tired me with apologies for being tiresome then left the room with a bow and madam i would not for the world detain you

hardcastle he spoke to me as if he knew me all his life before asked twenty questions and never waited for an answer interrupted my best remarks with some silly pun and when i was in my best story of the duke of marlborough and prince eugene he asked if i had not a good hand at making punch yes kate he asked your father if he was a maker of punch

miss hardcastle one of us must certainly be mistaken

hardcastle if he be what he has shown himself im determined he shall never have my consent

miss hardcastle and if he be the sullen thing i take him he shall never have mine

hardcastle in one thing then we are agreed—to reject him

miss hardcastle yes but upon conditions for if you should find him less impudent and i more presuming—if you find him more respectful and i more importunate—i dont know—the fellow is well enough for a man—certainly we dont meet many such at a horserace in the country

hardcastle if we should find him so——but thats impossible the first appearance has done my business im seldom deceived in that

miss hardcastle and yet there may be many good qualities under that first appearance

hardcastle ay when a girl finds a fellows outside to her taste she then sets about guessing the rest of his furniture with her a smooth face stands for good sense and a genteel figure for every virtue

miss hardcastle i hope sir a conversation begun with a compliment to my good sense wont end with a sneer at my understanding

hardcastle pardon me kate but if young mr brazen can find the art of reconciling contradictions he may please us both perhaps

miss hardcastle and as one of us must be mistaken what if we go to make further discoveries

hardcastle agreed but depend ont im in the right

miss hardcastle and depend ont im not much in the wrong exeunt

enter tony running in with a casket

tony ecod i have got them here they are my cousin cons necklaces bobs and all my mother shant cheat the poor souls out of their fortin neither o my genus is that you

enter hastings

hastings my dear friend how have you managed with your mother i hope you have amused her with pretending love for your cousin and that you are willing to be reconciled at last our horses will be refreshed in a short time and we shall soon be ready to set off

tony and heres something to bear your charges by the way giving the casket your sweethearts jewels keep them and hang those i say that would rob you of one of them

hastings but how have you procured them from your mother

tony ask me no questions and ill tell you no fibs i procured them by the rule of thumb if i had not a key to every drawer in mothers bureau how could i go to the alehouse so often as i do an honest man may rob himself of his own at any time

hastings thousands do it every day but to be plain with you miss neville is endeavouring to procure them from her aunt this very instant if she succeeds it will be the most delicate way at least of obtaining them

tony well keep them till you know how it will be but i know how it will be well enough shed as soon part with the only sound tooth in her head

hastings but i dread the effects of her resentment when she finds she has lost them

tony never you mind her resentment leave me to manage that i dont value her resentment the bounce of a cracker zounds here they are morrice prance exit hastings

enter mrs hardcastle and miss neville

mrs hardcastle indeed constance you amaze me such a girl as you want jewels it will be time enough for jewels my dear twenty years hence when your beauty begins to want repairs

miss neville but what will repair beauty at forty will certainly improve it at twenty madam

mrs hardcastle yours my dear can admit of none that natural blush is beyond a thousand ornaments besides child jewels are quite out at present dont you see half the ladies of our acquaintance my lady killdaylight and mrs crump and the rest of them carry their jewels to town and bring nothing but paste and marcasites back

miss neville but who knows madam but somebody that shall be nameless would like me best with all my little finery about me

mrs hardcastle consult your glass my dear and then see if with such a pair of eyes you want any better sparklers what do you think tony my dear does your cousin con want any jewels in your eyes to set off her beauty

tony thats as thereafter may be

miss neville my dear aunt if you knew how it would oblige me

mrs hardcastle a parcel of oldfashioned rose and tablecut things they would make you look like the court of king solomon at a puppetshow besides i believe i cant readily come at them they may be missing for aught i know to the contrary

tony apart to mrs hardcastle then why dont you tell her so at once as shes so longing for them tell her theyre lost its the only way to quiet her say theyre lost and call me to bear witness

mrs hardcastle apart to tony you know my dear im only keeping them for you so if i say theyre gone youll bear me witness will you he he he

tony never fear me ecod ill say i saw them taken out with my own eyes

miss neville i desire them but for a day madam just to be permitted to show them as relics and then they may be locked up again

mrs hardcastle to be plain with you my dear constance if i could find them you should have them theyre missing i assure you lost for aught i know but we must have patience wherever they are

miss neville ill not believe it this is but a shallow pretence to deny me i know they are too valuable to be so slightly kept and as you are to answer for the loss—

mrs hardcastle dont be alarmed constance if they be lost i must restore an equivalent but my son knows they are missing and not to be found

tony that i can bear witness to they are missing and not to be found ill take my oath ont

mrs hardcastle you must learn resignation my dear for though we lose our fortune yet we should not lose our patience see me how calm i am

miss neville ay people are generally calm at the misfortunes of others

mrs hardcastle now i wonder a girl of your good sense should waste a thought upon such trumpery we shall soon find them and in the mean time you shall make use of my garnets till your jewels be found

miss neville i detest garnets

mrs hardcastle the most becoming things in the world to set off a clear complexion you have often seen how well they look upon me you shall have them exit

miss neville i dislike them of all things you shant stir—was ever anything so provoking to mislay my own jewels and force me to wear her trumpery

tony dont be a fool if she gives you the garnets take what you can get the jewels are your own already i have stolen them out of her bureau and she does not know it fly to your spark hell tell you more of the matter leave me to manage her

miss neville my dear cousin

enter miss hardcastle and maid

miss hardcastle what an unaccountable creature is that brother of mine to send them to the house as an inn ha ha i dont wonder at his impudence

maid but what is more madam the young gentleman as you passed by in your present dress asked me if you were the barmaid he mistook you for the barmaid madam

miss hardcastle did he then as i live im resolved to keep up the delusion tell me pimple how do you like my present dress dont you think i look something like cherry in the beaux stratagem

maid its the dress madam that every lady wears in the country but when she visits or receives company

miss hardcastle and are you sure he does not remember my face or person

maid certain of it

miss hardcastle i vow i thought so for though we spoke for some time together yet his fears were such that he never once looked up during the interview indeed if he had my bonnet would have kept him from seeing me

maid but what do you hope from keeping him in his mistake

miss hardcastle in the first place i shall be seen and that is no small advantage to a girl who brings her face to market then i shall perhaps make an acquaintance and thats no small victory gained over one who never addresses any but the wildest of her sex but my chief aim is to take my gentleman off his guard and like an invisible champion of romance examine the giants force before i offer to combat

maid but you are sure you can act your part and disguise your voice so that he may mistake that as he has already mistaken your person

miss hardcastle never fear me i think i have got the true bar cant—did your honour call—attend the lion there—pipes and tobacco for the angel—the lamb has been outrageous this halfhour

maid it will do madam but hes here exit maid

enter marlow

marlow what a bawling in every part of the house i have scarce a moments repose if i go to the best room there i find my host and his story if i fly to the gallery there we have my hostess with her curtsey down to the ground i have at last got a moment to myself and now for recollection walks and muses

miss hardcastle did you call sir did your honour call

marlow musing as for miss hardcastle shes too grave and sentimental for me

miss hardcastle did your honour call she still places herself before him he turning away

marlow no child musing besides from the glimpse i had of her i think she squints

miss hardcastle im sure sir i heard the bell ring

marlow no no musing i have pleased my father however by coming down and ill tomorrow please myself by returning taking out his tablets and perusing

miss hardcastle perhaps the other gentleman called sir

marlow i tell you no

miss hardcastle i should be glad to know sir we have such a parcel of servants

marlow no no i tell you looks full in her face yes child i think i did call i wanted—i wanted—i vow child you are vastly handsome

miss hardcastle o la sir youll make one ashamed

marlow never saw a more sprightly malicious eye yes yes my dear i did call have you got any of your—a—what dye call it in the house

miss hardcastle no sir we have been out of that these ten days

marlow one may call in this house i find to very little purpose suppose i should call for a taste just by way of a trial of the nectar of your lips perhaps i might be disappointed in that too

miss hardcastle nectar nectar thats a liquor theres no call for in these parts french i suppose we sell no french wines here sir

marlow of true english growth i assure you

miss hardcastle then its odd i should not know it we brew all sorts of wines in this house and i have lived here these eighteen years

marlow eighteen years why one would think child you kept the bar before you were born how old are you

miss hardcastle o sir i must not tell my age they say women and music should never be dated

marlow to guess at this distance you cant be much above forty approaching yet nearer i dont think so much approaching by coming close to some women they look younger still but when we come very close indeed—attempting to kiss her

miss hardcastle never trust me dear papa but hes still the modest man i first took him for youll be convinced of it as well as i

hardcastle by the hand of my body i believe his impudence is infectious didnt i see him seize your hand didnt i see him haul you about like a milkmaid and now you talk of his respect and his modesty forsooth

miss hardcastle but if i shortly convince you of his modesty that he has only the faults that will pass off with time and the virtues that will improve with age i hope youll forgive him

hardcastle the girl would actually make one run mad i tell you ill not be convinced i am convinced he has scarce been three hours in the house and he has already encroached on all my prerogatives you may like his impudence and call it modesty but my soninlaw madam must have very different qualifications

miss hardcastle sir i ask but this night to convince you

miss hardcastle give me that hour then and i hope to satisfy you

servant yes your honour

marlow give me joy george crown me shadow me with laurels well george after all we modest fellows dont want for success among the women

hastings well and what then

marlow shes mine you rogue you such fire such motion such eyes such lips but egad she would not let me kiss them though

hastings but are you so sure so very sure of her

marlow why man she talked of showing me her work above stairs and i am to improve the pattern

hastings but how can you charles go about to rob a woman of her honour

marlow pshaw pshaw we all know the honour of the barmaid of an inn i dont intend to rob her take my word for it theres nothing in this house i shant honestly pay for

hastings i believe the girl has virtue

marlow and if she has i should be the last man in the world that would attempt to corrupt it

hastings you have taken care i hope of the casket i sent you to lock up is it in safety

marlow yes yes its safe enough i have taken care of it but how could you think the seat of a postcoach at an inndoor a place of safety ah numskull i have taken better precautions for you than you did for yourself——i have——

hastings what

marlow i have sent it to the landlady to keep for you

hastings to the landlady

marlow the landlady

hastings you did

marlow i did shes to be answerable for its forthcoming you know

marlow wasnt i right i believe youll allow that i acted prudently upon this occasion

hastings aside he must not see my uneasiness

marlow you seem a little disconcerted though methinks sure nothing has happened

hastings no nothing never was in better spirits in all my life and so you left it with the landlady who no doubt very readily undertook the charge

marlow rather too readily for she not only kept the casket but through her great precaution was going to keep the messenger too ha ha ha

hastings he he he theyre safe however

marlow as a guinea in a misers purse

marlow sir your humble servant aside whats to be the wonder now

hardcastle i believe sir you must be sensible sir that no man alive ought to be more welcome than your fathers son sir i hope you think so

marlow i do from my soul sir i dont want much entreaty i generally make my fathers son welcome wherever he goes

hardcastle i believe you do from my soul sir but though i say nothing to your own conduct that of your servants is insufferable their manner of drinking is setting a very bad example in this house i assure you

marlow i protest my very good sir that is no fault of mine if they dont drink as they ought they are to blame i ordered them not to spare the cellar i did i assure you to the side scene here let one of my servants come up to him my positive directions were that as i did not drink myself they should make up for my deficiencies below

hardcastle then they had your orders for what they do im satisfied

marlow they had i assure you you shall hear from one of themselves

enter servant drunk

marlow you jeremy come forward sirrah what were my orders were you not told to drink freely and call for what you thought fit for the good of the house

hardcastle aside i begin to lose my patience

jeremy please your honour liberty and fleetstreet for ever though im but a servant im as good as another man ill drink for no man before supper sir damme good liquor will sit upon a good supper but a good supper will not sit upon——hiccup——on my conscience sir

marlow you see my old friend the fellow is as drunk as he can possibly be i dont know what youd have more unless youd have the poor devil soused in a beerbarrel

hardcastle zounds hell drive me distracted if i contain myself any longer mr marlow—sir i have submitted to your insolence for more than four hours and i see no likelihood of its coming to an end im now resolved to be master here sir and i desire that you and your drunken pack may leave my house directly

marlow leave your house——sure you jest my good friend what when im doing what i can to please you

hardcastle i tell you sir you dont please me so i desire youll leave my house

marlow sure you cannot be serious at this time o night and such a night you only mean to banter me

hardcastle i tell you sir im serious and now that my passions are roused i say this house is mine sir this house is mine and i command you to leave it directly

marlow ha ha ha a puddle in a storm i shant stir a step i assure you in a serious tone this your house fellow its my house this is my house mine while i choose to stay what right have you to bid me leave this house sir i never met with such impudence curse me never in my whole life before

hardcastle nor i confound me if ever i did to come to my house to call for what he likes to turn me out of my own chair to insult the family to order his servants to get drunk and then to tell me this house is mine sir by all thats impudent it makes me laugh ha ha ha pray sir bantering as you take the house what think you of taking the rest of the furniture theres a pair of silver candlesticks and theres a firescreen and heres a pair of brazennosed bellows perhaps you may take a fancy to them

marlow bring me your bill sir bring me your bill and lets make no more words about it

hardcastle there are a set of prints too what think you of the rakes progress for your own apartment

marlow bring me your bill i say and ill leave you and your infernal house directly

hardcastle then theres a mahogany table that you may see your own face in

marlow my bill i say

hardcastle i had forgot the great chair for your own particular slumbers after a hearty meal

marlow zounds bring me my bill i say and lets hear no more ont

hardcastle young man young man from your fathers letter to me i was taught to expect a wellbred modest man as a visitor here but now i find him no better than a coxcomb and a bully but he will be down here presently and shall hear more of it exit

marlow hows this sure i have not mistaken the house everything looks like an inn the servants cry coming the attendance is awkward the barmaid too to attend us but shes here and will further inform me whither so fast child a word with you

enter miss hardcastle

miss hardcastle let it be short then im in a hurry aside i believe be begins to find out his mistake but its too soon quite to undeceive him

marlow pray child answer me one question what are you and what may your business in this house be

miss hardcastle a relation of the family sir

marlow what a poor relation

miss hardcastle yes sir a poor relation appointed to keep the keys and to see that the guests want nothing in my power to give them

marlow that is you act as the barmaid of this inn

miss hardcastle inn o law——what brought that in your head one of the best families in the country keep an inn—ha ha ha old mr hardcastles house an inn

marlow mr hardcastles house is this mr hardcastles house child

miss hardcastle ay sure whose else should it be

marlow so then alls out and i have been damnably imposed on o confound my stupid head i shall be laughed at over the whole town i shall be stuck up in caricatura in all the printshops the dullissimo maccaroni to mistake this house of all others for an inn and my fathers old friend for an innkeeper what a swaggering puppy must he take me for what a silly puppy do i find myself there again may i be hanged my dear but i mistook you for the barmaid

miss hardcastle dear me dear me im sure theres nothing in my behaviour to put me on a level with one of that stamp

marlow nothing my dear nothing but i was in for a list of blunders and could not help making you a subscriber my stupidity saw everything the wrong way i mistook your assiduity for assurance and your simplicity for allurement but its over this house i no more show my face in

miss hardcastle i hope sir i have done nothing to disoblige you im sure i should be sorry to affront any gentleman who has been so polite and said so many civil things to me im sure i should be sorry pretending to cry if he left the family upon my account im sure i should be sorry if people said anything amiss since i have no fortune but my character

marlow aside by heaven she weeps this is the first mark of tenderness i ever had from a modest woman and it touches me to her excuse me my lovely girl you are the only part of the family i leave with reluctance but to be plain with you the difference of our birth fortune and education makes an honourable connexion impossible and i can never harbour a thought of seducing simplicity that trusted in my honour of bringing ruin upon one whose only fault was being too lovely

miss hardcastle aside generous man i now begin to admire him to him but i am sure my family is as good as miss hardcastles and though im poor thats no great misfortune to a contented mind and until this moment i never thought that it was bad to want fortune

marlow and why now my pretty simplicity

miss hardcastle because it puts me at a distance from one that if i had a thousand pounds i would give it all to

marlow aside this simplicity bewitches me so that if i stay im undone i must make one bold effort and leave her to her your partiality in my favour my dear touches me most sensibly and were i to live for myself alone i could easily fix my choice but i owe too much to the opinion of the world too much to the authority of a father so that—i can scarcely speak it—it affects me farewell exit

miss hardcastle i never knew half his merit till now he shall not go if i have power or art to detain him ill still preserve the character in which i stooped to conquer but will undeceive my papa who perhaps may laugh him out of his resolution exit

enter tony and miss neville

tony ay you may steal for yourselves the next time i have done my duty she has got the jewels again thats a sure thing but she believes it was all a mistake of the servants

tony still gazing a damned cramp piece of penmanship as ever i saw in my life i can read your print hand very well but here are such handles and shanks and dashes that one can scarce tell the head from the tail—to anthony lumpkin esquire its very odd i can read the outside of my letters where my own name is well enough but when i come to open it its all——buzz thats hard very hard for the inside of the letter is always the cream of the correspondence

mrs hardcastle ha ha ha very well very well and so my son was too hard for the philosopher

miss neville yes madam but you must hear the rest madam a little more this way or he may hear us youll hear how he puzzled him again

mrs hardcastle he seems strangely puzzled now himself methinks

mrs hardcastle whats that my dear can i give you any assistance

miss neville pray aunt let me read it nobody reads a cramp hand better than i twitching the letter from him do you know who it is from

tony cant tell except from dick ginger the feeder

tony but i tell you miss its of all the consequence in the world i would not lose the rest of it for a guinea here mother do you make it out of no consequence giving mrs hardcastle the letter

mrs hardcastle hows this—reads dear squire im now waiting for miss neville with a postchaise and pair at the bottom of the garden but i find my horses yet unable to perform the journey i expect youll assist us with a pair of fresh horses as you promised dispatch is necessary as the hag ay the hag your mother will otherwise suspect us yours hastings grant me patience i shall run distracted my rage chokes me

miss neville i hope madam youll suspend your resentment for a few moments and not impute to me any impertinence or sinister design that belongs to another

mrs hardcastle curtseying very low fine spoken madam you are most miraculously polite and engaging and quite the very pink of courtesy and circumspection madam changing her tone and you you great illfashioned oaf with scarce sense enough to keep your mouth shut were you too joined against me but ill defeat all your plots in a moment as for you madam since you have got a pair of fresh horses ready it would be cruel to disappoint them so if you please instead of running away with your spark prepare this very moment to run off with me your old aunt pedigree will keep you secure ill warrant me you too sir may mount your horse and guard us upon the way here thomas roger diggory ill show you that i wish you better than you do yourselves exit

miss neville so now im completely ruined

tony ay thats a sure thing

miss neville what better could be expected from being connected with such a stupid fool—and after all the nods and signs i made him

hastings an insensible cub

marlow replete with tricks and mischief

tony baw damme but ill fight you both one after the other——with baskets

marlow as for him hes below resentment but your conduct mr hastings requires an explanation you knew of my mistakes yet would not undeceive me

hastings the torture of my situation is my only excuse

miss neville well my dear hastings if you have that esteem for me that i think that i am sure you have your constancy for three years will but increase the happiness of our future connexion if——

scene continued

enter hastings and servant

hastings you saw the old lady and miss neville drive off you say

servant yes your honour they went off in a postcoach and the young squire went on horseback theyre thirty miles off by this time

hastings then all my hopes are over

servant yes sir old sir charles has arrived he and the old gentleman of the house have been laughing at mr marlows mistake this half hour they are coming this way

hastings then i must not be seen so now to my fruitless appointment at the bottom of the garden this is about the time exit

enter sir charles and hardcastle

hardcastle ha ha ha the peremptory tone in which he sent forth his sublime commands

sir charles and the reserve with which i suppose he treated all your advances

hardcastle and yet he might have seen something in me above a common innkeeper too

sir charles yes dick but he mistook you for an uncommon innkeeper ha ha ha

hardcastle well im in too good spirits to think of anything but joy yes my dear friend this union of our families will make our personal friendships hereditary and though my daughters fortune is but small—

sir charles why dick will you talk of fortune to me my son is possessed of more than a competence already and can want nothing but a good and virtuous girl to share his happiness and increase it if they like each other as you say they do—

hardcastle if man i tell you they do like each other my daughter as good as told me so

sir charles but girls are apt to flatter themselves you know

hardcastle i saw him grasp her hand in the warmest manner myself and here he comes to put you out of your ifs i warrant him

enter marlow

marlow i come sir once more to ask pardon for my strange conduct i can scarce reflect on my insolence without confusion

hardcastle tut boy a trifle you take it too gravely an hour or twos laughing with my daughter will set all to rights again shell never like you the worse for it

marlow sir i shall be always proud of her approbation

hardcastle approbation is but a cold word mr marlow if i am not deceived you have something more than approbation thereabouts you take me

marlow really sir i have not that happiness

hardcastle come boy im an old fellow and know whats what as well as you that are younger i know what has passed between you but mum

marlow sure sir nothing has passed between us but the most profound respect on my side and the most distant reserve on hers you dont think sir that my impudence has been passed upon all the rest of the family

hardcastle impudence no i dont say that—not quite impudence—though girls like to be played with and rumpled a little too sometimes but she has told no tales i assure you

marlow i never gave her the slightest cause

hardcastle well well i like modesty in its place well enough but this is overacting young gentleman you may be open your father and i will like you all the better for it

marlow may i die sir if i ever——

hardcastle i tell you she dont dislike you and as im sure you like her——

marlow dear sir—i protest sir——

hardcastle i see no reason why you should not be joined as fast as the parson can tie you

marlow but hear me sir—

hardcastle your father approves the match i admire it every moments delay will be doing mischief so—

marlow but why wont you hear me by all thats just and true i never gave miss hardcastle the slightest mark of my attachment or even the most distant hint to suspect me of affection we had but one interview and that was formal modest and uninteresting

hardcastle aside this fellows formal modest impudence is beyond bearing

sir charles and you never grasped her hand or made any protestations

marlow as heaven is my witness i came down in obedience to your commands i saw the lady without emotion and parted without reluctance i hope youll exact no farther proofs of my duty nor prevent me from leaving a house in which i suffer so many mortifications exit

sir charles im astonished at the air of sincerity with which he parted

hardcastle and im astonished at the deliberate intrepidity of his assurance

sir charles i dare pledge my life and honour upon his truth

hardcastle here comes my daughter and i would stake my happiness upon her veracity

enter miss hardcastle

hardcastle kate come hither child answer us sincerely and without reserve has mr marlow made you any professions of love and affection

miss hardcastle the question is very abrupt sir but since you require unreserved sincerity i think he has

hardcastle to sir charles you see

sir charles and pray madam have you and my son had more than one interview

miss hardcastle yes sir several

hardcastle to sir charles you see

sir charles but did be profess any attachment

miss hardcastle a lasting one

sir charles did he talk of love

miss hardcastle much sir

sir charles amazing and all this formally

miss hardcastle formally

hardcastle now my friend i hope you are satisfied

sir charles and how did he behave madam

miss hardcastle as most profest admirers do said some civil things of my face talked much of his want of merit and the greatness of mine mentioned his heart gave a short tragedy speech and ended with pretended rapture

sir charles now im perfectly convinced indeed i know his conversation among women to be modest and submissive this forward canting ranting manner by no means describes him and i am confident he never sat for the picture

miss hardcastle then what sir if i should convince you to your face of my sincerity if you and my papa in about half an hour will place yourselves behind that screen you shall hear him declare his passion to me in person

sir charles agreed and if i find him what you describe all my happiness in him must have an end exit

miss hardcastle and if you dont find him what i describe—i fear my happiness must never have a beginning exeunt

scene changes to the back of the garden

enter hastings

hastings what an idiot am i to wait here for a fellow who probably takes a delight in mortifying me he never intended to be punctual and ill wait no longer what do i see it is he and perhaps with news of my constance

enter tony booted and spattered

hastings my honest squire i now find you a man of your word this looks like friendship

tony ay im your friend and the best friend you have in the world if you knew but all this riding by night by the bye is cursedly tiresome it has shook me worse than the basket of a stagecoach

hastings but how where did you leave your fellowtravellers are they in safety are they housed

tony five and twenty miles in two hours and a half is no such bad driving the poor beasts have smoked for it rabbit me but id rather ride forty miles after a fox than ten with such varment

hastings well but where have you left the ladies i die with impatience

tony left them why where should i leave them but where i found them

hastings this is a riddle

tony riddle me this then whats that goes round the house and round the house and never touches the house

hastings im still astray

tony why thats it mon i have led them astray by jingo theres not a pond or a slough within five miles of the place but they can tell the taste of

hastings ha ha ha i understand you took them in a round while they supposed themselves going forward and so you have at last brought them home again

tony you shall hear i first took them down featherbed lane where we stuck fast in the mud i then rattled them crack over the stones of upanddown hill i then introduced them to the gibbet on heavytree heath and from that with a circumbendibus i fairly lodged them in the horsepond at the bottom of the garden

hastings but no accident i hope

tony no no only mother is confoundedly frightened she thinks herself forty miles off shes sick of the journey and the cattle can scarce crawl so if your own horses be ready you may whip off with cousin and ill be bound that no soul here can budge a foot to follow you

hastings my dear friend how can i be grateful

tony ay now its dear friend noble squire just now it was all idiot cub and run me through the guts damn your way of fighting i say after we take a knock in this part of the country we kiss and be friends but if you had run me through the guts then i should be dead and you might go kiss the hangman

hastings the rebuke is just but i must hasten to relieve miss neville if you keep the old lady employed i promise to take care of the young one exit hastings

tony never fear me here she comes vanish shes got from the pond and draggled up to the waist like a mermaid

enter mrs hardcastle

mrs hardcastle i wish we were at home again i never met so many accidents in so short a journey drenched in the mud overturned in a ditch stuck fast in a slough jolted to a jelly and at last to lose our way whereabouts do you think we are tony

mrs hardcastle ill spoil you i will follows him off the stage exit

hardcastle theres morality however in his reply exit

enter hastings and miss neville

hastings my dear constance why will you deliberate thus if we delay a moment all is lost for ever pluck up a little resolution and we shall soon be out of the reach of her malignity

miss neville i find it impossible my spirits are so sunk with the agitations i have suffered that i am unable to face any new danger two or three years patience will at last crown us with happiness

hastings such a tedious delay is worse than inconstancy let us fly my charmer let us date our happiness from this very moment perish fortune love and content will increase what we possess beyond a monarchs revenue let me prevail

miss neville no mr hastings no prudence once more comes to my relief and i will obey its dictates in the moment of passion fortune may be despised but it ever produces a lasting repentance im resolved to apply to mr hardcastles compassion and justice for redress

hastings but though he had the will he has not the power to relieve you

miss neville but he has influence and upon that i am resolved to rely

hastings i have no hopes but since you persist i must reluctantly obey you exeunt

scene changes

enter sir charles and miss hardcastle

sir charles what a situation am i in if what you say appears i shall then find a guilty son if what he says be true i shall then lose one that of all others i most wished for a daughter

miss hardcastle i am proud of your approbation and to show i merit it if you place yourselves as i directed you shall hear his explicit declaration but he comes

sir charles ill to your father and keep him to the appointment exit sir charles

enter marlow

marlow though prepared for setting out i come once more to take leave nor did i till this moment know the pain i feel in the separation

miss hardcastle in her own natural manner i believe sufferings cannot be very great sir which you can so easily remove a day or two longer perhaps might lessen your uneasiness by showing the little value of what you now think proper to regret

marlow aside this girl every moment improves upon me to her it must not be madam i have already trifled too long with my heart my very pride begins to submit to my passion the disparity of education and fortune the anger of a parent and the contempt of my equals begin to lose their weight and nothing can restore me to myself but this painful effort of resolution

miss hardcastle then go sir ill urge nothing more to detain you though my family be as good as hers you came down to visit and my education i hope not inferior what are these advantages without equal affluence i must remain contented with the slight approbation of imputed merit i must have only the mockery of your addresses while all your serious aims are fixed on fortune

enter hardcastle and sir charles from behind

sir charles here behind this screen

hardcastle ay ay make no noise ill engage my kate covers him with confusion at last

marlow by heavens madam fortune was ever my smallest consideration your beauty at first caught my eye for who could see that without emotion but every moment that i converse with you steals in some new grace heightens the picture and gives it stronger expression what at first seemed rustic plainness now appears refined simplicity what seemed forward assurance now strikes me as the result of courageous innocence and conscious virtue

sir charles what can it mean he amazes me

hardcastle i told you how it would be hush

marlow i am now determined to stay madam and i have too good an opinion of my fathers discernment when he sees you to doubt his approbation

miss hardcastle no mr marlow i will not cannot detain you do you think i could suffer a connexion in which there is the smallest room for repentance do you think i would take the mean advantage of a transient passion to load you with confusion do you think i could ever relish that happiness which was acquired by lessening yours

marlow by all thats good i can have no happiness but whats in your power to grant me nor shall i ever feel repentance but in not having seen your merits before i will stay even contrary to your wishes and though you should persist to shun me i will make my respectful assiduities atone for the levity of my past conduct

miss hardcastle sir i must entreat youll desist as our acquaintance began so let it end in indifference i might have given an hour or two to levity but seriously mr marlow do you think i could ever submit to a connexion where i must appear mercenary and you imprudent do you think i could ever catch at the confident addresses of a secure admirer

marlow kneeling does this look like security does this look like confidence no madam every moment that shows me your merit only serves to increase my diffidence and confusion here let me continue——

sir charles i can hold it no longer charles charles how hast thou deceived me is this your indifference your uninteresting conversation

hardcastle your cold contempt your formal interview what have you to say now

marlow that im all amazement what can it mean

hardcastle it means that you can say and unsay things at pleasure that you can address a lady in private and deny it in public that you have one story for us and another for my daughter

marlow daughter—this lady your daughter

hardcastle yes sir my only daughter my kate whose else should she be

marlow oh the devil

miss hardcastle yes sir that very identical tall squinting lady you were pleased to take me for courtseying she that you addressed as the mild modest sentimental man of gravity and the bold forward agreeable rattle of the ladies club ha ha ha

marlow zounds theres no bearing this its worse than death

miss hardcastle in which of your characters sir will you give us leave to address you as the faltering gentleman with looks on the ground that speaks just to be heard and hates hypocrisy or the loud confident creature that keeps it up with mrs mantrap and old miss biddy buckskin till three in the morning ha ha ha

marlow o curse on my noisy head i never attempted to be impudent yet that i was not taken down i must be gone

hardcastle by the hand of my body but you shall not i see it was all a mistake and i am rejoiced to find it you shall not sir i tell you i know shell forgive you wont you forgive him kate well all forgive you take courage man they retire she tormenting him to the back scene

enter mrs hardcastle and tony

mrs hardcastle so so theyre gone off let them go i care not

hardcastle who gone

mrs hardcastle my dutiful niece and her gentleman mr hastings from town he who came down with our modest visitor here

sir charles who my honest george hastings as worthy a fellow as lives and the girl could not have made a more prudent choice

hardcastle then by the hand of my body im proud of the connexion

mrs hardcastle well if he has taken away the lady he has not taken her fortune that remains in this family to console us for her loss

hardcastle sure dorothy you would not be so mercenary

mrs hardcastle ay thats my affair not yours

hardcastle but you know if your son when of age refuses to marry his cousin her whole fortune is then at her own disposal

mrs hardcastle ay but hes not of age and she has not thought proper to wait for his refusal

enter hastings and miss neville

mrs hardcastle aside what returned so soon i begin not to like it

hastings to hardcastle for my late attempt to fly off with your niece let my present confusion be my punishment we are now come back to appeal from your justice to your humanity by her fathers consent i first paid her my addresses and our passions were first founded in duty

miss neville since his death i have been obliged to stoop to dissimulation to avoid oppression in an hour of levity i was ready to give up my fortune to secure my choice but i am now recovered from the delusion and hope from your tenderness what is denied me from a nearer connexion

mrs hardcastle pshaw pshaw this is all but the whining end of a modern novel

hardcastle be it what it will im glad theyre come back to reclaim their due come hither tony boy do you refuse this ladys hand whom i now offer you

tony what signifies my refusing you know i cant refuse her till im of age father

hardcastle while i thought concealing your age boy was likely to conduce to your improvement i concurred with your mothers desire to keep it secret but since i find she turns it to a wrong use i must now declare you have been of age these three months

tony of age am i of age father

hardcastle above three months

tony then youll see the first use ill make of my liberty taking miss nevilles hand witness all men by these presents that i anthony lumpkin esquire of blank place refuse you constantia neville spinster of no place at all for my true and lawful wife so constance neville may marry whom she pleases and tony lumpkin is his own man again

sir charles o brave squire

hastings my worthy friend

mrs hardcastle my undutiful offspring

marlow joy my dear george i give you joy sincerely and could i prevail upon my little tyrant here to be less arbitrary i should be the happiest man alive if you would return me the favour

hastings to miss hardcastle come madam you are now driven to the very last scene of all your contrivances i know you like him im sure he loves you and you must and shall have him

hardcastle joining their hands and i say so too and mr marlow if she makes as good a wife as she has a daughter i dont believe youll ever repent your bargain so now to supper tomorrow we shall gather all the poor of the parish about us and the mistakes of the night shall be crowned with a merry morning so boy take her and as you have been mistaken in the mistress my wish is that you may never be mistaken in the wife exeunt omnes
