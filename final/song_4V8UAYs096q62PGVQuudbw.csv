lights moving bodies grooving but can not feel a thing
i’ve got one step to the door then i hear
oooooo
like gravity pulling me in
i’m sinking in this space within
i can’t help but giving in to
this stranger with no name
dancing like a flame
like a moth i cannot be turned away

lead me
take me
far from here sweetly

do what you do
do what you will
let me get down take a hold of the wheel
let me drive you crazy
do what you do
do what you will
let me get down
i’ll be all the drug you feel
i’ll let you drive me crazy

i love your moves
i like your style
with them hips you drive me wild
i’m the puppet to your strings
you keep on moving me
into a world you keep on turning
turning for me now
everything we have is moving down down down
we just keep on grooving on down down down
see phillip phillips liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likelead me
take me
so far from here sweetly

do what you do
do what you will
let me get down take a hold of the wheel
let me drive you crazy
do what you do
do what you will
let me get down
i’ll be all that you feel
i’ll let you drive me crazyembed"
