what do you see in the dark
when the demons come for you

verse 1
if only you could have seen
how fucked up my life used to be
then everything starts to change
supposedly healing my pain

prechorus
i never thought id feel this way
i never thought that id see a day
id run away from anything or anywhere or anyone
its all these demons haunting me
its all these little things trapped inside of me
releasing me from all my sin

chorus
its taken me all of my anger
and taken me all of my hate
to learn how my life came together
releasing the demons again

verse 2
and now i look through my minds eye
and see where my past needs to rest
its always disturbed by these voices
that echo inside of my head
see godsmack liveget tickets as low as 45you might also likeprechorus
another way that i can hide
another reason to crawl inside and get away
from everything and everywhere and everyone no
its all these demons haunting me
its all these little things trapped inside of me
releasing me from all my sin

chorus
its taken me all of my anger
and taken me all of my hate
to learn how my life came together
releasing the demons again
again again again

bridge
facing the days as i grow into my own
loving and hatings the same
and threefold i told you
it comes back with laughter
over and over again
its coming back

chorus
its taken me all of my anger
and taken me all of my hate
to learn how my life came together
releasing
releasing the demons again
releasing the demons again
releasing the demons again
releasing the demons again
releasing the demonsembed"
