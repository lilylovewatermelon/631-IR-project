its the first day of summer
now i heard the rumour
we just fall out of the blue

verse 1
this highway
got me believe all the things that i see
come my way
never been clean gotta live on the scene
youre far away under the stargates
youre all of the things that i want
some might be scared but you wont

and i cant move my feet
if we dont set the fire free
this distance heart belongs to me you know
thats why youre queen bee
let you rule all over mе
this distance heart belongs to mе you know

chorus
its the first day of summer
