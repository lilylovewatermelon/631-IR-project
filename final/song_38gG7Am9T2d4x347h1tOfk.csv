every day theyre getting older more worried bout looking younger
its a patternized cycle show your face with every slumber
it’s equivalent to being full and longing for the hunger
guess it only takes nine months to build a life of suffering
moneys not enough for them just waking ups enough for me
told em how i felt and then we sat uncomfortably
its up to me one of them said
if you think you cant well its all in your head
as i shut the front door behind me
for the first time i’ve come out of hiding
and the lights so bright
for a second im blind
i cant see the city i cant see the cars
for a second im fineyou might also like22embed"
