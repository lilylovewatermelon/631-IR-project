but you sit there with your pride and kill us all
you have so much fun now trying to bend me till i break
and i just set myself up to take the fall
your eyes are black as tar and to look at you is hard
but im just too afraid to look away
misery loves company and here you stand in front of me
just please dont ask me to stay

so who do you trust
now that you need me to get through the day
im asking too much
to have you hear what i have to say
so i say

help me help you im down on my knees
if you need me so much then why did you leave
you needed a reason you needed too much
you can lean on me but dont lean
on me like im your crutch

you never started loving me so you could never quit
i could rule this fuckin world and youd still think im shit
youve turned your back on me have no family
in the end the devil gets what he deserves
you might also likeso who do you trust now that you
need me to get through the day
im asking too much
to have you hear what i have to say

so i say

help me help you im down on my knees
if you need me so much then why did you leave
you needed a reason you needed too much
you can lean on me but dont lean
on me like im your crutch

please help me please help me
please help me please help me

so who do you trust now that you
need me to get through the day
im asking too much
to have you hear what i have to say

so i say

help me help you im down on my knees
if you need me so much then why did you leave
you needed a reason you needed too much
you can lean on me but dont lean
on me like im your crutch
dont lean on me like im your crutchembed"
