you laugh at all the jokes
even the ones you know
funny im doing that too
alone in a crowded room
the one string thats out of tune
trust me i feel like that too

chorus
let me love the lonely out of you
let me love the pain youre going through
i think ive saved myself by saving you
let me love the lonely out of you

verse 2
lighthouse without the lights
you smile without your eyes
i know cause i do that too
your own worst enemy
you think that no one sees
i do cause im like that too

chorus
let me love the lonely out of you
let me love the pain youre going through
i think ive saved myself by saving you
let me love the lonely out of you

chorus
let me love the lonely out of you
let me love the pain youre going through
