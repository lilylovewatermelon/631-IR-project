1 tv on the radio  return to cookie mountain  i seemingly stumbled upon this band i heard they were playing soho in sb so i brushed up on some of their tunes before the show bought my tickets and checked them out one of the best live shows of the year this album is solid from start to finish great energy and an overall unique sound theyve already been endorsed by the likes of david bowie so i foresee big things fo tvotr

2 gnarls barkley  st elsewhere  i think i bumped this album more than any other this year danger mouse has got to be one of the most innovative producers today and ceelo is just flat out likeable if you didnt hear crazy like a million times this year you were living under a rock it was the biggest single of the year this is a really fun and happy cd sure to lift your spirits at any time

3 aloe blacc  shine through  many might remember aloe blacc as one half of la underground hiphop act emanon in his solo debut he establishes himself as a force in the rb scene i couldnt help but think of john legend when i heard this album he even does a spanish version of legends ordinary people as a bonus track good musical funky ethnic hes from panama hiphop

4 zero 7  the garden  wowim suddenly at a loss of words just when an artists music couldnt get more beautiful zero 7 drops the garden australian singer sia furler and guitarist jose gonzalez lend a hand to make this muscial masterpiece unprecedently producer sam hardaker sings on two of the tracks as well the evolution of this group is just mesmerizing as this album proves to be the most musical installment and tickles your emotions much like 2004s when it falls did do yourself a favor if you havent already and bring this album into your life

5 nightmares on wax  inna space outta sound  now had to be my favorite find of 2006 a german guy i met in brazil burned me a copy of their 2nd album smokers delight and i took notice inna space outta sound broke open the storm gates inot a vast library of ambienttriphop beats that rank with the best of them definately a reggae dub influence but its the production quality sets it apart

6 jdilla  donuts  if someone put a gun to my head and told me to pick my favorite album off of this list itd be this one its a shame that this record dropped posthumously for the evertalented jay dee this is a collection of old soul funk etc records that jdillas drops and mixes so tastefully its just a beautiful record i read a comment from another artist that this album makes him cry when he hears it i think its a testament to how timeless the selections are and it really reflects on the life of one of the greatest hiphop producers of our time and how he made us feel through his music

7 soul position  things go better with rj and al   my main man big d says this albums intro is one of the best hes ever heard and i agree its a prelude to a great album bluprints fuck it all mentality coupled with the always entertaining production of rjd2 is an awesome combination just good hiphop at a relatively lackluster period for the genre these two rise above

8 pearl jam  pearl jam  i grew up listening to this band and through my transition form an alternative rocker to an underground hiphopper to my current state as a fusionminded eclectic i still like what i hear if this is a lackluster period for hiphop then alternative rock is about to die pearl jam provides a breath of fresh air with their self titled album also known as the blue album with an avocado on the cover i caught a 3 hour live set on this tour and eddie vedder jeff ament et al are still rockin in the free world

9 the roots  game theory  id like to preface this entry with a big fuck you to my friends who gave up on the roots after phrenology and said that the tipping point didnt sound like the roots the roots have probably the most intriguing evolution of any hiphop act out there on the live hiphop food chain they sit at the top and game theory reinforces that black thought lets you know precisely whats on the minds of the group beginning with their call out track false media what ensues is a fluent expression of the kind of hiphop that you have to earn the right to produce uestlove is a hiphop renaissance man right up there with the likes of mos def and common his drum solo on halloween eve rocked la to pieces im on the edge of my seat waiting to see what boundaries the roots plan on establishing and crossing next

10 aceyalone with rjd2  magnificient city  yehhsss i grew up in la and aceyalone has always been one of my favorite alltime mcs when i heard that he teamed up with rjd2 it was almost unbelievable the possibilities were endless and i was anxious to hear this project this pairing worked so well aceys style was perfectly captured within the realm os rjs vast musical stylings rj kept it jazzy and funky and acey showed signs of reurning to the happygolucky form that made him an la hiphop icon with freestyle fellowship and later as a solo artist also this was my favorite show of 2006 first rjd2 plays an hour of his music if youve never seen him the dude mixes on 4 turntables with extreme mastery and no headphones in sight aceyalone proceeded to play a chronological review of all of his classics leading up to this point with rj on the decks and then they dropped just about every track off of magnificient city this was some kid in a candy store type shit


wordso did i miss anything im sure i did its hard to recollect all the great music that came out in the past year i gotta give thanks to wwwartistdirectcom for letting me know exactly when these albums came out becks guerolito little brothers the minstrel show and dangerdooms the mouse and the mask woulda made this list but they came out in the tail end of 2005
