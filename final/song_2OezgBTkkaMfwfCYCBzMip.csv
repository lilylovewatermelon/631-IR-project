a trace of reason
no matter where you turn

and the walls will fall
affirming nothing
so whats it all about
call on the brightest star
or play your hand as it lays
wounds always speak too loud

chorus
get along for a while
citizen and youll see
how the innocent are bound to the damned
what is just is i know
so were trapped by answers
love haunts til the end

are we all to ride
the edge of nothing
shake hands with fighting eyes

and if they dont know
their heart is stopping
cause everyone is right
you might also likechorus
get along for a while
citizen and youll see
how the innocent are bound to the damned
what is just is i know
so were trapped by answers
love haunts til the end

outro x2
from the moment that were born
til were old and tired
do we ever know peopleembed"
