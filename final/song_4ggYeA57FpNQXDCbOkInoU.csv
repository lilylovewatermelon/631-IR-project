always late for tea
never bothers to ring lately

says the silly sparrow
theres gossip in the grain
have you heard theoh you dont say

someday
someday
a snow shall fill the trees
youd best make warm the eves

callous is the old crow
hed mock even the sun
eyes as black as blood
bone crack in the craw

hed say
hed say
always a never mind
always a never mind

truth be
beggar that holds his tongue
dines on none none but air aloneyou might also likeembed"
