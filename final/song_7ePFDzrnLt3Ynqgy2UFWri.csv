oh what a night
late december back in 63
what a very special time for me
as i remember what a night

verse 2 gerry polci
oh what a night
you know i didnt even know her name
but i was never gonna be the same
what a lady what a night

chorus frankie valli
oh i i got a funny feeling
when she walked in the room
and my as i recall
it ended much too soon

verse 3 gerry polci
oh what a night
hypnotizing mesmerizin me
she was everything i dreamed shed be
sweet surrender what a night

bridge don ciccone
and i felt a rush
like a rolling bolt of thunder
spinning my head around
and takin my body under

oh what a night
whyd it take so long to see the light
seemed so wrong but now it seems so right

oh i felt a rush
like a rolling bolt of thunder
spinning my head around
and takin my body under
