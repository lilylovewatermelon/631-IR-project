verse 1 childish gambino
at a clippers game on the courtside side
watch a nigga shoot like a fourfive five
they mad at me too i got more fire
why these bitches see you go home roger
go home roger
tia and tamera in my bed im a smart guy
i aint fucking with you niggas like apartheid nah
hits on my list check my archive
im something so immaculate instead of asking whats happening
rather blast a jackson 5 in the back of an acura
acting blacker than a bernie mac two charlie murphys and akon
the girls that you brought man where are they from
where are they from we were playing playstation
why you standing there say some
girl say some no this aint a vacation
this is my house my house all she needed was some

i had a ménage i murdered the vag
but afterwards it was awkward as fuck
cause im nervous as fuck and could not get it up

on my porch smoking vapor hit with the sunday paper
