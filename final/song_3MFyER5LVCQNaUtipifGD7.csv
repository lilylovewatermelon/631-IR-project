i wanna know i wanna know

verse 1
been sick with the pen since i was ten inches tall
im relentless you guessed it back with the vengeance
in the set list every sentence so raw you can sense it
no question tryna be the best that
ever walked this earth if im not then im next up
dressed up like im bout to hit a bank or somethin
yeah i am not the one you wanna mess with no
when i come into the room put your heads down
im a little bit t√∏p stressed out
what does that mean
im a rap fiend with a bad lead
you could run if you want but youll never catch me
so cold with it yall dont get it
let you put me in a cage just so i can open it
handcuffed hands up this is dope to me
oh you thought you had me captured so funny
better run from me i dont think you really understand what this does for me
i dress bummy but i clean up nice they aint never seen this side of me
long tshirt they eyein me
rules dont apply to me
you better give me my privacy
i got the fans i got because im takin them behind the scenes
you played hideandseek i played hidefromme agh
yeah look at all that we accomplished
quittin for mes not an option
i wanna look at my kids in the face when im older and say i did something admirable
fast checks fast women that dont inspire me no
you dont wanna know whats goin on inside my personal life then get out my diary yeah

i wanna know what its like to be happy
i wanna know what its like to wake up in the morning and feel like its real when im laughin yeah

verse 2
yeah record labels signin artists they aint got a clue what to do with
why would i put my career in the hands of someone that dont even know what they doin
why would i sit in a room full of people that dont even care about me or my future and tell me they aint really feelin the vision then hop on the wagon the moment its movin huh
heard you tellin people you dont really like the content
whatchu wanna hear me rap about
how im on the road gettin side chicks
you should treat your mouth like your phone in a movie theater put that on silence
i dont care what everybody else is doin im just bein me and thats not how i live
oh my oh my yeah im in the zone now
zoned out come to my show with they phones out
whole crowd oh wow thats wild tone down no
i have created my own style
i have created my own sound
oh you didnt know well you know it now
slowin down
never happened this is what i was made for
they say you get what you paid for
grandpa told me always look to heaven try to pay attention when you talkin to god yeah
i wish ida paid more i shoulda prayed more
everybodys out here shoppin tryna find a different product in the same stores woo
everybody wants they dream to fall in they lap but dont wanna work for it
ive been doin this since i was just a kid and mama bought me 8 mile at the movie store
hopin someday maybe i could do what i love for a livin with people i care for
people that care more about me as person than money i make for em yeah
prechorus
i wanna know what its like to be happy
i wanna know what its like to wake up in the morning and feel like its real when im laughin yeah
