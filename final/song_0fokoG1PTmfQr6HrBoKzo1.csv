when youre big and troubles seem so far
you put your belly up to the bar
squint your eyes you can almost miss the dirt
you tell yourself it couldnt hurt

chorus 1
but when youre small
you cant walk down the hall
when youre small
youre not very big at all

verse 2
when youre low you reach a certain point
where you cant really see the point
you can try but you cant see eye to eye
yet when youre low then you really know

chorus 2
but when youre high
its easier to fight
when youre high
you dont have to know why

when youre small
you dont have very far to fall
when youre small
you feel like you belong
when youre small
you can curl into a ball
when youre small
no youre not very big at all2embed"
