fell in love with a girl
i fell in love once and almost completely
shes in love with the world
but sometimes these feelings can be so misleading
she turns and says are you alright
i said i must be fine cause my hearts still beating
come and kiss me by the riverside yeah
bobby says its fine he dont consider it cheating now

verse 2
red hair with a curl
melloroll for the flavor and the eyes were peeping
cant keep away from the girl
these two sides of my brain need to have a meeting

refrain
cant think of anything to do yeah
my left brain knows that all love is fleeting
shes just looking for something new yeah
i said it once before but it bears repeating now
