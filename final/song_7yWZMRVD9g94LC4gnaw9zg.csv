baby i know that you gotta go
its a whim or a plan either way i hope
there’s a beach in it
your friday nights are barefoot in the sand
theres music and lights in your left hand
has a beer in it yeah i hope the coast is clear in it
oh i love you and ill leave it at that
it’s okay if you don look back

chorus
if my 98 pontiac gets to drivin through your dreams
gets you flyin round this old town in that same ol shotgun seat
when you open your eyes and that pretty little mind has a memory in it
i hope theres still a little me in it

verse 2
you ain’t got to call you ain’t got to write
if the lonely gets you dialin for my voice one night
’cause you miss hearin it ill try not to have a tear in it
wont try to talk you back into us
i’ll keep my mouth and my broken heart shut

chorus
if my 98 pontiac gets to drivin through your dreams
gets you flyin round this old town in that same ol shotgun seat
when you open your eyes and that pretty little mind has a memory in it
i hope theres still a little me in it

chorus
if my 98 pontiac gets to drivin through your dreams
