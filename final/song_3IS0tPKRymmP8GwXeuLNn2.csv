you say you love me
but they feel like words to me
well this just aint working
stop thinking you can run over me
drifting settling
off to a foreign place
if i cant see whats in front of me
its a mystery well then apparently

prechorus
things just aint the same
and im ready for change
go on be gone
bye bye so long

chorus
cant you see that youre fading fading fading
faaading away away away away
i opened up my eyes and i finally realized
today today its too late
youre fading away

verse 2
put a sock in it just stop running your mouth
got my mind made up i aint coming back again
no way no way no way no way
cause im so fed up boy you got me messed up
if we hooking back up dont press your luck today today
im blowing you away yeah yeah

bridge
saw you turn into a ghost right in front of my eyes
tell me whats a girl to do when shes crying inside
im about to go insane im jumping off this train
whether wrong or right ill be gone by night

faaading away away away away
i opened up my eyes and i finally realized
today today its too late
youre fading away12embed"
