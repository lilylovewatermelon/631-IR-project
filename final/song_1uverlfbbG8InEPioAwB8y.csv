it aint the time for you to walk
if i won’t let go
i can tell that aint what you want
but it’s like you can’t let it show
girl i’ve tried again and again
to give you all of me but you deny girl that aint right
and i chose you ‘cause you’re all i need
and you chose your man but your man ain’t me
so don’t call my phone acting like you care
i done made my move i know life ain’t fair
what you want got what you want
what you need got what you need
you don’t love you don’t love no more
its like you don’t feel its like you don’t feel
what you want got what you want
what you need got what you need
you don’t love what you want baby
its like you don’t feel its like you don’t feel
what you want act like you aint got no love for me
what you need got what you need
you don’t love
its like you don’t feelyou might also like8embed"
