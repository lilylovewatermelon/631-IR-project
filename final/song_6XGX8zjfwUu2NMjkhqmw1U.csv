excuse the mess i didn’t see you from behind
i caught a glimpse but the reflection’s only mine
it’s almost like i’m paralyzed and locked outside myself
what i don’t need is to concede because i won’t be someone else

prechorus
i am not perfect
i don’t claim to be
if that’s what you wanted
well then i’m so sorry

chorus
how about a better version of the way that i am
how about a better version that makes me understand
how about a better version of the way that i am
the way i look the way i speak how about a better version of me

verse 2
excuse the wall i put it up from time to time
a silver shade and the design is all mine
it’s just a maze that everyday i seem to be stuck in
it never seems to fade away but i pray for the day it ends

prechorus
i am not perfect
i don’t claim to be
if that’s what you wanted
well then i’m so sorry

show me my vital signs until i’m realigned
show me my vital signs until i’m realigned

how about a better version of me
how about a better version of me
how about a better version of me
how about a better version
