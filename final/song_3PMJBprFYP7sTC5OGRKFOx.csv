time does tell
that even if they say so
shed be the one that would know
that i did do what ive done
and i wouldnt call it cheating
id just say i was leading her on
why walk while i run away

prechorus
you you ask me what went wrong
me ill write you this last song
please just tell me one way we can win
one one more thing before i go
two the one who loves me so
three dont make me count to three again

chorus
happy endings
just what did you do
if youre a dream then come true
stop pretending
that what you mean isnt what you say
hopeful dreaming
of times before the pain wishing it was still the same
loving leaving
round and round and round we go again
see the allamerican rejects liveget tickets as low as 245you might also likeverse 2
walks alone have often lead to thinking
my love for you is sinking to what seems an all time low
or high the limits never ending
and dont you know im sending
theres no venture i wont go
for you

prechorus
you you ask me what went wrong
me ill write you this last song
please just tell me one way we can win
one one more thing before i go
two the one who loves me so
three dont make me count to three again

chorus
happy endings
just what did you do
if youre a dream then come true
stop pretending
that what you mean isnt what you say
hopeful dreaming
of times before the pain wishing it was still the same
loving leaving
round and round and round we go again
again again again again
again again again again
bridge
she walks away she talks away
she walks away
she walks away she talks away
away away

chorus
happy endings
just what did you do
if youre a dream then come true
stop pretending
that what you mean isnt what you say
hopeful dreaming
of times before the pain wishing it was still the same
loving leaving
round and round and round we go again
happy endings
just what did you do
if youre a dream then come true
stop pretending
that what you mean isnt what you say
hopeful dreaming
of times before the pain wishing it was still the same
