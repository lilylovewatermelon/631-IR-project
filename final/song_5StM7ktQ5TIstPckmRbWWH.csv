verse
these niggas moving funny like they in stilettos in stilettos
tell em leggo like im talkin bout the eggo bout the eggo
my beak my beak for your beak for your beak
cause i can turn your b into who i see who i see
its striking striking the lightning the lightning
cause i be icy like a cup of icee ayy ayy ayy ayy
exciting im frightening ayy
im on they ass like a fuckin bike seat okay
big ass belt buckle like captain knuckles
let my nuts hang like iâ€™m yo favorite uncle
royal like rumble but no need to tussle
they threw you the backhand and what you did fumble
beat on that pussy then dust off my knuckles
no fast n furious car i got muscle
they say they killers like chucky i chuckle
i keep some guns and some bands in a duffle water
