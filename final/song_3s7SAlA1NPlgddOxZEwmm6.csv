verse
crush a bit little bit roll it up take a hit
at the party with my homies walk up and they play my shit
on the road tickets sold didn’t have to sell my soul
visionary in this bitch and domination is the goal
where you stay every day just got my crib in la
never play we been at it way before that idj
never seems to be enough when money is the motive cuh
bitches on my dick don’t give a fuck y’all must not know what’s up
in the cut we don’t give a fuck we just trying to cut
line em up if they say they bout it then we’ll sign em up
rattpack that’s a fact basic bitch can’t fuck with that
where you at that’s what they be asking i say on the map

who we are the coolest motherfuckers on the planet
drop that new shit just cause they demand it
living like we got it cause we get it
do it just to say we fucking did it
