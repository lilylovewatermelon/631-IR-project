i dont know why shes with me
i only brought her trouble since the day she met me
if i was her by now i woulda left me
i woulda walked away by now
broken away somehow i swear she forgave me
she said a womans gotta do what she gotta do
even if it means she denied herself the truth yeah
cause when youre in too deep you wake up when its too late

refrain danny odonoghue
youve fallen in love in the worst way
and if you dont go now then youll stay yeah
cause ill never let you leave never let you breathe
cause if youre looking for heaven baby it sure as hell aint me yo
so walk away

verse 2 bob
so if you want then i suggest you walk
why are we up this hour knockin pictures off the wall
tell me what does that resolve i guess its my fault
the truth is never easy when you gotta get it off
and girl im so exhausted yes all this makes me nauseous
this is just the way that i am you cannot alter it
im sorry that i couldnt be your fantasy
if this aint what you want then you should leave

but still she stays walk away walk away
but still she stays

verse 3 danny odonoghue
shes standing in the heart of darkness
saying i know you got a soul even though youre heartless
how could any woman in their right mind be so blind
to find something to save
stead of walking with me she shoulda walked away
she finds colour in the darkest places
she finds beauty in the saddest of faces
for such a clued in headstrong city girl
coulda had the world but

refrain danny odonoghue
youve fallen in love in the worst way
and if you dont go now then youll stay
cause ill never let you leave never let you breathe
cause if youre looking for heaven baby it sure as hell aint me
so walk away

verse 4 bob
as i fall a thousand miles an hour downward
now that youre gone i guess its true words have power
i guess what i said left a taste so sour
in your mouth you wanted me to see what lifes like without you
and so i lay awake watchin dvds
season one season two even season three
im sorry that i couldnt be inside your fantasy
but if this aint what you want then you should leave
break danny odonoghue  bob
but still she stays walk away walk away
you should leave
but still she stays walk away walk away
