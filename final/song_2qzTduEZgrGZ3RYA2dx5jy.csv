psalm 27 lord is my light my salvation
whom shall i fear lord forgive me for my sins
i aint cryin i aint cryin cause i have sinned
the lord is the strength of my life of whom shall i be afraid
and before i wrap up this port of miami please lord please lord
when the wicked even my enemies and foes came upon me to eat up my flesh
theres a lot of my brothers and sisters they stumbled and fell
they wasnt here to watch this come to pass
though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear
and since i cant do shit else imma say a prayer amen
though war should rise in this i shall be confident
amen

verse 2
this was 12 years in the makin
no side deals with satan
im dealin with the maker straight up
a lot of homies ask whats a prayer
a prayer is what kept me focused 12 years
a prayer is what saved me i shouldve been indicted

a prayer is what kept me here when them bullets cut the air
i fell and i just said a prayer
