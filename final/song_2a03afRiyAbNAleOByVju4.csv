i guess if i can let this moment slip away
cause i got my eye on you
i see you looking over your shoulder
let me make my way over

pre hook
excuse me miss lady how you doing
your body looking right
youre the type i like
can i pursue and
can i get a little closer
so i can get to know you
and exchange names and thangs
before the night is over

all i really want is for you to back it up
go on and put your weight on it
cause its alright
do what you wanna
make me believe ya

rap verse
jeans tight high heels
this is how you make me feel
lips glossed teeth white
apple bottoms let me bite
spend the night catch a flight
we can do whatwhat you like
feeling right ya smelling good
let get this understood
is there something youre not telling me
are you the daughter of frankie beverly
its the way you move
the way you groove
im a fan and youre the celebrity
she doing freaky stuff
shawty got me geeked up
like fabo i got playdoh
let me show you street love

hook
all i really want is for you to back it up
go on and put your weight on it
cause its alright
do what you wanna
make me believe ya
oooh i wanna see ya
