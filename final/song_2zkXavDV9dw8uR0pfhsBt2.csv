looks innocent enough doesnt it
but sometimes there are dangers involved
that never meet the eye
no matter where you meet a stranger
be careful if they are too friendly

verse 1
hey a casual affair
that could go anywhere
and only for tonight
take any moment any time
a lover on the left
a sinner on the right

chorus
just lay in the atmosphere
a casual affair
hushhush baby dont you say a word
lay in the atmosphere
a casual affair

verse 2
break involuntary ties
a secret so the spies
could never find us out
stay for as long as you have time
so the mess that well become
leaves something to talk about

just lay in the atmosphere
a casual affair
hushhush baby dont you say a word
lay in the atmosphere
a casual affair
