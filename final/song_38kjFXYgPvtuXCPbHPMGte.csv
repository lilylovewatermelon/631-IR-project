as long as you notice
im hoping that youll keep your heart open
ill keep mine open too
if you dont ask i wont tell
just know that just know that
it all hurts it all hurts just the same

chorus 1
something is wrong i cant explain
everything changed when the birds came
youll never know what they might do if they catch you too early
we need to fly ourselves before someone else tells us how
something is off i feel like prey i feel like praying

verse 2
as long as you notice
im hoping that youll keep your heart open
ill keep mine open too
so so ill probably take you aside
and tell you whats on my mind
but you youll just keep it inside
probably tell me that youre alright

and if you go then i’ll never grow

if you run ill be sure to let you fly

chorus 2

we need to fly ourselves before someone else tells us how
something is off i feel like prey i feel like praying
something is off i feel like prey i feel like praying
