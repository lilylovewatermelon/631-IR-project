you think you know me
you dont know shit
ive seen the world through your eyes
and it makes me sick
ive questioned all of your answers
theyre fucking lies
i wont conform to your system
id rather die

chorus
ill burn it down just to watch it go
ill burn it down so everybody knows
ill burn it down just to see it torched
burn it down i hate it to the core

verse 2
think youre a martyr
not hard to see
you want to rule the fucking world
you got to get through me
your iron fist will be broken
no soul to sell
you think ill burn for my actions
see you in hell

burn it down i do it for myself
burn it down for me and no one else
i burn it down just to watch it fall
burn it down i hate you fucking all

chorus
ill burn it down just to watch it go
