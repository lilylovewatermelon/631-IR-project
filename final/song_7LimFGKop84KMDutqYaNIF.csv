hey i was always the crazy one broke into the stadium
and i wrote your number on the fiftyyard line
you were always the perfect one and a valedictorian so
under your number i wrote call for a good time
i only wanted to get your attention
but you overlooked me somehow
besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
and i played my guitar too loud
how do you like me now

chorus
how do you like me now now that im on my way
do you still think im crazy standing here today
i couldnt make you love me but i always dreamed about
livin in your radio how do you like me now

verse 2
when i took off to tennessee i heard that you made fun of me
never imagined id make it this far
then you married into money girl aint it a cruel and funny world
he took your dreams and he tore them apart
he never comes home and youre always alone
and your kids hear you cry down the hall
alarm clock starts ringing who could that be singin
