verse 1 patrick stump
last summer we took threes across the board
but by fall we were a cover story now in stores

prechorus patrick stump
make us poster boys for your scene
but we are not making an acceptance speech
i found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes
every dot coms refreshing for a journal update

chorus patrick stump
so long live the car crash hearts cry on the couch and
all the poets come to life fix me in fortyfive
so long live the car crash hearts cry on the couch and
all the poets come to life fix mе in fortyfive

verse 2 patrick stump
i can take your problems away with a nod and a wavе
of my hand cause thats just the kind of boy that i am

prechorus patrick stump
the only thing i havent done yet is die
and its me and my plus one at the afterlife
crowds are won and lost and won again
but our hearts beat for the diehards
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus patrick stump
so long live the car crash hearts cry on the couch and
all the poets come to life fix me in fortyfive
so long live the car crash hearts cry on the couch and
all the poets come to life fix me in fortyfive

bridge patrick stump
long live the car crash hearts
long live the car crash hearts
long live the car crash hearts
long live the car crash hearts

chorus patrick stump
so long live the car crash hearts cry on the couch and
all the poets come to life fix me in fortyfive hehe woo
