i dont believe
in the smile that you leave me with
when you walk away and say goodbye
well i dont expect
the world to move underneath me
but for gods sake could you try
i know that youre true to me
youre always there you say you care
i know that you wanna be mine

chorus
where is your heart
cause i dont really feel you
where is your heart
what i really want is to believe you
is it so hard to give me what i need
i want your heart to bleed
and thats all im asking for
oh where is your heart

verse 2
i dont understand
your love is so cold
its always me thats reaching out for your hand
and ive always dreamed
that love would be effortless
like a petal falling to the ground
a dreamer following his dream
