in my home town
for anyone who sticks around
youre either lost or youre found
theres not much in between
in my home town
everythings still black and white
its a long long way from wrong to right
from sunday morning to saturday night

chorus
everybody just wants to get high
sit and watch a perfect world go by
were all looking for love and meaning in our lives
we follow the roads that lead us
to drugs or jesus

verse 2
my whole life
ive tried to run ive tried to hide
from the stained glass windows in my mind
refusing to let gods light shine
down on me
down on me

chorus
everybody just wants to get high
sit and watch a perfect world go by
were all looking for love and meaning in our lives
theres not much space between us
drugs or jesus yeah

everyones just looking for the truth

chorus
everybody just wants to get high
sit and watch a perfect world go by
were all looking for love and meaning in our lives
we follow the roads that lead us
to drugs or jesus
