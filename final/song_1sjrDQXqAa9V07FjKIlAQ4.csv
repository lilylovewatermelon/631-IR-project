memories are just where you leave them
drag the waters til the depths give up their dead
what did you expect to find
was it something you left behind
dont you remember anything i said when i said

chorus
dont fall away and leave me to myself
dont fall away and leave love bleeding
in my hands in my hands again
leave love bleeding
in my hands in my hands
love lies bleeding

verse 2
oh hold me now i feel contagious
am i the only place that youve left to go
she cries her life is like
some movie black and white
dead actors faking lines
over and over and over again she cries

chorus
dont fall away and leave me to myself
dont fall away and leave love bleeding
in my hands in my hands again
leave love bleeding
in my hands in my hands
love lies bleeding
you might also likebridge
and i wanted you to turn away
you dont remember but i do
you never even tried

chorus
dont fall away and leave me to myself
dont fall away and leave love bleeding
in my hands in my hands again
leave love bleeding
in my hands in my hands again
leave love bleeding
in my hands in my hands again

outro
