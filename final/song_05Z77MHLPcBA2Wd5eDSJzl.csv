dont panic no not yet
i know im the one you want to forget
cue all the love to leave my heart
its time for me to fall apart

prechorus
now youre gone but ill be okay
your hot whiskey eyes have fanned the flame
maybe ill burn a little brighter tonight
let the fire breathe me back to life

chorus
baby you were my picket fence i miss missing you now and then
chlorine kissed summer skin i miss missing you now and then
sometimes before it gets better the darkness gets bigger
the person that youd take a bullet for is behind the trigger
oh were fading fast i miss missing you now and then

verse 2
making eyes at this husk around my heart
i see through you when were sitting in the dark
so give me your filth make it rough
let me let me trash your love

prechorus
i will sing to you every day
if it will take away the pain
oh and ive heard you got it got it so bad
cause i am the best youll never have

baby you were my picket fence i miss missing you now and then
chlorine kissed summer skin i miss missing you now and then
sometimes before it gets better the darkness gets bigger
the person that youd take a bullet for is behind the trigger
