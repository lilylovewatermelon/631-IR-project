all this feels strange and untrue
and i wont waste a minute without you
my bones ache my skin feels cold
and im getting so tired and so old
the anger swells in my guts
and i wont feel these slices and cuts
i want so much to open your eyes
cause i need you to look into mine

chorus
tell me that youll open your eyes
tell me that youll open your eyes
tell me that youll open your eyes
tell me that youll open your eyes

verse 2
get up get out get away from these liars
cause they dont get your soul or your fire
take my hand knot your fingers through mine
and well walk from this dark room for the last time
every minute from this minute now
we can do what we like anywhere
i want so much to open your eyes
cause i need you to look into mine

tell me that youll open your eyes
tell me that youll open your eyes
tell me that youll open your eyes
tell me that youll open your eyes
tell me that youll open your eyes
tell me that youll open your eyes
tell me that youll open your eyes
tell me that youll open your eyes
