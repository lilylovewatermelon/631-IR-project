times were hard and things were bad
but theres a silver lining behind every cloud
just poor people thats all we were
trying to make a living out of black land dirt
wed get together in a family circle singing loud

daddy sang bass
mama sang tenor
me and little brother would join right in there
singing seems to help a troubled soul
one of these days and it wont be long
ill rejoin them in a song
im going to join the family circle at the throne
no the circle wont be broken
by and by lord by and by

daddy sang bass
mama sang tenor
me and little brother would join right in there
in the sky lord in the sky
now i remember after work
mama would call in all of us
you could hear us singing for a country mile
now little brother has done gone on
but ill rejoin him in a song
well be together again up yonder in a little while

daddy sang bass

me and little brother would join right in there
