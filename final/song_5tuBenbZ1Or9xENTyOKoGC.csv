im losing my mind
why the hell did i paint these walls white
and i wonder whats the point of this life
sometimes ill pray but i will never close my eyes

verse 2
i want to be happy
find a man with an old name just like me
and get over how my dog is my best friend
and he doesnt even know what my name is

chorus
jonny did you ever love me
jonny help me figure it out
not that ive paid attention
but you havent said it out loud
jonny do you see what youre doing
what youre making me think about
this wasnt posed to be a love song
but i guess it is now

bridge
jonny maybe youll never hear this
or maybe its stuck in your head
well i hope it makes you cry
the way that i did
