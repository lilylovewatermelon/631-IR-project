did you stand there all alone
oh i cannot explain whats going down
i can see you standing next to me
in and out somewhere else right now
you sigh look away
i can see it clear as day
close your eyes so afraid
hide behind that baby face

prechorus
dododo dododo

chorus
you can drive all night
looking for the answers in the pouring rain
you wanna find peace of mind
looking for the answer

verse 2
funny how it seems like yesterday
as i recall you were looking out of place
gathered up your things and slipped away
no time at all i followed you into the hall
cigarette daydreams
you were only seventeen
so sweet with a mean streak
nearly brought me to my knees
see cage the elephant liveget tickets as low as 399you might also likeprechorus

chorus
you can drive all night
looking for the answers in the pouring rain
you wanna find peace of mind
looking for the answer
if we can find a reason a reason to change
looking for the answer
if you can find a reason a reason to stay
standing in the pouring rain

you can drive all night
looking for the answers in the pouring rain
you wanna find peace of mind
looking for the answer
if we can find a reason a reason to change
looking for the answer
if you can find a reason a reason to stay
