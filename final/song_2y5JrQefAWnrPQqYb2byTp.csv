verse 1
you’re no better off
living your life
than dreaming at night
this much is true
but it’s still up to you
to take my advice

chorus
to take it slowly brother
let it go now brother
take it slowly brother
let it go
go home go home
go home go home

verse 2
you’re better off dead
when your mind’s been set
from nine until five
how could it be true
well it’s happened to you
so take my advice

and take it slowly brother
let it go now brother
take it slowly brother
let it go
go home go home
go home go home
go home go home
go home go home11embed"
