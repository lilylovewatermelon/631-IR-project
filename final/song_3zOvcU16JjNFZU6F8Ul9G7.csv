hey girl i know this shit might sound crazy
before you get in bed throw on those heels
hey girl now i know why you waited
had to be sure that i was worth the thrill
ladies come and go but you got something different
had me so addicted from the start
and id never known all this loving id be missing
if i didnt work my way into your heart

chorus jason derulo  jordin sparks
