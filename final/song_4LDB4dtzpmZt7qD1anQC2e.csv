i think i met my match again
standing round the candlelight
in the middle of this blizzard
you stood and melted all the ice

chorus
oh its only love
oh its only love
oh if only love comes round again
it will have been worth the ride

verse 2
you were master of so many
savior to none
i waged all of my hopes so plenty on you
now look what ive become

chorus
oh its only love
oh its only love
oh if only love comes round again
it will have been worth the ride
and what a ride

bridge
sometimes lonely is not only a word
but faces i have known
and if you see me could you free me with a smile
so i can let go

oh its only love
oh its only love
oh if only love comes round again
it will have been comes round again
it will have been worth the ride
worth the ride
and what a ride
