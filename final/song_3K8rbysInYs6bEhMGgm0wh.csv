hes drunk again its time to fight
she must have done something wrong tonight
the living room becomes a boxing ring
its time to run when you see him
clenching his hands
shes just a woman
never again

verse 2
i hear her scream from down the hall
amazing she can even talk at all
she cries to me go back to bed
im terrified that shell wind up
dead in his hands
shes just a woman
never again

chorus
been there before but not like this
seen it before but not like this
never before have i ever
seen it this bad
shes just a woman
never again

just tell the nurse you slipped and fell
it starts to sting as it starts to swell
she looks at you she wants the truth
its right out there in the waiting room
with those hands
looking just as sweet as he can
never again

chorus
seen it before but not like this
been there before but not like this
never before have i ever
seen it this bad
shes just a woman
never again
never again

fathers a name you havent earned yet
youre just a child with a temper
havent you heard dont hit a lady
kicking your ass would be a pleasure

verse 4
hes drunk again its time to fight
same old shit just on a different night
she grabs the gun shes had enough
tonight shell find out how fucking
tough is this man
pulls the trigger as fast as she can
never again
chorus
seen it before but not like this
been there before but not like this
never before have i ever
seen it this bad
shes just a woman
never again
seen it before but not like this
been there before but not like this

seen it this bad
shes just a woman
never again
