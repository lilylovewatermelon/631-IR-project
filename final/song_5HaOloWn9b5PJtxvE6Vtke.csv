i see color bars when i come
sgt rock broke the key off in the lock
to where i come from
sir no sir we have no power in the air
the battles on the ground
laying low again high on the sound

verse 2
bruno s is a man to me
youre just some dude with a stilted attitude
that you learned from tv
youll undo but ill be connecting everything
the traffic in my town
riding high again high on the sound

outro
everyone wants me to ride into the sun
but i aint gonna go down
laying low again high on the soundyou might also like1embed"
