for those days we felt like a mistake
those times when loves what you hate
somehow
we keep marchin on
for those nights when i couldnt be there
ive made it harder to know that you know
that somehow
well keep moving on

prechorus
theres so many wars we fought
theres so many things were not
but with what we have
i promise you that
were marchin on
were marchin on
were marchin on

chorus 1
for all of the plans weve made
there isnt a flag id wave
dont care if we bend
id sink us to swim
were marchin on
were marchin on
were marchin on

for those doubts that swirl all around us
for those lives that tear at the seams
we know
were not what weve seen oh
for this dance well move with each other
there aint no other step than one foot
right in front of the other

prechorus
theres so many wars we fought
theres so many things were not
but with what we have
i promise you that
were marchin on
were marchin on

well have the days we break
and well have the scars to prove it
well have the bonds that we save
but well have the heart not to lose it
for all of the times weve stopped
for all of the things im not
we put one foot in front of the other
we move like we aint got no other
we go when we go
were marchin on
were marchin on

theres so many wars we fought
theres so many things were not
but with what we have
i promise you that
