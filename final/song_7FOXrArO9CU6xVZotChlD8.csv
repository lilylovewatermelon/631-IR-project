most stared up in the club just swagging doing my thang
popping bottles with models and just watching them drank
partying so hard the ladies dont want it to end
they looked at me and said

baby im a troublemaker
i heard that youre a heartbreaker i said
baby im a troublemaker

baby im a troublemaker
i heard that youre a heartbreaker i said
baby im a troublemaker

verse 1 akon
see im that type of guy you wont love
im that type of guy you wont cuff
im that type of guy your daddy wont let you go out
cause he thinks i sell drugs
im that type of guy that will save ya
im that type that will call you later
wont be around to give you that time
gotta get on the grind and get to that paper
that i can do
gotta keep my baby girl laced in the latest and the fliest suits
never one for none lets stay caked up hold it down thats all you gotta do
then i walk up in the place with a pocket full of money my brother like i are the dude
stepping out with the finest suits look at me now

im that type that will pop the clip and
im that type of guy that put you in your place
if your bougie just start tripping

that everywhere i go i can find a pretty ho
but there aint too many know how to get that dough
thats the type of girl i want around me
even though im a with her make a man feel free
roll with the fellas even hold my cheese
look like something you would see on tv
she dont mind climbing up that ladder
similar to the words it dont matter
but this time they wanna see us together

verse 3 akon
youre not for sure
even though i wanna take you everywhere i go
because of you all the girls is staring taking notes
and i realize being with you girls bring more girls
and thats just what im attracted to
and id rather go all the way
love her long time till the break of day
i wont let her ever leave my bed
till she sees the color purple like anna mae
now she wants to start holding on me like whatever shes smoking on
ill be long gone before you can say look at me now
