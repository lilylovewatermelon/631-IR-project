look to history

verse 1
the politicians say theyre right
and stoke the fire till the ash turns white
they say survivals everything
but as for me i dont say a thing oh yeah

prechorus
how long must i still fight
woahoh
watching other countries plight
woahoh

chorus
just look back to history
you will see that its filled with greed
the only way to get ahead
is exploit the weak and to burn your dead

postchorus
just look to history

bridge
society in moral decay
here tomorrow or gone today
ah yeah
