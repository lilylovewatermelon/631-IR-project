so this is how it goes
well i i would have never known
and if it ends today
well ill still say that you shine brighter than anyone

chorus
now i think were taking this too far
dont you know that
its not this hard
well its not this hard
but if you take whats yours and i take mine
must we go there
please not this time
no not this time

verse 2
well this is not your fault
but if im without you then i will feel so small
and if you have to go
well always know that you shine brighter than anyone does

chorus
now i think were taking this too far
dont you know that
its not this hard
well its not this hard
but if you take whats yours and i take mine
must we go there
please not this time
no not this time
