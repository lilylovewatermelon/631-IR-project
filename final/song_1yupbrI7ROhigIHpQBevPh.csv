i fell in love again
all things go all things go
drove to chicago
all things know all things know
we sold our clothes to the state
i dont mind i dont mind
i made a lot of mistakes
in my mind in my mind

all things go all things go
to recreate us
all things grow all things grow
we had our mind set
all things know all things know
you had to find it
all things go all things go

in my mind in my mind
i made a lot of mistakes
