my demons are begging me to open up my mouth
i need them
mechanically make the words come out
they fight me vigorous and angry
watch them pounce
ignite me
licking up the flames they bring about

prechorus
i sold my soul to a threepiece
and he told me i was holy
he’s got me down on both knees
but it’s the devil thats tryna

chorus
hold me down hold me down
sneaking out the back door make no sound
knock me out knock me out
saying that i want more this is what i live for
hold me down hold me down
throw me in the deep end watch me drown
knock me out knock me out
saying that i want more this is what i live for

verse 2
selfish
taking what i want and call it mine
i’m helpless
clinging to a little bit of spine
they rush me
telling me i’m running out of time
they shush me shh
walking me across a fragile line
