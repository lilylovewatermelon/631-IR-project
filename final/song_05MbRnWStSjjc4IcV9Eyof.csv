she used to be the happiest girl i knew and
i remember seeing her laugh
i remember the time she cried
when tears fill her eyes
as we sang love song by tesla
her smile is turning upside down
shes got a boyfriend now

chorus
shes got a boyfriend now
and its hard to see
what shes got herself into
shes getting used to
the loneliness thats bottled up inside
she knows shell stick right through the sad times
and all the bad times
cuz its up to her to make some sense somehow
shes got a boyfriend now

verse 2
she always knew shed find the right guy
whod hold her through the night
someone shed take to meet her mom
and take her to see britney spears
who knows if clark kent is a superman
or if hes just an asshole
leading on and on
and on and on and on
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likechorus
yeah shes got a boyfriend now
and its hard to see
what shes got herself into
shes getting used to
the loneliness thats bottled up inside
she knows shell stick right through the sad times
and all the bad times
cuz its up to her to make some sense somehow
shes got a boyfriend now
shes got a boyfriend now

bridge
why does it always have to be
guys like that always get to be the one
she thinks the world of
and why does it always have to be
girls like that cant ever find someone
someone like me
and its hard to know the difference
between inside and out
when she asks if i can mend her broken heart
i wouldnt know where to start
she got what she always wanted
she got what she always wanted
she got what she always wanted
chorus
shes got a boyfriend now shes only crying on the inside
and its hard to see
what shes got herself into
shes getting used to shes only crying on the inside
the loneliness thats bottled up inside
she knows shell stick right through the sad times shes only crying on the inside
and all the bad times
cuz its up to her to make some sense somehow shes only crying on the inside
shes got a boyfriend now

chorus
shes got a boyfriend now
and its hard to see
what shes got herself into shes got a boyfriend now
shes getting used to
the loneliness thats bottled up inside shes got a boyfriend now
she knows shell stick right through the sad times
and all the bad times shes got a boyfriend now
cuz its up to her to make some sense somehow
