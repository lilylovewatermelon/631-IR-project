the artifice and all they lack we dont need them anymore
i dont have the means and so it seems for now i cant participate
but ive waited long now the dollars strong again i still cant participate
when we dont consume it seems we are immune to all of the thoughts they sell
you know as well as i thats a lie

cause i want to spend i want to spend
in a neverending story but it always ends
i want to spend i want to spend
in a neverending story but it always ends

and when i die the angels will try to count all my belongings
to measure my worth pure gold solid dirt to see if im worth keeping
but the house i rent and the car i drive im sorry but they aint mine
you know as well as i thats no lie

cause i want to spend i want to spend
in a neverending story but it always ends
i want to spend i want to spend
in a neverending story but it always ends
and it always ends and it always endsyou might also likeembed"
