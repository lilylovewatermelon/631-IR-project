its been seven minutes now since ive lost my way
it doesnt seem that long but my whole world has changed
its in all the little things when you smile now it stings
its been seven minutes since ive lost the girl of my dreams
its been half an hour now since i dropped you home
and im driving past the places we both know
past the bar where we first kissed and that movie that we missed
cause we were hanging out in the parking lot
now i sink a little deeper think a little clearer
looking at myself through these newfound eyes

prechorus
is it too late to turn around
im already halfway out of town
now i know how i let you down
oh i finally figured it out

chorus
i forgot to love you love you love you
i forgot to love you love you love you

verse 2
radios playing songs for me and you
chasing cars reminds me of nights in your room
drinking wine under your window back when life was so damn simple
how the hell did i end up losing you mmm

chorus
i forgot to love you love you love you

i forgot to love you love you

if i came back now would you still be there
if i come around would you even care
if i came back now would you still be there
if i come around would you even care

prechorus
is it too late to turn around
im already halfway out of town
now i know how i let you down
oh i finally figured it out
