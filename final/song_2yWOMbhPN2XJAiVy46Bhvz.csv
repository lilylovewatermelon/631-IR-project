grace she takes the blame
she covers the shame
removes the stain it could be her name
grace its a name for a girl
its also a thought that changed the world
and when she walks on the street you can hear the strings
grace finds goodness in everything

verse 2
grace shes got the walk
not on a ramp or on chalk
shes got the time to talk
she travels outside of karma karma
she travels outside of karma
when she goes to work you can hear her strings
grace finds beauty in everything

verse 3
grace she carries a world on her hips
no champagne flute for her lips
no twirls or skips between her fingertips
she carries a pearl in perfect condition
what once was hurt what once was friction
what left a mark no longer stings
because grace makes beauty out of ugly things

grace finds beauty in everything
grace finds goodness in everything3embed"
