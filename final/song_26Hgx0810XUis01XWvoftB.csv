here we go again okay big body benz skrrt
cut off all my friends yeah choppers for my enemies
go and ask the streets about lil dominique i been a beast
really got my name from shootin dice and sellin niggas weed
557 223s 308s go through a car door
all the houses paid off none of my hoes aint got no car note
sell a thousand scream free ralo
baby you should stop it i know
everythings a profit for sure
pilot waitin on us lets go
still be in the projects with coldhearted and q ball
wreck the rari buy a new one tomorrow im too raw
i got foreigns all colors like a pack of starburst
when they ask me how it happened i just tell em god works
im tryna touch me a billi still hustle like im on zero
really done saved some niggas thats why they call me the hero
trappin like this shit legal im tryna uplift my people
i used to serve in a regal i turned em into believers yeah

my life really a miracle my bitches say im magical
i still fuck with lil critical i ran through more then half of them
i put on for that avenue i had to bust my ass for this word
how a bitch who never even met me gon try to tell my business
how someone i only had sex with once gon try to have a kid by me
once you cross that line you dead really thats how it is with me
brodie got rich off of percs he sell em twentyfive a piece
my lil scamminass bitch made quartermillion in a week
i aint never thirsty run into a ho and dont even speak
got that blick on me in public hope they think its only me
this shit different they gotta go through my assistant just to reach me
if nobody else gon show em ill teach em ill teach em
