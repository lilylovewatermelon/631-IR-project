up on a hill heres where we begin
this little story a long time ago
start to pretend stop pretendin
it seems this game is simply neverendin

prechorus
oh in the sun sun havin fun its in my blood
i just cant help it
dont want you here right now let me go
oh let me ggggggggo

chorus
leaving just in time stay there for a while
rollin in the ocean tryin to catch her eye
work hard and say its easy do it just to please me
tomorrow will be different so ill pretend im leaving
