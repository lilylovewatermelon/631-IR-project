verse 1
you think youve got your way
but baby theres a catch
dont need your foul play
now you have met your match
you think youre in control
but that wont last that long
you thought you wore the crown
honey you were wrong

prechorus
you had me taken in but know ive found you out
and i wont go through that again
youve always had to win
youll have to go without
you dont know where to stop
no no no no

chorus
go go go go go ill get over you
you drive me crazy up the wall
think youre mr “know it all”
go go go go go ill get over you
you drive me crazy up the wall
goodbye mr “know it all”

i let you have your say
you never compromised
complaining everyday about everything in sight
ive let you stay awhile
now i am getting bored
no substance in your style and
youre not the man you thought you were

and i wont go through that again
youve always had to win
youll have to go without
you dont know where to stop ill get over you
no no no no

chorus
go go go go go ill get over you
you drive me crazy up the wall
think youre mr “know it all”
go go go go go ill get over you
you drive me crazy up the wall
goodbye mr “know it all” ill get over you
