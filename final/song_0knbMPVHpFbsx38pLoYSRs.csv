its bugging me grating me
and twisting me around
yeah im endlessly caving in
and turning inside out

chorus
cause i want it now i want it now
give me your heart and your soul
and im breaking out im breaking out
last chance to lose control

verse 2
yeah its holding me morphing me
and forcing me to strive
to be endlessly cold within
and dreaming im alive

chorus
cause i want it now i want it now
give me your heart and your soul
im not breaking down im breaking out
last chance to lose control
