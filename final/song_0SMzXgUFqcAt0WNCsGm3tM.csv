i was walking through the streets i could not hear my best friend call
he was feeling incomplete about to take his final fall
last thing i remember there were tears of blood and just not mine
any other day and i would save you from this cold decline

chorus
everything they said about everything
was a coming undone its a life supreme
i do and i dont well i do and i dont oh yeah yeah
feasting on the flowers so fast and young
its a light so bright that i bite my tongue
i do and i dont well i do and i dont oh yeah yeah
the next dimension show me in

verse 2
we were moving in the world expanding your realities
a force of nature on the verge commanding abnormalities
last thing i remember there was ringing in my selfish ears
twentysix a number much too small for someones golden years

chorus
everything they said about everything
was a coming undone its a life supreme
i do and i dont well i do and i dont oh yeah yeah
feasting on the flowers so fast and young
its a light so bright that i bite my tongue
i do and i dont well i do and i dont oh yeah yeah
the next dimension show me in
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likebridge
you get a little bit more this time when
you give a little bit for your brothers kind
like she always said oh dont look back just look ahead
you sing a little bit stronger when you
remember the song of your old best friend
like she always said oh dont look back just look ahead

chorus
everything they said about everything
was a coming undone its a life supreme
i do and i dont well i do and i dont oh yeah yeah
feasting on the flowers so fast and young
its a light so bright that i bite my tongue
i do and i dont well i do and i dont oh yeah yeah2embed"
