come loosen up
so hung up
come count them ways to forever
remember the winter gets cold in ways you always forget

chorus
ah you know
mnnn rhythm and soul
get your hands out your back pockets
boy let it go
here comes the man you saw in kazan
he just fixing his coat
rhythm and soul

verse two
dollars and cents and no accident
not in the name of democracy
come get there
come be there
come let your socks fall down to your shoes

chorus
and you know
the rhythm and soul
get your ankles moving their sockets
ooh there you go
and here comes the man he bought a gift from kazan
he cant leave it alone
oh no rhythm and soul
you might also likeverse three
when you take a picture and it falls in your lap
take another picture and you’re springing the trap
you’ve been sold
you can’t bat this with your eye
change your tie and get wise
rhythm and
tract houses
square couches
short legs and square shoulders
pot holders
egg and soldiers
your tank rollers
you all know this

outro
yeah you know
oooh the rhythm and soul
get your fingers moving their sockets tune in tokyo
you’re just the man
the one i saw in kazan
one of us went for the throat
rhythm andembed"
