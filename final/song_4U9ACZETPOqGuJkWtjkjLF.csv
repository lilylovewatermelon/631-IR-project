theres a picture on the wall
of me on a john deere
jenny handed me a beer
said how the hell did you get there
oh oklahoma
mmmm mm

verse 2
there were flowers that were dry
sittin on the dresser
she asked me where theyre from
i said a place i dont remember
oh oklahoma ohoh

prechorus
jenny jumped into the pool
she was swimmin with nikki lane
she said most men dont want a woman
with a legacy its our bane
she said you cant be a muse and be happy too
you cant blacken the pages with russian poetry
and be happy
and that scared me
cause i met a man who

verse 3
theres a hole thats in my heart
all my women try and heal
theyre doin a good job
convincin me that its not real
its heat lightning ohohoh oh

verse 4
cause theres a man thats in my past
theres a man thats still right here
hes real enough to touch
and in my darkest nights hes shinin
oohoohooh

prechorus
jenny was smokin by the pool
we were writin with nikki lane
i said im scared of the santa clarita fires
i wish that it would rain
i said the power of us three can bring absolutely anything
except that one thing
the diamonds the rust and the rain
the thing that washes away the pain
but thats okay cause
chorus
now when weather turns to may
all my sisters come to paint my banisters green
my blue banisters gray

chuckys makin birthday cake
chickens runnin bare feet theres a baby on the way
and now my blue banisters are green and gray ahah

outro
