cant you imagine how good
going through this will make you feel
i promise no one will ever know

i can hear the voice but i dont wanna listen
strap me down and tell me ill be all right
i can feel the subliminal need to be one with the voice
and make everything go
i can hear the voice but i dont wanna listen
strap me down and tell me ill be all right
i can feel the subliminal need to be one with the voice
and make everything all right
