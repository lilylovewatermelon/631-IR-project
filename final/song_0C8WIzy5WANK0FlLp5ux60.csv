its 6 am and im wide awake
cause i cant stop thinkin
bout the stuff you were sayin to me
and i i cant let it slide
the papers not here yet the suns not up
but im not afraid
to tell you what i feel inside
i had one of those dreams that makes it all so

clear to me now
i got a whole new perspective
its so clear to me now
you cant treat me that way
it appears to me how
long you tried to make me think
it was me who was being the fake
so clear

verse 2
why did i smile when i hurt inside
said i was okay when i knew its a lie
i wanted to believe in you
you took your chances and one was me
so ill just forgive you and set you free
yeah im on my way
yeah im stepping out of the haze and its so

try and maybe i can find better days
