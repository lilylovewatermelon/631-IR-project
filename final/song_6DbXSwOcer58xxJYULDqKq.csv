is not cinone what today were eight
seven and ones eight i hope old curlypate
branches me out his verbtree on the slate
amo as avi atum are ans
up to aturus person tense and mood
quies me cum subjunctivo i could cry
and chews corderius with his morning crust
look eight years onward and hes perched hes perched
dapper and deft on stool beside this chair
cinozzo cinoncello who but he
trying his milkteeth on some crusty case
like this papa shall trituratе full soon
to smooth papinianian pulp

it trots
already through my head though noon be now
doеs suppertime and what belongs to eye
dispose o don o the day first work then play
the proverb bids and then means wont we hold
our little yearly lovesome frolic feast
cinuolos birthnight cinicellos own
that makes gruff january grin perforce
for too contagious grows the mirth the warmth
escaping from so many hearts at once
when the good wife buxom and bonny yet
jokes the hale grandsiresuch are just the sort
to go off suddenlyhe who hides the key
o the box beneath his pillow every night
which box may hold a parchment some one thinks
will show a scribbled something like a name
cinino ciniccino near the end
to whom i give and i bequeath my lands
estates tenements hereditaments
when i decease as honest grandsire ought
whereforeyet this one time again perhaps
shant my orvieto fuddle his old nose
then uncles one or the other well i the world
maydrop in merelytrudge through rain and wind
rather the smellfeasts rouse them at the hint
theres cookery in a certain dwellingplace
gossips too each with keepsake in his poke
will pick the way thrid lane by lanternlight
and so find door put galligaskin off
at entry of a decent domicile
cornered in snug condottiall for love
all to crush cup with cinucciatolo
well
let others climb the heights o the court the camp
how vain are chambering and wantonness
revel and rout and pleasures that make mad
commend me to homejoy the family board
altar and hearth these with a brisk career
a source of honest profit and good fame
just so much work as keeps the brain from rust
just so much play as lets the heart expand
honouring god and serving mani say
these are reality and all elsefluff
nutshell and naughtthank flaccus for the phrase
suppose i had been fisc yet bachelor

why work with a will then wherefore lazy now
turn up the hourglass whence no sandgrain slips
but should have done its duty to the saint
o the day the son and heir thats eight years old
let law come dimple cinoncinos cheek
and latin dumple cinarellos chin
the while we spread him fine and toss him flat
this pulp that makes the pancake trim our mass
of matter into argument the first
prime pleading in defence of our accused
which once awaft on paper wing shall soar
shall signalise before applausive rome
what study and mayhap some motherwit
can do toward making master fop and fisc
old bachelor bottinius bite his thumb
now how good god is how falls plumb to point
this murder gives me guido to defend
now of all days i the year just when the boy
verges on virgil reaches the right age
for some such illustration from his sire
stimulus to himself one might wait years
and never find the chance which now finds me
the fact is theres a blessing on the hearth
a special providence for fatherhood
heres a man and whats more a noble kills
not sneakingly but almost with parade
wifes father and wifes mother and wifes self
thats mothers self of son and heir like mine
and here stand i the favoured advocate
who pluck this flower o the field no solomon
was ever clothed in glorious gold to match
and set the same in cinoncinos cap
i defend guido and his comradesi
pray god i keep me humble not to me
non nobis domine sed tibi laus
how the fop chuckled when they made him fisc
well beat you my bottinius all for love
all for our tribute to cinottos day
why sbuddikins old innocent himself
may rub his eyes at the bustleask whats this
rolling from out the rostrum as a gust
o the pro milone had been prisoned there
and rattled rome awake awaken rome
how can the pope doze on in decency
he needs must wake up also speak his word
have his opinion like the rest of rome
about this huge this hurlyburly case
he wants who can excogitate the truth
give the result in speech plain black and white
to mumble in the mouth and make his own
a little changed good man a little changed
no matter so his gratitude be moved
by when my giacintino gets of age
mindful of who thus helped him at a pinch
archangelus procurator pauperum
and proved hortensius redivivus
whew
to earn the estest merit the minced herb
that mollifies the livers leathery slice
with here a goosefoot there a cockscomb stuck
cemented in an element of cheese
i doubt if dainties do the grandsire good
last june he had a sort of stranglingbah
hes his own master and his will is made
so liver fizz law flit and latin fly
as we rub hands oer dish by way of grace
may i lose cause if i vent one word more
exceptwith freshcut quill we ink the white
propro guidone et sociis there

count guido marriedor in latin due
what duxit in uxoremcommonplace
taedas jugales iniit subiitha
he underwent the matrimonial torch
connubio stabili sibi junxithum
in stable bond of marriage bound his own
thats clear of any modern taint and yet

virgil is little help to who writes prose
he shall attack me terence with the dawn
shall cinuccino mum mind business sir
thus circumstantially evolve we facts
ita se habet ideo series facti
he weddedah with owls for augury
nupserat heu sinistris avibus
one of the blood arezzo boasts her best
dominus guido nobili genere ortus
pompiliae
but the version afterward
curb we this ardour notes alone today
the speech tomorrow and the latin last
such was the rule in farinaccis time
indeed i hitched it into verse and good
unluckily law quite absorbs a man
or else i think i too had poetised
law is the pork substratum of the fry
goosefoot and cockscomb are latinity
and in this case if circumstance assist
well garnish law with idiom never fear
outoftheway events extend our scope
for instance when bottini brings his charge
that letter which you say pompilia wrote
to criminate her parents and herself
and disengage her husband from the coil
that guido franceschini wrote say we
because pompilia could nor read nor write
therefore he pencilled her such letter first
then made her trace in ink the same again
ha my bottini have i thee on hip
how will he turn this nor break tullys pate
existimandum dont i hear the dog
quod guido designaverit elementa
dictae epistolae quae fuerint
superinducto ab ea calamo
notata atramentotheres a style
quia ipsa scribere nesciebat boh
now my turn either insulsei outburst
stupidly put inane is the response
inanis est responsio or the like
towit that each of all those characters
quod singula elementa epistolae
had first of all been traced for her by him
fuerant per eum prius designata
and then the ink applied atop of that
et deinde superinducto calamo
the piece she says became her handiwork
per eam efformata ut ipsa asserit
inane were such response a second time
her husband outlined her the whole forsooth
vir ejus lineabat epistolam
what she confesses that she wrote the thing
fatetur eam scripsisse scorn that scathes
that she might pay obedience to her lord
ut viro obtemperaret apices
here repeat charge with proper varied phrase
eo designante ipsaque calamum
super inducente by such argument
ita pariter she seeks to show the same
ay by saint joseph and what saints you please
epistolam ostendit medius fidius
no voluntary deed but fruit of force
non voluntarie sed coacte scriptam
thats the way to write latin friend my fisc
bottini is a beast one barbarous
look out for him when he attempts to say
armed with a pistol guido followed her
will not i be beforehand with my fisc
cut away phrase by phrase from underfoot
guido pompiliamguido thus his wife
following with igneous engine shall i have
armis munitus igneis persequens
arma sulphurea gestans sulphury arms
or might one style a pistolpoppingpiece
armatus breviori sclopulo
well let him have been armed so though it make
somewhat against us i had thought to own
provided with a simple travellingsword
ense solummodo viatorio
instructus but well grant the pistol here
better we lost the cause than lacked the gird
at the fiscs latin lost the judges laugh
its venturini that decides for style
tommati rather goes upon the law
so as to law

ah but with law neer hope
to level the fellowdont i know his trick
how he draws up ducks under twists aside
hes a leangutted hectic rascal fine
as palehaired redeyed ferret which pretends
tis ermine pure soft snow from tail to snout
he eludes law by piteous looks aloft
lets latin glance off as he makes appeal
to the saint thats somewhere in the ceilingtop
do you suppose that i dont see the beast
plague of the erminevermin for it takes
it takes and heres the fellow fisc you see
and judge youll not be long in seeing next
confound the fophes now at work like me
enter his study as i seem to do
hear him read out his writing to himself
i know he writes as if he spoke i hear
the hoarse shrill throat see shut eyes neck shotforth
i see him strain on tiptoe soar and pour
eloquence out nor stay nor stint at all
perorate in the air and so to press
with the product what abuse of type is here
hell keep clear of my cast my logicthrow
let argument slide and then deliver swift
some bowl from quite an unguessed point of stand
having the luck o the last word the reply
a plaguy cast a mortifying stroke
you face a fellowcries so there you stand
but i discourteous jump clean oer your head
you play shipcarpenter not pilot so
stop ratholes while a sea sweeps through the breach
hammer and fortify at puny points
do clamp and tenon make all tight and safe
tis here and here and here you ship a sea
no good of your stopped leaks and littleness

yet what do i name little and a leak
the main defence o the murders used to death
by this time dry bare bones no scrap to pick
safer i worked at the new the unforeseen
the nice byestroke the fine and improvised
point that can titillate the brain o the bench
torpid with overteaching by this time
as if tommati that has heard reheard
and heard again first this side and then that
guido and pietro pietro and guido din
and deafen full three years at each long ear
dont want amusement for instruction now
wont rather feel a flea run oer his ribs
than a daw settle heavily on his head
oh i was young and had the trick of fence
knew subtle pass and push with careless right
the left arm ever quietly behind back
with the dagger in t not both hands to blade
puff and blow put the strength out blunderbore
thats my subordinate young spreti now
pedant and prighell pant away at proof
thats his way

now for mineto rub some life
into ones choppy fingers this cold day
i trust cinuzzo ties on tippet guards
the precious throat on which so much depends
guido must be all gooseflesh in his hole
despite the prisonstraw bad carnival
for captives no sliced fry for him poor count

carnivaltimeanother providence
the town aswarm with strangers to amuse
to edify to give ones name and fame
in charge of till they find some future day
cintino come and claim it his name too
pledge of the pleasantness they owe papa
who else was it cured rome of her great qualms
when she must needs have her own judgmentay
since all her topping wits had set to work
pronounced already on the case mere boys
twice cineruggiolos age and half his sense
as good as tell me when i cross the court
master arcangeli plucking at my gown
we can predict we comprehend your play
well help you save your client tralala
ive travelled ground from childhood till this hour
to have the town anticipate my track
the old fox takes the plain and velvet path
the young hounds predilectionprints the dew
dont he to suit their pulpy pads of paw
no burying nose deep down i the briery bush
thus i defend count guido

where are we weak
first which is foremost in advantage too
our murderwe call killingis a fact
confessed defended made a boast of good
to think the fisc claimed use of torture here
and got thereby avowal plump and plain
that gives me just the chance i wantedscope
not for bruteforce but ingenuity
explaining matters not denying them
one may disputeas i am bound to do
and shallvalidity of process here
inasmuch as a noble is exempt
from torture which plebeians undergo
in such a case for law is lenient lax
remits the torture to a nobleman
unless suspicion be of twice the strength
attaches to a man born vulgarly
we dont card silk with comb that dresses wool
moreover twas severity undue
in this case even had the lord been lout
what utters on this head our oracle
our farinacci my gamaliel erst
in those immortal questions what i quote
of all the tools at laws disposal sure
that named vigiliarum is the best
that is the worstto whoso has to bear
lasting as it may do from some seven hours
to ten beyond ten weve no precedent
certain have touched their ten but bah they died
it does so efficaciously convince
thatspeaking by much observation here
out of each hundred cases by my count
never i knew of patients beyond four
withstand its taste or less than ninetysix
end by succumbing only martyrs four
of obstinate silence guilty or noagainst
ninetysix full confessors innocent
or otherwiseso shrewd a tool have we
no marvel either in unwary hands
death on the spot is no rare consequence
as indeed all but happened in this case
to one of ourselves our young tough peasantfriend
the accomplice called baldeschi they were rough
dosed him with torture as you drench a horse
not modify your treatment to a man
so two successive days he fainted dead
and only on the third essay gave up
confessed like flesh and blood we could reclaim
blockhead bottini giving cause enough
but nowell take it as spontaneously
confessed well have the murder beyond doubt
ah fortunate the poets word reversed
inasmuch as we know our happiness
had the antagonist left dubiety
here were we proving murder a mere myth
and guido innocent ignorant absentay
absent he waswhy where should christian be
engaged in visiting his proper church
the duty of us all at christmastime
when caponsacchi the seducer stung
to madness by his relegation cast
about him and contrived a remedy
to stave off what opprobrium broke afresh
by the birth o the babe on him the imputed sire
he came and quietly sought to smother up
his shame and theirs togetherkilled the three
and fledgo seek him where you please to search
just at the moment guido touched by grace
devotions ended hastened to the spot
meaning to pardon his convicted wife
neither do i condemn thee go in peace
who thus arrived i the nick of time to catch
the charge o the killing though greatheartedly
he came but to forgive and bring to life
doubt ye the force of christmas on the soul
is thine eye evil because mine is good

so doubtless had i needed argue here
but for the full confession round and sound
thus would you have some kingly alchemist
whose concern should not be with proving brass
transmutable to gold but triumphing
rather above his gold changed out of brass
not vulgarly to the mere sight and touch
but in the idea the spiritual display
proud apparition buoyed by winged words
hovering above its birthplace in the brain
here would you have this excellent personage
forced by the gross need to gird apron round
plant forge light fire ply bellowsin a word
demonstratewhen a faulty pipkins crack
may disconcert you his presumptive truth
here were i hanging to the testimony
of one of these poor rusticsfour ye gods
whom the first taste of friend the fiscals cord
might drive into undoing my whole speech
shaming truth so
i wonder all the same
not so much at those peasants lack of heart
butguido franceschini nobleman
bear pain no better everybody knows
it used once when my father was a boy
to form a proper nay important point
i the education of our wellborn youth
to take the torture handsomely at need
without confessing in this clownish guise
each noble had his rack for private use
and would for the diversion of a guest
bid it be set up in the yard of arms
to take thereon his hour of exercise
command the varletry stretch strain their best
while friends looked on admired my lord could smile
mid tugging which had caused an ox to roar
men are no longer men

and advocates
no longer farinacci let men add
if i one more time fly from point proposed
so vindicatiohere begins the same
honoris causa so we make our stand
honour in us had injury we shall prove
or if we fail to prove such injury
more than misprision of the factwhat then
it is enough authorities declare
if the result the deed in question now
be caused by confidence that injury
is veritable and no figment since
what though proved fancy afterward seemed fact
at the time they argue shall excuse result
that which we do persuaded of good cause
for what we do hold justifiable
the casuists bid man bound to do his best
they would not have him leave that best undone
and mean to do the worstthough fuller light
show best was worst and worst would have been best
act by the present light they ask of man
ultra quod hic non agitur besides
it is not anyway our business here
de probatione adulterii
to prove what we thought crime was crime indeed
ad irrogandam paenam and require
its punishment such nowise do we seek
sed ad effectum but tis our concern
excusandi here to simply find excuse
occisorem for who did the killingwork
et ad illius defensionem mark
the difference and defend the man just that
quo casu levior probatio
exuberaret to which end far lighter proof
suffices than the prior case would claim
it should be always harder to convict
in short than to establish innocence
therefore we shall demonstrate first of all
that honour is a gift of god to man
precious beyond comparewhich natural sense
of human rectitude and purity
which white mans soul is born with brooks no touch
therefore the sensitivest spot of all
woundable by a wafture breathed from black
ishonour within honour like the eye
centred i the ballthe honour of our wife
touch us o the pupil of our honour then
not actuallysince so you slay outright
but by a gesture simulating touch
presumable mere menace of such taint
this were our warrant for eruptive ire
to whose dominion i impose no end

virgil now should not be too difficult
to cinoncinosay the early books
pen truce to further gambols poscimur

nor can revenge of injury done here
to the honour proved the life and soul of us
be too excessive too extravagant
such wrong seeks and must have complete revenge
show we this first on the mere natural ground
begin at the beginning and proceed
incontrovertibly theodoric
in an apt sentence cassiodorus cites
propounds for basis of all household law
i hardly recollect it but it ends
bird mates with bird beast genders with his like
and brooks no interference bird and beast
the very insectsif they wive or no
how dare i say when aristotle doubts
but the presumption is they likewise wive
at least the nobler sorts for take the bee
as instancecopying king solomon
why that displeasure of the bee to aught
that savours of incontinency makes
the unchaste a very horror to the hive
whence comes it bees obtain the epithet
of castae apes notably the chaste
because ingeniously saith scaliger
the young onesee his book of tabletalk
such is their hatred of immodest act
they fall upon the offender sting to death
i mind a passage much confirmative
i the idyllist though i read him latinized
why asks a shepherd is this bank unfit
for celebration of our vernal loves
oh swain returns the wiser shepherdess
bees swarm here and would quick resent our warmth
only coldblooded fish lack instinct here
nor gain nor guard connubiality
but beasts quadrupedal mammiferous
do credit to their beasthood witness him
that aelian cites the noble elephant
or if not aelian somebody as sage
who seeing much offence beneath his nose
his masters friend exceed in courtesy
the due allowance to that masters wife
taught them good manners and killed both at once
making his master and all men admire
indubitably then that masters self
favoured by circumstance had done the same
or else stood clear rebuked by his own beast
adeo ut qui honorem spernit thus
who values his own honour not a straw
et non recuperare curat nor
labours by might and main to salve its wound
se ulciscendo by revenging him
nil differat a belluis is a brute
quinimo irrationabilior
ipsismet belluis nay contrariwise
much more irrational than brutes themselves
should be considered reputetur how
if a poor animal feel honour smart
taught by blind instinct nature plants in him
shall manconfessed creations masterstroke
nay intellectual glory nay a god
nay of the nature of my judges here
shall man prove the insensible the block
the blot o the earth he crawls on to disgrace
come thats both solid and poeticman
derogate live for the low tastes alone
mean creeping cares about the animal life

may gigia have remembered nothing stings
fried liver out of its monotony
of richness like a root of fennel chopped
fine with the parsley parsleysprigs i said
was there need i should say and fennel too
but no she cannot have been so obtuse
to our argument the fennel will be chopped

from beast to man next mount weay but mind
still mere man not yet christianthat in time
not too fast mark you tis on heathen grounds
we next defend our act then fairly urge
if this were done of old in a green tree
allowed in the spring rawness of our kind
what may be licensed in the autumn dry
and ripe the latter harvesttide of man
if with his poor and primitive halflights
the pagan whom our devils served for gods
could stigmatise the breach of marriagevow
as that which blood blood only might efface
absolve the husband outraged whose revenge
anticipated law plied sword himself
how with the christian in full blaze of day
shall not he rather double penalty
multiply vengeance than degenerate
let privilege be minished droop decay
therefore set forth at large the ancient law
superabundant the examples be
to pick and choose from the athenian code
solons the name is serviceablethen
the laws of the twelve tables that fifteenth
romulus likewise rolls out round and large
the julian the cornelian gracchus law
so old a chime the bells ring of themselves
spreti can set that going if he please
i point you for my part the belfry out
intent to rise from dusk diluculum
into the christian day shall broaden next

first the fit compliment to his holiness
happily reigning then sustain the point
all that was long ago declared as law
by the early revelation stands confirmed
by apostle and evangelist and saint
towitthat honour is the supreme good
why should i baulk saint jerome of his phrase
ubi honor non est where no honour is
ibi contemptus est and where contempt
ibi injuria frequens and where that
the frequent injury ibi et indignatio
and where the indignation ibi quies
nulla and where there is no quietude
why ibi there the mind is often cast
down from the heights where it proposed to dwell
mens a proposito saepe dejicitur
and naturally the mind is so cast down
since harder tis quum difficilius sit
iram cohibere to coerce ones wrath
quam miracula facere than work miracles
saint gregory smiles in his first dialogue
whence we infer the ingenuous soul the man
who makes esteem of honour and repute
whenever honour and repute are touched
arrives at term of fury and despair
loses all guidance from the reasoncheck
as in delirium or a frenzyfit
nor fury nor despair he satiatesno
not even if he attain the impossible
oerturn the hinges of the universe
to annihilatenot whose caused the smart
solely the author simply of his pain
but the place the memory vituperii
o the shame and scorn quiasays solomon
the holy spirit speaking by his mouth
in proverbs the sixth chapter near the end
because the zeal and fury of a man
zelus et furor viri will not spare
non parcet in the day of his revenge
in die vindictae nor will acquiesce
nec acquiescet through a persons prayers
cujusdam precibusnec suscipiet
nor yet take pro redemptione for
redemption dona plurium gifts of friends
nor moneypayment to compound for ache
who recognises not my clients case
whereto as strangely consentaneous here
adduce saint bernard in the epistle writ
to robertulus his nephew too much grief
dolor quippe nimius non deliberat
does not excogitate propriety
non verecundatur nor knows shame at all
non consulit rationem nor consults
reason non dignitatis metuit
damnum nor dreads the loss of dignity
modum et ordinem order and the mode
ignorat it ignores why trait for trait
was ever portrait limned so like the life
by cavalier maratta shall i say
i hear hes first in reputation now
yes that of samson in the sacred text
thats not so much the portrait as the man
samson in gaza was the antetype
of guido at rome for note the nazarite
blinded he wasan easy thing to bear
intrepidly he took imprisonment
gyves stripes and daily labour at the mill
but when he found himself i the public place
destined to make the common people sport
disdain burned up with such an impetus
i the breast of him that all of him on fire
moriatur roared he let my souls self die
anima mea with the philistines
so pulled down pillar roof and death and all
multosque plures interfecit ay
and many more he killed thus moriens
dying quam vivus than in his whole life
occiderat he ever killed before
are these things writ for no example sirs
one instance more and let me see who doubts
our lord himself made up of mansuetude
sealing the sum of sufferance up received
opprobrium contumely and buffeting
without complaint but when he found himself
touched in his honour never so little for once
then outbroke indignation pent before
honorem meum nemini dabo no
my honour i to nobody will give
and certainly the example so hath wrought
that whosoever at the proper worth
apprises worldly honour and repute
esteems it nobler to die honoured man
beneath mannaia than live centuries
disgraced in the eye o the world we find saint paul
no miscreant to this faith delivered once
far worthier were it that i died cries he
expedit mihi magis mori than
that any one should make my glory void
quam ut gloriam meam quis evacuet
see ad corinthienses whereupon
saint ambrose makes a comment with much fruit
doubtless my judges long since laid to heart
so i desist from bringing forward here
i cant quite recollect it

have i proved
satis superque both enough and to spare
that revelation old and new admits
the natural man may effervesce in ire
oerflood earth oerfroth heaven with foamy rage
at the first puncture to his selfrespect
then sirs this christian dogma this lawbud
fullblown now soon to bask the absolute flower
of papal doctrine in our blaze of clay
bethink you shall we miss one promisestreak
one doubtful birth of dawn crepuscular
one dewdrop comfort to humanity
now that the chalice teems with noonday wine
yea argue molinists who bar revenge
referring just to what makes out our case
under old dispensation argue they
the doom of the adulterous wife was death
stoning by moses law nay stone her not
put her away next legislates our lord
and last of all nor yet divorce a wife
ordains the church she typifies ourself
the bride no fault shall cause to fall from christ
then as no jot nor tittle of the law
has passed awaywhich who presumes to doubt
as not one word of christ is rendered vain
which could it be though heaven and earth should pass
where do i find my proper punishment
for my adulterous wife i humbly ask
of my infallible popewho now remits
even the divorce allowed by christ in lieu
of lapidation moses licensed me
the gospel checks the law which throws the stone
the church tears the divorcebill gospel grants
the wife sins and enjoys impunity
what profits me the fulness of the days
the final dispensation i demand
unless law gospel and the church subjoin
but who hath barred thee primitive revenge
which like fire damped and dammed up burns more fierce
use thou thy natural privilege of man
else wert thou found like those old ingrate jews
despite the mannabanquet on the board
alonging after melons cucumbers
and such like trash of egypt left behind
there was one melon had improved our soup
but did not cinoncino need the rind
to make a boat with so i seem to think

law gospel and the churchfrom these we leap
to the very last revealment easy rule
befitting the wellborn and thoroughbred
o the happy day we live innot the dark
o the early rude and acorneating race
behold quoth james we bridle in a horse
and turn his body as we would thereby
yea but we change the bit to suit the growth
and rasp our colts jaw with a rugged spike
we hasten to remit our managed steed
who wheels round at persuasion of a touch
civilisation bows to decency
the acknowledged use and wont the mannersmild
but yet imperative lawwhich make the man
thus do we pay the proper compliment
to rank and that society of rome
hath so obliged us by its interest
taken our clients part instinctively
as unaware defending its own cause
what dictum doth society lay down
i the case of one who hath a faithless wife
wherewithal should the husband cleanse his way
be patient and forgive oh language fails
shrinks from depicturing his punishment
for if wronged husband raise not hue and cry
quod si maritus de adulterio non
conquereretur hes presumed afoh
presumitur leno so complain he must
but how complain at your tribunal lords
far weightier challenge suits your sense i wot
you sit not to have gentlemen propose
questions gentility can itself discuss
did not you prove that to our brother paul
the abate quum judicialiter
prosequeretur when he tried the law
guidonis causam in count guidos case
accidit ipsi this befell himself
quod risum moverit et cachinnos that
he moved to mirth and cachinnation all
or nearly all fere in omnibus
etiam sensatis et cordatis men
strongsensed soundhearted nay the very court
ipsismet in judicibus i might add
non tamen dicam in a cause like this
so multiplied were reasons pro and con
delicate intertwisted and obscure
that law were shamed to lend a fingertip
to unravel readjust the hopeless twine
while halfadozen steps outside the court
there stood a foolish trifler with a tool
adangle to no purpose by his side
had clearly cut the tangle in a trice
asserunt enim unanimiter
doctores for the doctors all assert
that husbands quod mariti must be held
viles cornuti reputantur vile
and branching forth a florid infamy
si propriis manibus if with their own hands
non sumunt they take not straightway revenge
vindictam but expect the deed be done
by the courtexpectant illam fieri
per judices qui summopere rident which
gives an enormous guffaw for reply
et cachinnantur for he ran away
deliquit enim just that he might scape
the censure of both counsellors and crowd
ut vulgi et doctorum evitaret
censuram and lest so he superadd
to loss of honour ignominy too
et sic ne istam quoque ignominiam
amisso honori superadderet
my lords my lords the inconsiderate step
waswe referred ourselves to law at all
twit me not with law else had punished you
each punishment of the extralegal step
to which the highborn preferably revert
is ever for some oversight some slip
i the taking vengeance not for vengeance self
a good thing done unhandsomely turns ill
and never yet lacked ill the laws rebuke
for pregnant instance let us contemplate
the luck of leonardussee at large
of sicilys decisions sixtyfirst
this leonard finds his wife is false what then
he makes her own son snare her and entice
out of the townwalls to a private walk
wherein he slays her with commodity
they find her body halfdevoured by dogs
leonard is tried convicted punished sent
to labour in the galleys seven years long
why for the murder nay but for the mode
malus modus occidendi ruled the court
an ugly mode of killing nothing more
another fructuous samplesee de re
criminali in matthaeus divine piece
another husband in no better plight
simulates absence thereby tempts the wife
on whom he falls out of sly ambuscade
backed by a brother of his and both of them
armed to the teeth with arms that law had blamed
nimis dolose overwilily
fuisse operatum was it worked
pronounced the law had all been fairly done
law had not found him worthy as she did
of four years exile why cite more enough
is good as a feastunless a birthdayfeast
for ones cinuccio so well finish here
my lords we rather need defend ourselves
inasmuch as for a twinkling of an eye
we hesitatingly appealed to law
rather than deny that on mature advice
we blushingly bethought us bade revenge
back to the simple proper private way
of decent selfdealt gentlemanly death
judges there is the law and this beside
the testimony look to it

pause and breathe
so far is only too plain we must watch
bottini will scarce hazard an attack
here lets anticipate the fellows play
and guard the weaker placeswarily ask
what if considerations of a sort
reasons of a kind arise from out the strange
peculiar unforseen new circumstance
of this our candour owns abnormal act
to bar the right of us revenging so
impunity were otherwise your meed
go slay your wife and welcomemay be urged
but why the innocent old couple slay
pietro violante you may do enough
not too much not exceed the golden mean
neither brutebeast nor pagan gentile jew
nor christian no nor votarist of the mode
were free at all to push revenge so far

no indeed why thou very sciolist
the actual wrong pompilia seemed to do
was virtual wrong done by the parents here
imposing her upon us as their child
themselves allow then her fault was their fault
her punishment be theirs accordingly
but wait a little sneak not off so soon
was this cheat solely harm to guido pray
the precious couple you call innocent
why they were felons that law failed to clutch
qui ut fraudarent who that they might rob
legitime vocatos folks law called
ad fidei commissum true heirs to the trust
partum supposuerunt feigned this birth
immemores reos factos esse blind
to the fact that guilty they incurred thereby
ultimi supplicii hanging or aught worse
do you blame us that we turn laws instruments
not mere selfseekersmind the public weal
nor make the private good our sole concern
that havingshall i saysecured a thief
not simply we recover from his pouch
the stolen article our property
but also pounce upon our neighbours purse
we opportunely find reposing there
and do him justice while we right ourselves
he owes us for our part a drubbing say
but owes our neighbour just a dance i the air
under the gallows so we throttle him
the neighbours law the couple are the thief
we are the overready to help law
zeal of her house hath eaten us up for which
can it be law intends to eat up us
crudum priamum devour poor priam raw
twas jupiters own joke with babes to boot
priamique pisinnos in homeric phrase
shameand so ends the period prettily

but evenprove the pair not culpable
free as unborn babe from connivance at
participation in their daughters fault
ours the mistake is that a rare event
non semel it is anything but rare
in contingentia facti that by chance
impunes evaserunt go scotfree
qui such wellmeaning people as ourselves
justo dolore moti who aggrieved
with cause apposuerunt manus lay
rough hands in innocentes on wrong heads
cite we an illustrative case in point
mulier smirnea quaedam good my lords
a gentlewoman lived in smyrna once
virum et filium ex eo conceptum who
both husband and her son begot by him
killed interfecerat ex quo because
vir filium suum perdiderat her spouse
had been beforehand with her killed her son
matrimonii primi of a previous bed
deinde accusata then accused
apud dolabellam before him that sat
proconsul nec duabus caedibus
comtaminatam liberare nor
to liberate a woman doublydyed
with murder voluit made he up his mind
nec condemnare nor to doom to death
justo dolore impulsam one impelled
by just grief sed remisit but sent her up
ad areopagum to the hill of mars
sapientissimorum judicum
caetum to that assembly of the sage
paralleled only by my judges here
ubi cognito de causa where the cause
well weighed responsum est they gave reply
ut ipsa et accusator that both sides
o the suit redirent should come back again
post centum annos after a hundred years
for judgment et sic by which sage decree
duplici parricidio rea one
convicted of a double parricide
quamvis etiam innocentem though in truth
out of the pair one innocent at least
she occidisset plainly had put to death
undequaque yet she altogether scaped
evasit impunis see the case at length
in valerius fittingly styled maximus
that eighth book of his memorable facts
nor cyriacus cites beside the mark
similiter uxor quae mandaverat
just so a lady who had taken care
homicidium viri that her lord be killed
ex denegatione debiti
for denegation of a certain debt
matrimonialis he was loth to pay
fuit pecuniaria mulcta was
amerced in a pecuniary mulct
punita et ad paenam and to pains
temporalem for a certain space of time
in monasterio in a convent

ay
in monasterio how he manages
in with the ablative the accusative
i had hoped to have hitched the villain into verse
for a gift this very day a complete list
o the prepositions each with proper case
telling a story long was in my head
what prepositions take the accusative
ad to or atwho saw the catdown to
ob for because of keep her claws off ah
law in a man takes the whole liberty
the muse is fetteredjust as ovid found

and now sea widens and the coast is clear
what of the dubious act you bade excuse
surely things brighten brighten till at length
remainsso far from act that needs defence
apology to make for act delayed
one minute let alone eight mortal months
of hesitation why procrastinate
out with it my bottinius ease thyself
right promptly done is twice right right delayed
turns wrong we grant you should have killed your wife
but on the moment at the meeting her
in company with the priest then did the tongue
o the brazen head give licence time is now
you make your mind up time is past it peals
friend you are competent to mastery
o the passions that confessedly explain
an outbreakyet allow an interval
and then break out as if times clock still clanged
you have forfeited your chance and flat you fall
into the commonplace category
of men bound to go softly all their days
obeying law

now which way make response
what was the answer guido gave himself
that so to argue came of ignorance
how honour bears a wound for wound said he
my body and the smart is worst at first
while wound my soul where honour sits and rules
longer the sufferance stronger grows the pain
tis ex incontinenti fresh as first
but try another tack calm common sense
by way of contrast astoo true my lords
we did demur awhile did hesitate
yet husband sure should let a scruple speak
ere he slay wifefor his own safety lords
carpers abound in this misjudging world
moreover theres a nicety in law
that seems to justify them should they carp
suppose the source of injury a son
father may slay such son yet run no risk
why graced with such a privilege because
a father so incensed with his own child
or must have reason or believe he has
quia semper seeing that in such event
presumitur the law is bound suppose
quod capiat pater that the sire must take
bonum consilium pro filio
the best course as to what befits his boy
through instinct ex instinctu of mere love
amoris and paterni fatherhood
quam confidentiam which confidence
non habet law declines to entertain
de viro of the husband where has he
an instinct that compels him love his wife
rather is he presumably her foe
so let him ponder long in this bad world
ere do the simplest act of justice

but
againand here we brush bottinis breast
object you see the danger of delay
suppose a man murdered my friend last month
had i come up and killed him for his pains
in rage i had done right allows the law
i meet him now and kill him in cold blood
i do wrong equally allows the law
wherein do actions differ yours and mine
in plenitudine intellectus es
hast thy wits fisc to take such slayers life
returns it life to thy slain friend at all
had he stolen ring instead of stabbing friend
today tomorrow or next century
meeting the thief thy ring upon his thumb
thou justifiably hadst wrung it thence
so couldst thou wrench thy friends life back again
though prisoned in the bosom of his foe
why law would look complacent on thy rush
our case is that the thing we lost we found
the honour we were robbed of eight months since
being recoverable at any day
by death of the delinquent go thy ways
ere thou hast learned law will be much to do
as said the rustic while he shod the goose

nay if you urge me interval was none
from the inn to the villablank or else a bar
of adverse and contrarious incident
solid between us and our just revenge
what with the priest who flourishes his blade
the wife who like a fury flings at us
the crowdand then the capture the appeal
to rome the journey there the journey thence
the shelter at the house of convertites
the visits to the villa and so forth
where was one minute left us all this while
to put in execution that revenge
we planned o the instantas it were plumped down
a round sound egg o the spot some eight months since
rome more propitious than our nest should hatch
object not you reached rome on christmaseve
and despite liberty to act at once
waited a weekindecorous delay
hath so the molinismcanker lords
eaten to the bone is no religion left
no care for aught held holy by the church
what would you have us skip and miss those feasts
o the natal time must we go prosecute
secular business on a sacred day
should not the merest charity expect
setting our poor concerns aside for once
we hurried to the song matutinal
i the sistine and pressed forward for the mass
the cardinal thats camerlengo chaunts
then rushed on to the blessing of the hat
and rapier which the pope sends to what prince
has done most detriment to the infidel
and thereby whet our courage if twere blunt
meantime allow we kept the house a week
suppose not we were idle in our mew
picture count guido raging here and there
money i need nonefriends the word is null
match me the white was on that shield of mine
borne atwherever might be shield to bear
i see my grandsire he who fought so well
athere find out and put in time and place
of what might be a fight his grandsire fought
i see thisi see that

see to it all
or i shall scarce see lambs fry in an hour
nod to the uncle as i bid advance
the smoking dish this for your tender teeth
behoves us care a little for our kin
you sirwho care so much for cousinship
as come to your poor loving nephews feast
he has the reversion of a long lease yet
land to bequeath he loves lambs fry i know

here fall to be considered those same six
qualities what bottini needs must call
so many aggravations of our crime
parasitegrowth upon mere murders back
we summarily might dispose of such
by some offhand and jaunty fling some skit
so since theres proved no crime to aggravate
a fico for your aggravations fisc
nohandle mischief ratherplay with spells
were meant to raise a spirit and laugh the while
we show that did he rise we are his match
therefore first aggravation we made up
over and above our simple murdering selves
a regular assemblage of armed men
coadunatio armatorumay
unluckily it was the very judge
who sits in judgment on our cause today
that passed the law as governor of rome
four men armedthough for lawful purpose mark
much more for an acknowledged crimeshall die
we five were armed to the teeth meant murder too
why thats the very point that saves us fisc
let me instruct you crime nor done nor meant
you punish still who arm and congregate
for why have used bad means to a good end
crime being meant not doneyou punish still
the means to crime you haply pounce upon
though circumstance have baulked you of their end
but crime not only compassed but complete
meant and done too why since you have the end
be that your sole concern nor mind those means
no longer to the purpose murdered we
which that our luck was in the present case
quod contigisse in praesenti casu
is palpable manibus palpatum est
make murder out against us nothing less
of many crimes committed with a view
to one main crime you overlook the less
intent upon the large suppose a man
having in view commission of a theft
climb the townwall tis for the theft he hangs
suppose you can convict him of such theft
remitted whipping due to who climbs wall
for bravery or wantonness alone
just to dislodge a daws nest and no more
so i interpret you the manly mind
of him the judge shall judge both you and me
o the governor who being no babe my fisc
cannot have blundered on ineptitude
were specially of such forbidden sort
through shape or length or breadth as prompt law plucks
from single hand of solitary man
and makes him pay the carriage with his life
delatio armorum arms against the rule
contra formam constitutionis of
pope alexanders blessed memory
such are the poignard with the double prong
hornlike when tines make bold the antlered buck
and all of brittle glassfor man to stab
and break off short and so let fragment stick
fast in the flesh to baffle surgery
and such the genoese blade with hooks at edge
that did us service at the villa here
sed parcat mihi tam eximius vir
but let so rare a personage forgive
fisc thy objection is a foppery
thy charge runs that we killed three innocents
killed dost see then if killed what matter how
by stick or stone by sword or dagger tool
long or tool short round or triangular
poor folks they find small comfort in a choice
means to an end means to an end my fisc
nature cries out take the first arms you find
furor ministrat arma wheres a stone
unde mî lapidem where darts for me
unde sagittas but subdue the bard
and rationalise a little eight months since
had we or had we not incurred your blame
for letting scape unpunished this bad pair
i think i proved that in last paragraph
why did we so because our courage failed
wherefore through lack of arms to fight the foe
we had no arms or merely lawful ones
an unimportant sword and blunderbuss
against a foe pollent in potency
the amasius and our vixen of a wife
well then how culpably do we gird loin
and once more undertake the high emprise
unless we load ourselves this second time
with handsome superfluity of arms
since better say too much than not enough
and plus non vitiat too much does no harm
except in mathematics sages say
gather instruction from the parable
at first we are adviseda lad hath here
seven barley loaves and two small fishes what
is that among so many aptly asked
but put that question twice and quite as apt
the answer is fragments twelve baskets full
and while we speak of superabundance fling
a word by the way to fools that cast their flout
on guidopunishment exceeds offence
you might be just but you were cruel too
if so you stigmatise the stern and strict
still he is not without excusemay plead
transgression of his mandate overzeal
o the part of his companions all he craved
was they should fray the faces of the three
solummodo fassus est he owns no more
dedisse mandatum than that he desired
ad sfrisiandum dicam that they hack
and hew i the customary phrase his wife
uxorem tantum and no harm beside
if his instructions then be misconceived
nay disobeyed impute you blame to him
cite me no panicollus to the point
as adverse oh i quite expect his case
how certain noble youths of sicily
having good reason to mistrust their wives
killed them and were absolved in consequence
while others who had gone beyond the need
by mutilation of the paramour
so galba in the horatian satire grieved
these were condemned to the galleys as for guilt
exceeding simple murder of a wife
but why because of ugliness and not
cruelty in the said revenge i trow
ex causa abscissionis partium
quia nempe id facientes reputantur
naturae inimici man revolts
against such as the natural enemy
pray grant to one who meant to slit the nose
and slash the cheek and slur the mouth at most
a somewhat more humane award than these
objectum funditus corruit flat you fall
my fisc i waste no kick on you but pass

third aggravation that our act was done
not in the public street where safety lies
not in the byeplace caution may avoid
wood cavern desert spots contrived for crime
but in the very house home nook and nest
o the victims murdered in their dwellingplace
in domo ac habitatione propria
where all presumably is peace and joy
the spider crime pronounce we twice a pest
when creeping from congenial cottage she
taketh hold with her hands to horrify
his household more i the palace of the king
all three were housed and safe and confident
moreover the permission that our wife
should have at length domum pro carcere
her own abode in place of prisonwhy
we ourselves granted by our other self
and proxy paolo did we make such grant
meaning a lureelude the vigilance
o the jailor lead her to commodious death
while we ostensibly relented

ay
just so did we nor otherwise my fisc
is vengeance lawful we demand our right
but find it will be questioned or refused
by jailor turnkey hangdogwhat know we
pray how is it we should conduct ourselves
to gain our private rightbreak public peace
do you bid ustrouble order with our broils
endangershall i shrink to ownourselves
who want no broken head nor bloody nose
while busied slitting noses breaking heads
from the first tipstaff shall please interfere
nam quicquid sit for howsoever it be
an de consensu nostro if with leave
or not a monasterio from the nuns
educta esset she had been led forth
potuimus id dissimulare we
may well have granted leave in pure pretence
ut aditum habere that thereby
an entry we might compass a free move
potuissemus to her easy death
ad eam occidendam privacy
o the hearth and sanctitude of home say you
would you give mans abode more privilege
than godsfor in the churches where he dwells
in quibus assistit regum rex by means
of his essence per essentiam all the same
et nihilominus therein in eis
ex justa via delinquens whoso dares
to take a liberty on ground enough
is pardoned excusatur thats our case
delinquent through befitting cause you hold
to punish a false wife in her own house
is graver than what happens every day
to hale a debtor from his hidingplace
in church protected by the sacrament
to this conclusion have i brought my fisc
foxes have holes and fowls o the air their nests
praise you the impiety that follows fisc
shall false wife yet have where to lay her head
contra fiscum definitum est hes done
surge et scribe make a note of it
if i may dally with aquinas word
or in the deaththroe does he mutter still
fourth aggravation that we changed our garb
and rusticised ourselves with uncouth hat
rough vest and goatskin wrappage murdered thus
mutatione vestium in disguise
whereby mere murder got complexed with wile
turned homicidium ex insidiis fisc
how often must i round thee in the ears
all means are lawful to a lawful end
concede he had the right to kill his wife
the count indulged in a travesty why
deilla ut vindictam sumeret
that on her he might lawful vengeance take
commodius with more ease et tutius
and safelier wants he warrant for the step
read to thy profit how the apostle once
for ease and safety when damascus raged
was let down in a basket by the wall
to scape the malice of the governor
another sort of governor boasts rome
many are of opinioncovered close
concealed withwhat except that very cloak
he left behind at troas afterward
i shall not add a syllable molinists may
well have we more to manage ay indeed
fifth aggravation that our wife reposed
sub potestate judicis beneath
protection of the judgeher house was styled
a prison and his power became its guard
in lieu of wall and gate and bolt and bar
this a tough point shrewd redoubtable
because we have to supplicate the judge
shall overlook wrong done the judgmentseat
now i might suffer my own nose be pulled
as manbut then as fatherif the fisc
touched one hair of my boy who held my hand
in confidence he could not come to harm
crossing the corso at my own desire
going to see those bodies in the church
what would you say to that don hyacinth
this is the sole and single knotty point
for bid tommati blink his interest
you laud his magnanimity the while
but baulk tommatis officehe talks big
my predecessors in the placethose sons
o the prophets that may hope succeed me here
shall i diminish their prerogative
count guido franceschinis honourwell
has the governor of rome none

you perceive
the cards are all against us make a push
kick over table as our gamesters do
we do you say encroach upon the rights
deny the omnipotence o the judge forsooth
we who have only been from first to last
intent on that his purpose should prevail
nay more at times anticipating both
at risk of a rebuke

but wait awhile
cannot we lump this with the sixth and last
of the aggravationsthat the majesty
o the sovereign here received a wound towit
laesa majestas since our violence
was out of envy to the course of law
in odium litis we cut short thereby
three pending suits promoted by ourselves
i the mainwhich worsens crime accedit ad
exasperationem criminis

yes here the eruptive wrath with full effect
howdid not indignation chain my tongue
could i repel this last worst charge of all
there is a porcupine to barbacue
gigia can jug a rabbit well enough
with soursweet sauce and pinepips but good lord
suppose the devil instigate the wench
to stew not roast him stew my porcupine
if she does i know where his quills shall stick
come i must go myself and see to things
i cannot stay much longer stewing here
our stomachi mean our soulis stirred within
and we want words we wounded majesty
fall under such a censure wewho yearned
so much that majesty dispel the cloud
and shine on us with healing on its wings
we prayed the pope majestas very self
to anticipate a little the tardy pack
bell us forth deep the authoritative bay
should start the beagles into sudden yelp
unisonousand gospel leading law
grant there assemble in our own behoof
a congregation a particular court
a few picked friends of quality and place
to hear the several matters in dispute
causes big little and indifferent
bred of our marriage like a mushroomgrowth
all at once can one brush off such too soon
and so with laudable dispatch decide
whether we in the main to sink detail
were one the church should hold fast or let go
what take the credit from the law you ask
indeed we did law ducks to gospel here
why should law gain the glory and pronounce
a judgment shall immortalise the pope
yes our selfabnegating policy
was joabswe would rouse our davids sloth
bid him encamp against a city sack
a place whereto ourselves had long laid siege
lest taking it at last it take our name
and be not innocentinopolis
but no the modesty was in alarm
the temperance refused to interfere
returned us our petition with the word
ad judices suos leave him to his judge
as who should saywhy trouble my repose
why consult peter in a simple case
peters wifes sister in her feverfit
might solve as readily as the apostles self
are my tribunals posed by aught so plain
hath not my court a conscience it is of age
ask it

we do askbut inspire reply
to the court thou bidst me ask as i have asked
oh thou who vigilantly dost attend
to even the few the ineffectual words
which rise from this our low and mundane sphere
up to thy region out of smoke and noise
seeking corroboration from thy nod
who art all justicewhich means mercy too
in a low noisy smoky world like ours
where adams sin made peccable his seed
we venerate the father of the flock
whose last faint sands of life the frittered gold
fall noiselessly yet all too fast o the cone
and tapering heap of those collected years
never have these been hurried in their flow
though justice fain would jog reluctant arm
in eagerness to take the forfeiture
of guilty life much less shall mercy sue
in vain that thou let innocence survive
precipitate no minim of the mass
o the allso precious moments of thy life
by pushing guido into death and doom

our cardinal engages read my speech
they say the pope has one halfhour in twelve
of something like a moderate return
of the intellectualsnever much to lose
if i adroitly plant this passage there
the fisc will find himself forestalled i think
though he stand beat till the old eardrum break
ah boy of my own bowels hyacinth
wilt ever catch the knackrequite the pains
of poor papa become proficient too
i the how and why and whenthe time to laugh
the time to weep the time again to pray
and all the times prescribed by holy writ
well well we fathers can but care but cast
our bread upon the waters

in a word
these secondary charges go to ground
since secondary so superfluousmotes
quite from the main point we did all and some
little and much adjunct and principal
causa honoris is there such a cause
as the sake of honour by that sole test try
our action nor demand it more or less
because of the actions mode we merit blame
or maybe deserve praise the court decides
is the end lawful it allows the means
what we may do we may with safety do
and what means safety we ourselves must judge
put case a person wrongs me past dispute
if my legitimate vengeance be a blow
mistrusting my bare arm can deal the same
i claim cooperation of a stick
doubtful if stick be tough i crave a sword
diffident of ability in fence
i fee a friend a swordsman to assist
take onewho may be coward fool or knave
why not take fiftyand if these exceed
i the due degree of drubbing whom accuse
but the first author of the aforesaid wrong
who put poor me to such a world of pains
surgery would have just excised a wart
the patient made such pother struggled so
that the sharp instrument sliced nose and all
taunt us not that our friends performed for pay
for us enough were simple honours sake
give country clowns the dirt they comprehend
the piece of gold our reasons which suffice
ourselves be ours alone our piece of gold
be to the rustic reason and to spare
we must translate our motives like our speech
into the lower phrase that suits the sense
o the limitedly apprehensive let
each level have its language heaven speaks first
to the angel then the angel tames the word
down to the ear of tobit he in turn
diminishes the message to his dog
and finally that dog finds how the flea
which else importunate might check his speed
shall learn its hunger must have holiday
how many varied sorts of language here
each following each with pace to match the step
haud passibus aequis

talking of which flea
reminds me i must put in special word
for the poor humble followingthe four friends
sicarii our assassins in your charge
ourselves are safe in your approval now
yet must we care for our companions plead
the cause o the poor the friends of oldworld faith
who are in tribulation for our sake
pauperum procurator is my style
i stand forth as the poor mans advocate
and when we treat of what concerns the poor
et cum agatur de pauperibus
in bondage carceratis for their sake
in eorum causis natural piety
pietas ever ought to win the day
triumphare debet quia ipsi sunt
because those very paupers constitute
thesaurus christi all the wealth of christ
nevertheless i shall not hold you long
with multiplicity of proofs nor burn
candle at noontide clarify the clear
there beams a case refulgent from our books
castrensis butringarius everywhere
i find it burn to dissipate the dark
tis this a husband had a friend which friend
seemed to him overfriendly with his wife
in thought and purposei pretend no more
to justify suspicion or dispel
he bids his wife make show of giving heed
semblance of sympathypropose in fine
a secret meeting in a private place
the friend enticed thus finds an ambuscade
towit the husband posted with a pack
of other friends who fall upon the first
and beat his love and life out both at once
these friends were brought to question for their help
law ruled the husband being in the right
who helped him in the right can scarce be wrong
opinio an opinion every way
multum tenenda cordi heart should hold
when the inferiors follow as befits
the lead o the principal they change their name
and non dicuntur are no longer called
his mandatories mandatorii
but helpmates sed auxiliatores since
to that degree does honour sake lend aid
adeo honoris causa est efficax
that not alone non solum does it pour
itself out se diffundat on mere friends
we bring to do our bidding of this sort
in mandatorios simplices but sucks
along with it in wide and generous whirl
sed etiam assassinii qualitate
qualificatos people qualified
by the quality of assassinations self
dare i make use of such neologism
ut utar verbo

haste we to conclude
of the other points that favour leave some few
for spreti such as the delinquents youth
one of them falls short by some months of age
fit to be managed by the gallows two
may plead exemption from our laws award
being foreigners subjects of the granduke
i spare that bone to spreti and reserve
myself the juicier breast of argument
flinging the breastblade i the face o the fisc
who furnished me the tidbit he must needs
play off his armoury and rack the clowns
and they at instance of the rack confessed
all four unanimously did resolve
that night o the murder in brief minutes snatched
behind the back of guido as he fled
that since he had not kept his promise paid
the money for the murder on the spot
and reaching home again might even ignore
the past or pay it in improper coin
they one and all resolved these hopeful friends
they would inaugurate the morrows light
having recruited strength with needful rest
by killing guido as he lay asleep
pillowed by wallet which contained their fee

i thank the fisc for knowledge of this fact
what fact could hope to make more manifest
their rectitude guidos integrity
for who fails recognise apparent here
that these poor rustics bore no envy hate
malice nor yet uncharitableness
against the people they had put to death
in them did such an act reward itself
all done was to deserve their simple pay
obtain the bread they earned by sweat of brow
missing this pay they missed of everything
hence claimed it even at expense of life
to their own lord so little warped were they
by prepossession such the absolute
instinct of equity in rustic souls
while he the count the cultivated mind
he wholly rapt in his serene regard
of honour as who contemplates the sun
and hardly minds what tapers blink below
he dreaming of no argument for death
except the vengeance worthy noble hearts
would be to desecrate the deed forsooth
vulgarise vengeance as defray its cost
by money dug out of the dirty earth
mere irritant in maros phrase to ill
what though he lured base hinds by lucres hope
the only motive they could masticate
milk for babes not stong meat which men require
the deed done those coarse hands were soiled enough
he spared them the pollution of the pay
so much for the allegement thine my fisc
quo nil absurdius than which nought more mad
excogitari potest may be squeezed
from out the cogitative brain of thee

and now thou excellent the governor
push to the peroration caeterum
enixe supplico i strive in prayer
ut dominis meis that unto the court
benigna fronte with a gracious brow
et oculis serenis and mild eyes
perpendere placeat it may please them weigh
quod dominus guido that our noble count
occidit did the killing in dispute
ut ejus honor tumulatus that
the honour of him buried fathomdeep
in infamy in infamia might arise
resurgeret as ghosts break sepulchre
occidit for he killed uxorem wife
quia illi fuit since she was to him
opprobrio a disgrace and nothing more
et genitores killed her parents too
qui who postposita verecundia
having thrown off all sort of decency
filiam repudiarunt had renounced
their daughter atque declarare non
erubuerunt nor felt blush tinge cheek
declaring meretricis genitam
esse she was the offspring of a drab
ut ipse dehonestaretur just
that so himself might lose his social rank
cujus mentem and which daughters heart and soul
they perverterunt turned from the right course
et ad illicitos amores non
dumtaxat pellexerunt and to love
not simply did alluringly incite
sed vi obedientiae but by force
o the duty filialis daughters owe
coegerunt forced and drove her to the deed
occidit i repeat he killed the clan
ne scilicet amplius in dedecore
lest peradventure longer life might trail
viveret link by link his turpitude
invisus consanguineis hateful so
to kith and kindred a nobilibus
notatus shunned by men of quality
relictus ab amicis left i the lurch
by friends ab omnibus derisus turned
a common hackblock to try edge of jokes
occidit and he killed them here in rome
in urbe the eternal city sirs
nempe quae alias spectata est
the appropriate theatre which witnessed once
matronam nobilem lucretias self
abluere pudicitiae maculas
wash off the spots of her pudicity
sanguine proprio with her own pure blood
quae vidit and which city also saw
patrem virginius undequaque quite
impunem with no sort of punishment
nor et non illaudatum lacking praise
sed polluentem parricidio
imbrue his hands with butchery filiae
of chaste virginia to avoid a rape
ne raperetur ad stupra so to heart
tanti illi cordi fuit did he take
suspicio the mere fancy men might have
honoris amittendi of fames loss
ut potius voluerit filia
orbari that he chose to lose his child
quam illa incederet rather than she walk
the ways an inhonesta child disgraced
licet non sponte though against her will
occiditkilled them i reiterate
in propria domo in their own abode
ut adultera et parentes that each wretch
conscii agnoscerent might both see and say
nullum locum theres no place nullumque esse
asylum nor yet refuge of escape
impenetrabilem shall serve as bar
honori laeso to the wounded one
in honour neve ibi opprobria
continuarentur killed them on the spot
moreover dreading lest within those walls
the opprobrium peradventure be prolonged
et domus quae testis fuit turpium
and that the domicile which witnessed crime
esset et paenae might watch punishment
occidit killed i round you in the ears
quia alio modo since by other mode
non poterat ejus existimatio
there was no possibility his fame
laesa gashed griesly tam enormiter
ducere cicatrices might be healed
occidit ut exemplum praeberet
uxoribus killed her so to lesson wives
jura conjugii that the marriageoath
esse servanda must be kept henceforth
occidit denique killed her in a word
ut pro posse honestus viveret
that he please god might creditably live
sin minus but if fate willed otherwise
proprii honoris of his outraged fame
offensi by mannaja if you please
commiseranda victima caderet
the pitiable victim he should fall

done i the rough i the rough but done and lo
landed and stranded lies my very own
my miracle my monster of defence
leviathan into the nose whereof
i have put fishhook pierced his jaw with thorn
and given him to my maidens for a play
i the roughtomorrow i review my piece
tame here and there undue floridity
its hard you have to plead before these priests
and poke at them with scripture or you pass
for heathen and whats worse for ignorant
o the quality o the court and what it likes
by way of illustration of the law
tomorrow stick in this and throw out that
and having first ecclesiasticised
regularise the whole next emphasise
then latinize and lastly ciceroise
giving my fisc his finish theres my speech
and wheres my fry and family and friends
wheres that old hyacinth i mean to hug
till he cries out jam satis let me breathe
oh what an evening have i earned today
hail ye true pleasures all the rest are false
oh the old mother oh the fattish wife
rogue hyacinth shall put on paper toque
and wrap himself around with mammas veil
done up to imitate papas black robe
im in the secret of the comedy
part of the program leaked out long ago
and call himself the advocate o the poor
mimic don father that defends the count
and for reward shall have a small full glass
of manly red rosolio to himself
always provided that he conjugate
bibo i drink correctlynor be found
make the perfectum bipsi as last year
how the ambitious do so harden heart
as lightly hold by these homesanctitudes
to me is matter of bewilderment
bewilderment because ambitions range
is nowise tethered by domestic tie
am i refused an outlet from my home
to the worlds stagewhereon a man should play
the man in public vigilant for law
zealous for truth a credit to his kind
naythrough the talent so employed as yield
the lord his own again with usury
a satisfaction yea to god himself
well i have modelled me by agurs wish
remove far from me vanity and lies
feed me with food convenient for me what
i the world should a wise man require beyond
can i but coax the good fat little wife
to tell her fool of a father of the prank
his scapegrace nephew played this time last year
at carnivalhe could not choose i think
but modify that inconsiderate gift
o the cup and cover somewhere in the will
under the pillow someone seems to guess
correct that clause in favour of a boy
the trifle ought to grace with name engraved
would look so well produced in years to come
to pledge a memory when poor papa
latin and law are long since laid at rest
hyacintho dono dedit avuswhy
the wife should get a necklace for her pains
the very pearls that made violante proud
and pietro pawned for half their value once
redeemable by somebodyne sit
marita quae rotundioribus
onusta mammisbaccis ambulet
her bosom shall display the big round balls
no braver should be borne by wedded wife
with which horatian promise i conclude
into the pigeonhole with thee my speech
off and away first work then play play play
bottini burn your books you blazing ass
sing tralala for lambkins we must liveembed"
