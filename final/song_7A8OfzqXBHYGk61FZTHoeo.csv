boy youre gonna know it all
youll think youre ten feet tall
and run like youre bulletproof
and total a car or two
boy youre gonna hate this town
wish you could burn it down
that fire in your eyes is 20 counties wide
but boy youre gonna love 17
and boy youll do some stupid things

chorus
youre gonna drive and kiss
and throw a punch
and grow up way too fast
youre gonna drop the ball
hit the wall
and break some hearts like glass
i know you well cause youre a part of me
and a part of you will always be a boy

verse 2
youre gonna be so stubborn
you get that from your mother
i already see it now you werent built for backing down
and boy therell be a small town night
and youll fall for her skyblue eyes
and when shes in your hands
youll think youre a man and not a boy
shell make you lose your mind boy
shell be every reason why
see lee brice liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likechorus
youre gonna drive and kiss
and throw a punch
and grow up way too fast
youre gonna drop the ball
hit the wall
and break some hearts like glass
i know you will cause youre a part of me
and a part of you will always bemy boy

bridge
its 3am and id do anything to get you back to sleep
and that face will be the same one in the rearview
the day i watch you leave

outro
but boy youre gonna come back home
youre gonna settle down
but you wont feel the way im feelin now
til you have a boy
hes gonna know it all
hell think hes ten feet tall
and run like hes bulletproof
and total a car or two1embed"
