wasnt really looking when you caught my eyes
just another town just another night
didnt say much i was scared for my life
i didnt catch your number and didnt know your name
tried to move on couldnt help to think of you
and i knew that youd change everything

chorus
whats mine is yours
every breathe i take every choice i make
it might sound crazy
all my pain washed away in the blink of an eye
yeah you saved me
you got all of me and i dont need it anymore
whats mine is yours
whats mine is yours
whats mine is yours

verse 2

your shoes on my floor
taking my side of the bed and more
but it’s fine i don’t mind cause you changed everything

chorus
whats mine is yours
every breathe i take every choice i make

all my pain washed away in the blink of an eye
