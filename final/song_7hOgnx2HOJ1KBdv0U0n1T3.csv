i want to succeed
is this a good quality
i wonder whats next

nothing

more and more its an animal
waiting to be seen
faced with someones failures
a sickening sight indeed indeed indeed

indeed

spoken
in the beginning it seems that no one thinks beyond having fun
which is why you write music in the first place
always moving refining and pushing forward the art that ones creating
looking to the right time to share it
and then the headaches of criticism
senior advisors unseen people above
twisting distorting that which we love
and neverending problems with money
holding you back preventing progress
i thought you only started cause it was fun

we play the blaming game
yes i mind
its not your turn
we play the blaming game
yes i mind
its not your turn
we play the blaming game
yes i mind
its not your turn

i wonder
i wonder whats next

yes we play the blaming game
yes i mind
its not your turn
we play the blaming game
yes i mind
its not your turn
we play the blaming game
yes i mind
its not your turn
we play the blaming game
yes i mind
its not your turn
