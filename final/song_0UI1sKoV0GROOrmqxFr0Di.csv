my hands are cold my bodys numb
im still in shock what have you done
my head is pounding my visions blurred
your mouth is moving i dont hear a word
and it hurts so bad that i search my skin
for the entry point where love went in
and ricocheted and bounced around
you left a hole when you walked out yeah

chorus
im falling through the doors of the emergency room
can anybody help me with these exit wounds
i dont know how much more love this heart can lose
and im dying dying from these exit wounds
wounds
where theyre leaving the scars youre keeping
exit wounds
where theyre leaving the scars youre keeping

verse 2
marks of battle they still feel raw
a million pieces of me on the floor
im damaged goods for all to see
now who would ever wanna be with me
ive got all the baggage drink the pills
yeah this is living but without the will
im blacking out im shutting down
you left a hole when you walked out yeah
