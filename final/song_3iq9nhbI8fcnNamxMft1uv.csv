no i think ill stay in tonight
skip the conversations and the oh im fines
no im no stranger to surprise
this paper town has let me down too many times
why do i even try
give me a reason why
i thought that i could trust you never mind
why all the switching sides
where do i draw the line
i guess im too naive to read the signs

chorus
im just lookin for some real friends
all they ever do is let me down
every time i let somebody in
then i find out what theyre all about
im just lookin for some real friends
wonder where theyre all hidin out
im just lookin for some real friends
gotta get up out of this town oh ooh

postchorus
oh yeah

verse 2
i stay up talkin to the moon ooh

i just wanna talk about nothin
with somebody that means something
spell the names of all the dreams and demons
for the times that i dont understand
tell me whats the point of a moon like this
when im alone again
can i run away to somewhere beautiful
where nobody knows my name

chorus
im just lookin for some real friends
all they ever do is let me down
then i let somebody in
but i find out what theyre all about
im just lookin for some real friends
all they ever do is let me down
im just lookin for some real friends
gotta get up out of this town yeah
