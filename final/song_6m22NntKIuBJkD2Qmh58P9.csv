how do i get closer to you
when you keep it all on mute
how will i know the right way to love you
usually the queen of figuring out
breaking down a man is no workout
but i have no clue how to get through to you

prechorus
oh
i wanna hit you just to see if you cry
i keep knockin on wood
hopin theres a real boy inside

chorus
cause youre not a man
youre just a mannequin
i wish you could feel that my love is real
but youre not a man

verse 2
i wish i could just turn you on
put a battery in make you talk
even pull a string for you to say anything
but with you there is no guarantee
only expired warranty
a bunch of broken parts and i cant seem to find your heart
you might also likeprechorus
oh
im such a fool im such a fool im such a fool
this ones out of my hands
i cant put you back together again

chorus
cause youre not a man
youre just a mannequin
i wish you could feel that my love is real
but youre not a man
youre just a a toy
could you ever be a real real boy
and understand
but youre not a man

bridge
if the past is the problem our future could solve em baby
i could bring you to life if you let me inside baby
itll hurt but in the end
youll be a man

chorus
youre not a man
youre just a mannequin
i wish you could feel that my love is real
a toy
could you ever be a real real boy
understand
but youre not a man
youre not a man
youre just a mannequin
i wish you could feel that my love is real
but youre not a man4embed"
