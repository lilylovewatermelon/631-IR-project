harry truman was our president
a coke an burger cost you thirty cents
i was still in love with mavis brown
on the night hank williams came to town
i love lucy debuted on tv
that was one big event we didnt see
—Åause no one stayed at home for miles around
it was the night hank williams came to town
mama ironed my shirt and daddy let me take the truck
i drove on out to grapevine and picked old mavis up
we hit that county line for one quick round
on the night hank williams came to town
a thousand people sweltered in the gym
then i heard someone whisper hey thats him
thats when the crowd let out this deafening sound
it was the night hank williams came to town
on and on he sang into the night
jambalaya cheating heart i saw the light
howd they get miss audrey in that gown
on the night hank williams came to town
mavis had her picture made with hank outside his car
she said he sure is humble for a grand ole opry star
mavis said why dont we hang around
it aint often that hank williams comes to town
while hank signed his autograph on beaulah rices fan
mavis got acquainted with the drifting cowboys band
the effect on all our lives was quite profound
on the night hank williams came to townyou might also likeembed"
