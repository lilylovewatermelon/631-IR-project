gets rid of the pain of being a man
caught here in a fiery blaze wont lose my will to stay
i tried to drive all through the night
the heat stroke ridden weather the barren empty sights
no oasis here to see
the sand is singing deathless words to me
cant you help me as im startin to burn
all alone
too many doses and im starting to get an attraction
my confidence is leaving me on my own
all alone
no one can save me and you know i dont want the attention
as i adjust to my new sights
the rarely tired lights will take me to new heights
my hand is on the trigger im ready to ignite
tomorrow might not make it but everythings all right
mental fiction follow me
show me what its like to be set free
cant you help me as im startin to burn
all alone
too many doses and im starting to get an attraction
my confidence is leaving me on my own
all alone
no one can save me and you know i dont want the attention
so sorry youre not here
ive been sane too long my visions so unclear
now take a trip with me
but dont be surprised when things arent what they seem
caught here in a fiery blaze wont lose my will to stay
these eyes wont see the same after i flip today
sometimes i dont know why wed rather live than die
we look up towards the sky for answers to our lives
we may get some solutions but most just pass us by
dont want your absolution cause i cant make it right
ill make a beast out of myself
gets rid of all the pain of being a man
cant you help me as im startin to burn
all alone
too many doses and im starting to get an attraction
my confidence is leaving me on my own
all alone
no one can save me and you know i dont want the attention
so sorry youre not here
ive been sane too long my visions so unclear
now take a trip with me
but dont be surprised when things arent what they seem
ive known it from the start
all these good ideas will tear your brain apart
scared but you you follow me
im too weird to live but much too rare to diesee avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeembed"
