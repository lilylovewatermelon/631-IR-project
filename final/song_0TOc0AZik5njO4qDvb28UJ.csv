late at night when im layin off in the bed
countin bread some crazy shit be goin through my head
i be wonderin bout this life that i live that i live
aiyyo god got some better shit he can give he can give
i wonder if its a better place for the innocent kids
in the ghetto they gotta suffer for shit that they aint did
by no fault of they own goin through struggles and strife
havin to deal with a fucked up life thats cold
i know they thinkin nobody knows or nobody cares
why cant nobody see the shit when everybody stares
man we losin the children we losin the youth
cause you motherfuckers wont tell em the truth
so they runnin round unprepared and uninformed
its understood thats why the hood is dumpin on em
we gotta show em its a better way freal at any cost
cause they the future if we dont save em then we already lost mayne

hook  2x
