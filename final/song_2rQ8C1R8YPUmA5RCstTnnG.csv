verse 1 gmebe bandz
my city full of them demons run up and kill you for treason
we let it blow in the am we dont give a fuck let it blow in the pm
poppin a tylenol 3 in free all my bros in the pen
pray every night for my sins repent sayin they hop in the benz
my demon he ride with me shotty been schemin since we was some shawties
aint too many left at my table extendo clip hang out the pocket like cables
aint got no time for these haters all i really want is paper
hoe could you do me one favor suck on my dick while i spank ya
everyday tell god im thankful you fuck wit me it gon be fatal
murder smoke you like a vegas skurt pull off we see you later
we might just pull up in a rover we might just pull up in a nova
