the story you bout to hear is complete fiction
it is however made up of a group of stories
true stories about real people
thus creating real characters going through real things
thus making the story itself real true and a real story
a true story
is nonfiction

verse
our story begins in a dark place
a place where you learn that everything that you wanted
could potentially be the very thing that leads to your destruction
the very thing you should fear
this is a lesson learned the hard way
experience being the only teacher
i mean you cant exactly tell a broke man that money is evil
and expect him to listen to you now can you
naw hes got to go down that road
hes got to face them demons himself
before he can acquire that knowledge
the money solves one group of problems
only to introduce another
strangers become friends
friends become enemies
the fame just like any other drug
feels incredible
until you realize that all that adoration
all that love aint real
and the women
huh the women
a drug you use that uses you right back
a high for a high so to speak
