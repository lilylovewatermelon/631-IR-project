black jack whiskey straight
every day changes your life
you got the look that you know youre real bad
yeah baby youre right
everybody loves you baby youre the king of the night
and im the only one making sure i stay out of your sight

prechorus
you know i can make your night
you wanna get it
you got something that i like
but i might regret it

chorus
me and you were a disaster
and youre only a danger to me
but the party aint the same without you
thats why youre so good for everybody else but youre trouble for me

postchorus
oh oh ohoh
yeah youre trouble for me
oh oh ohoh
trouble for me
