yeah i know
you be posted up from sunday to saturday night
started hangin with the members then you blew a few pipes
and you gon do the dash if you see them blue lights
a lot of people dyin and its a chance that you might
you got god on your side but its hard to do right
dont pay them haters no mind you can be what you like
tryna leave this in the past grindin for a new life

verse 1
hard headed i grew up resilient
it wasnt no heroes so we looked up to the villains
for generations bitch my side of town been drillin
we been at war ever since them red buildings
its hard to make peace once blood get to spillin ayy
lil wooski get to shootin like he filmin
yeah my friends died too i know that feeling
im poppin ecstasy to help me with the healin
leia and lil baby my younger siblings
i really love em so i treat em like my children
leilani told me stack them bands to the ceiling
i switched my swag up cant you tell the difference
im finna feed the whole gang with these millions
im finna buy my whole hood with these millions
girl if i give you my time thats a privilege
but i can only give my heart to the realest

verse 2
lately ive been feelin like fuck the streets this shit a scam
these days if it aint bout money i dont give a damn
im just gon get rich and fuck them plastic hoes on instagram
still with the gang though one false move them killers blam
still on that same block for those who say they look for me
i aint sacrifice the shit i lost it was took from me
almost went insane went insane went insane
from all this pain all this pain all this pain
turned that pain into passion and made it happen
shout out to the ones who doubted me they keep me laughin
sippin on this codeine got me relaxin
she say she like how i be swaggin she love my fashion
vvs my diamonds my jewelry flashin
drip so hard im makin puddles bitch my gucci splashin
fresh to death like my closet in the casket
fresh to death like my closet in the casket
