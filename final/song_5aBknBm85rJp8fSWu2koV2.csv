i am done pretending
you have failed to find whats left
i will suck you dry again
some are not worth saving
you are such a pretty mess
i will choke the life within

prechorus
now you want to take me down
as if i even care
i am the monster in your head
and i thought youd learn by now
it seems you havent yet
i am the venom in your skin
and now your life
is broken

chorus
after the lights go out on you
after your worthless life is through
i will remember how you scream
i cant afford to care
i cant afford to care

verse 2
i am suffocating
you have failed to pull me in
i will drag you down again
life is unrelenting
feeding lies into my head
i will feed the lies you live

now you want to take me down
as if i even care
i am the monster in your head
and i thought youd learn by now
it seems you havent yet
i am the venom in your skin
and now your life
is broken

chorus
after the lights go out on you
after your worthless life is through
i will remember how you scream
i cant afford to care
i cant afford to care

chorus
after the lights go out on you
after your worthless life is through
i will remember how you scream
i cant afford to care
i cant afford to care
