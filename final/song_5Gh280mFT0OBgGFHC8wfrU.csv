hello
hello hello hello hello
hello hello hello hello
hello hello hello hello
hello

spoken word
mmm this mornin my man exclusively introduced me to some good extra lovin
he was lickin and suckin on everything
just the way he should
this mornings extra lovin was good
we laid there sweaty sex funky happy as we want to be
lovin exclusively my man and me
all night all mornin
so our stomachs were growlin hungrily
so i jumped up and rushed to the store
in hopes of comin back and gettin a little more
of this mornings good extra lovin 
at the market the people were pushin and shovin
trying to be the next in line the turn was mine
the new girl at the counter was cute not as fine as me
was this some kind of womens intuition some kind of insecurity
nah cause my man is happy at home lovin me exclusively
so i shook my head whats up
hello she smiled as she rung me up
orange juice 329
croissants 485
she sniffed
butter 89 cents
she sniffed
strawberries 150 a pint
she sniffed and sniffed and sniffed and sniffed again
and then replied raheem right
