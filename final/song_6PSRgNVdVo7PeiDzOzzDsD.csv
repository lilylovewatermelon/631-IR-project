this feeling never leaves you alone
you pull the trigger on your own
youre hiding in your safe place
hiding with your eyes shut tightly
all the way to the hospital
now will you ever rest your head
you end up feeling mostly dead
pretending youre the last one
hiding with your eyes shut tightly
all the way to the hospital

chorus
before i cross my heart and hope to die at all
take off my mask and leave the lies to the liars

verse 2
it never used to hurt before
it isnt funny anymore
it isnt funny anymore
feeling so alone now
funny how you wish some way
that you could die at the hospital
youre quiet on the car ride home
youre waiting for your head to explode
youre hiding in your safe place
hiding with your eyes shut tightly
all the way to the hospital
you might also likespoken interlude
i dont feel okay
i dont feel alright ahhahaha
oh my god i dont know

chorus
before i cross my heart and hope to die at all
take off my mask and leave the lies to the liars
before i close before i close my eyes im gonna give it up
take off my mask take off my mask and leave the lies to the liars
leave the lies to the liars

bridge
will you look them in the face
could you look me in the face
three cheers you fooled them all
cmon hiphiphooray
three cheers you fooled them all
cmon hiphiphooray
hiphiphooray

chorus
before i cross my heart and hope to die at all
take off my mask and leave the lies to the liars
before i close before i close my eyes im gonna give it up
take off my mask take off my mask and leave the lies to the liars
leave the lies to the liars
