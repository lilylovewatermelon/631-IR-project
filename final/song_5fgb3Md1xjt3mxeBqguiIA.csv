never want to stand upon myself
never want to get in the way i said it
i dont know what the plan is but you can share with me
cause ill be a listening ear
to everything you say i wont turn away
and ill listen open up my heart and
i must say that i love you so

and its better this time than ive ever known

verse 2
every day is a battle i face
strange life i live but its what youve decided
i give it all into your hands
do what you will with me
and ill ill smile when you speak
remember all those times i was hoping for something
and shaking my head from all i had done
but you never left me

chorus

and its better this time than ever before
oohlalove ive fallen in love
and its better this time than ive ever known
oohlalove ive fallen in love
and its better this time than ever before

and its better this time than ive ever known
