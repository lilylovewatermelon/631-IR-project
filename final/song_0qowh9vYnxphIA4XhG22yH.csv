we talk bad and we talk good
you are just making us more famouse
just love my fans  i even love the hatters you know
im use to it

sometimes it just feels that
if we werent aventura
trabajo en la fritura
you wouldnt speak of us
and all these girls all love us 
do they really really love us
cause in school it wasnt like this
y hoy todo cambio

no me conoces solos escuchas mi voz
you dont know me
you havent spoke to none of us
como te atreves a llamarme comparon
yo soy humilde tengo buen corazon
para llegar a la fama
tienes que ser un campeon
weve been booed out of stage
and look at us
you cant stop us you cant fade us
i love my fans but fuck the haters
this industry is full of hate and love
hoy me siento ser el mas popular
pero no olvido mi barrio
holla back mi gente hermosa
que tanto quiero
dominicano puertorrique√±o
gracias a dios gracias a mami
gracias papa
