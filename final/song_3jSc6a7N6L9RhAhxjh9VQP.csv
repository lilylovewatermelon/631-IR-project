i only had a couple drinks last night
and a few good hits from an antler pipe
and i must admit i had a few white lines
and i dont know what all happened
i woke up in the noontime light
with a poundin head shiner on my eye
and i dont know how and i dont why
but it feels like fierce abandon

chorus
ah working on a buildin outta handhewn brimstone
workin on a buildin and im buildin on it all alone
well there aint nobody in my room tonight
goodnight honey honey sleep tight
ma i swear im doin’ all right
but when the evenin comes around
i swear to god

verse 2
pay no mind to the words i say
cause they aint no count anyway
ive been ramblin around and led astray
by the paths that i been choosin
cuttin paths like a forest fire
pupils wider than backhoe tires
throwin my money on a funeral pyre
but it sure feels good abusin
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likechorus
ah working on a buildin outta handhewn brimstone
workin on a buildin and im buildin on it all alone
well there aint nobody in my room tonight
goodnight honey honey sleep tight
ma i swear im doin’ all right
but when the evenin comes around
i swear to god

verse 3
bands too loud for their bible thumpin
it feels too good to not count for somethin
big sandy rock sludge river roll
goddamn fire in the hole
look out baby im bound to blow
im bound to blow a gasket
damn good gig good damn crowd
good god for cryin out loud
comin’ off stage i was mighty proud
then i dont know what all happened

chorus
ah working on a buildin outta handhewn brimstone
workin on a buildin and im buildin on it all alone
well there aint nobody in my room tonight
good night honey honey sleep tight
ma i swear im doing all right
but when the evenin comes around
i swear to god
i swear to godembed"
