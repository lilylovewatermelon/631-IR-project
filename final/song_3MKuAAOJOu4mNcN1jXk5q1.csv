throw a dog a bone ill take it if i have to
go real fast like theres somewhere we can get to
whats the use of standing right there on the edge if there aint nowhere to fall
whats the use in hanging on tight to the phone if nobody might call

chorus
desperation
theres danger in frustration
complicated words slipping off of your tongue and aint one of them the truth
im still desperate for you

verse 2
tell it like a lie live it like a movie
give a heart away like it dont mean nothing to me
whats the use in making all the plans that we made if you werent gonna go
whats the use of slapping on a smile for a face if your eyes dont wanna show

chorus
desperation
theres danger in frustration
complicated words slipping off of your tongue and aint one of them the truth
im still desperate for you

bridge
well its too damn bad you didnt have a chance to make me your best friend
you were too caught up in giving too much up and not doing what you should have been

desperation
theres danger in frustration
complicated words slipping off of your tongue and aint one of them the truth
im still desperate for youembed"
