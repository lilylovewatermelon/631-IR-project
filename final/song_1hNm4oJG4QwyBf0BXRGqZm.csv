lyin beside you watching you sleepin
after youve loved me so tenderly
im searchin for some way to tell you
how good it felt when i held you
theres so many ways you get to me

chorus
cause youve got the touch
it turns me on and on
you light a fire in me
that keeps burning strong
the longer im with you
the deeper and deeper in love i fall
youve got the moves
you move me so much
youve got the touch

verse 2
as you wake up you pull me closer
and whisper good morning warm in my ear
nobody could do that like you do
you make it so easy to love you
and i know i will for a million years

chorus
cause youve got the touch
you turn me on and on
you light the fire in me
that keeps growing strong
the longer im with you
the deeper and deeper in love i fall
youve got the moves
that move me so much
youve got the touch

chorus
cause youve got the touch

the longer im with you
the deeper and deeper in love i fall

youve got the touch
