this night walk the dead
in a solitary style and crash the cemetery gates
in the dress your husband hates
way down mark the grave
where the searchlights find us drinking by the mausoleum door
and they found you on the bathroom floor

chorus
i miss you i miss you so far
and the collision of your kiss that made it so hard

verse 2
back home off the run
singing songs that make you slit your wrists
it isnt that much fun staring down a loaded gun
so i wont stop dying wont stop lying
if you want ill keep on crying
did you get what you deserve
is this what you always want me for

chorus
i miss you i miss you so far
and the collision of your kiss that made it so hard
