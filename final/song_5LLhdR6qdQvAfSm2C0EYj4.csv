wash away the anger wash away the anger

verse 1
here i stand beneath the warm and soothing rain
the droplets falling gently down on the terrain
wash away the sorrow all the stains of time
but theres no memory its only dry inside

prechorus
in the mud and sinking deeper
into a peaceful life

chorus
and it will come like a flood of pain
pouring down on me
and it will not let up until the end is here
and it will come through the darkest day
in my final hour
and it will never rest until the clouds are clear
until it finds my dreams have disappeared
my dreams disappearyou might also like3embed"
