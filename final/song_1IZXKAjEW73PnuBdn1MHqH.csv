a showmans life is a smokey bar
and the fevered chase of a tiny star
its a hotel room and a lonely wife
from what ive seen of a showmans life

chorus
nobody told me about this part
they told me all about the pretty girls
and the wine and the money and the good times
theres no mention of all the wear and tear
on an old honky tonkers heart
well i might have known it
but nobody told me about this part

verse 2
a boy will dream as children do
of a great white way until the dream comes true
and a phony smile in a colored light
is all there is to a showmans life

chorus
nobody told me about this part
they told me all about the pretty girls
and the wine and the money and the good times
no mention of all the wear and tear
on an old honky tonkers heart
well i might have known it
but nobody told me about this part

and nobody told me about this part
they told me all about the pretty girls
and the wine and the money and the good times
theres no mention of all the wear and tear
on an old honky tonkers heart
well i might have known it
but nobody told me about this part
