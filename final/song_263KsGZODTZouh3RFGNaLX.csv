“and uh there’s a song there that’s that’s coming from you know from inside me”

verse 1
louise she just wasnt thinking
when she climbed into his bed
she only wanted to lie beside him
to hell with his best friend
she woke him up and she whispered
but the answer wasnt good
whatever made you think i would ever love you
even if i could

chorus
louise louise
you cant be anybodys friend
louise louise
ill love you til im dead
louise louise
not even if she likes the way you dance
louise never heard about puppy love
cause they dont know that term in france

verse 2
she came from across the country
just to stare into her phone
she came to the same apartment
she only wanted to be left alone
and she could catch anybodys attention
but it never won her friends
love could kick you out on the streets
but it never paid your rent
you might also likechorus
louise louise
you cant be anybodys friend
louise louise
ill love you til im dead
louise louise
not even if she likes the way you dance
louise never heard about puppy love
cause they dont know that term in france4embed"
