verse 1
yeah this is not natural yeah this is not natural
a bunch of holes where the dead used to be on the ground
forget supernatural forget supernatural
cause all those resting in peace are out and walking the streets
yeah with no heartbeat

across the sky they can hear you on the other side
a scream thats loud enough to wake the dead
and all alone you bought tickets for the nightmare
as you wake the dead wake the dead

an empty hole in your chest where your heart used to beat
