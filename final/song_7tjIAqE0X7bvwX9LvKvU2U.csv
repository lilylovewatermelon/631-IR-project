missed the saturday dance
i heard they crowded the floor
couldnt bear it without you
i dont get around much anymore
thought id visit the club
got as far as the door
theyd have asked me about you
i dont get around much anymore

bridge
and oh darling i guess my minds more at ease
but nevertheless why stir up old memories

verse 2
been invited on dates
might have gone but what for
awfully different without you
i dont get around much anymore

oh i missed that saturday dance
but i heared they flooded the floor
i couldnt bear it without you
dont get around much anymore
so i thought id visit the club
but i only got as far as the door
someone will ask me about you
i dont get around much anymore
