lived through you
safe with how we lived our lives
with how it all turned out
but things are bound to change
uncovered lies surfaced throughout
will make you change your mind

chorus 1
sometimes life is altered
wont turn out right cant turn out right

verse 2
when i see you i can read it in your eyes
fate misunderstood
but things are bound to change
swallowed the lies cant blame you for
thinking with your heart

chorus 2
sometimes life is altered
break from the ropes your hands are tied
uneasy with confrontation
wont turn out right cant turn out right

bridge
i see my world crumble and fall before my eyes
i know i know
dark will turn to light in time ill be alright
i know i know
i never imagined my life could turn out this way
so cold so black so alone
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeverse 3
living goes by fast catch your breath
and it will pass you by
and it wont last to sulk with the memories you hold

chorus 2
sometimes life is altered
break from the ropes your hands are tied
uneasy with confrontation
wont turn out right cant turn out right
sometimes life is altered
break from the hopes your hands are tied
uneasy with confrontation
wont turn out right cant turn out right5embed"
