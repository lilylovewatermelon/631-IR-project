we should have waited
its alright
we should have waited

chorus
we love to break the season
we used to shake the beehive
to relax and rewind

we should have waited
its alright now

see why you cry see why you save
your regimen is gonna die
see what you know
lets see what you throw
your regimen

waiting so
waiting i know

chorus
we love to break the season
we used to shake the beehive
to rewind
see alien ant farm liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likewe should have waited
its alright now

see why you came see why you go
your regimen is oh too slow
see why you cry get sting from the hive
your regimen

waiting so
waiting i know
and i dont mind

chorus
we love to break the season
and your the reason
we used to shake the beehive
to relax

we love to break the season
and your the reason
we used to shake the beehive
and rewind

see and we dont mind
are you sane are you ashamed
see and we dont mind
are you sane are you ashamed

see and we dont mind
and we dont mind
and we dont mind

and we dont mind
we love to break the season
and your the reason
we used to shake the beehive
to relax and rewindembed"
