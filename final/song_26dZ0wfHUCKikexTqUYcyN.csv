verse ramirez
whippin the grain inside the caddy do my thing upon the fuckin floor
hit em with that onetwo step and then i rob this nigga ho
slidin by my chain you see the diamond pinky ring and stones
thats dancing in my mouth shinin like they been hit by the rain
im ruthless im heartless straight out of the fucking coffin
gorilla the killa the pimp thats always flossin
bendin corners in that escalade lovin pussy stayin paid
swervin through the interstate the moneys always callin mane
pull up to the liquor store to get some woods and sip a four
run up to the barbecue to shoot these dice and play ceelo
bumpin classics smokin magic never worry bout no static
pussyboy this automatic bitch you want it you can have it
swingin with them elbows peanut butter jelly coke
candy paint be drippin so you know that bitch fresh off that ho
poppin trunk and bangin screw trunkin twos say what it do
parkin pimpin mackin women thought you knew that im a fool
