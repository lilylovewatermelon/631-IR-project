oh she hates to say goodbye
so she only says goodnight
when she goes she stops to look behind
and ill sink
oh she sleeps with one eye closed
so she can tell when shes alone
oh no yeah summer comes and goes
but ill sink

chorus
oh shes the sunset in the west
oh she is sleep when i need rest
and though the ship can be saved yet
and oh for you i would never sink again
and oh for you i would never sink again

verse 2
oh she promises to write
i know its harder if she tries
so i have grown to tell myself a lie
and ill sink
time slows to let me talk alone
high hopes dont last me very long
winding roads they never seem to stop
but ill sink
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 104you might also likechorus
oh shes the sunset in the west
oh she is sleep when i need rest
and though the ship can be saved yet
and oh for you i would never sink again
and oh i would never sink again
and oh i would never sink again
and oh i would never sink again
and oh for you i would never sink again
and oh for you i would never sink again

outro
oh shes the path in which i tread
oh shes the shiver up my neck
oh shes the blood rush to my head
oh for you i would never sink again
and oh for you i would never sink again2embed"
