at a loss for something different to say
ive said everything weve said it all before

refrain
an extra nail for your coffin

verse 2
im going to ride that horse weve beaten to death
and deliver its stinking carcass to your doorstep
a gift from all the dead children
that are the progeny of your ballistic union

chorus
borrowing from peter to rape paul
no news is good news
but ive got some news for you
fetch me a rope lynch mob of one

refrain
an extra nail for your coffin

verse 3
certain blood has been shed for uncertain reasons
you will never quiet this storm
a cold wind to chill your bones
i bring the hammer down
see lamb of god liveget tickets as low as 14you might also likechorus
borrowing from peter to rape paul
no news is good news
but ive got some news for you
fetch me a rope lynch mob of one
