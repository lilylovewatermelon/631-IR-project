theres two ways this goes now
as our love comes crashing down
you could be the flame that burns out
or you could turn and burn it down
and in my life ive found the sweetest killers hanging around
waiting on your undeserving lips to smile on a life you know exists

chorus
so if you worry dont worry bout me
i always wanted you to see
the california coastline on your own time
and if you worry dont worry bout me
i always wanted to be free
in the simple way
i found in all of those younger days

verse 2
if i dont wake up trace me on the asphalt
let the morning rain wash me away
theres two ways this goes now
as our love comes crashing down
you could be the flame that burns out
or you could turn and burn it down
and look at what you have now
the silver dagger in your mouth
waiting on the words to come down
that this aint working out

but if you worry dont worry bout me
i always wanted you to see
the california coastline on your own time
and if you worry dont worry bout me
i always wanted to be free
in the simple ways
i found in all those younger days

outro
if you worry dont worry about me
if you worry dont worry about me
if you worry dont worry about me
if you worry dont worry about me
am i blue enough am i blue enough

if you worry dont worry about me
if you worry dont worry about me
if you worry dont worry about me
if you worry dont worry about me
am i blue enough am i blue enough1embed"
