while i down kentucky bourbon i am waiting for a call
and the moon and stars tonight are playing shadows on the wall
with the moon the way it is dear would you answer out of spite
or are you feeling lonely tonight
cuz i remember last time we were out under the stars
driving crooked down the highway drinking beer in roadside bars
now and then i wonder why this painful memory
can never find its way to you from me

chorus
and i cant dial the phone just now even though i know your number
cant bring my broken heart to be untrue
like you did today youll say goodbye the same old way
ever since you hung up on me im hung up on you

verse 2
well the house im ringing up from is a half a mile from you
but with the reception im getting might as well be timbuktu
and behind the door of your home is a strange and foreign land
where you speak a language i dont understand

chorus
and i cant dial the phone just now even though i know your number
cant bring my broken heart to be untrue
like you did today youll say goodbye the same old way
ever since you hung up on me im hung up on you
you might also likeverse 3
now im goin down to jimmys bar like a thousand other times
with an appetite for poison and a suitcase full of dimes
and ill wait there by the payphone with one hundred other guys
with those sorry hung up teardrops in our eyes

chorus
and i cant dial the phone just now even though i know your number
cant bring my broken heart to be untrue
like you did today youll say goodbye the same old way
ever since you hung up on me im hung up on you

outro
ever since you hung up on me im hung up on youembed"
