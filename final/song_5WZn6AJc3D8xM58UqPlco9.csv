i took a walk on a saturday night
fog in the air just to make my mind seem clear
where do i go from here
i see my breath pushing steam through the air
shaking hands run through my hair
my fears where do i go from here

chorus
is it my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other
my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other

verse 2
walking down to the waters edge
asking why im here instead of home
now i stand alone
i stop to stare at the ocean side
im breathing in just to fill inside with peace
like you were here with me

chorus
is it my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other
my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other

oh its on the warmest night
its in the brightest light
its when the world is moving
oh its in the faintest cry
its in the lovers eyes
is when i need you most
and dont you know

chorus
is it my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other
my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other
my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other
my fault is it my fault
weve been missing each other
weve been missing each other12embed"
