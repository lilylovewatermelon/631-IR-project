no more water in the lake
no more fish in the ocean
they grew wings flew away
i got a clue where theyre going
they want a break they want a break
no more water in the lake
no more fish in the ocean
they grew wings flew away
i got a clue where theyre going
they want a break they want a break

prechorus
all the lucky ones kept fucking it up
threatened our lives but it wasnt enough
didnt wanna sit down couldnt listen to nobody
so everybody went out of control

chorus
thrashing in platinum dust
damage that cant be undone
tragic of weapons

bridge
they want a break
everybody went to outer space
the second that the sun exploded
im the only fool who stayed

all the lucky ones kept fucking it up
threatened our lives but it wasnt enough
didnt wanna sit down couldnt listen to nobody
so everybody went out of control
