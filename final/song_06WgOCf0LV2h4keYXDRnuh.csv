the drought was the very worst ahah ahah
when the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
it was months and months of back and forth ahah ahah
youre still all over me like a winestained dress i cant wear anymore

prechorus
hung my head as i lost the war
and the sky turned black like a perfect storm

chorus
the rain came pouring down
when i was drownin thats when i could finally breathe
and by mornin
gone was any trace of you i think i am finally clean

verse 2
there was nothin left to do ahah ahah
when the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
so i punched a hole in the roof ahah ahah
let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

prechorus
the water filled my lungs i screamed so loud
but no one heard a thing
