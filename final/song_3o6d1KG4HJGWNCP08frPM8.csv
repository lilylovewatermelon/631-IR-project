have i answered the question who am i
mmhmm
well i confront it all the time were teaching people how to use their head the uh point is that in order to use your head you have to go out of your mind you have to go out of all of the uh static symbolic ways in which you think

verse 1
if it was colors and shapes the imaginary
stead of all of this weight that we have to carry
would you be able to breathe
and if you could just find where that comfort resides
no distraction or movement that fucks with your mind
would you let them see
while beneath the ocean i met with the captain
who sank to the floor on his ship
all of his passengers escaped to safety
but he was not done with his trip
he looked up and smiled asked me how do you do
i told him im losin my grip
he told me son if you want to hold onto yourself
then let yourself slip

chorus
fall oohoohooh
fall oh
fall
oh it feels good to fall
oohoohooh oohoohooh

these puzzles are so hard to make into pictures
of something that theyll understand
they could open their eyes still be blind to the beauty
but march on the heart of this land ohoh
why dont you turn around and go home
they invade your minds and then fill them with nonsense
these things that a man doesnt need
take out the love and the passion and hope
and they fill it with nothing but greed
while floating through galaxies they said i couldnt
i noticed how sad one can get
cause the ignorant mind is so peaceful i find
i cant understand nothin no more

chorus
if i jump let me fall yeah oohoohooh
if i jump let me fall oh
fall
oh it feels good to fall
oohoohooh oohoohooh
