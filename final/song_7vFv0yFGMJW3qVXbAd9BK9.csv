we got the afternoon
you got this room for two
one thing ive left to do
discover me discovering you
one mile to every inch of
your skin like porcelain
one pair of candy lips and
your bubblegum tongue

prechorus
and if you want love well make it
swim in a deep sea of blankets
i take all your big plans and break em
this is bound to be a while

chorus
your body is a wonderland
your body is a wonder ill use my hands
your body is a wonderland

verse 2
something bout the way
your hair falls in your face
i love the shape you take when
crawling towards the pillowcase
you tell me where to go
and though i might leave to find it
ill never let your head hit the bed
without my hand behind it
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likeprechorus
you want love well make it
swim in a deep sea of blankets
i take all your big plans and break em
this is bound to be a while

chorus
your body is a wonderland
your body is a wonder ill use my hands
your body is a wonderland
ill never speak again again
ill use my hands

bridge
damn baby
you frustrate me
i know youre mine all mine all mine
but you look so good it hurts sometimes

chorus
your body is a wonderland ill never speak again again
your body is a wonder ill use my hands
your body is a wonderland ill never speak again again
your body is a wonderland ill use my hands21embed"
