pain made to order

pain

verse corey taylor
im not the second coming im the first wave
better get an army cuz the fire left me unscathed
you betcha bottom dollar im the top of the shit pile
so stick around cuz ill get to you in just a few

step off the achtung get back or get stung
idiotic sense of yourself are you that dumb
entire legion of me totalitarian
the one and only motherfucka top of the world man

cause i cant stand it planned it gonna crashland it
in other words consider me branded
another version of me another version of you
both barrels  what you gonna do

bridge corey taylor
all i hear is human noise
you made your own fucking choice
i belong to only me
silence for my revelry
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likebreakdown corey taylor
i can only die over time
filthy hands stay away from mine
every reason is a right to hate
painful clutch  death is fine give me mine

chorus clown  corey taylor
only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away

breakdown corey taylor
somebody explain this
you dont care cause you dont exist
what the fuck is this another joke
reckoning

chorus corey taylor clown  chris fehn
only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away

only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away
only one of us walks away3embed"
