what i do its the truth
when i drink i cant think
when i use i need more
when youre weak i cant speak
close your eyes and taste this wine
the cork removed less purified

i throw away everything that you say
erase everything that you think

what i feel its a sin
tell the truth do not lie
make a wish wont come true
one way streets one track mind
open up and see the light
one million ways to hypnotize
i throw away everything that you say

erase everything that you think
erase everything that you think

piss it piss it all awayyou might also likeembed"
