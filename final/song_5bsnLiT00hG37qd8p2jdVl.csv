i thought i saw you in the battleship
but it was only a lookalike
she was nothing but a vision trick
under the warning light
she was close close enough to be your ghost
but my chances turned to toast
when i asked her if i could call her your name

verse 2
i thought i saw you in the rusty hook
huddled up in a wicker chair
i wandered over for a closer look
and kissed whoever was sitting there
she was close and she held me very tightly
til i asked awfully politely
please can i call you her name

chorus
and i elongated my lift home
yeah i let him go the long way round
i smelt your scent on the seatbelt
and kept my shortcuts to myself

verse 3
i thought i saw you in the parrots beak
messing with the smoke alarm
it was too loud for me to hear her speak
and she had a broken arm
it was close so close that the walls were wet
and she wrote it out in letraset
no you cant call me her name
you might also likebridge
tell me wheres your hiding place
im worried ill forget your face
and ive asked everyone
im beginning to think i imagined you all along

chorus
i elongated my lift home
yeah i let him go the long way round
i smelt your scent on the seatbelt
and kept my shortcuts to myself

verse 4
i saw your sister in the cornerstone
on the phone to the middle man
when i saw that she was on her own
i thought she might understand
she was close well you couldnt get much closer
she said im really not supposed to but yes
you can call me anything you want51embed"
