far in ohhhh wait we singing
take everything left from me
all to blame

verse 1
how can we still succeed taking what we dont need
telling lies alibis selling all the hate that we breed
supersize our tragedies you cant define me or justify greed
bought in the land of the free land free

chorus
and were all to blame
weve gone too far from pride to shame
were trying so hard were dying in vain
were hopelessly blissful and blind to all we are

postchorus
we want it all with no sacrifice

verse 2
realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear
stand to salute say thanks to the man of the year
how did we all come to this you cant define me or justify greed
a greed that we just cant resist resist

tell me now what have we done
we dont know i cant allow
what has begun to tear me down believe me now
we have no choice left with our backs against the wall

weve gone too far from pride to shame
were hopelessly blissful and blind when all we need
is something true to believe
