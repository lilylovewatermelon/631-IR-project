dont walk too proud dont talk too loud
and make it up as you go
and take whatever you are given
and leave what you think you know at the door

chorus
as she said
you could be my kind of man
and will you do the best you can
and i could use a little time
i need to straighten out my mind
and im gonna break on break on through
and i close my eyes and think of you

chorus
and you said
you could be my kind of man
and will you do the best you can
find a thing that you love
find a thing you understand
find a thing that you love
find a thing you understand

bridge

you could be my kind of man
you could be my you could be my
you could be my kind of man
