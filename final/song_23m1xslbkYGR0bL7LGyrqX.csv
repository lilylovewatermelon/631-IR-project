​juicy j​
you know the time is tickin short now im reachin for the vault
grab them clothes that match the night and them things they call they aunt
yes a nigga know im quiet if you dont talk they think your soft
but i be quick to pull and blast and leave your body full of chalk
never talk cause when you talk these hoes be all up in your biz
bring the word up where you livin all the shit a nigga did
ho i aint did no fucking dirt or rolled no bodies in the trunk
i shipped some keys over seas medal flour mixed with funk
i call the police 911 theirs been a murder on my set
and when they pull up on my set we pop them things and then we jet
on the low is how i keep it if you want your blood to spill
run your mouth off in the street and pull your gun to shoot to kill
if you real if you realer than a motherfucking gang
on the block is where you hang throw them motherfucking thangs
nigga chopping up the cake slinging rocks or pushing weight
ghetto niggas from the south aint no law that we cant break

you might also like​dj paul​
what you know about going out heading out riding out down south
finding dj paul with the gold and diamonds in his mouth
riding in the rover with the bars and the broads in the cars behind me
could you tell me howd you find me
rolex hanging up out the window shiny as hell
i must have gave myself away with my diamond bezzle​bling​
sling the rover in the garage cranking up the caprice
time to check up on my traps in the bazbusy week
zoners hanging on corners slanging that marijuana
ho we been known since we been gone good since this early morn
biggitybust them dust them thinking we blood donors
in my hood im like whats up with something thats on us
grooving with the hypnotize camp posse boys
took my credit card the lexus bought ten of them toys ha ha
i got you thinking wishing you was thru with the hypnotizers
but facing failure you can get the club crunk like us

verse 3 project pat​
knickyknack paddywhack automatic ghetto bust
some say they down but they shady so in glock i trust
i shall bust if you in it mane represent it mane
if its all about that ghetty green then im with it mane
understand where im coming from out the ghetto slum
project pat tear da club up thugs out here slanging drugs
making lame dugs bite the dust if they step to us
aint no need to cuss even fuss let that luger bust
if you real you can keep it real never fake the deal
if you gotta kill for your meal then you handle that
in the street the gat is a tool used for regulating
popping off lead at your hat when you violating
incriminating eyes when you see me passing in my lex
haters in disguise dont you book this killa to a test
laid to rest must have been your time for you to clock out
had a vest but you should have had your fucking glock out
