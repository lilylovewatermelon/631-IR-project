thirty nine candles burn out on a cake
each representing a million mistakes
the last one still burns there is a wish i can make
this time i am getting it right

so i close my eyes and i take a deep breath
and i promise myself in the time i have left

chorus
i am going to work like i do not need the money
i am going to laugh like i am not afraid to cry
i am going to dance like nobody is watching
i am going to love while i still got the time

verse 2
loving me has not been easy on you
i do not know why but i know you still do
it maybe my day but here is a present for you
you are looking at your new man

he is sincere and sober and faithful and kind
and he is home when you need girl and starting tonight

chorus

no more excuses and no more me doing things wrong
life is too short baby i have wasted ours for too long
and baby from now on
