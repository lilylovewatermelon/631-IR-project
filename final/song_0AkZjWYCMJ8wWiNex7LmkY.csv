two days past eighteen
he was waitin for the bus in his army greens
sat down in a booth in a cafe there
gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair

verse 2
hes a little shy so she give him a smile
and he said would you mind sittin down for a while
and talkin to me im feelin a little low
she said im off in an hour and i know where we can go

verse 3
so they went down and they sat on the pier
he said i bet you got a boyfriend but i dont care
i got no one to send a letter to
would you mind if i sent aone back here to you

chorus
i cried
never gonna hold the hand of another guy
too young for him they told her
waitin for the love of a travelin soldier
our love will never end
waitin for the soldier to come back again
nevermore to be alone
when the letter said a soldiers comin home
you might also likeverse 4
so the letters came from an army camp
in california then vietnam
and he told her of his heart it might be love
and all of the things he was so scared of

verse 5
he said when its gettin kinda rough over here
i think of that day sittin down on the pier
and i close my eyes and see your pretty smile
dont worry but i wont be able to write for a while

chorus
i cried
never gonna hold the hand of another guy
too young for him they told her
waitin for the love of a travelin soldier
our love will never end
waitin for the soldier to come back again
nevermore to be alone
when the letter said a soldiers comin home

verse 6
one friday night at a football game
the lords prayer said and the anthem sang
a man said folks would you bow your heads
for a list of local vietnam dead
verse 7
cryin all alone under the stands
was a piccolo player in the marchin band
and one name read and nobody really cared
but a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

chorus
i cried
never gonna hold the hand of another guy
too young for him they told her
waitin for the love of a travelin soldier
our love will never end
waitin for the soldier to come back again
nevermore to be alone
when the letter said a soldiers comin

chorus
i cried
never gonna hold the hand of another guy
too young for him they told her
waitin for the love of a travelin soldier
our love will never end
waitin for the soldier to come back again
nevermore to be alone
when the letter said a soldiers comin home13embed"
