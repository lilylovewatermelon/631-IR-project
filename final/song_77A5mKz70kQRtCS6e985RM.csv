silver winged broken english boys they smoke
talk and joke above the water
new york lady holding in her heavy hand
sacred lantern guiding dawn

chorus
quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back
quit all that quit all that quit all that
quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back
quit all that quit all that quit all that

verse 2
casting glances backwards but its not your fault
turned to salt for wondering
in your braids and heavy pages we were folded
kiss the cold and dirty ground

chorus
quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back
quit all that quit all that quit all that
quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back
quit all that quit all that quit all that

verse 3
seasons wake with sleeping birds now flying south
covered mouth we watch in awe
fallen pines to shape the skyline take me there
beneath the barren colored moon
quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back
quit all that quit all that quit all that
see gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likebridge
greeting all the masses
from their teeming shores
she was born with open hands
her color color color is coming back
color color color

outro
quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back
quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back
quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back
quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back
quit all that quit all that quit all that looking back
