the one which allows them to sleep well
well walk along our own path
the one which will lead us to our own bliss

but we need hints
before we get tired
but we need hints
before we get tired

now we need hints
before we lose pace
we need a hint
to know were on the right track

we need hints
before we get tired
but we need hints
before we get tired

now we need speed
before we lose pace
we need a hint
to know were on the right tracksee josé gonzález liveget tickets as low as 50you might also like2embed"
