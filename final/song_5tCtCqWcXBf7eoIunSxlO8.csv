honey this club here is stuck up
dinner and diatribes
i knew well from our first hookup
the look of mischief in your eyes
your friends are a fate that befell me
hell is the talkin type
i’d suffer hell if youd tell me
what youd do to me tonight

tell me tell me tell me ah

chorus
that’s the kind of love
ive been dreamin of
thats the kind of love
ive been dreamin of

verse 2
honey i laugh when it sinks in
a pillar i am upright
scarcely can speak for my thinkin
what youd do to me tonight
now that the evenin’ is slowin’
now that the ends in sight
honey it’s easier knowin
