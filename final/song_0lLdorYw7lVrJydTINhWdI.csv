its beginning to look a lot like christmas
everywhere you go
take a look at the five and ten
its glistening once again
with candy canes and silver lanes aglow
its beginning to look a lot like christmas
toys in every store
but the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
on your own front door

verse 2
a pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
is the wish of barney and ben
dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
is the hope of janice and jen
and mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again
its beginning to look a lot like christmas
everywhere you go
theres a tree in the grand hotel one in the park as well
its the sturdy kind that doesnt mind the snow

verse 3
its beginning to look a lot like christmas
soon the bells will start
and the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
right within your heart
its beginning to look a lot like christmas
toys in every store
but the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
on your own front door

sure its christmas once more5embed"
