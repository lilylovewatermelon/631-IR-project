these fancy things in magazines
diamond rings and beauty queens
but nothin seems to sparkle like you do
these fine cigars and caviar
expensive cars and movie stars
but everything i need is in this room
oh and ive seen the lights from new york to vegas
and ive tasted wine from venice to paris
and ive seen the sights
nothin comparin to you

chorus
so i aint lookin over fences tryna find a better view
my search for all that ended when i first laid eyes on you
and the grass is always greener
cause the sun shines when you smile
and when im holdin you the world makes sense
on my side of the fence

verse 2
if i ever win the lottery
it wouldnt mean a lot to me cause i already got you to hold my hand
and if a genie gave me a million wishes
id spend them all on all your kisses
and save just one to stay right where i am
see dan  shay liveget tickets as low as 12you might also likechorus
so i aint lookin over fences tryna find a better view
my search for all that ended when i first laid eyes on you
and the grass is always greener
cause the sun shines when you smile
and when im holdin you the world makes sense
on my side of the fence

bridge
youre the rain on the roof in the summer
youre the leaves in the fall changing color
youre the whisper i hear in the thunder
on my side of the fence
youre the reason my hearts beating faster
youre the tears falling down from the laughter
youre the only one im after

chorus
so i aint looking over fences trying to find a better view
my search for all that ended when i first laid eyes on you
and the grass is always greener
cause the sun shines when you smile
and when im holdin you the world makes sense
baby when im holdin you the world makes sense
on my side of the fence
outro
you know it does baby
on my side of the fence
