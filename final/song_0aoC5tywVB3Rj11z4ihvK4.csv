i see her and im filled with doubt
i dont know if this parking place
is just another empty space

words ive said arent coming true
i dont know if its me or you
this promise is too hard to keep
i have to speak

so what i lied
but the truth wouldve been suicide
monogamy is all she wants from me
but i see my life and its way too short

dont blame me
for not being subservient to others needs
im at the point where honesty
just doesnt fucking work for me

i did my best to try
and be a mirror of society
but we both know the mirrors cracked
and everybodys in the act

faking what they cannot feel
hoping they can make it real
reality is killing me
is killing me
you might also likeso what i lied
but the truth wouldve been suicide
monogamy is all she wants from me
but i see my life and its way too short

dont blame me
for not being subservient to others needs
im at the point where honesty
just doesnt fucking work for me

monogamy is all she wants from me
but i see my life and its way too short

erect a life ill never see
ill stand back from the scenery
and laugh at all the other guys
who never could escape in time

stuck like flies on sticky tongues
chewed up fore their life is done
im not here to compromise or apologize

so what i lied
but the truth wouldve been suicide
monogamy is all she wants from me
but i see my life and its way too short
dont blame me
for not being subservient to others needs
im at the point where honesty
just doesnt fucking work for me

life is too fucking short
its too fucking short
its too fucking shortembed"
