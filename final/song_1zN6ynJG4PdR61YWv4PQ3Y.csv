my hands are searching for you
my arms are outstretched towards you
i feel you on my fingertips
my tongue dances behind my lips for you
this fire runs in through my being
burning im not used to seeing you

prechorus
im alive

i can feel you all around me
thickening the air im breathing
holding on to what im feeling
savoring this heart thats healing

verse 2
my hands float up above me
and you whisper you love me
and i begin to fade
into our secret place
the music makes me sway
the angels singing say we are alone with you
i am alone and they are too with you
