verse 2 50 cent
sunny days wouldnt be special if it wasnt for rain
joy wouldnt feel so good if it wasnt for pain
death gotta be easy cause life is hard
itll leave you physically mentally and emotionally scarred
this is for my niggas on the block twistin trees in cigars
for the niggas on lock doin life behind bars
i dont say only god can judge me cause i see things clear
crookedass crackers will give my blackass a hundred years
im like paulie in goodfellas you can call me the don
like malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
slim switched sides on me let niggas ride on me
i thought we was cool why you want me to die homie homie

chorus 50 cent
many men
many many many many men
wish death pon me
lord i dont cry no more
dont look to the sky no more
have mercy on me
have mercy on my soul
somewhere my heart turned cold
have mercy on many men
many many many many men
wish death pon me
verse 3 50 cent
every night i talk to god but he dont say nothin back
i know he protectin me but i still stay with my gat
in my nightmares niggas keep pullin tecs on me
psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
the feds didnt know much when pac got shot
i got a kite from the pens that told me tut got knocked
i aint gon spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
are you illiterate nigga you cant read between the lines
in the bible it says what goes around comes around
hommo shot me three weeks later he got shot down
now its clear that im here for a real reason
cause he got hit like i got hit but he aint fuckin breathin

chorus 50 cent
many men
many many many many men
wish death pon me
lord i dont cry no more
dont look to the sky no more
have mercy on me
have mercy on my soul
somewhere my heart turned cold
have mercy on many men
many many many many men
wish death pon me133embed"
