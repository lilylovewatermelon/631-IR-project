verse 2
i can be your lady im a woman
im a motherfucker but they got a problem
put some babies in your life and take away the drama
put the paper in a picture like a diorama
gotta face a lot of people of the opposite
cause the world told me we aint got the common sense
gotta prove it to myself that im on top of shit
and you would never know a god without the goddesses
honest as fuckin honest get
and i could be on everything
i mean i could be the leader head of all the states
i could smile and jiggle it til his pockets empty
i could be the ceo just look at robyn fenty
and ima be there for you cause you on my team girl
dont ever think you aint hella these niggas dream girl
they wanna pit us against each other
when we succeedin for no reasons
they wanna see us end up like we regina on mean girls
princess or queen tomboy or king yeah
youve heard a lot youve never seen nah
mother earth mother mary rise to the top top
divine feminine im feminine why
