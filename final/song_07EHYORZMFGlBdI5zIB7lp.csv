i pledge allegiance to the flag
of the united states of america
and to the republic for which it stands people
one nation under god indivisible
with liberty and justice for all it feels so good to be back
mosh with me now

verse 1
scrutinize every word memorize every line
i spit it once refuel reenergize and rewind
i give sight to the blind my insight through the mind
i exercise my right to express when i feel its time
its just all in your mind what you interpret it as
i say to fight you take it as ima whip someones ass
and if you dont understand dont even bother to ask
a father who has grown up with a fatherless past
who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin
and juggling both perhaps mastered his craft slash
entrepreneur whos helped launch a few more rap acts
whos had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
of his career typical manure movin past that
mr kisshisasscrack hes a class act
rubber band man yeah he just snaps back

verse 2
all the people up top on the side and the middle
come together lets all form and swarm just a little
just let it gradually build from the front to the back
all you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
dont matter what color all that matters were gathered together
to celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
if it rains let it rain yeah the wetter the better
they aint gon stop us they cant were stronger now more than ever
they tell us no we say yeah they tell us stop we say go
rebel with a rebel yell raise hell we gon let em know
stomp push shove mush fuck bush
until they bring our troops home come on just

chorus
come along follow me as i lead through the darkness
as i provide just enough spark that we need
to proceed carry on give me hope

put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog
to the light at the end of the tunnel we gon fight we gon charge
we gon stomp we gon march through the swamp
we gon mosh through the marsh take us right through the doors come on
verse 3
imagine it pourin just rainin down on us
moshpits outside the oval office
someones tryna tell us somethin maybe this is god just
sayin were responsible for this monster this coward
that we have empowered this is bin laden
look at his head noddin
how could we allow somethin like this without pumpin our fists
now this is our final hour
let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
try to amplify it times it and multiply it by six
teen million people all equal at this high pitch
maybe we can reach alqaeda through my speech
let the president answer a higher anarchy
strap him with an ak47 let him go
fight his own war let him impress daddy that way
no more blood for oil
we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
no more psychological warfare
to trick us to thinkin that we aint loyal
if we dont serve our own country were patronizin a hero
look in his eyes its all lies
the stars and stripes have been swiped washed out and wiped
and replaced with his own face mosh now or die
if i get sniped tonight youll know why
cause i told you to fight
chorus
so come along follow me as i lead through the darkness
as i provide just enough spark that we need
to proceed carry on give me hope
give me strength come with me and i wont steer you wrong
put your faith and your trust as i guide us through the fog
to the light at the end of the tunnel we gon fight we gon charge
we gon stomp we gon march through the swamp
we gon mosh through the marsh take us right through the doors come on
outro eminem  hailie jade
and as we proceed
to mosh through this desert storm
and these closing statements
if they should argue let us beg to differ
as we set aside our differences
and assemble our own army
to disarm this weapon of mass destruction
that we call our president for the present
and mosh for the future of our next generation
to speak and be heard
mr president mr senator
can you guys hear us28embed"
