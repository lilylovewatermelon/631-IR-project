cant get the stink off
hes been hanging round for days
comes like a comet
suckered you but not your friends

prechorus
one day hell get to you
and teach you how to be a holy cow

chorus
you do it to yourself you do
and thats what really hurts
cause you do it to yourself just you
you and no one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

postchorus
do it do it to yourself

verse 2
dont get my sympathy
hanging out the fifteenth floor
youve changed the locks three times
he still comes reeling through the door
you might also likeprechorus
one day ill get to you
and teach you how to get to purest hell

chorus
you do it to yourself you do
and thats what really hurts
cause you do it to yourself just you
you and no one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself

instrumental break

chorus
you do it to yourself you do
and thats what really hurts
cause you do it to yourself just you
you and no one else
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself
you do it to yourself
oh to yourself
