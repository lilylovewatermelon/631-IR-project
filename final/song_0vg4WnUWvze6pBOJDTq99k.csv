my life is brilliant
verse 1
my life is brilliant
my love is pure
i saw an angel
of that im sure
she smiled at me on the subway
she was with another man
but i wont lose no sleep on that
cause ive got a plan
chorus
youre beautiful
youre beautiful
youre beautiful its true
i saw your face in a crowded place
and i dont know what to do
cause ill never be with you

verse 2
yeah she caught my eye
as i walked on by
she could see from my face that i was
fucking high
and i dont think that ill see her again
but we shared a moment that will last til the end
