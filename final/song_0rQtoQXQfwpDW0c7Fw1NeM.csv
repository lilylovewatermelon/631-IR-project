before i check the mic check check one two
i give it a extra swipe with a lysol disinfectant wipe good evening
coronavirus in effect tonight
antiseptics on deck i got every type yeah
i throw on my tux then i yeah give zero fucks then i yeah
act like a jockstrap uh cup my nuts then i yeah
check my ball hair what make sure its all there yeah
then call the pallbearer yeah
its music to bе murdered by again why stop
overkill likе a pipe bomb in your pine box
youre all hitched to my cock what
went from punchin a time clock to getting my shot
then treated it like a cyclops
like its the only one i only one eye got
and my thoughts are like nines cocked chkchk
every lines obscene pervertedest mind got the dirtiest rhyme stocked
thats why theres parental advising visine every time i drop eye drop
so throw on the theme to alfred ill channel him like the panama canal
but how could i get up in arms about you saying trash is all that i put out
bitch i still get the bag when im putting garbage out
plus the potty mouth im not about to wash it out
the filthiest so all this talk about im washed up how preposterous
because if cleanliness is next to godliness
its obvious that its impossible for me to be beside myself
and im bout that capital like a proper noun
still on top the pile
got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial
quick to call you out on your bullshit
dont make me give that crock a dial
cause if i do it see you later alligator
made it out the trailer then i made a vow to cater to no one
so hate ive gained about the same amount thats in my bank account
so heres some more shit for you to complain about i say the
bars that never slack yeah but always get attacked yeah
i think theyre gunnin for me its startin to feel like that
like im marked cause when i rap its like fallin on my back in a tar pit
cause i have this target on my back ew yuck
but if i ever doublecrossed my fans and lost my stans
id probably pop five xans yeah
go in my garage start my van
inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust i can
and doze off like snores
but odds like that with these thoughts i haves like a giant getting squashed by ants
if this is the test of time id pass with flying colors
like i just tossed my crayons tossed my crayons
small medium and large size cans
sanitizers of all types brands cost nine bands
which is a small price for lysol wipes and
if my palms brush across my pants i wash my hands

verse 2
i sit in silence in candlelit environments
sipping wild irish while getting violent
homicidal visions when im spitting like this

which is really childish and silly but im really like this
im giving nightmares to billie eilish im diddys side bitch

interlude
what the fuck hold on wait

oh im still east side bitch

verse 3
so til the end since epmd

cause at the present yeah i outrap em all wrap em all im at the mall
got your bitch in a bathroom stall she could suck a basketball uh
through a plastic straw yeah with a fractured jaw damn
my dick is coat check ha she wanna jack it off yeah
im so far past the bar i should practice law
mentally im fucked up generally general lee duh
dukes of hazzard car yeah get the cadaver dogs
cause this is murder murder and youll get murked murked
this music bout to kill you brr brr brr
this chicken hit my phone she said chirp chirp
i said hut hut hike your skirt skirt
then go eat some worms like the early bird
what the fuck is love thats a dirty word
make me fall in it theres not a girl on earth
or any other planet thats a world of hurt
and i wont buy her designer cause i dont pander panda
but im back with so many knots i need a chiropractor damn
and this the final chapter why cause im either frying after oh
or they gon give me the needle what like a vinyl scratcher dj
yeah im a card like hallmark
at walmart with a small cart buying wall art
and yall who claim to be dogs arent
no bite like a tree mostly just all bark arf arf
but yall pickin the wrong tree they call me dog because im barking bar king bark bark barking
and i got a lot yeah like where cars park
id describe it as bowling why ball hard balls hard
cause the gutters where my mind is and when
its in this frame better split like the five and the ten
cause without a second to spare im strikin again
and when the beat is up my alley i go right for the pens pins
the cypher begins
im talkin smack like heroin the mics a syringe
its like a binge vicodin i would liken to tin
my mind is a recycling bin
theres no place i never been
but i never budge and i never bend
you hyperextend on me this games life it depends
like adult diapers for men
even when im rappin less stellar
its sour grapes i still whine im the best seller cellar
like a trey deuce spray you as these shots penetrate through dres booth
and go straight through your grapefruit no escape route
so you wont leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds
your ass is grass and i am not gonna graze you
but if bars were semimacs id be the mad hatter
cause i got so many caps and you dont have any straps nah
so youd be a fitted yeah so dont act like you fittin to snap
bitch ill pee p on your head like a phillies hat haha
no stoppin me youre on a window shopping spree
bitch you probably go broke at the dollar tree
you never buy shit all you ever cops a plea
youre always punkin out like halloween
you rather opt to flee you need to stop it punk
homie youre not a g act like you got the pump
and youre gonna cock the heat or get the glock and dump
bitch if you shot a tree you wouldnt pop the trunk
yeah and im buddies with alfred we about to
disembowel them gut em and scalp em yeah
this is bout to be the bloodiest outcome
cause we gon make you bleed with every cut from this album
so im choppin em up like dahmer
the nut job with the nuts that are bigger than jabba the hutt
im in the cut and im out for the blood
its lookin like its that time of the month
carvin em up with the bars while i sharpen em up dog and a mutt
im gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer fuckin phenomenal but
yall will get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you dont vámonos
i keep droppin like dominos the formidable abominable
stompin a mudhole in my comp even if its off the top of the dome
son em get the coppertone im at the stop and go coppin the mop and glo
got your stomach in knots like you swallowed rope
you out of pocket though like a motherfuckin wallet stole
outro
wait whyd the beat cut off
fuck it114embed"
