when she moved in down my street
still dont know what she saw in me

i guess she like the way i made her laugh
she wanted more than what friends have
she kissed me once and we never looked back

first time was down by the river
our sweat made both us shiver
dont stop darling theyre just raindrops
the moonlight was all around
our breath the only sound
baby darling she said take me
and drive me crazy

in the woods in my grandpas barn
in the backseat of my car
she said it doesnt matter where we are

she made me thirst for a womans love
i kept drinking couldnt get enough
yeah there was magic in her velvet touch

first time was down by the river
our sweat made both us shiver
dont stop darling theyre just raindrops
the moonlight was all around
our breath the only sound
baby darling she said take me
and drive me crazy
see kip moore liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likethe leaves changed and the sky turned grey
her daddys job took her away
i can still see the tears rolling down her face
oh yeah

first time was down by the river
our sweat made both us shiver
dont stop darling theyre just raindrops
the moonlight was all around
our breath the only sound
baby darling she said take me
and drive me crazy

baby drive me crazyembed"
