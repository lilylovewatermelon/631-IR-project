baby i aint never been the type to dance
but tonight may be the night
i get on it
a few shots of the patron i lose my mind this sick
and i might lose my balance
because i hit that blunt too many times
come down is what i have to tell myself yeah
cause when i get in my zone
i cant even see nobody else
im standing on furniture
and my outfits so fly oh
they telling me i should relax
but im like why
