hey hey like fragments of a broken mind
hey hey i splinter by my own design
hey hey the search is not a waste of time
on and on this road keeps burnin
break away my hands are glued upon the wheel
break away the road ahead is all i feel
break away the only thing left thats real
on and on ill take this
