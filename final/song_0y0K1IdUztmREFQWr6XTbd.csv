verse 1 bun b
now bein king of the undergrounds a title i wear with pride
like my syrup and swisha cant leave without it when i ride
even though im the king of the city where i reside
i wouldnt and couldnt do it without my woman on my side
sometimes i got it figured out sometimes im confused
i win 9 times out of 10 but now and then i might lose
but no matter the road i choose and how the drama unfold
a playa always got his better half right on his shoulders
she gon hold me down to the fullest rainy or sunny
she seen me ball out of control and dead broke with no money
so when the game got funny she aint pack up and roll
she help me get back on my feet now man thats way too cold
if you got a down woman witchu keepin it true
dont try to hate appreciate her for the things that she do
this dedicated to the dedicated ladies that stand up
if you keep it real wit your man then put your hand up cmon

but the real women that play the game like they suppose

verse 2 talib kweli
uhh im bout to spoil you show you my gratitude
i love the all of you even your attitude
never gonna give you blacknblues thats abuse im not that dude
take it back to when i held yo hand and my name became yo back tattoo
i love the fact that you dont need me to make you whole
doin it fast or takin it slow you know when to let me take control
and i apologize for puttin tears inside them eyes
when i wasnt fair didnt compromise filled you with fear when i told them lies
how i love to dive inside them thighs i love your cockiness
aint gonna ask if you roll in rap you know this right its obvious
im an underground king with a winner down queen im fin to let her know
this aint about bling this aint about cream i never let her go
we smokin love smokin love you know whats up know whats up
this for the real women thats you throw it up
cause your mans so focused you rub your lips lovin the bub cause i open you up
you got my back whether broke or reup in the crush limosine cause we rollin up
