it must be your skin im sinking in
it must be for real cause now i can feel
i didnt mind its not my kind
its not my time to wonder why
everything gone white everythings grey
now youre here now youre away
i dont want this remember that
ill never forget where youre at

chorus
dont let the days go by
glycerine glycerine

verse 2
im never alone im alone all the time
are you at one do you lie
we live in a wheel where everyone steals
but when we rise its like strawberry fields
treated you bad you bruise my face
couldnt love you more youve got a beautiful taste

chorus
dont let the days go by
couldve been easier on you
i couldnt change though i wanted to
it should have been easier by three
our old friend fear and you and me
glycerine glycerine
dont let the days go by
glycerine
dont let the days go by
see bush liveget tickets as low as 28you might also likepostchorus
glycerine glycerine
uh glycerine glycerine

bridge
bad moon white again
bad moon white again
as she falls around me

verse 3
i needed you more you wanted us less
i could not kiss just regress
it might just be clear simple and plain
well thats just fine thats just one of my names

chorus
dont let the days go by
couldve been easier on you you you
glycerine glycerine
