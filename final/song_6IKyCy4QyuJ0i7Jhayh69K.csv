i really see you upside down
but my brain knows better
it picks you up and turns you around
turns you around
turns you around

if you feel discouraged
when theres a lack of color here
please dont worry lover
its really bursting at the seams
from absorbing everything
the spectrums atoz

ah ah
ah ah
ah ah
ah ah
ah ah

this is fact not fiction
for the first time in years
all the girls in every girlie magazine cant make me feel
any less alone
im reaching for the phone
to call at 703
on your machine i beg and plead
for you to come home
but its far too late
see death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also likei should have given you a reason to stay
