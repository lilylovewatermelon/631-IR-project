hey there honey in your cut up jeans
whatcha drinkin i was thinkin you could save a sip for me
ive been lookin cross the party all night long
at you movin your hips with your pretty lips singin along
to a country song
climb on up here with me
in my truck cause if we
dont go ridin around
im gonna run my battery down

chorus
so if youre ready to roll girl just let me know girl
i dont know who brought you here and he left you alone
but he aint worth the time youre spendin
textin him on the phone girl
its time to move on girl
i got a radio and a shotgun seat
and its gettin late
its time for me to take you home girl

verse 2
its alright if you live way out
i got enough gas to take you all over this town yeah
when we pull in the drive ill walk you up to the door
im a good guy girl ill settle for a kiss on the porch
unless you want one more
now he aint payin no attention
dont know what hes missin
so baby what do ya say
why dont you just walk this way
see thomas rhett liveget tickets as low as 37you might also likechorus
when youre ready to roll girl
just let me know girl
i dont know who brought you here and he left you alone
but he aint worth the time youre spending textin him on the phone
its time to move on girl
i got a radio and a shotgun seat
and its getting late
its time for me to take you home girl
come on lets go girl

bridge
so when youre ready to roll girl
we can take it nice and slow girl
might even find a place to park
sit there and watch the stars

outro
put on a show girl
hey i dont know girl
i got a radio and a shotgun seat
and its getting late
its time for me to take you home girl
you can be my home girlembed"
