knock knock whos there
2012 is a brand new year
cleaning house singing songs
shedding light and righting wrongs
ding dong the witch aint dead
shes still trying to take my bread
four more years til my girls all gone
then the bitch gonna have to leave me alone
its all good cause im as happy as a flea
on a mountain of dogs you see
a little music cured all the hurt
and put hate in six feet of dirt

chorus
i was looking for some heaven
theres no need to look no more
california 37
took me right to heavens door
knock knock woahoh
rock and roll
california 37
took me right to heavens door

verse 2
heres to those who didnt think
train could ever roll again
you were the fuel that i used when
inspiration hit a dead end
san francisco got it done 415 took the 911
thank you all for believing in
we wont let you down again
truth is it was attitude
replaced greed with gratitude
then replaced a pretty key dude
its all truth not being rude
making love now not mistakes
working hard instead of looking for breaks
came all the way from the eighth great lake
and found 37 reasons to stay
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likechorus
i was looking for some heaven
theres no need to look no more
california 37
took me right to heavens door
knock knock woahoh
rock and roll
california 37
took me right to heavens door

i was looking for some heaven
theres no need to look no more
