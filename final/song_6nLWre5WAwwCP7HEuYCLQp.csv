we made mornin love
as the mourning doves
sang a song for us
they were warnin us
they were mournin our love
it was more than our love
they cried over us
it was over for us

chorus
oohoohoohooh
oohoohoohooh
oohoohoohooh
oohoohoohooh

verse 2
ages and phases and stages
but baby there really aint no end
some doors were closed just for others to open
im hopin you let me in
truth to be told were only gettin older
but closer than we ever been
the doves werent cryin they only were tryin
to tell us to try it again
