my boss hes a probable bore
put me hands and knees on scrubable floor
do it right receive the lions share bliss
know all too well just where that ration is

verse 2
learned a lot about the company dough
learned less about receiving it though
saw how it came to those who always sat pretty
dont need it

chorus

verse 3
my girl had a probable cause
or so she said and took a probable pause
i was dumped for occupying her time
i asked her why and what was next in line she said

verse 4
shiny hairthats my life ambition
but ill devote my time to a newer mission
the rizzlerazzle kitsch of paranoid city
dont need it
