if youre waiting for a parade there aint none
sharpen up your spirit of adventure the fabulous gay way
hey whats the big idea yeah
i have no ideas in fact im quite bewildered
now dont get gay with me
gay sir im far from gay
now listen and keep your shirt on
grown men in a rubber suit runnin around with a young boy
homo

verse 1
oh shoot get a load of that fruit
in thighhigh boots red tightywhities and blue cat suit
holy homos even the rats know it’s tacky
you ever see me slippin like that bitch just smack me
posin chest and legs open couldn’t stand worse
all was missin was a bandana and a man purse
cryin dyin laughin til glands burst
faster than a speeding glass bleedingass ran first
fixin baby hair messed up wavy curl
under the cape the back of the s say baby girl
the things some people‘ll do for fame
it’s an herb it’s a lame its a goddamn shame
villain willing when them cold streets call
you can keep your hero and hold the meatballs
worthy title lock it with pockets on empty
he work harder than a steam engine like john henry
turn dirt to dollars like don henley
ugly and still get hollers like ron jeremy
at least monetarily terribly
mcs need therapy it’s like a fairy spree
hit him with a kryptonite brick kryptonite
children come and prick his dead body with a stick
wrote this lyric from in the bed with a chick
she had the tightest grip around the head of my
you might also likeinterlude
how much money you got
i aint got but four dollars on me
damn
anyway i dont got this whole censored for ya
shit you must be some kind of faggot man
my partner a faggot why dont you come on out here man
man what the hell

verse 2
bic now can i get my pen back
got no enemy got no friend black
with the green goblin got the batcave robbed
bust in batman’s head bobbin’ slobbin’ robin’s knob
yall already got your belts on the floor so
kick them shits over here and click off the porno
alfred come home and found them both naked
handcuffed to each other just as he had suspected
red and chrome batmobile wheelin‘ and dealin’
aquamans sleepin with the fishes for real for squealin’
psst the lolo on a seal skin blazer
it’s just a little graze from a razorthin laser
amazed at all these socalled wannabe players
showin off they titballs to all the freegayers
it’s like a leotard fest
how it got started is any retards guess
regardless that’s they choice no hate debate
becomes a problem when they try an attempt to go straight
and raise the monster rate in the whole population
it’s starting to affect the super pimpin occupation
now who’s the hater headline the newspaper
fate of a fake you out caped crusader
tied to the tracks make a damn tram derail
rap is like scam spam nigerian email
the man with no beard is more weirder than a shemale
sucker got bagged on a temazepam street sale
told em one of ours set it up yeah doubt
did it like the dirty drawls wet ‘em up and air it out
outro
you got any money what
listen you got any money
man you goin crazy what the hell for
four dollars only damn
