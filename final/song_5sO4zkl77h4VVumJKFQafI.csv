hear me out day follows today
light turns to clay in my hands
how to explain so pristine the pain
kindness made the cut so clean

chorus
i still care for you
i still care for you
i still care for you

verse 2 ray lamontagne
hear me out you wanted me to be
less your lover than a mirror
cant you see what you mean to me
even promises may bleed

chorus
i still care for you
i still care for you
i still care for you

verse 3 ray lamontagne
the hours grow heavy and hollow
cruel as a grave
open me and youll find
only bones burned to glass

i still care for you
i still care for you
