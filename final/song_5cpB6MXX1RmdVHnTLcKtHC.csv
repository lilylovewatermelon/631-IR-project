pull up on my job and make ‘em go work
we hit the singles club her hips are double time
got three finals this week but she dont care she get some money first
i understand to feel myself i started from the dirt
now i’m just like clean our goal is to flip a silver dollar out a dream
i mean it looks just how it seems
apologize if that came off as openended
she took it as backhanded and got offended
like you know what you no different
you think every bitch is the same
and boy dont you know them chips can dip as quick as they came
i came to the scene she want the taste of the fame
at the end she want a lick of that cococococaine
tell you like your voice let your hips do the talking
contrary to what you think they really say this often
but watching you whine make me really wanna know
would you mind if you with it we can go
