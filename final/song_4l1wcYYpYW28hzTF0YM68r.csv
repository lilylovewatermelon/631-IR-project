chorus
it was trials and tribulations on the road to chasing that paper
seen so many faces been so many places caught some cases
crazy thing is out of all life done taught me
before you get one win you gotta take a thousand losses
i remember nigga yeah straight up you know me
how would i ever forget how could i ever forget yeah yeah
i remember oh i remember
how could i ever forget how would i ever forget

verse
i remember everything the shine and the struggle
i remember all the pain all the grind all the hustle
i remember elementary when pops would come and get me
and take me to the neighborhood with valerria and whitney
then pops had went to prison i remember every letter
i remember bitches playing with my heart cause i would let em
i remember whatshisname told me bro lets stick together
but we couldnt stick together cause niggas change just like the weather
i still remember the first night when i met mr raymond
i was on the block with glocks when uncle dereck came to save me
remember back in middle school when i met derek bailey
and he taught me how to sack that weed stack that cheese and save it
but i still fucked it up i remember tryna shake back
me and sir kendrick in the kitchen cookin fake crack
i remember my first show i remember who booked me
i remember all you opps from middle school them niggas was pussy
i remember my first stolen car i was with lil chaz
i had just jumped off the porch but lil bruh was moving fast
i remember when i first met kareem we was coolin
a year later we was breakin in them houses shootin movies
if we catch a nigga late night no pipe its a wrap
we made lil whatshisname jump off his bike and thats a fact
remember when i first caught a buzz with my raps
money came and niggas changed and stabbed me in my back
remember when i first confessed my love and i cried
asked you bout that other fuck nigga and you lied
no longer could i stand to see the truth in your eyes
so i went somewhere else to find love and you know why
remember sitting in my cell blaming the streets
mama came to see me said the blame was on me
remember lenny died the city cried for a week
i remember when you niggas testified on lil c
