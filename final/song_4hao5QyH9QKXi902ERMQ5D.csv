time and time again i stand at the crossroad
where the weight of my burden eclipses my resolve
this broken path ive chosen i walk it alone
though i feel forgotten youve carved my name in stone

chorus
in these desperate times this i plead
when all else fails remember me

verse 2
this is daily crucifixion and these rusty nails leave scars
my jagged crown is at my side
anguish is never far

chorus
in these desperate times this i plead
when all else fails remember me

verse 3
this is a bloodoath
they are nothing to me anymore
but your voice means more to me than youll ever know

bridge
theres no question
youre the answer
i will find you

in these desperate times this i plead this i plead
when all else fails remember me
in these desperate times this i plead this i plead
when all else fails remember meembed"
