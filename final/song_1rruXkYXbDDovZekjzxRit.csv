i was feeling sad
cant help looking back
highways flew by
run run away
no sense of time
like you to stay
want to keep you inside

chorus
run run run away
lost lost lost my mind
like you to stay
want you to be my prize

chorus
run run run away
lost lost lost my mind
like you to stay
want you to be my prize

cant help looking back
highways flew by
run run away
no sense of time
like you to stay

all alone
not so strong without these open arms

all alone
not that strong without these open arms
lie beside
all alone
not so strong without these open arms
lie beside
