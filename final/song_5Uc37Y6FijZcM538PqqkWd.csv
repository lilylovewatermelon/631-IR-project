i feel my lotus bloom
come closer
i want your energy i want your aura
you are my destiny my mantra

i never knew i could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight
oh ohohohoh

take me down to the river
underneath the bloodorange sun
say my name like a scripture
keep my heart beating like a drum
legendary lovers
we could be legendary lalalalala
