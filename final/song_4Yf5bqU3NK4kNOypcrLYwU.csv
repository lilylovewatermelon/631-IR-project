i am a little bit of loneliness
a little bit of disregard
handful of complaints but i cant help the fact
that everyone can see these scars
i am what i want you to want
what i want you to feel
but its like no matter what i do i cant convince you
to just believe this is real

prechorus mike shinoda
so i let go watchin you
turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that im not
but ill be here cause youre all that ive got

chorus chester bennington
i cant feel the way i did before
dont turn your back on me i wont be ignored
time wont heal this damage anymore
dont turn your back on me i wont be ignored

verse 2 mike shinoda
i am a little bit insecure
a little unconfident
cause you dont understand i do what i can
but sometimes i dont make sense
i am what you never wanna say
but ive never had a doubt
its like no matter what i do i cant convince you
for once just to hear me out

so i let go watchin you
turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that im not
but ill be here cause youre all that ive got

chorus chester bennington
i cant feel the way i did before
dont turn your back on me i wont be ignored
time wont heal this damage anymore
dont turn your back on me i wont be ignored

youre gonna listen to me like it or not
right now hear me out now
youre gonna listen to me like it or not
right now

breakdown chester bennington
