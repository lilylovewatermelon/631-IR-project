seize the day or die regretting the time you lost
its empty and cold without you here
too many people to ache over

refrain
i see my vision burn
i feel my memories fade with time
but im too young to worry
the streets we traveled on
will undergo our same lost past

verse 1
i found you here now please just stay for a while
i can move on with you around
i hand you my mortal life but will it be forever
id do anything for a smile
holdin you til our time is done
we both know the day will come but i dont wanna leave you

refrain
i see my vision burn
i feel my memories fade with time
but im too young to worry
a melody a memory or just one picture

newborn life replacin all of us

no longer needed here so where do we go
will you take a journey tonight
follow me past the walls of death
but girl what if there is no eternal life

i see my vision burn
i feel my memories fade with time
but im too young to worry
a melody a memory or just one picture

silence you lost me no chance for one more day
silence you lost me no chance for one more day
