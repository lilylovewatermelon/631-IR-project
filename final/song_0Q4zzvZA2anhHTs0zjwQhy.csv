so what you waiting for
so what you waiting for

verse 1
i have never compromised
i never gave in
and so i have welcomed
every challenge in my life
and i have never wandered blind
im led by hunger and so i
savor every drop
each minute im alive

prechorus
leave nothing left behind

chorus
so what you waiting for
tell me what you waiting for
dont stand by and deny it
so what you waiting for
tell me what you waiting for
break new ground and defy it

dont let the world outside
leave you cornered and alone
so what you waiting for
tell me what you waiting for
let them all be reminded
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeverse 2
dont let them undermine
your dreams can never be stolen
dont leave them stagnant
rotting on the vine
say goodbye
to anyone who tries
to bleed you dry
you will show them
youre blessed
with an unlimited supply

prechorus
leave nothing left behind

chorus
so what you waiting for
tell me what you waiting for
dont stand by and deny it
so what you waiting for
tell me what you waiting for
break new ground and defy it

dont let the world outside
leave you cornered and alone
so what you waiting for
tell me what you waiting for
let them all be reminded
bridge
so what you waiting for

chorus
so what you waiting for
tell me what you waiting for
dont stand by and deny it
so what you waiting for
tell me what you waiting for
break new ground and defy it

dont let the world outside
leave you cornered and alone
so what you waiting for
tell me what you waiting for
let them all be reminded
