your eyes they tie me down so hard
ill never learn to put up a guard
so keep my love my candle bright
learn me hard oh learn me right

break
this aint no sham
i am what i am

verse 3
though i may speak some tongue of old
or even spit out some holy word
i have no strength from which to speak
when you sit me down and see im weak

chorus
we will run and scream
you will dance with me
theyll fulfill our dreams and well be free
and we will be who we are
and theyll heal our scars
sadness will be far away

verse 2
so as we walked through fields of green
was the fairest sun id ever seen
and i was broke i was on my knees
and you said yes as i said please
you might also likeprechorus
this aint no sham
i am what i am
i leave no ties
for a cynics mind

chorus
we will run and scream
you will dance with me
fulfill our dreams and well be free
and we will be who we are
and theyll heal our scars
sadness will be far away

outro
do not let my fickle flesh go to waste
as it keeps my heart and soul in its place
and i will love with urgency but not with haste5embed"
