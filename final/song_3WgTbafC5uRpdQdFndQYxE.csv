the rap game hiphop 101

hahahaha the rap game motherfucker

verse 1 swifty mcvay
im a disrupted nigga you made me crazy
you shouldve slayed me as a baby behavin shadier
than wes craven and you aint even gotta pay me
i take pleasure of layin a nigga down daily
you face me drunk or sober you’ll faint fast
im never fucked up to where i cant whoop yo ass
your neckll get snapped with bare hands fuck music
is he rappin its cool but fools just dont confuse it
what happens these dudes get rude then i lose it
im scandalous ill blow your two kids off the atlas
with a gat thats bigger than godzillas back nigga
you are not realer in fact youll feel the effects
of a crack dealer yall presidents sends me smack
and got a mac10 with it so i aint gotta rap
but im thankful for that dont mistaken me black
or youll be stankin in the back of a fuckin cadillac

when i see that little cheney dyke get sniped out
lights out bitch adiós goodnight gunshot ah

think for a minute cause the hype just died down
that i wont go up in the oval office right now
and flip whatever aint tied down upside down
im all for america fuck the government
tell that c delores tucker slut to suck a dick
motherfucker ducked what the fuck son of a bitch
take away my gun im gonna tuck some other shit

switchblade with a little switch to switch blades
and switch from a six to a sixteeninch blade

verse 3 kon artis
i bet youd rather me drink and drown in my own inequity
but fuck that ima rap til yall all get sick of me
and clutch my nut sack and spit all who pick at me
a pitt and rott mix fuck the dogs you sic on me
im sayin you motherfuckers dont know us quit playin
if im broke then im breakin up in the place where you layin
you know same shit every nigga done in his life
i look at this why speak on what i want when i write
so why should i ever fear another man
if he bleed like i bleed take a piss and he stand
okay you win you can say we cant rap
but no source never made me not buy an album when they say it was wack

verse 4 kuniva
i walk in that party and just start bustin
right after i hear the last verse of self destruction
this liquor makes me wanna blast the chrome
to let you know the time without morris day and jerome nigga
im low down and shifty quickly call swifty
to do a driveby on the tenth speed with 50
youre feelin lucky squeeze i catch you outside of
chuck e cheese with your seed you be an unlucky g
my lifestyle is unstable a partyin addict
they said no fighting in the club – so i brought me a matic
coughin the static i jump niggas call me a rabbit
poppin the tablet and guns that saw you in half with
bridge 50 cent
believe me we run this rap shit fo sheezy
make makin millions look easy
everywhere you turn you see me
you hear me believe me
before you see my pistol in 3d
no time to call a peace treaty
dial 911 ‘cause you need the
police to help you believe me

verse 5 proof
i snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
this is absurd these street niggas twistin my words
we finally could say goodbye to hollywood
cause proof and shyne man shit nothing in common
the nastiest band with gats in each hand
we never bow down to be a flash in the pan
no remorse fuck your stature dog
nothing to do with hands when i clap at yall
put your jaw on the ground with the four and the pound
then im gone outta town fore the law come around
so we can battle with raps we can battle with gats
matter of fact we can battle for plaques

verse 6 bizarre
im too fuckin retarded
i dont give a fuck about my dick
thats why im datin lorena bobbitt
my crew had an argument who was the largest
now they all is dead and i roll as a solo artist
plus i made the beats and wrote all the raps
well i really didnt but i did according to this contract
i was thrown in the snow with nowhere to go
freezin 20 below forced to join bel biv devoe
my little girl she shouldnt listen to these lyrics
thats why i glued her headphones to her ear
to make sure she hear it
if rap dont work im startin a group with garth brooks
hahahaha 50 sing the hook
