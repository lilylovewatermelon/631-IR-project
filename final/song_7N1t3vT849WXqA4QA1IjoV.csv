cutting out the deadweight
cutting out the deadweight

verse 1 eric vanlerberghe
let me take a second to get this through to you
its time you get put in the rearview
cut ties theres nothing left to
your lies im seeing right through
let me lay it out so its clear for you to see
im done with the ones that dont believe
cut ties theres nothing left to
your lies im seeing right through

chorus brian burkheiser  eric vanlerberghe
yeah im cutting out the deadweight
yeah im cutting out the ones who drag me down
all this negativity weighing down on me
all this negativity weighing down on me
cutting out the deadweight

verse 2 eric vanlerberghe
admit its so pathetic to think id carry you
id rather watch all the lows you sink to
cut ties theres nothing left to
your lies im seeing right through
now that i can see what youre really all about
shake my hand turn your back and run your mouth
i laugh at all the time you wasted
youre bitter and i can fucking taste it
so if you think that you can drag me down
its gonna come back around
see i prevail liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likechorus brian burkheiser
