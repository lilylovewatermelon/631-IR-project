come on oh my star is fadin

come here oh my star is fadin
and i swerve out of control
and i swear i waited and waited
ive got to get out of this hole

chorus
but time is on your side
its on your side now
not pushin you down and all around
its no cause for concern

verse 3
come on oh my star is fadin
and i see no chance of release
and i know im dead on the surface
but i am screamin underneath

chorus
and time is on your side
its on your side now
not pushin you down and all around oh

stuck on the end of this ball and chain
and im on my way back down again
stood on a bridge tied to a noose
sick to the stomach
you can say what you mean but it wont change a thing
im sick of the secrets
stood on the edge tied to the noose
and you came along and you cut me loose
you came along and you cut me loose
you came along and you cut me loose13embed"
