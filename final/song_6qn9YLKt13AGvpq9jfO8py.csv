its like youre screaming and no one can hear
you almost feel ashamed that someone could be that important
that without them you feel like nothing
no one will ever understand how much it hurts
you feel hopeless like nothing can save you
and when its over and its gone
you almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
so that you could have the good

yellow diamonds in the light
and were standing side by side
as your shadow crosses mine
what it takes to come alive
