if only you could watch me fall
i cannot feel it anymore
the soul you cut the soul you adored
cannot feel you anymore
cause youve run through me with destructive force
i think somehow i gotta get it straight
i gotta get you out of me
but i cannot get through you

prechorus
see me im down and i get deeper with every breath
see me im over the edge farther with every step
see me im down and i get deeper with every breath
standing over the edge im takin my last breath

chorus
how i feel like im starless im ready to fade now
and how i feel like im starless im hopeless and grayed out
somehow i feel like im starless im ready to fade now
and now i feel like im starless im ready to burn out

verse 2
i can transcend you and mentally bend you
but i cant handle the shit that im into
i have been blinded im always reminded
of the things ive wanted but i never could find
i am a part of a world that i hate
i wish the end would come faster my worlds a disaster
cant you see that im down and im drownin
and i cant keep my head above my wake

see me im down and i get deeper with every breath
see me im over the edge farther with every step
see me im down and i get deeper with every breath
standing over the edge im takin my last breath

chorus
how i feel like im starless im ready to fade now
and how i feel like im starless im hopeless and grayed out
somehow i feel like im starless im ready to fade now
and now i feel like im starless im ready to burn out

interlude
i gotta get you out of my veins
i gotta get you out of my blood
i gotta get you out of my scene
i gotta get you out of me

bridge
but ive really tried hard to get down to words
its the way i fit into this world
think ive survived pushed me to the darker side
because of life as it was
the life that was yours shouldve been mine
but i never could take anymore of this
cause im always gonna get gonna get down to the floor
its a cold gun that i kiss
cause i cannot break anymore
chorus
somehow i feel like im starless im ready to fade now
thats how i feel when im starless im hopeless and grayed out
somehow i feel like im starless im ready to burn out
oh now im starlessembed"
