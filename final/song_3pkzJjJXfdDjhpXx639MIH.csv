if youre going out with someone new
im going out with someone too
i wont feel sorry for me
im getting drunk but id much rather be

prechorus
somewhere with you laughing loud on a carnival ride
yeah driving around on a saturday night
you made fun of me for singing my song
got a hotel room just to turn you on
you said pick me up at three am
youre fighting with your mom again
and id go id go id go somewhere with you

verse 2
i wont sit outside your house
and wait for the lights to go out
call up that ex to rescue me
climb in their bed when id much rather sleep

prechorus
somewhere with you like we did on the beach last summer
when the rain came down and we took cover
down in your car out by the pier
you laid me down whispered in my ear
i hate my life hold on to me
ah if you ever decide to leave
then ill go ill go ill go

i can go out every night of the week
can go home with anybody i meet
but its just a temporary high
cause when i close my eyes
im somewhere with you
somewhere with you

verse 3
if you see me out on the town
and it looks like im burning it down
you wont ask and i wont say
but in my heart im always

prechorus 1
somewhere with you laughing loud on a carnival ride

chorus
i can go out every night of the week
can go home with anybody i meet
but its just a temporary high
