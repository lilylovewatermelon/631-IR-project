how did we get here
how the hell
pan left  close on the steeple of the church

how did i get here
how the hell
christmas
christmas eve last year

how could a night so frozen
be so scalding hot
how can a morning this mild
be so raw
why are entire years strewn
on the cutting room floor of memory
when single frames of one magic night
forever flicker in closeup
on the 3d imax of my mind
thats poetic
thats pathetic
you might also likewhy did mimi knock on rogers door
and collins choose that phonebooth
back where angel set up his drums
why did maureens equipment break down
why am i the witness
and when i capture it on film
will it mean that its the end and im aloneembed"
