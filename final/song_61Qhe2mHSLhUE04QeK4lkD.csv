verse 1
grew up in a small town
and when the rain would fall down
id just stare out my window
dreamin of what could be
and if id end up happy
i would pray i would pray

verse 2
trying hard to reach out
but when i tried to speak out
felt like no one could hear me
wanted to belong here
but something felt so wrong here
so i prayed i would pray
i could break away

chorus 1
ill spread my wings and ill learn how to fly
ill do what it takes til i touch the sky
and ill make a wish take a chance make a change
and break away
out of the darkness and into the sun
but i wont forget all the ones that i love
ill take a risk take a chance make a change
and break away

verse 2
wanna feel the warm breeze
sleep under a palm tree
feel the rush of the ocean
get onboard a fast train
travel on a jet plane
far away i will
and break away

chorus 1
ill spread my wings and ill learn how to fly
ill do what it takes til i touch the sky
and ill make a wish take a chance make a change
and break away
out of the darkness and into the sun
i wont forget all the ones that i love i gotta
take a risk take a chance make a change
and break away

bridge
buildings with a hundred floors
swinging round revolving doors
maybe i dont know where theyll take me but
gotta keep moving on moving on
fly away break away
chorus 2
ill spread my wings and ill learn how to fly learn how to fly
though its not easy to tell you goodbye
i gotta take a risk take a chance make a change
and break away
out of the darkness and into the sun into the sun
but i wont forget of the place i come from
i gotta take a risk take a chance make a change
and break away
