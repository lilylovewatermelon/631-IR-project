verse
last night i had a dream about you
in this dream im dancing right beside you
and it looked like everyone was having fun
the kind of feeling ive waited so long
dont stop come a little closer
as we jam the rhythm gets stronger
theres nothing wrong with just a little little fun
we were dancing all night long
the time is right to put my arms around you
youre feeling right you wrap your arms around too
but suddenly i feel the shining sun
before i knew it this dream was all gone

chorus
ooh i dont know what to do
about this dream and you
i wish this dream comes true
ooh i dont know what to do
about this dream and you
well make this dream come true
