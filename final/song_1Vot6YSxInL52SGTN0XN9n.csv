verse 3 jayz with usher
they call me king hov copy big ballin is my hobby
so much so they think im down with the illuminati
my watch do illuminate my pockets are naughty
but im god body you better ask somebody
i was born a god i made myself a king
which means i downgraded to a human being
you was born a goddess i made you my queen
which mean we upgraded to louis the thirteen
hot tottie her poppy like cognac
her momma like herb tea we birthed a couple of sacks
and as the tea steeped i creeped all in her teepee
we did it indian style had the girls speaking
in tongues she like young you hung what you done done
stop it before you wake up my mom i might ah
and now that you arrived it’s time that i go
im so cold im so cold
