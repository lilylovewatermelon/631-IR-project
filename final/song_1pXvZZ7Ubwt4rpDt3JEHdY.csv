you sold me dust
get him

verse
great balls of fire
guess who just crawled out the muck and mire
that could make you trust a motherfuckin liar
a real shuck and jiver
vaughn never been a duckanddiver
he spit on the mic yuck saliva
hold it like a truck driver hold a cb on a sharp turn
still clutchin his chest from the heartburn
whats your handle i need a zantac ahk
and thanks before i blank into anaphylactic shock
rock or disco chocolate on a crisco ho
cock diesel and still tell a joke like joe piscopo
tell em the basics basically break the matrix
and just for kicks make em gel like asics
thats why they actin standoffish
eat the beat by hand like canned raw crawfish
can you please pass the cocktail sauce
you might as well know hell is hot as hell boss
tell my hoss he said broads call me vaughny
i make sure i throws em back if theys too scrawny
or bony phony mcs use a standin
leave him hangin like if i aint know where his hands been
hussy how bout we bloody up you just for me
bust a knee then go finish study a plus degree
true victory a new sick story
i never met a chick that was too thick for me
holy moses my old earth know me closest
on how i played the back and stayed bent like scoliosis
its no puzzle you can ask doc zizmor
the slow guzzle got your nizzle crooked like biz jaw
drink like a fishy she wish she was a pisces
live since back when twentyfive cents icees
used to turn your tongue the color red
now they want to fill ya full of lead
what the fuck that young fella said
what kid its vaughn the redblooded
do yourself a favor or come on get headbutted
yoke him if he run ill be there in a jiffy son
with the flame suppressor like off the 151
quit your bitchin or get blaow in your babblebox
punishment for dry snitchin now eat this travel fox
youll be alright once it pass through your yellow belly
only thing he said was can you please pass the jelly
homo say what like a promo play the cut
on the late night before you touch the mic get your weight right
a lot of crews like to act like a violent mob
they really need to just shut the fuck up like silent bob
either that or get smoked like hickory
should squash the beef and go wash their teeth quickly
know the stee write a rhyme like a mystery
and sign it on the bottom in calligraphy your nigga vyou might also like11embed"
