we wouldnt be seen dead here in the day
i guess youre lucky that its dark now
and if i like it then well stay
impress the empress take a shot now

chorus
we got the glow in our mouths
white teeth teens are out
white teeth teens are up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning
but we got our methods and theres nothing here to stop
to stop this

verse 2
if you want well help tonight to split its seams
give the bruises out like gifts
youll get the picture of your dreams
i wont be smiling but the notes from my admirers
fill the dashboard just the same ah ahah

chorus
we got the glow in our mouths
white teeth teens are out
white teeth teens are up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning
but we got our methods and theres nothing here to stop
to stop us when were up for it
i know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
i like your reckoning
but we got our methods and theres nothing here to stop
to stop this

ill let you in on something big
i am not a white teeth teen
i tried to join but never did
the way they are the way they seem
is something else its in the blood
their molars blinking like the lights
in the underpass where we all sit
and do nothing and love it

refrain
and everything works out so good
i wear the robe like noone could
and everything works out so good
i wear the robe like noone could

outro
we got the glow in our mouths
and everything works out so good
i wear the robe like noone could
white teeth teens are out
and everything works out so good
i wear the robe like noone could
white teeth teens are out76embed"
