i said that i would never do you wrong
said a million things but now i know
that i should really stick to what i said what i said

prechorus
but im stupid im wasted im a moron lets face it i blew it
you waited my last card i played it
didnt even stand to watch you go
and now youre gone

chorus
but im still so fucked in love with you
im still so fucked in love with you
i tried to move on i even kissed
every girl on the vip list
but im still so fucked in love with you

bridge
and after all the shit i put you through
after all i broke your heart in two
i was so fucked i couldnt see but i see

prechorus  chorus

verse 2
i had it all and i thought id be okay without you okay without you
i can write you this song but its not enough its not the same without
you same without you dont dont dont give up i still have hope
so dont give up it doesnt feel so far or long ago
