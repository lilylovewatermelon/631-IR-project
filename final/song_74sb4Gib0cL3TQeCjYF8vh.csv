yes i do i believe
that one day i will be where i was
right there right next to you
and its hard the days just seem so dark
the moon and the stars are nothing without you
your touch your skin where do i begin
no words can explain the way im missing you
deny this emptiness this hole that im inside
these tears they tell their own story

prechorus
told me not to cry when you were gone
but the feelings overwhelming its much too strong

chorus
can i lay by your side next to you you
and make sure youre all right
ill take care of you
i dont want to be here if i cant be with you tonight

verse 2
im reaching out to you
can you hear my call
this hurt that ive been through
im missing you missing you like crazy
