like a spotlight the water hits me
ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth
though i know that no one’s listening
i nervously rehearse for when youre around
and i keep waiting like you might change my mind

chorus
who wrote the book on goodbye
theres never been a way to make this easy
when theres nothing quite wrong but it dont feel right
either your head or your heart you set the other on fire

verse 2
back and forth now im feelin guilty
cause i just cant stop this pendulum in my head
though i know that our time is ending
oh id rather lay forever right in this bed
and i keep waiting like you might change my mind
give me one more night

chorus
who wrote the book on goodbye
theres never been a way to make this easy
when theres nothing quite wrong but it dont feel right
either your head or your heart you set the other on fire

no one knows knows

bridge
we fell from the peak
and the stars they broke their code
im trying to forget
how i landed on this road
im caught in between
what i wish and what i know
when they say that you just know

chorus
who wrote the book on goodbye
theres never been a way to make this easy
when theres nothing quite wrong but it dont feel right
either your head or your heart you set the other on fire

no one knows knows

you set the other on fire
you set the other on fire
