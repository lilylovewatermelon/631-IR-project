bet you think im sitting at home naw
bet you think that im all alone naw
i bet you think im missing you and wishing you would call my phone
hell naw
i went wheels up on a runway
and that ticket was a oneway

chorus
im somewhere on a beach
sipping something strong
got a new girl she got it going on
we drink all day and party all night
im way too gone to have you on my mind
she got a body and shes naughty
and she got me like you aint never got me
im getting sun getting some and i aint slept in a week
yeah im somewhere on a beach

verse 2
heard you called my boys
heard you called my folks
they said you drove by my house real slow
you can check any spot roll down every road
but girl i aint even close

sipping something strong

and she got me like you aint never got me
im getting sun getting some and i aint slept in a week
yeah im somewhere on a beach

on a beach towel
my shades on
my drinks up and the suns out
im somewhere on a beach

chorus
im somewhere on a beach
