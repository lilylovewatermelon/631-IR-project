verse 3 eminem
i got you caught up in the rapture make you recapture
the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
you never wanted someone so bad youre
sweatin but if im what you wanted
whyd you panic when i grabbed ya
girl dont be so frantic im just a hopeless romantic
dont try to fight the feeling of somethin thats so organic
you cant ignore it so dont just stand before it
just drop them panties to the floor lets get to camcordin
damn shawty i told you this was bound to happen
soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
i was bound to work a number on your back
and throw your spine out of alignment
my love has got you so blind that
you couldnt pick amy winehouse out of a lineup
so stop at the store pick a pint up
lets get the pineapple schnapps going no one will knock
cause ima hang a sign up saying dont disturb
shawty im so superb
i say the right things dont i spit the dopest words
