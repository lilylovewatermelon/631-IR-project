and then i got a call sayin that my cousin died in a fire
so i washed myself for what seemed like three hours
with tears and rusty water
i need some of that calgon take me away action immediately
before i start scrubbing my hands hard repeatedly
im stuck somewhere lethargic between reality
and a fuckin tool video  wake me up
ive said goodbye too many times in these 22 long ones
and here i am wavin again so long friend
i should have told her how this town doesnt like it when people leave
so it finds ways to keep them
it sows seeds and reaps them
and now shes part of that harvest but different from all the others
ask her mother how her smile touched souls and warmed cold hearts
monique i miss you
i wish i couldve kissed you farewell
and given you that tattoo you always asked for
but when im done tattin thug life on gods stomach
you got next im done yall take what you want from it
im goin to wash my hands
i miss you girlsee gym class heroes liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likeembed"
