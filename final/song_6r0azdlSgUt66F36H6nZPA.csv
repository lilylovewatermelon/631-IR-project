in the fall you were there
grace began before i was aware
a shame too great for me to hide
covered now because of jesus christ

chorus
i cant believe
the price you paid for me
what you did not owe
so that i could know you
how can it be
you chose someone like me
to declare your praise
for the glory of your name

verse 2
to the one who gave it all
i belong with all my heart and soul
and every gain i count as loss
when i survey the wonder of the cross

chorus
i cant believe
the price you paid for me
what you did not owe
so that i could know you
how can it be
you chose someone like me
to declare your praise
for the glory of your name
