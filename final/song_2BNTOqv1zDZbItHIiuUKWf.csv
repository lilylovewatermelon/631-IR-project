these days they call you crazy
if you hold the door for a lady
if you dont call her girl stead of baby
youre out of style obsolete
if you seal a deal with a handshake
sit down for a meal and you still pray
if a promise is somethin you dont break
youre the last of a dyin breed

chorus
when did old fashioned become so out of fashion
when did we go out with the old in with the new
and you can bet your ass theres a lot of us ol cats
wearin old boots and old hats
that aint ready to give old hat the boot

verse 2
we aint afraid to work in the hot sun
we can finish a fight but wont start one
we dont ever forget where we came from
weve got a degree in the old school
for all that ive learned i wish that i knew

chorus
when did old fashioned become so out of fashion
when did we go out with the old in with the new
and you can bet your ass theres a lot of us ol cats
wearin old boots and old hats
that aint ready to give old hat the boot

chorus
i say old fashioned dont go out of fashion no
you dont have to throw all of the old out for the new
and you can bet your ass theres a lot of us ol cats
wearin old boots and old hats
that aint ready to give old hat the boot
yeah theres a lot of us old hats
that aint ready to give old hat the bootembed"
