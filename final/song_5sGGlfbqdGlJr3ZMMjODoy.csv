i think i have lost so much time
over the course of calling you mine

things will go just as i planned
maybe who knows she could be down
but she wont go away

its you no one really likes
its you happy all the time

verse 3
how do i forget that shes around
is there a trick
middle ground be okay with it
cause she wont go away

its you no one really likes
its you happy all the time
