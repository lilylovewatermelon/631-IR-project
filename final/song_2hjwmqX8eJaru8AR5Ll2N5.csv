cant live this way forever
gotta make ourselves some money
or be thrown out with the bathwater

my sister and my brother
look to me for answers
and our fathers and our mothers
wanna know they raised us right
wanna know they raised us right

is it that the good life is the simple one
sittin in the lawn watchin leaves go by
readin good books and playin songs

watchin the wind blow through your front yard
dont follow your head
follow your heart

and while youre sittin all alone in your room on your bed
and your windows are open but you wont go out no
ah heaven go easy on me

and while youre sittin all alone in your room on your bed
and your windows are open but you wont go out no
ah heaven go easy on me
see the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likeits damn good tove met you i hope that you stay
were well on our way
were well on our way
were well on our way
were well on our way
were well on our way
were well on our way
were well on our way
were well on our way
were well on our way
were well on our way
all these things are rushing by
all these things are rushing by
all these things are rushing by
all these things are rushing by
all these things are rushing by
continued in background

all things must end darlin
all things must end darlin
all things must end darlin
all things must end darlin
all these things are rushing by
all these things are rushing by

ah heaven go easy on meembed"
