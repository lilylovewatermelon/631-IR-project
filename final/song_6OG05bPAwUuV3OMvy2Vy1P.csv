you took my sadness out of context
at the mariners apartment complex
i aint no candle in the wind
im the board the lightning the thunder
kind of girl whos gonna make you wonder
who you are and who youve been

prechorus
and who ive been is with you on these beaches
your venice bitch your diehard your weakness
maybe i could save you from your sins
so kiss the sky and whisper to jesus
my my my you found this you need this
take a deep breath baby let me in

chorus
you lose your way just take my hand
youre lost at sea then ill command your boat to me again
dont look too far right where you are thats where i am
im your man
im your man

verse 2
they mistook my kindness for weakness
i fucked up i know that but jesus
cant a girl just do the best she can
catch a wave and take in the sweetness
think about it the darkness the deepness
all the things that make me who i am
see lana del rey liveget tickets as low as 163you might also likeprechorus
and who i am is a bigtime believer
that people can change but you dont have to leave her
when everyones talking you can make a stand
cause even in the dark i feel your resistance
you can see my heart burning in the distance
baby baby baby im your man yeah

chorus
you lose your way just take my hand
youre lost at sea then ill command your boat to me again
dont look too far right where you are thats where i am
im your man
im your man

outro
catch a wave and take in the sweetness
take in the sweetness
you want this you need this
are you ready for it
are you ready for it
are you ready for it153embed"
