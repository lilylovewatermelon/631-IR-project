my name is volatile
i’ve been this way a long while
i’d surely like to rest but the energy gets the best of me and
it’s been a wild ride
i wouldn’t change a minute
i can’t slow down inside guess that’s why i live it
watch it now

verse 1
the years of mischief
followed by weeks of thrift
i land on earth’s hard face
no legs could keep that pace
and through the rest i sift

prechorus 1
is there ever a time
when the state of sleeping willingly leaves my mind

bridge 1
highly frustrated wanna feel elated
come monday morn you feel checkmated
you can be uncool and become the rule
exceptions were made to drown
see 311 liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeprechorus 2
i’m not used to it you’d think i’d be by now
the ins the outs the ups and the downs

chorus
i wanna make a mess
i wanna blow off stress
i wanna stoke the fire
just creatures for a while
i wanna make a mess
i wanna blow off stress
i wanna stoke the fire
just creatures just creatures

postchorus
it comes and goes and comes and goes
sometimes i go a little crazy
sometimes i go a little crazy just like you i do

verse 2
i know what you were gonna say
but were afraid to cause dismay
your lyrics switched around
the mixture watered down
and now a pointless display
prechorus 3
it’s something one won’t understand
unless theyre in it with me hand in hand

bridge 2
don’t buy the fear don’t buy that my dear
the things you love you must keep near and
carry on and you won’t feel withdrawn
even if you’re coming down

prechorus 4
sometimes it’s wearable sometimes its bearable
i careen towards balance til’ the glass is full

chorus
i wanna make a mess
i wanna blow off stress
i wanna stoke the fire
just creatures for a while
i wanna make a mess
i wanna blow off stress
i wanna stoke the fire
just creatures just creatures
it comes and goes and comes and goes

interlude
sometimes
sometimes i get a little out there
sometimes i go off
sometimes just like you
outro
i go a little crazy
sometimes i go a little crazy just like you i do
sometimes i go a little crazy
sometimes i go a little crazy just like you i do1embed"
