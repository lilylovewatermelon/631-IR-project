sound the bugle now play it just for me
as the seasons change remember how i used to be
now i cant go on i cant even start
i got nothing left just an empty heart
im a soldier wounded so i must give up the fight
theres nothing more for me lead me away
or leave me lying here

verse 2
sound the bugle now tell them i dont care
theres not a road i know that leads to anywhere
without a light i fear that i will stumble in the dark
lay right down decide not to go on
then from on high somewhere in the distance
theres a voice that calls remember who you are
if you lose yourself your courage soon will follow
so be strong tonight remember who you are

outro
yeah youre a soldier now fighting in a battle
to be free once more
yeah thats worth fighting forsee bryan adams liveget tickets as low as 56you might also like7embed"
