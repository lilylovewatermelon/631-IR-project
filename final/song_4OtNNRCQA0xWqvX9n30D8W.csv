its possible that the worst of the inside
could take our pencils away end creating
cant let the teachers lay waste of a new mind
prevent emotional drought and watch the pace quicken

chorus
try to never touch try to never touch
wont keep holding back my conscience realize
theres a choice to not end up like you
not end up like you

verse 2
lets turn our wretched debates into action
by diplomacy gain back a handshake
tied and unable to tend to the wounds that were made
so much closer to shame we see but never touch

chorus
never touch try to never touch try to never touch
wont keep holding back my conscience realize
theres a choice to not end up like you
not end up like you

search for truth
see chevelle liveget tickets as low as 161you might also likebridge
one more man tearing at the throat of
one more man never dropped as fast as
one more man coloring the fate of
one more man is better than the fate of you

chorus
try to never touch try to never touch
wont keep holding back my conscience realize
theres a choice to not end up like you
holding back my conscience realize
theres a choice to not end up like you
not end up like youembed"
