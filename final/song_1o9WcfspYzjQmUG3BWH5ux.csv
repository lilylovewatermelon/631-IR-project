soft skin you touch me within
so i know i can be human once again
i know youre faced with something
that could consume you completely
soft skin you touch me once again
and somehow it stings cause i know it is the end
i hate that youre leaving
so why dont you talk to me
you act like nothing ever happened
but it meant the world to me

chorus
and you cant and you cant see the weight in the trees
and you cant and you cant see the weight of the leaves
and you cant and you cant see the weight on my heart
and you cant and you cant see the weight on my heart
and you cant and you cant see the weight in the trees these are our—
and you cant and you cant see the weight of the leaves
and you cant and you cant see the weight on my heart these are our falling secrets
and you cant and you cant see the weight on my heart
