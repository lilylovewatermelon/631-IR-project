slow is the memory
and i can picture her standin right in front of me
said that im behaving badly
and kind of driving her crazy
but i know she wants me
i remember everything
her sweat it tastes like sugar cane
and sitting on top of me yelling out my fucking name
until im empty
but i know she wants me

chorus
but i have already tried to explain myself
its not that i love someone else
but i cant bear to listen to you cry yeah
sick of all these wasted years
drowned in someone else’s tears
you let me down now im hanging you out to dry

break
whoa ohohoh
whoa ohohoh
yeah yeah yeah yeah

verse 2
and ill see you when i get back
maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
you touch me there because you know how much i like that
i think that we both need to relax you know you want me
all the time and everywhere
a happy surface but the underbelly isnt there
and the worst thing is that i dont even really care
and the emptiness is too much to bear
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likechorus
but i have already tried to explain myself
its not that i love someone else
but i cant bear to listen to you cry
sick of all these wasted years
drowned in someone elses tears
you let me down now im hanging you out to dry

bridge
cause sometimes i dont know what to do
im scared to stand right in front of you
the way our pain subsides
cant bear the stare of your teary eyes
i know you feel like its hard to stay
in fact you may just wanna run away
now all that i can really say is baby oh
deep down you know yeah

chorus
i have already tried to explain myself
its not that i love someone else
but i cant bear to listen to you cry
sick of all these wasted years
drowned in someone else’s tears
you let me down now im hanging you out to dry
already tried to explain myself
its not that i love someone else
but i cant bear to listen to you cry
sick of all these wasted years
i’m drowned in someone else’s tears
you let me down now im hanging you out to dry
outro
oh no no no oh no no no
yeah ooh dry
