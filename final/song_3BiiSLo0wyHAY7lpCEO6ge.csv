a lifetime is startin to feel like
its fallin short of the mark
but its all that we got
every teardrop every wrong turn
made the moment we found
and its comin around around around around around

chorus
i dont wanna miss one thing
we can turn the whole world down
and listen to the inbetween
we are we are the sound
theres nothin but the space were in
the hurry and the noise shut out
just stay here and be right now

verse 2
the shadows cling to the ceiling
and fracture the light
that lands in our eyes
every moment changes the whole view
and just when it ends
i feel it again again again again again

chorus
i dont wanna miss one thing
we can turn the whole world down
and listen to the inbetween
we are we are the sound
theres nothin but the space were in
the hurry and the noise shut out
just stay here and be right now

nothin else matters
nothin else matters
nothin else matters
stay here and be right now
nothin else matters
nothin else matters
nothin else matters
just stay here and be right now

chorus
i dont wanna miss one thing
we can turn the whole world down
and listen to the inbetween
we are we are the sound
theres nothin but the space were in
the hurry and the noise shut out
just stay here and be right now10embed"
