the clocks running down
the teams losing ground
to the opposing defense
the young quarterback
waits for the snap
when suddenly it all starts to make sense

chorus
hes got all kinds of time
hes got all kinds of time
all kinds of time
hes got all kinds of time
all kinds of time

verse 2
he takes a step back
hes under attack
but he knows that no one can touch him now
he seems so at ease
a strange inner peace
is all that hes feeling somehow

chorus
hes got all kinds of time
hes got all kinds of time
all kinds of time
hes got all kinds of time
all kinds of time

he thinks of his mother
he thinks of his bridetobe
he thinks of his father
his two younger brothers
gathered around the widescreen tv

verse 3
he looks to the left
he looks to the right
and there in a golden ray of light
is his open man
just like he planned
the whole world is his tonight

chorus
hes got all kinds of time
hes got all kinds of time
all kinds of time
hes got all kinds of time
all kinds of timeembed"
