hide my face again harbor in the shadows
feel this weight of sin hammering away
die with the guilt of a thousand awol soldiers
die watch the scythe usher me astray

prechorus
i cant go on this way
not as i am today
the ugly side of me is strong
take aim a loaded gun
pull back on all who run
a cowards truth inside the wrong

chorus
this means war
this means war
this means war

verse 2
lash your tongue of bane carry me to nowhere
mental holocaust battle never ends
lie mask the pain of a child whos forsaken
lie to myself praise the new regime

prechorus
i left me long ago
reasons youll never know
no one to miss me when im gone
with no more words to say
no argument to stay
another post i dont belong

this means war
this means war
this means war
this means war

guitar solo

bridge
no home to call my own
no finding someone new
no one to break the fall
no one to see me through
no name to carry on
no promise for today
no one to hear the call
no tattered flag to raise

verse 3
walk the razors edge cut into the madness
question all you trust buy into the fear
i see the man ripping at my soul now
i i know the man i know him all too well

prechorus
theres nothin here for free
lost who i wanna be
my serpent blood can strike so cold
on any given day
ill take it all away
another thought i cant control
chorus
this means war
this means war
this means war
this means war
