dio has rocked for a long long time
now its time for him to pass the torch
he has songs of wildebeests and angels
he has soared on the wings of a demon

verse 2
its time to pass the torch
youre too old to rock no more rockin for you
were taking you to a home
but we will sing a song about you

bridge
and we will make sure
that youre very well taken care of
youll tell us secrets that youve learned

verse 3
oh
your sauce will mix with ours
and well make a good goulash baby
dio time to go
you must give your cape and scepter
to me and a smaller one for kg

outro
go go
