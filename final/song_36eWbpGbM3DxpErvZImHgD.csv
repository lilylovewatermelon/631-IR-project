girl close your eyes
let that rhythm get into you
dont try to fight it
there ain’t nothin that you can do
relax your mind
lay back and groove with mine

you gotta feel that heat
and we can ride the boogie
share that beat of love

dance you into day sunlight
i wanna rock with you all night
were gonna rock the night away
