i stepped on a flower foot on a petal
good wasnt home so i settled for better
im on my way to get it but get it got shot
so i guess i gotta work with the little bit i got
now im like hey i like the view from here
im so high i cant see you from here
both eyes on the money its looking back at me
man these bitches just looking for a daddy
pussy and problems cant live without em
the weed too loud turn up the volume
richer than a bitch but i cant buy tomorrow
thats why i go hard ho
thats why i go hard ho

verse 1
god bless the world and most people in it
its anybodys game but nobodys winning
mona lisa smile that bitch barely grinning
take you off the face of the earth like a blemish
we went from boyz to menace menace ii society
now we get higher call that shit karate
blame it on the money the money is the bad guy
smoke so much good i dont even have a bad side
yeah i got a pussy hangover
bitches eat me up like my name is russell stover
murder the perception make em get it right
if im flirting with perfection im fucking her tonight
im a southerners delight louisiana pride
the belly of the beast it ate me alive
tell them bitches theyll never take me alive
and today i took a walk outside and
see lil wayne liveget tickets as low as 80you might also likechorus
i stepped on a flower foot on a petal
good wasnt home so i settled for better
im on my way to get it but get it got shot
so i guess i gotta work with the little bit i got
now im like hey i like the view from here
im so high i cant see you from here
both eyes on the money its looking back at me
man these bitches just looking for a daddy
pussy and problems cant live without em
the weed too loud turn up the volume
richer than a bitch but i cant buy tomorrow
thats why i go hard ho
thats why i go hard ho

verse 2
uh and we all kiss our mamas
cause promises are broken but tomorrow isnt promised
think im gettin sick im feelin illegal
and not having money is the root of all evil
life is a midget so try to live it up
its dr carter bitch i got this shit nipped and tucked
if these walls could talk they probably wont shut up
i need some wallpaper before they start to fuss
yeah pick up the phone and call your bluff
human growth hormone now my pockets all buff
i dont think about the future it come soon enough
motherfucker i dont shoot ya bitch i shoot ya up
i aint like these niggas i dont like these niggas
i just roll another joint like spike lee nigga
and i woke up this morning got the cold out my eyes
and then i took a walk outside and
chorus
i stepped on a flower foot on a petal
good wasnt home so i settled for better
im on my way to get it but get it got shot
so i guess i gotta work with the little bit i got
now im like hey i like the view from here
im so high i cant see you from here
both eyes on the money its looking back at me
all these bitches just looking for a daddy
pussy and problems cant live without em
the weed too loud turn up the volume
richer than a bitch but i cant buy tomorrow
thats why i go hard ho
thats why i go hard ho
