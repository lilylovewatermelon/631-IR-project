as i walked out on laredo one day
i spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen
all wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay
then beat the drum slowly play the fife lowly
play the dead march as you carry me along
take me to the green valley lay the sod oer me
for im a young cowboy and i know ive done wrong

then go write a letter and send it ti my gray haired mother
and please send the same to my sister so dear
but please not one word of all this would you mention
if my mother should as for my story to hear
there is another more dear than a sister
shell bitterly weep
and if some other man ever wins her affection
dont mention my name and my name will pass on

just beat the drum slowly play the fife lowly
play the dead march as you carry me along
take me to the green valley lay the sod oer me
for im a young cowboy and i know ive done wrong

get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
six dancehall maidens to sing me a song
put bunches of roses all over my coffin
roses to deaden the clods when they fall
you might also likewe beat the drum slowly we play the fife lowly
we bitterly wept as we bore him along
down in the green valley we lay the sod oer him
he was a young cowboy and we know hed done wrong
first to the cardhouse and then down to roses
and there stands his marker we made to this day4embed"
