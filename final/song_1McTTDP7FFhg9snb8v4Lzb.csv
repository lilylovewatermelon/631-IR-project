another night wasted
in my parents basement
i could almost taste it
why did i ever go back home

chorus
all night
you got me runnin like a rabid animal like a dog
with no bite
how will i ever find you in the darkness
with no light

verse 2
another night wasted
in my parents basement
i dont know why i didnt chase it
when i was right on its tail

when all night
you got me runnin like a rabid animal like a dog
with no fight

with no light
