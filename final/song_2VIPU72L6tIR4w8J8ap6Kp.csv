mercy
why you gotta show up lookin so good just to hurt me
why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning
mercy
why you hanging on so tight if this aint working
why you wanna stop this flame if its still burning
cause its still burning

chorus
so if youre gonna break my heart just break it
and if youre gonna take your shot then take it
take it
if you made up your mind then make it
but make this fast
if you ever loved me
have mercy

verse 2
if you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
wind up home alone
please dont call me
and say you miss me no

chorus
if youre gonna break my heart just break it
and if youre gonna take your shot then take it
take it
if you made up your mind then make it
but make this fast
if you ever loved me
have mercy
