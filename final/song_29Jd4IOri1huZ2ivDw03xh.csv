heres your new drug
shoot it in the left eye feel it on the right side
no its not love
though it sets up shop behind your ribcage
building blood clots and black holes
like using an axe to pull a sliver from your skin

chorus
and they say this is medicine
an overdose of oxygen
a severed head as sedative
to be at peace would be a sin and surely unamerican
im breaking

verse 2
heres your new blood
transfusion took us all night tell us that youre all right
no its not love
though it feels like fire inside of your veins
burning right beneath the wrist begging for a razors kiss
to free it from your skin

chorus
and they say this is medicine
an overdose of oxygen
a severed head as sedative
to be at peace would be a sin its surely unamerican
im breaking down
see thrice liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likeoutro
down down down
im breaking down
lift the veil its not medicine
and my heart fails time and time againembed"
