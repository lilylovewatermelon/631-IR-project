a compromise
between honesty and lies
to lead me past
their sly disguise

chorus
my moves are slow
but soon theyll know
my moves are slow
but soon theyll know

verse 2
behind the scenes
they grow their schemes
hiding intentions
revealing only fractions

chorus
their moves are slow
but soon youll know
their moves are slow
but soon youll know

bridge
theyll keep on whispering their mantras
well keep on whispering our mantras
theyll keep on whispering their mantras
well keep on whispering our mantras

my moves are slow
but soon theyll know
their moves are slow
but soon youll know

bridge
theyll keep on whispering their mantras
well keep on whispering our mantras
theyll keep on whispering their mantras
well keep on whispering our mantrasembed"
