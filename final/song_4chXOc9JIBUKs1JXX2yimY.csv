i watch the days rush by me like a river
i shouldnt wait but im scared to touch the water
i let the phone ring
why wont you believe me
i wait for silence
it takes a lot not to answer

prechorus
all i have to say is you dont deserve me you dont deserve me
im finally walkin away
cause you dont deserve me and youre not worthy

chorus
and i wont let you pull me in
because i know youre gonna win
the war is over but the war is over the war is over
and i wont fight you anymore
i never been so sure
the war is over cause the war is over

verse 2
i used to let you paint a pretty picture
