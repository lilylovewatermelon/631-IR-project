she chews levi garrett by a sycamore tree
and the way she acts dont nobody know
but i sure do love it
when she crinkles her nose
woo hoo hey anna marie
woo hoo hey thats anna marie
woo hoo hey anna marie
she shows up to church about a quarter till 2
with bible in her hand and a flask in her shoe
says she come from the great unknown
twisted twelve ways from sunday
when she gets stoned

chorus
a penny for a nickel and nickel for a dime
a dime for quarter it makes her feel fine
it takes an apple a day to keep the doctor away
it takes a whole lot less to make my baby stay
