above the highway
cotton clouds
im beginning to feel im on my way to god
rainy sky prettier than i thought
rain inside
skidded into my yard
ran inside pity i wasnt far
and nobody was harmed
i wish i were

chorus
above the sky i think
theres a spot for goods
and a bad boy who do good thing for bad call
im on my way to next time
above the sky i think
theres a spot for goods
and a bad boy who do good thing for bad call
im on my way to next time
