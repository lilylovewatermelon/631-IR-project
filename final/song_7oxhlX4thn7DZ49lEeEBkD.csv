twisted just like she did back then when
the game of galaga played among friends

i told her look
i know a lot of folks around town
probably been telling you that
danny just a crook
i definitely done some things that i shouldnt be proud of
but we can do it by the book
weve known each other for a long time
i know your the strong kind of women with a strong mind
and thats what got me hooked
i got some crazy homies
whatchu talkin about
you got some crazy homies
yo quit fronting and lolly gagging
we can have a baby daughter
maybe call her maggie
weve known each other since the 9th grade
we make each other laugh
best friends lets do this the right way

chorus danny boone
listen up cause i love you lady
we go back like 1980
lord knows youre the one to change me

verse 3 danny boone
i know im still crazy
but ive changed a lot
ive cleaned up a little
and youre still hot
but if i aint the one
i hope you find true love
and if not im here when push comes to shove
just know if you walk down that aisle
with another dude to take those vows
how ill react there aint no telling
i might bust in the back of the church and start yelling

chorus danny boone
listen up cause i love you lady
we go back like 1980
lord knows youre the one to change me
you love me cause im so crazy
youll see itll be you and me
always always5embed"
