in your cup holder was some loose change
ya got your cellphone on vibrate
i wish you were on it
theres a road you got to take to get to my place
faded double yellow lines on a two lane
i wish you were on it

chorus
i could use a little you right now
rushin over runnin into my house
with want you back tears rollin down your face
drop your keys on my hardwood floor
kiss me like you never kissed me before
and girl i swear thats all that it would take
and you know the way
i wish you were on it
wish you were on it wish you were on it

verse 2
theres a parking spot under the sycamore
and the flood light on the front porch
i wish you were on it
and through the front door up the stair case
theres a four post down the hall way
i wish you were on it
you might also likechorus
i could use a little you right now
rushin over runnin into my house
with want you back tears rollin down your face
drop your keys on my hardwood floor
kiss me like you never kissed me before
and girl i swear thats all that it would take
and you know the way
i wish you were on it
wish you were on it wish you were on it

bridge
theres a heart that needs to unbreak
and you know the way

chorus
i could use a little you right now
rushin over runnin into my house
with want you back tears rollin down your face
drop your keys on my hardwood floor
kiss me like you never kissed me before
and girl i swear thats all that it would take
and you know the way
i wish you were on it
wish you were on it wish you were on it2embed"
