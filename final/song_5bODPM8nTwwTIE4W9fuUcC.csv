verse 1 zayn liam
he takes your hand i die a little
i watch your eyes and im in riddles
why cant you look at me like that nanananana
when you walk by i try to say it
but then i freeze and never do it
my tongue gets tied the words get trapped

prechorus harry
i hear the beat of my heart getting louder
whenever im near you

chorus all zayn
but i see you with him slow dancin
tearing me apart cause you dont see
whenever you kiss him im breakin
oh how i wish that was me
