verse 1
this is my canvas yeah my canvas
ima paint it how i want it baby oh i paint it
this is my canvas
ima paint it paint it paint it how i want it nigga
fuck you cause there there is no right or wrong only a song
i like to write alone be in my zone
think back to forest hills no perfect home
but the only thing like home ive ever known
until they snatched it from my mama
and foreclosed her on the loan
im so sorry that i left you there to deal with that alone
i was up in new york city chasing panties getting dome
had no clue what you was going through
how could you be so strong
and how could i be so selfish i know i can be so selfish
i could tell by how i treat you with my girl damn she so selfless
but she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
and though it dont always show i love her just like i love you and
i need to treat you better
wish you could live forever
so we could spend more time together uh
i love you mama uh

verse 2
another day another rhyme ho
another day another time zone
today i woke up feeling horny so its only right i got two bitches playing on my trombone
keep up never sure where the words would take me
niggas eat em up and regurgitate me
shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
give a virgin the urge to rape me nigga please
best friends really make great for enemies
my watch came niggas cant wait for one of these
i see you nigga this aint no rolex its an ap nigga
im hot dog catch up to me nigga— huh couldnt resist
aim for the stars and i shouldnt have missed
but i was riding on fumes so i stopped by the moon
now im sitting on the hood of this bitch
like thanks for the view waiting on thanks from a few
cause without me you wouldnt exist
you know that shit gave you the blueprint dont forget
cole is your phone on zero percent
going off now niggas showing off
niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
im taking off like boing on a big ass boeing and getting head like a coin toss too easy
