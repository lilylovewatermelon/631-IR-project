ill never forget about what you did to me
ill never forget bout what you what you told me
shit hurt so deep cant lie you showed but ima run my bands up

i heard somebody said they said something
what the fuck you mean these niggas cant tell me nun

verse 1
i never forget what papa told me
this shit aint nothing like the old days
ill never go back to my old ways all the lies they told me
thought you was true but shit you showed me
i was 1hunnit you werent real with me
got time for the think and i thought about it
i gotta watch who i bring around me
after all this shit iont trust nobody
call up my phone tryna come around me
in the maybach alone iont need nobody
go watch for myself iont need nobody
go hard in the booth when i get inside it
turn up in this bitch im in full throttle
know im blessed but im sick of the fame
to tell the truth you aint feeling my pain
whole lot of money for my chain i just charge it to the game
go above and beyond for my gang
send a shot through the dash in the lane
all the shit they done said you know i aint forget a thang

ill never forget bout what you what you told me
shit hurt so deep cant lie you showed but ima run my bands up
fuck everybody that had changed up
shit i remember we aint had nun look what we done came from
i heard somebody said they said something
what the fuck you mean these niggas cant tell me nun
look where we came from
i heard somebody said they said something
what the fuck you mean these niggas cant tell me nun

verse 2
when its cloudy im still shining raining im still stunting
time wait for nobody all day gettin that money
scared to trust somebody baby look what you done done me

this for the ones who hated me
now you gotta pay just to see me bitch
