whispers the sound of your name

worthy to be praised

all consuming flame

filled with your wonder
here i surrender
held in your mystery of grace
calling me closer
waking desire
coming alive in your name

chorus
holy holy is the lord
worthy to be praised
yahweh
fire rising in my soul
all consuming flame
