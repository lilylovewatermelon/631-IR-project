i feel like cherry wine
like valentines
like the spring is coming
and everything is alright
cause ive got a love thats new
i hear youre happy too
well thats the way it should be
but lately i feel like crying

chorus
i wanna get over you
but youre everywhere
and i just cant get away
i gotta get over you
cause its just not fair
that i i still see your face

verse 2
i heard your name today
yeah i walked away
cause everyones still talkin
i dont need that in my life
got better things to do
than worry about you
im gonna keep on walking
but sometimes i i dont know why

i wanna get over you
cause youre everywhere
and i just cant get away
i gotta get over you
cause its just not fair
that i see your face

well we had a good time
but time goes on
you didnt really want me til i was gone

break
i wanna get over you
before you get over me
over me

chorus
i gotta get over you
but you just wont let me
and i cant get away
i gotta get over you
but i cant forget the
things that i said
still ringing in my head
i wanna get over you
but youre always longer than i
i just cant get away gotta get over you
i gotta get over you
cause its so unfair
that i still can see your face oh
