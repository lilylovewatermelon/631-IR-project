milk it for all its worth
make sure you get there first
the apple of your eye
the rotten core inside
we are all prisoners
things couldnt get much worse
ive had it up to here
you know your end is near

chorus
you had to have it all
well have you had enough
you greedy little bastard
you will get what you deserve
when all is said and done
i will be the one
to leave you in your misery
and hate what youve become

verse 2
intoxicated eyes
no longer live that life
you should have learned by now
ill burn this whole world down
i need some peace of mind
no fear of whats behind
you think youve won this fight
youve only lost your mind

you had to have it all
well have you had enough
you greedy little bastard
you will get what you deserve
when all is said and done
i will be the one
to leave you in your misery
and hate what youve become

bridge
hold me down
i will live again
pull me out
i will break it in
hold me down
better in the end
hold me down

chorus
you had to have it all
well have you had enough
you greedy little bastard
you will get what you deserve
when all is said and done
i will be the one
to leave you in your misery
and hate what youve become
outro
heaven help you
heaven help you8embed"
