fixation on the darkness
that engulfs this world
drain the life force of our people
change

fixation on the darkness
that engulfs this world
drain the life force of our people

return to the womb new life
lay your head to rest mercy
to give you a peace of mind
lay your head to rest

verse 2
come together inside
this body is only a shell
change the only way we will survive
light transfiguration of the soul
of the soul of the mind
fixation on the darkness
that engulfs this world
drain the life force of our people
