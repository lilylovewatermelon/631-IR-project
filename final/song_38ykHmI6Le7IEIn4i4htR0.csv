two jealous sisters theyre waiting for me
and one is laid on the floor
and one is changing the locks on the doors
and ive been buying their time on my knees
and ive been selling them blankets to bleed on

around the house by the sea
the scent of roses and raspberry leaves
and there is smoke in my clothes
too much time with just smoke in my nose
and ive been making the meaning they lack
and ive been burning that book they come back to

there is a house by the sea
and an ocean between it and me
and like the shape of a wave
the jealous sisters will sing on my grave
and ive been living to run where they led
and ive been dying to rise from their bed
and ive been sparing my neck from their chain
and theyve been changing the sound of my name
and ive been swimming to them in my sleep
and ive been dreaming our love and our freedomsee iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeembed"
