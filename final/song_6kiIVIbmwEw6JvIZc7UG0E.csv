peanut butter seats came perfect time
rich but im still ducking one time

verse 1
late night ive been cruisin down the interstate
late night ive been thinkin a lot of niggas hate
told my dawg lets pour tons of ace
if he talkin out his lip we gotta give cuz a taste
i cant let no niggas mock my name
especially when these lil niggas see me as reputable
and the ogs respect me that done came out my section
we just bought cullinan just to maintain
i talk to him my brother nem he on the same thang
we just tryna motivate bought the ap show the face
feel like im a zoe today feel like im a woe today
i was in miami with a bitch gave me cold face
she had this dick on her noseplate
