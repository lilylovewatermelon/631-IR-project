this songs called dugout
pool house
pool house
ththis songs called pool house
one two three four

verse 1
waiting around for something to change my mood
cause i know that whats in this plastic cup isnt going to
kids on the lawn stuck in pairs of two
your lunch is on its way back up but youre still in the pool

chorus
wait inside
ill be fine
i guess ill sit outside
while you change your mind oh no woahoh

verse 2
ill risk it all to find
a place where i can hear my thoughts
this song is playing too loud
but upstairs theyre still making out
im getting all choked up
i guess its just my luck
and im stuck on the porch
what am i waiting for

while you change your mind
