verse taboo
here come the man with the disco jam
stepped in the place and people like damn
party get started with the crew and the fam
bout to get naughty and do all i can
what is a band that cant really rock
whats a mc thats a rock on the spot
what is a mic that aint got no cable
whats a dj without the turntable
whats a hot girl if she cant really dance
whats electro without wearin tight pants
what is a rhythm if it just dont bump
baby let me get in and give you what you want
give you what you need baby how you want it
time to get nasty put your ass on it
time to get on it on it on it
time to get on it
see black eyed peas liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likechorus
