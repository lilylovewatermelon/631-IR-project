verse 1
waking up midnight november
and youre still in my bed
its kinda rough cause since i met ya
theres things weve never said

prechorus
so if i go for a little while longer
when im home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
if you say go i would stop everything oh
my heart would play the role now
and act like its never been broke

chorus
though my soul oh oh oh
lately i really need to know
how long how long can we be touch and go
oh my soul oh oh oh
how long how long can we be touch and go
