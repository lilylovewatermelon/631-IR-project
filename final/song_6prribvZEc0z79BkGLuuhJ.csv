exnigga he so needy
punk ass tried to replace me but the stakes is too high
they cant survive off minime
im talkin pedigree

cant hate a bitch for free
talkin im off the bench like brady
im pressin niggas like kd its up

so classic that ass so fat it look natural its not
i talk bullshit a lot

comin back she so candid
comin back snatched like bandit
comin back this aint canned shit
im organic with my fresh squeezed
im dumpin like press squeeze
im horny like suck these
so daring like touch me
and all the petty shit aside
all the funny shit aside
i just want whats mine

this aint no warnin shot
case all you hoes forgot
