if i give you every piece of me i know that you could drop it
give you the chance i know that you could take advantage once you got it
if i open up my heart to you i know that you could lock it
throw away the key and keep it there forever in your pocket
if i give the opportunity to you then would you blow it
if i was the greatest thing to happen to you would you know it
if my love was like a flower would you plant it would you grow it
ima give you all my body are you strong enough to hold it

prechorus
if i show you all my demons and we dive into the deep end
would we crash and burn like every time before
i would tell you all my secrets wrap your arms around my weakness
if the only other options letting go

chorus
ill stay vulnerable yeah
ill stay vulnerable yeah
ill stay vulnerable

verse 2
if i hand you my emotions would you even wanna take it
would you even wanna take it yeah
if i give you all my trust then would you fumble it and break it

if i let you cross my finish line then would you wanna make it
would you wanna make it would you wanna make it
i think im ready wont you come and flip the switch and activate it ooh
