wish you were so— wish you were so— wish you were sober
sober sober sober

verse 1
this partys shit wish we could dip
go anywhere but here
dont take a hit dont kiss my lips
and please dont drink more beer

prechorus
ima crawl out the window now
cause i dont like anyone around
kinda hope youre followin me out
but this is definitely not my crowd

chorus
nineteen but you act twentyfive now
knees weak but you talk pretty fly wow
ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
take me where the music aint too loud
trade drinks but you dont even know her
save me til the party is over
kiss me in the seat of your rover
real sweet but i wish you were sober

wish you were so— wish you were so— wish you were sober
i wish you were sober
wish you were so— wish you were so— wish you were sober

verse 2
trip down the road walking you home
you kiss me at your door
pulling me close beg me stay over
but im over this roller coaster

prechorus
ima crawl out the window now
getting good at saying gotta bounce
honestly you always let me down
and i know were not just hanging out

chorus
nineteen but you act twentyfive now
knees weak but you talk pretty fly wow
ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
take me where the music aint too loud
trade drinks but you dont even know her
save me til the party is over
kiss me in the seat of your rover
real sweet but i wish you were sober
