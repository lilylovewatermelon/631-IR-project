caught cases niggas stayed silent
to this day i thank the lord for it
askin me about such and such helluva made this beat baby
i aint say nothin too much love for em

chorus
i done had some conversations that cant be repeated
for the sake of some of my niggas freedom
we done did some shit i know so many secrets
tell them other niggas that know em i hope yall can keep em
i know about some situations i cant never say
cause they can get us life so i cant never break
i just pray to god i make it through the day
cause i done did some shit im takin to the grave

verse 1
it was a summer day
niggas creepin on us in the black car
round this time we was beefin heavy
so we kept a chopper in the back part
we ended up gettin the upper hand
i just know that hundred shots cracked hard
ima leave it there i aint say much
but i hate i even went that far
it was two of us when that popped off
took a oath ima not talk
so if the story get leaked out
i know who face ima knock off
these niggas with me
when its beef theyll come and kill everythin movin
ill never tell you what i think
ima tell you what i know i done seen them boys do it ah
after it happened it never happened
get rid of anythin that can tie us to it
go clip for clip with my enemies
then go wait a trial with them prosecutors
niggas snitchin on their homeboys
i dont see how they do it
i dont see how them niggas still livin
i know their mans in there goin through it
like right right right ayy ayy
