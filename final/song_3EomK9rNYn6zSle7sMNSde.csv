and my hearts on fire
you come to me come to me
wild and wired
you come to me give me everything i need

you bring a lifetime of promises
and a world of dreams
you speak the language of love
like you know what it means
and it cant be wrong
take my heart and make it strong

cause youre simply the best
better than all the rest
better than anyone
anyone i ever met
im stuck on your heart
i hang on every word you said
tear us apart
baby i would rather be dead

deep in your heart
i see the start
of every night and every day
and in your eyes i get lost
i get washed away
just as long as im here in your arms
i could be in no better place
cause youre simply the bestsee bonnie tyler liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeembed"
