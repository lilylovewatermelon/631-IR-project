damn i used to love this view
sit here and drink a few
main street and the high school lit up on friday night
down there its another touchdown
man this years team is stout
i can hear them going crazy
and up here so am i
thinking about you sitting there saying i hate this i hate it
if you couldnt stand living here whyd you take it take it

chorus
give me back my hometown
cause this is my hometown

verse 2
all the colors of my youth
the red the green the hope the truth
are beating me black and blue cause youre in every scene
my friends try to cheer me up get together at the pizza hut
i didnt have the heart to tell them that was our place
these sleepy streetlights on every sidewalk side street
shed a light on everything that used to be

chorus
give me back my hometown
cause this is my hometown
yeah yeah ooohh yeah yeah
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likeverse 3
you can have my grandmas locket
the knife out of my grandpas pocket
yeah my state champion jacket
i dont care you can have it
every made memory
every picture every broken dream
yeah everything everything everything

chorus
give me back my hometown
cause this is my hometown
yeah yeah ooohh yeah yeah9embed"
