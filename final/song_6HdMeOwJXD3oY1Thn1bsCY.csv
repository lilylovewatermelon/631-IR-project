in the blue of this life
where it ends in the night
when you couldnt see
you would come for me

verse 2
wonder eyes motion high
and we dont dare slip on by
make us suffer like no other

chorus
theres nothing like lapis lazuli
let it go back to me

outro
like no other you cant be replaced
like no other you cant be replaced
like no other you cant be replaced
like no other you cant be replaced
like no other you cant be replaced
like no other you cant be replaced
like no other you cant be replaced
like no other you cant be replaced
theres nothing like lapis lazuli
like no other you cant be replaced
theres nothing like lapis lazuli
like no other you cant be replaced
theres nothing like lapis lazuli
like no other you cant be replaced
theres nothing like lapis lazuli
like no other you cant be replaced
theres nothing like lapis lazuli
like no other you cant be replaced
theres nothing like lapis lazuliyou might also like17embed"
