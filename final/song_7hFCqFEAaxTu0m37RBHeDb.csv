well im tattered and torn a little bit worn but i aint hardly broken in two
and its a pitiful thing the way i still cling to the memories i still have of you
but i tried and i tried and i tried to forget it
i drank myself plum into the grave
but ill try and ill try and ill try not to let it keep me awake

chorus
just let me go get your hooks out from under my skin
just let me know a second chance just aint coming again
a second chance just aint coming again

verse 2
when i take a look back and i hear your voice crack
that night you put a hole in the wall
i can see all the things all of the troubles i bring
damn i remember thеm all
but i tried and i tried and i tried to forgеt it
i drank myself plum into the grave
but ill try and ill try and ill try not to let it keep me awake

chorus
just let me go get your hooks out from under my skin
just let me know a second chance just aint coming again
a second chance just aint coming againyou might also likeembed"
