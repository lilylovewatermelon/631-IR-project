spending my money honey i didnt care
taking my friends out for a mighty good time
i drank that good gin champagne and wine

just as soon as my money got low
i couldnt find no friends
and i had no place to go
if i ever get my hands on a dollar again
im gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

cause i found out that nobody wants you
nobody wants you when they find out
that youre down and out
in your pocket theres not not one penny
and as for friends you dont have any

just let you get back up on your feet again
here they all come telling you
their your old longlost friend
and this i wanna tell you and about it i have no doubt
nobody wants you
nobody needs you
nobody wants when youre down and outyou might also likeembed"
