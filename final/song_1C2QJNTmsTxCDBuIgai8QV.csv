is our secret safe tonight
and are we out of sight
or will our world come tumbling down
will they find our hiding place
is this our last embrace
or will the walls start caving in

prechorus
it could be wrong could be wrong but it should have been right
it could be wrong could be wrong to let our hearts ignite
it could be wrong could be wrong are we digging a hole
it could be wrong could be wrong this is out of control
it could be wrong could be wrong it can never last
it could be wrong could be wrong must erase it fast
it could be wrong could be wrong but it could have been right
it could be wrong could be

chorus
love is our resistance
theyll keep us apart and they wont stop breaking us down
hold me
our lips must always be sealed

verse 2
if we live a life in fear
ill wait a thousand years
just to see you smile again
kill your prayers for love and peace
youll wake the thought police
we cant hide the truth inside

it could be wrong could be wrong this is out of control
it could be wrong could be wrong it can never last
it could be wrong could be wrong must erase it fast
it could be wrong could be wrong but it could have been right

chorus
love is our resistance
theyll keep us apart and they wont stop breaking us down
hold me
our lips must always be sealed

outro
the night has reached its end
we cant pretend
we must run
we must run
its time to run
take us away from here
protect us from further harm
