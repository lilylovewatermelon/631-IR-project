paper bags and plastic hearts
all our belongings in shopping carts
its goodbye
but we got one more night
lets get drunk and ride around
and make peace with an empty town
we can make it right

chorus
throw it away forget yesterday
well make the great escape
and we wont hear a word they say
they dont know us anyway
watch it burn
let it die
cause we are finally free tonight

verse 2
tonight will change our lives
its so good to be by your side but well cry
we wont give up the fight
well scream loud at the top of our lungs
and theyll think its just cause were young
and well feel so alive
see boys like girls liveget tickets as low as 77you might also likechorus
throw it away forget yesterday
well make the great escape
and we wont hear a word they say
they dont know us anyway
watch it burn
let it die
cause we are finally free tonight

bridge
all of the wasted time
the hours that were left behind me
answers that well never find
they dont mean a thing tonight

chorus
throw it away forget yesterday
well make the great escape
we wont hear a word they say
they dont know us anyway
throw it away forget yesterday
well make the great escape
we wont hear a word they say
they dont know us anyway
throw it away forget yesterday
well make the great escape
we wont hear a word they say
they dont know us anyway
outro
watch it burn
let it die
cause we are finally free tonight8embed"
