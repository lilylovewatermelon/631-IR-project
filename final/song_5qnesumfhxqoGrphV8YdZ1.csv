everything on you is getting out of control
i see your fist raised up and clinched
i know you better than this

dont hold your breath
just get as far away as you can possibly get
i know you better than you
im takin my time cause i got nothing to do

wait a minute somethings wrong
i know it wont take long
lets burn a hole into the sky
and take a look into gods eyes

i know it dont seem right
but it wont take all night
im not tryin to save the planet
i just dont like this noose im hangin from

red faced short breathed
yeah im takin it all until theres nothing left
for you to prove
yeah im takin my time cause i got nothing to do

wait a minute somethings wrong
i know it wont take long
lets burn a hole into the sky
and take a look into gods eyes
you might also likei know it dont seem right
but it wont take all night
im not tryin to save the planet
i just dont like this noose im hangin from

why dont you make up your mind
why dont you make up your mind
why dont you make up your mind

why dont you make up your mind
why dont you make up your mind
why dont you make up your mind

wait a minute somethings wrong
i know it wont take long
lets burn a hole into the sky
and take a look into gods eyes

i know it dont seem right
but it wont take all night
im not tryin to save the planet
i just dont like this noose im hangin fromembed"
