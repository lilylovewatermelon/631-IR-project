new orleans is ruled by thugs even more ruthless than las most violent gangs
the crips  bloods tried to establish themselves here and these guys killed them simple as that—gone see you later
we look at gangs like this its like a coward move to us but a gang it takes fifteen people to get in two cars and do a driveby and kill one person in new orleans i just saw one person kill fifteen people

chorus juvenile
you a paper chaser you got your block on fire
remainin a g until the moment you expire
you know what it is to make nothin out of something
you handle your biz and don’t be cryin and sufferin
you a paper chaser you got your block on fire
remainin a g until the moment you expire
you know what it is to make nothin out of something
you handle your biz and don’t be cryin and sufferin

verse 1 who boy boy
definition of the living dead got a dead bitch givin head
tulip flowers growin on my bed rust and blood settle on my lead
broken soul but im breaking bread
headdreaded boy from waggaman
petey pablo shirt off on em swingin like a helicopter
got it covering this chopper spittin out them yoppas
got the drama with the llama i can get you to nirvana
run them pockets proper we create our own karma
balboa out the magnolia northside soulja
need the keys to the rover

verse 2 lil waaaaaa
ruby da fucking ape
ruby da fucking orangutan
mumblin nothing just the discussion of public destruction
im up in flames the soulja by the lake
feelin like im in the navy but i pull up in the tank ayy
sippin the tang out of an ak kangaroo the next lane
lame move you looking plain
cant redo the flex mane
camo on my body like i just got back from the war
i heard a bang in the bank ben frank on the floor
back in new orleans now everybody wanna score
im trying to finesse the lesser into something more
im drawin a blank on who the fuck you is
