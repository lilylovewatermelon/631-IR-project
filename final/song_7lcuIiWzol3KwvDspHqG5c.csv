we will not die this way in unification
they cannot break these chains of faith
let them do their worst let them do their worst
never slaves to iniquity

chorus
we will not die this way this is absolution
death claims us no more no more
do not grieve end the suffering
we will live live eternal

verse 2
will you take the stand among the dead
bury your fear and hold fast to life
come on

chorus
we will not die this way this is absolution
death claims us no more no more
do not grieve end the suffering
we will live live eternal
