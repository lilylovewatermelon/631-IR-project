i dont feel the way ive ever felt
i know
gonna smile and not get worried
i try but it shows

prechorus
anyone can make what i have built and better now
anyone can find the same white pills
it takes my pain away

chorus
its a lie a kiss with open eyes
and shes not breathing back
anything but bother me
it takes my pain away
never mind these are hurried times
oh oh oh
i cant let it bother me

verse 2
i never thought id walk away from you
i did
but its a false sense of accomplishment every time i quit

prechorus
anyone can see my every flaw
it isnt hard
anyone can say theyre above this all
it takes my pain away

its a lie a kiss with open eyes
and shes not breathing back
anything but bother me
it takes my pain away
never mind these are hurried times
oh oh oh
i cant let it bother me

i cant let it bother me
it takes my pain away

chorus
its a lie a kiss with open eyes
and shes not breathing back
anything but bother me
it takes my pain away
never mind these are hurried times
oh oh oh
i cant let it bother me

takes my pain
takes my pain
takes my pain
takes my pain away3embed"
