yeah sometimes i wanna disappear like i just dont exist
or find a time machine and take me back when i was six
maybe younger either way i guess the point of it
would be to tell that little kid that hes gon take a lotta hits
yeah id probably grab your hand and tell you life is hard
if you got questions or you need advice then talk to god
cause hes the only one that listens even when you think he isnt
even good people are great at makin bad decisions yeah oh
they aint gon take it serious
you find out pretty quick that life is more than just appearances
i know some things we could avoid to save embarrassment
but everything that breaks you down can also build your character
cause people love to see you fail just be aware of it
dont let nobody tell you who to be or write your narrative
look were all products of the things that we experience
but theres a big difference between confidence and arrogance
you hearin this
i know that you dont get it now but you gon get it later
i know you feel like youre alone and no one loves you maybe
and you gon cover insecurities with lotsa anger
the weird thing is someday all of this will make you famous oh
you start to write about your life and while theyre all relatin
youll make up a slogan call it real but feel like youre the fakest
wish i could tell you that your futures nothin but amazin
thats just not the case and i guess i just dont know how to say this
see nf liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likechorus
i dont know if you can hear me or not
but if you can i just want you to know
you gon make a lotta mistakes
and they gon laugh in our face
thats part of life thats just the way that it goes
thats just the way that it goes
and i dont know if you can hear me or not
but if you can i just need you to get it
i know you been questionin life
trust me i know what its like
im here for you if you need someone to listen
do you need someone to listen

verse 2
see mom and dad are not together they took different routes
but you probably already knew you gettin older now
remember back when mom picked us up from grandmas house
and she hid her boyfriend in the trunk and drove a couple miles
down the street and then she pulled over to let him out
cause she aint want dad to know she had these type of dudes around
cause last time he found out he had to take us from her
you look uncomfortable im sorry let me change the subject hey
you know how weve always struggled with abandonment yeah
and when we feel like someones leaving we start panickin yeah
and yo i wish i could say ive learned to manage it
you think its bad now but you dont know the half of it
passion is somethin we have never lacked
we see it the most when were writin raps
they think its funny now let em laugh
i know you think its just an outlet when youre really mad
but you dont know the platform youre about to have oh
i know some things about the future you aint ready for
i know some things that you gon cover up but cant ignore
and what hurts is they gon surface at the worst moments
and we gon act like it dont hurt us but it hurts dont it
we walk around with the devil talkin on both shoulders
wish i could tell you that he disappears when we get older
but thats just not the case and i know you feel out of place
and everything is not okay and life can be a lot to take butâ€¦
chorus
i dont know if you can hear me or not
but if you can i just want you to know
you gon make a lotta mistakes
and they gon laugh in our face
thats part of life thats just the way that it goes
thats just the way that it goes
and i dont know if you can hear me or not
but if you can i just need you to get it
i know you been questionin life
trust me i know what its like
im here for you if you need someone to listen
do you need someone to listen

verse 3
you know how intoxicated people make us nervous
to the point sometimes we shake and it feels so disturbin
dont be scared thats just trauma tryna reach the surface
and tell us everyone we love is gonna try to hurt us
which isnt true but its a lie that both of us believe in
yeah you might get a glimpse of happiness from your achievements
but what youll learn as you get older every time you reach one
is youll just make another goal that doesnt lead to freedom
see some things about to happen that you cant imagine
at 24 youll drop an album and youll call it mansion
at 25 youll put out therapy and gain some traction
skip to track number four now thats a really sad one
yeah perceptions coming next we bout to reach the masses
it sounds awesome at the same time it doesnt matter
at 27 well make millions but its really sad cause
you learn to realize that none of this will make you happy
outro
i wish that i could look at you with empathy
sometimes i feel like ive become what you were scared to be
which makes it really hard to look at you with sympathy
cause if im feeling bad for you then i have to feel bad for me
and thats just something i feel like we dont deserve
thats why im always looking down on you i know it hurts
im sure you have a lot of questions
ive been tryna search to find us both some answers
ill be here for you if things get worse
too many faces too many faces too many faces42embed"
