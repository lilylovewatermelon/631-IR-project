bae you’re leaving again
it’s rainy outside you know
don’t wanna get cold

verse 1
bae you’re leaving again
it’s rainy outside you know
don’t wanna get cold
“bye i’m running late”
didn’t say where she went
god knows

chorus
bae you’re running away
lost in the eye of men
you’re roaming your way
and he waits
while she is so close to home
warmed up so that she stays
his bae

verse 2
he told her bae the porch is unlocked
even if no one else
comes by the front
now i sense why the men
who live in these empty lands
don’t use them
see men i trust liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likebridge
singing she moves
by deserted pines
who stand tall unstirred
ran out of milk
wearing her nice shoes
she likes coffee dark

chorus
he said bae you’re running away
lost in the eye of men
you’re roaming your way
and he waits
while she is so close
warmed up so that she stays
his bae
