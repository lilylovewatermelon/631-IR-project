baby who do you think is better than you
do you know everything that they go through
have they taken you on their closet tour
youll find a few skeletons im sure
you think everyones kickin up their feet
when youre sold the life of easy street
you gotta make there and then maintain
improve your lifestyle that its the same thing

chorus
life at best is a struggle
life at best can be trouble
store up on love stay humble
its all a guess baby life at best

verse 2
theres a shortcut for everything these days
dont fall for the tvs or some magazine page
not much gets solved with a pill in one take
what you work hard for is the thing that pays
you gotta make it there and maintain
improve lifestyle and its the same thing

chorus
life at best is a struggle
life at best can be trouble
store up on love stay humble
its all a guess baby life at best
