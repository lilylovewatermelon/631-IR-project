twisting and turning unable to sleep
do the voices ever stop
my thoughts speak louder the more i resist
and theyre driving me insane
do they ever go

chorus
inside im a danger to myself
i’m a danger to myself
inside im a prisoner of my own hell
my own hell

verse 2
losing the battle i waged on myself
lock me up and toss the key
toys in the attic its all getting worse
why wont i let me be
oh god make it stop

chorus
inside im a danger to myself
i’m a danger to myself
inside hey im a prisoner of my own hell
my own hell
see five finger death punch liveget tickets as low as 79you might also likebridge
fit me for a straitjacket
put me in a padded cell
im a danger to you all
and im a danger to myself

chorus
inside im a danger to myself
i’m a danger to myself
inside hey im a prisoner of my own hell
my own hell

inside im a danger to myself
i’m a danger to myself
inside im a prisoner of my own hell

outro
