shes a freaky young gal a bisexual
but a hustler though and will sell some snow
wit dat juicy fat thang i cant let you go
what she doing mane wit all that i bet you know
baby girl take dem trips down to mexico
get dem birds and dat herbs and will see her doe
clock ticks like her brain when she sceme a plot
set playas up for change and receive alot
my thang staying on hard make that coochie pop
suck me up til she get the last goosy drop
the shake club never had much to offer her
a dyke broad get none cause its boss wit her
and its boss wit me why you be asking when twerking
she dont claim pimp but shell have ya working
aw its for certain she been there and did dat
could be corporate lawyer or a hood rat
chorus
shes a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
catching me wit the dope and shell take the charge
shes a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
catching me wit the dope and shell take the charge
shes a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
catching me wit the dope and shell take the charge
shes a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
catching me wit the dope and shell take the charge
verse 2
razor blade in ya mouth green stuff in ya stuff
philly blunts in ya purse but that aint enough
turning liquor bottles up wit cha mane as we dip
turn right turn left each corner take a sip
say wassup to the big pussy click in hine park
learna and leonara and those who got hard
staying down wit your dogs till they let your dogs go
jailhouse like a dog house dog yaint know
everbody need somebody real on their team
no letters no visitation make you mean
make you wanna think everybody left you for dead
and ya gal dat you love out there giving head
what the past dont be thinking bout the things that i did
i need money for some commissary can ya dig
taking chances with us so we can live
chorus
put some rims on the car shoes for the kids
shes a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
catching me wit the dope and shell take the charge
shes a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
catching me wit the dope and shell take the charge
shes a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
catching me wit the dope and shell take the charge
shes a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
catching me wit the dope and shell take the charge
shes a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
catching me wit the dope and shell take the charge
shes a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
catching me wit the dope and shell take the charge
shes a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
catching me wit the dope and shell take the charge
shes a ghetto type broad and her life was hard
