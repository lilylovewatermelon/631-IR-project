verse 1
i wanna tell the world that your my girl and that im your man ahh baby
and i wanna tell the world that you got me why cant we be ahh baby
i cant put my name on your kiss
and i cant speak your name from these lips
we froze
and nobody knows
have to walk out the room everytime you call
tellin everybody i aint seen you in so long
it feels like i aint breatin
this feels worser than cheatin
