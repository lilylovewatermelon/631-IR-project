wheezy outta here
huh uh

chorus
who think you foolin we not new to it
we countin fluent
hawks game on the wood my cup full of mud
i came out the hood
sometimes a gangsta need a hug
ima give all my problems above
hate when people keep doin too much
keep it real the streets show you no love

verse 1
we dont need no one vouchin for us
ive been grindin and found me a buzz
ive been searchin for love and found lust
its so hard to stop holdin a grudge
my lil dawg split your shit like a dutch
my whole squad kept the kid in the cut
keep your strap cause these niggas play tough
pick and choose who the right one to trust
pick and choose who the right one to trust
keep it real its a lot of fake love
niggas hate but they bitches in love
paint the bentley all white like a dove
i took off aint the same as it was
kicked her out told her walk to the bus
im a sipper can tell when its cut
you cant tell me that she aint a slut

sometimes a gangsta need a hug

verse 2
i dont need no one vouchin for me

beverly center shoppin spree on me
new agenda dont do nothin free
aint no one of my foreigns on e
all my bitches got expensive weave
i sip drank for my pain to get eased
i still talk to the lord on my knees
helpin me take care all of my needs
and we take off the top for a breeze
