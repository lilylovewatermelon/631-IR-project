aw shit
here we go again here they go again
talkin shit about a real man let me ask you this
how many of you little niggas got your own shit
bitch me and all my niggas got our own damn crib
bitch me and all my folk record our own damn shit
inhouse studio flexed out for your bitch
when she walk through the door all she do is compliment
bitch im finna smoke a blunt so i dont wanna say shit
dont bother me ill break your ass if you take my tip
heres a tip if you stuck get the fuck up out of here
i aint playin with no stupid nigga i aim anywhere
lock and load on his fuckin soul turn that bitch cold
let it shatter like the ice do when it hits the floor
bitch im trynna see wassup my whole squad on the boat
bitch say the wrong shit we make your stupid ass float
i aint never been a bitch ask all my old hoes
nigga ask yours too hah he aint even know
yuh yuh she came through and dropped her panties on my floor
yuh yuh she licked me up right before she linked with you
yuh yuh kissed his bitch and i dont give no fuck fool
i let these hoes do what the fuck they want to
cause these hoes gon do what the fuck they want to
east memphis where im at dont matter where i move
tell a ho stay home cause the cash coming through
niggas ask me where my lyrics at who the fuck is you

and these niggas dont listen til i say it in the booth
