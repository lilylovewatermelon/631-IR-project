right now
theres an ad on every tv in every home
trying sell you a fix for whatevers wrong
some potion some pill send your dollar bill

verse 2
right now
theres a drink over ice on a bar in a glass
every sip will erase your pain your past
have another round but some things are hard to drown

chorus
im lost im broke im ugly im old
got an empty that nothing can fill in my soul
im dumb im numb im weird and scared
not pretty enough to be repaired
cant win cant change all i do is fail
cant put my crazy back on the shelf
yeah the cruelest lies of all the lies we tell
are the ones we tell ourselves

verse 3
right now
theres a girl in a buick parked out of sight
swears she cant take it not another night
wants to close her eyes maybe see the perfect size

im lost im broke im ugly im old
got an empty that nothing can fill in my soul

cant put my crazy back on the shelf
yeah the cruelest lies of all the lies we tell
are the ones we tell ourselves

bridge
right now theres a couple in a kitchen going through the routine
of a two story two kid american dream
they were head over heels now theyre coming apart at the seams
wonder where all the feeling went
thinkin that its time to split
but they aint ready to quit

chorus
im strong im sorry im steady im bold
got a faith and fire that fills my soul
yeah its okay to struggle okay to be scared
the busted and broken can be repaired
cant win cant change all i do is fail
yeah thats what i used to tell myself
cause the cruelest lies of all the lies we tell
yeah the cruelest lies of all the lies we tell
are the ones we tell ourselves
the ones we tell ourselves1embed"
