chorus
ap and patek philippe flooded flooded
and got the richard mille flooded ice
cubans and bracelets and necklace ice flooded
stones in my teeth like they braces flooded flooded

verse 1
gold diamond chains im the new mr t
all this ice on me i could go and ski
shorty on fleek with this patek philippe fleek
whole lot to see clarity vs
cold like a polar bear north pole
money stretch all the way from north dakota dakota
know pretty bitches like cocacola
diamonds hit like they inmates in angola hmm
look like a fight fight
block out your sight ice
whole lot of ice on on
these diamonds bite we shining bright
look like a light show show
hell of a price expensive nights
she got a nice throat throat
she got me right i bought her ice

verse 2
i spent twofifty on just one chain
none of this shit came from johnny dang
eliantte got me goin insane
diamonds updated they head of the game
im underrated they ap from vegas
they hated i waited i knew shit would change
pull up mercedes my neck lookin crazy
they hated i waited i knew shit would change
my life is wavy im highly sedated
they thought i was crazy i bought some more chains
flood out the shady i iced out the baby
and they goin crazy protecting the name
reach for these stones and get popped in your brain
no ones smoking stronger they aint stoppin the train
today is rose gold im not rockin the plain
i dont got it on then i dont feel the same
