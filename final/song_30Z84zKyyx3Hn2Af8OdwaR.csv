im a trainwreck in the morning
im a bitch in the afternoon
every now and then without warning
i can be really mean towards you
im a puzzle yes indeed
ever complex in every way
and all the pieces arent even in the box
and yet you see the picture clear as day

chorus
i dont know why you love me
and thats why i love you
you catch me when i fall
accept me flaws and all
and thats why i love you
and thats why i love you
and thats why i love you

verse 2
i neglect you when im workin
when i need attention i tend to nag
im a host of imperfection
and you see past all that
im a peasant by some standards
but in your eyes im a queen
you see potential in all my flaws
and thats exactly what i mean

you catch me when i fall
accept me flaws and all
and thats why i love you
and thats why i love you
and thats why i love you
