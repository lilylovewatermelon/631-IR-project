ive never felt so sober
ive never felt the low that i feel tonight
your words made everything drag on and on
i finally found her
and when i did i just couldnt make things right
is this really happening oh god i think i just ruined my life

verse 1
what the fuck am i doing
i cant tell the difference from wrong and right
i secondguess my decisions
cause i havent been this person in my whole life
i think i need something new here
when i keep longing for what i had
no need for second opinions
i do the best i can to ruin what i have come on

prechorus
dont think youve got to go it alone here
ive got nothing left to hide
you got time just make up your mind

chorus
i thought this was what you wanted
someone who gets everything right
gets everything right
i thought this was what you wanted
someone to put you first in their life
cause were running out of time
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likeverse 2
lets have three cheers for the new year hey hey hey
heres to hoping its not as bad
this wasnt part of my vision
the optimist in me says we can make this last but no
you ruined my favorite records
listen to them and i think of you
i just hope you remember
all of the countless times that i believed in you for what

prechorus
dont think youve got to go it alone here
ive got nothing left to hide
you got time just make up your mind

chorus
i thought this was what you wanted
someone who gets everything right
gets everything right
i thought this was what you wanted
someone to put you first in their life
cause were running out of time

bridge
just know that it kills me
when i hear anything to do with you
you wont see it but believe me
i need to be right where you are
you know that im leaving
and you wont hear till a year from now
but this kills me
cause now i think that everythings everythings about you
chorus
i thought this was what you wanted
someone who gets everything right
gets everything right
i thought this was what you wanted
someone to put you first in their life
cause were running out of time

outro
dont think youve got to go it alone here
ive got nothing left to hide
you got time just make up your mind5embed"
