verse 1
prescription drugs show me love
percocets adderall
xanny bars get codeine involved
stuck in this body high cant shake it off
im falling off i cant hold a thought
whats wrong with me now depression creep
im stressing deep even in my sleep
my mommy call i hit ignore
my daughter calls i press ignore
my chin press on my chest my knees press the floor
im blanking out woke up on the couch
dinner on my shirt my stomach hurts
i had a ball sellin 80s but yo the karmas worse
i cry when nothings wrong im mad when peace is involved
my senses harmed sluggish ruggish
a couple xannies popped open my pill box
prescription drugs
interlude joy
daddy daddy
whats wrong daddy
wake up
wake up

prescription drugs i fell in love
my little secret she gon kill a thug
my body numb she like to give me hugs
i love her touch i get a rush
when she dont come around i start to go nuts
my heart erupts im curled in pain
my phone ring ring and ring and ring
if you aint selling drugs then i dont hear a thing
may 7 ali calls pm of 645 i finally answer this time
he said come to the stu im mixing all your rhymes
i dont decline at least thats in my mind
grab the keys need some woods for the trees
dap the clerk fore i leave max on my ac
continue right remember seeing light
why its night but thats my life
prescription drugs

outro joy
