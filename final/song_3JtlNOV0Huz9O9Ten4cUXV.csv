she said i dont really care where you been
but wherever you go save a place for me
ill be by your side cause youre made for me
and i cant be alone
she said i dont really care bout your friends
but when you leave the house save a space for me
ima be around cause were made to be
and i cant be alone
loves a crazy thing cant believe were here again
lovers or friends that all depends on you shorty
love you so deep
maybe did i forget to mention
that you got all my attention baby
come and kick it lady

chorus
all i want
is for you to tell me that its mine
and let me treat you right
all i want
is for you to know you look divine
standin here beside me

verse 2
she said i dont give a damn how ya been
i only care to know what youre goin through

and ill let that be known
