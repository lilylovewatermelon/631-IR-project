he dirty worked him with that k cause he got paid and thats so cool
my mind feel chained heart up in flames
soul full of pain along the way a lonely go
christ is in the chain got the crowd sayin my name
theres a nеw maybach truck over there tеn times i aint drove im sold
that my childhood friend named mel on the phone
right now he fucked up tellin me to hold it down
im all alone he got a disease inside his body im tryna pay for to get it gone
im never sleep when he asleep soon as he call pick up the phone
life sticked me deep inside the streets duckin bullets runnin home
long range shots fired i learned to return with my first chrome
