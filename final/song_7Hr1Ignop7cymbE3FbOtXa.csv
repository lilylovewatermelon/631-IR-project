never feared for anything
never shamed but never free
a life that healed the broken heart with all that it could
lived a life so endlessly
saw beyond what others see
i tried to heal your broken heart with all that i could

prechorus
will you stay
will you stay away forever

chorus
how do i live without the ones i love
time still turns the pages of the book its burned
place and time always on my mind
i have so much to say but youre so far away

verse 2
plans of what our futures hold
foolish lies of growin old
it seems were so invincible the truth is so cold
a final song a last request
a perfect chapter laid to rest
now and then i try to find a place in my mind

where you can stay
you can stay away forever

chorus
how do i live without the ones i love

i have so much to say but youre so far away

bridge
sleep tight im not afraid not afraid
the ones that we love are here with me
lay away a place for me place for me
cause as soon as im done ill be on my way on my way
to live eternally

chorus
how do i live without the ones i love
time still turns the pages of the book its burned
place and time always on my mind
and the light you left remains but its so hard to stay
when i have so much to say and youre so far away
interlude

outro
i love you you were ready
the pain is strong and urges rise
but ill see you when he lets me
your pain is gone your hands untied
so far away
and i need you to know
so far away
and i need you to need you to know39embed"
