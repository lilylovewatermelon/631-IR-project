you wanna see what over looks like
ya aint gotta go far just a few blocks down
you wanna see a picture of goodbye
chairs on the table
smoke hanging round the ceiling from the night before
light coming through the crack in the door

chorus
nothing says gone like a parking lot with only one car in it
nothing says gone like an empty glass
or sitting on the bar in the middle of the day
in a blue light haze all alone
nothing says gone like high noon neon

verse 2
she could be a left lane blur
wind in her hair blowing through another town
or staring out over a wing
tears on her face head in the clouds
it doesnt really matter now

chorus
nothing says gone like a parking lot with only one car in it
nothing says gone like an empty glass
or sitting on the bar in the middle of the day
in a blue light haze all alone
nothing says gone like high noon neon

nothing says gone like 12 oclock on the rocks
and nothing says over like a parking lot with only one car in it
nothing says gone like an empty glass
or sitting on the bar in the middle of the day
in a blue light haze all alone
nothing says gone like high noon neon1embed"
