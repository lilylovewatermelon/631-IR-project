there are days that i can walk around like im alright
and i pretend to wear a smile on my face
and i can keep the pain from comin out of my eyes
but sometimes sometimes

chorus
sometimes i cry
cry
sometimes i cry
when i cant do nothin else

verse 2
everybody keeps tellin me move on
aw but i cant seem to go anywhere without you
cause ever since and every single night youve been gone
sometimes sometimes

chorus
sometimes i cry
cry
sometimes i cry
when i cant do nothin else
