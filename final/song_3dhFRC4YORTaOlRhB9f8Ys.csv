propaganda
homage

verse one
yeah so i’m making my debut in an era where rappers
use fewer words than groot but i sprout from different roots
so i continue in the tradition of black thought black thought
where the mission is to be the match that sparks that sparks
the mind that will mobilize the masses
beginning in sun kissed grasses
we’re guaranteed taxes and caskets but
we gotta work to remove black skin from white masks
a fanonmenon that i wanna
don the ski mask of the robbers frantz fanon
as if i’m not already seen as bad by the coppers homage
that’s like parents being raised by their toddlers
that’s more backwards than european opinions
of africans i had to let go of others
opinions of me to be free
but for my curtain call give a round of applause to

you see me here you hear me now as i make my debut
but there was a point in time when i ain’t know what to do

verse two
slouched on a brown broken down couch in
my mama house watching akeelah and the bee on bet
as dr larabee says to me use
words to change the world but i fear being brilliant
who am i to shine who are you not
to halaj you got to be lialu
no one can stop you except yourself so
accept yourself why measure self with the ruler of the world
when you’re a pharaoh lets go lets get to it
you found freedom in music but how will you use it
with rhythm and words comes responsibility
don’t let criticisms blur god’s gift to emcee
a prerequisite for emcee leadership is vision
so esoteric lyrics in the music is a given
and the evidence of your influence may be hidden
but i promise the children are stepping in your footprints
the same way that you stepped in the footprints of musicians
so for your curtain call direct the round of applause towards

chorus
royce da 5’9 ab soul and wale
joey badass black thought and common
jonathan mcreynolds outkast and big krit
jamila woods travis greene and tye tribbett
michael jackson janet jackson and alicia keys
bob marley fela kuti and pusha t
parliament funkadelic and marvin gaye
and so many more but i don’t have time to say but
postchorus
time upon time ‘cause life is cyclical
musicians produce frequencies that make freedom ring
and since that’s the way that i was saved
i will create in that tradition till i’m placed in my grave

outro
thank you god
thank you godembed"
