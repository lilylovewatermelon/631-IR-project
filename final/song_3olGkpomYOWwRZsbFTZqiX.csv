i take a little smoke in the evenin
i take a little whiskey on ice
i never get behind on killin my mind
its just the kind of things i like
just the kind of things i like

verse 2
the minute that i saw you walkin over
i figured i was diggin my grave
well you had the shovel i knew you were trouble
but youre just the kind of trouble i crave
just the kind of trouble i crave

chorus
and mama always set a good example
daddy always gave me good advice
jesus tried to steer me in the right direction
but the devil always made me think twice
devil always made me think

verse 3
someday im goin six feet under
and when im standin at the gate
theyll tally up my sins they wont let me in
sayin son youre just a little too late
son youre just a little too late
