youre feeling pretty good
you think youve got a shot
most girls you probably would
yeah this is that kind of place
but she aint that kind of girl
youre reading it all wrong
let me tell you about her

she only smokes when she drinks
she only drinks now and then
now and then when shes tired
of being let down by men
you can give her a light
but its not what you think
everybody knows she only drinks alone
and she only smokes when she drinks

did you ask her to dance
let me guess she told you no
you gotta take her someplace quiet
and see how far that goes
oh dont take it all that hard
when she smiles and turns you down
for a complicated girl
she aint that hard to figure out
see joe nichols liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likeshe only smokes when she drinks
she only drinks now and then
now and then when shes tired
of being let down by men
you can give her a light
but its not what you think
everybody knows she only drinks alone
and she only smokes when she drinks

oh she only smokes when she drinks
she only drinks now and then
now and then when shes tired
of being let down by men
you can give her a light
but its not what you think
everybody knows she only drinks alone
and she only smokes when she drinks

yeah thats rightembed"
