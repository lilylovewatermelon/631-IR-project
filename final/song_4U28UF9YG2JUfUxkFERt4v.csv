you guide me in
to safety and silence oh
as you breathe me out
i drink you in oh

chorus
and we go beyond the farthest reaches
where the light bends and wraps beneath us
and i know as you collapse into me
this is the start of something

verse 2
rivers and oceans
we could beckon no
your eyes and your limbs
are instruments to pick apart
the distance within

bridge
let the tides carry you back to me
the past the future
through death
my arms are open

chorus
and we go beyond the farthest reaches
where the light bends and wraps beneath us
and i know as you collapse into me
this is the start of somethingsee sleep token liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeembed"
