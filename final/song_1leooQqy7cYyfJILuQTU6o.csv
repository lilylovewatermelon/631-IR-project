its not what i took from you
its not what i stole
we are born like this like this

verse 1

to stretch the thought a mile
weve lost that kind of spirit
we want it back today
the time is right to change this
to make the life we know
they took what we were given
well get it back again

prechorus
somewhere someones gun someones gun is laughing

chorus
its not what i gave to you
its not what i stole
we are born like this like this
its not what i took from you
its not what i stole
we are born like this
