verse 1 miley cyrus
i remember dreaming bout the things i do right now right now
like i climbed onto a cloud scared to look back down yeah
i remember when ayy
i was all alone all alone
nobody round nobody round
to hold me down hold me down
but now youre here with me tonight
look at what you found

prechorus miley cyrus
i was lonely for some time
now its only you and i
i wont live without your love tonight tonight

chorus miley cyrus
im dancing to the sound of my words in the crowd
too high to come down
so let me see your hands in the air

its go hard or go home and it aint no looking back
my toughest enemys in the mirror would you look at that
im top five dead or alive one of the best to rhyme
and if i ever take a seat i stood the test of time
every verse every song every feature i was on better know that i abused it
if i die before my time ill still be living through my music
i cracked the industry open but still got this shit on lock
even on the highway up to heaven luda still will be on top hey

chorus miley cyrus
im dancing to the sound of my words in the crowd
too high to come down
so let me see your hands in the air
let me see your hands in the air
let me see your hands in the air
