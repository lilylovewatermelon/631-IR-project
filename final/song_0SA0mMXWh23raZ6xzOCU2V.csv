golden rubbers in these denim pockets denim pockets
on my waist theres a black glock black glock
new girl moved on the block on the block
she been plottin on my brown cock brown cock
last night i slept over hers over hers
during sex i overheard i overheard
a sword sliced the air i pulled out the nana
rolled off the bed then shot back powpow
blood on the sheets probably spillin from my gash
looked out the glass seen him sprintin on the grass
a real ninja with the blade and the mask
had them gold ninja stars and red supreme nunchuks
now she tryna patch me up but
girl i was just tryna get a nut bust
if thats your ex you should probably own a pistol
but im guessin its wiser to exit with dude
chorus frank ocean  tyler the creator
the blinds wide open so he can ooh
see you in the dark when youre sleepin ooh
naked body fresh out the shower
and you touch yourself after hours ah ah
aint no man allowed in your bedroom ah ah
youre sleeping alone in bed ooh ooh
but check your window swag
hes at your window

but in the back of my top im writing songs about we

little ones the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
youre a pretty broad in the top three
of things that ive been waiting to come so

we can begin the pretend game i wanna be finn from adventure time
chorus frank ocean  tyler the creator
