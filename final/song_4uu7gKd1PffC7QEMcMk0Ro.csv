verse 1
i got a plan to run up some bands
you tell me i cant i tell you who i am
free all my brothers thats stuck in the can
glizzy on me 38 it wont jam
opp pack i can make you a strand
free mark he went dumb off a xan
fake jeans that shit come from japan
i be flexing you can look at my gram
bitches see me and they know who i am
lil tjay oh my god im a fan
lil tjay oh my god im the man
i remember i was whippin the pan
wasnt right but i did what i can
fuck it though cause im just livin my life
remember times when the day wasnt bright
half a pint up in a twoliter sprite
ima make sure all my niggas aight
commissary and im shippin out kites
takin off bout to book me a flight
diamonds dancin in the middle of night
fire bitches started bein polite
i remember when i wasnt they type
now they figure i can better they life
i aint listenin to niggas advice
unless i feel what you tellin me right
