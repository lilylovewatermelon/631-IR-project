give a little loving but i still gonna need some more rob it
stealing from the rich and then give it to the poor
telling everybody it dont matter anymore she said
all i really needed was a friend like you
help me through and together we can change but
if i was to stay it wasnt for too long
people sing the same song everywhere im going
closer to the sun and far from the moon
people screaming out they gonna see me real soon
they say oooohhh ooohhhhh ooohhhhooooohhh
