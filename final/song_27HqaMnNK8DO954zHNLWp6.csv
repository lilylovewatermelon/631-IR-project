one for all one for all
its all its all for one
lets start a union calling every human
its one for all and all for one
lets live in unison calling every citizen
its one for all and all for one

verse 1
we dont want war cant take no more
its drastic time for sure
we need an antidote and a cure
cause do you really think muhammad got a problem with jehovah
we dont want war imagine if any prophet was alive
in current days amongst you and i
you think theyd view life like you and i do
or would they sit and contemplate on why
do we live this way act and behave this way
we still live in primitive today
cause the peace in the destination of war cant be the way
theres no way so people just be a woman be a man
realize that you can change the world by changing yourself
and understand that were all just the same
so when i count to three lets change

hook
one for all one for all
its all its all for one
lets start a union calling every human
its one for all and all for one
lets live in unison calling every citizen
its one for all and all for one

got no time for grand philosophy
i barely keep my head above the tide
i got this mortgage got three kids at school
what youre saying is the truth but really troubles me inside
id change the world if i could change my mind
if i could live beyond my fears
exchanging unity for all my insecurity
exchanging laughter for my tears

hook
one for all one for all
its all its all for one
lets start a union calling every human
its one for all and all for one
lets live in unison calling every citizen
its one for all and all for one

verse 3
i dont know yall we in a real deposition
in the midst of all this negative condition
divided by beliefs differences and religion
why do we keep missing the point in our mission
why do we keep killing each other whats the reason
god made us all equal in his vision
i wish that i could make music as a religion
then we could harmonise together in this mission
listen i know its really hard to make changes
but two of us could help rearrange this curse
utilising all the power in our voices
together we will unite and make the right choice
and fight for education save the next generation
come together as one
i dont understand why its never been done
so lets change on the count of one
bridge
it takes one just one
and then one follows the other one
and then another follows the other one
next thing you know you got a billion
people doing some wonderful things
people doing some powerful things
lets change and do some powerful things
unity could be a wonderful thing

hook
one for all one for all
its all its all for one
one for all one for all
its all its all for one
lets start a union calling every human
its one for all and all for one
lets live in unison calling every citizen
its one for all and all for oneembed"
