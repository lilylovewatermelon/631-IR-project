pack it up and leave it
leave it all behind you
startin fresh in someone elses town
and though we may be leavin
ill be right beside you
to pick you up until you come around

without your friends beside you
you built up just to knock it down
so when youre feelin rough
ill be right behind you to pick you up
until you come around
