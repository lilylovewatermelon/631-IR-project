the deals we made to shake things up
and the rights that they abused
might just fuck us over
but the doors wont shut until theyre sure
theres nothing left to use
someones taking over
threw it away but now i say
its time to hand it over

verse 2
the jokes worn thin the king stepped in
now well see who is who
look whos bending over
but the stars werent wrong the time felt right
we both knew it was true
the smart ones exit early
and the rest hope for a shoulder

interlude
oohooh wahoo
oohooh wahoo
oohooh wahoo
oooh

verse 3
if we lose our touch it wont mean much
if everyones confused
which door do we open
ohohoh oh…
its the same old trick they played their hand
now theres one thing left to do
