her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
takes forever getting ready so shes never on time for anything
when she gets that come get me look in her eyes
well it kinda scares me the way that she drives me wild
when she drives me wild

chorus
beautiful crazy she cant help but amaze me
the way that she dances aint afraid to take chances
and wears her heart on her sleeve
yeah shes crazy but her crazys beautiful to me

verse 2
she makes plans for the weekend cant wait to go out
till she changes her mind
says lets stay on the couch and watch tv
and she falls asleep

chorus
beautiful crazy she cant help but amaze me
the way that she dances aint afraid to take chances
and wears her heart on her sleeve
yeah shes crazy but her crazys beautiful to me
