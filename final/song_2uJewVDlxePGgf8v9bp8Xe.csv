verse 1 gucci mane
i pulled up in a 4door porsche settrippin
3 young dreadhead niggas riding with me
i dont think they like me and i dont like em neither
but if they move wrong ill red up their white beater
i do it for the hood i do it like no equal
i do it for the red black yellow white people
i just bought a k just the other day
and i dont play with grown men i dont like to play
im so motherfuckin turned up right now
niggas hang on me i dont give a fuck right now
well you niggas keep on trying like the little engine that could
you think you can you think you could i think you pussies should

chorus gucci mane
im so motherfuckin turned up right now
someone please turn gucci mane down
brick squad thugged out we dont give a fuck
we hit the club shoot the club tear the club up
so you should hit the floor get low and shut up
hit the floor get low and shut the fuck up
yous a bitch yous a snitch you a motherfuckin scrub
yous a bitch yous a snitch you a motherfuckin scrub

verse 3 wooh da kid
iced out bar got me ballin like the lakers
homicide around the corner where you in jamaica

im a nigga with an attitude holding on the gun
17 niggas i left 16 hit
last nigga hit the corner got his whole head split
told you youre a goner imma leave you dead quick
im like wu the kid thugged out we dont give a fuck
let your soul meet the sole of the bottom of my chucks
black car black tint with the baby tags
stay low to the floor my midget out the bag2embed"
