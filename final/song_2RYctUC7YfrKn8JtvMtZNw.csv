verse 1
i feel it it’s in me tonight
i see this tonight i’m pulling up
i see him he’s walking out
he gives me the eye and he’s a thug
what’s the deal i’m 21
im legal hey now im free to run
that’s the one i meet this morning
pulling me to the floor wanna get to know me

prechorus
i’m ready to have fun lets bang the thing up
but you gotta be prepared to get your weight up
see i’m at the train since i came up
in the atl is where it came from

chorus
bang it up boy gonna bang it up
i’m full grown you can go tear it up bang it up
bang it up boy gonna bang it up
last one i had on the floor couldn’t do enough bang it up
bang it up boy gonna bang it up bang it up
bang it up boy gonna bang it up bang it up
