i was in the tomb til i moved where its sunny
now if you listen closely you can hear my diamonds hummin
im used to pocket change so its funny gettin money
either im filling up my lungs or im filling up my tummy
the legends of the hidden temple 24 carat emblems
chain look like olmec rings lookin like the incas
mayans on my diamonds they admire when we arriving
whole team fucking cashed see the sesh up on my eyelids
gemstones float while the ash float down
know we make our own juice like we make our own sounds
no free verse cause i dont do charity
pistol in my face crack a smile there aint no scaring me
everybody wanna sound so damn unique
but if i heard your song i aint thinkin bout the whos he
bitch im thinking turn it down know you thinking fuck this boy
go ahead and speak a word i promise i will love you boy
bitch im thinking turn it down know you thinking fuck this boy
go ahead and speak a word i promise i will love you boyyou might also like5embed"
