i remember those days when i first had that grande money
never checked the price it just all came to me
but now a days ill be pinchin every penny
five star dining at my local dennys
ive been sitting on the curb in you neighborhood
lookin at the streetlight thinking how i could
just get one response maybe a glance
but the system has its rules about the second chance

livin by the tracks in the barrio
keeps my welfare state from the don risto
dont be amazed when you see me out of line
my baseball bat will take care of joe grind
thought i was one baby im a fool
because ive been wrong for years

chorus
aint it funny how everybody knows but you
couldnt imagine what else you could do
oh mm

oh ill
be craving that way
oh im
craving that way
you might also likeaint it funny how everybody knows but you
couldnt imagine what else you could do
aint it funny how everybody knows but you
couldnt imagine what else you could do
oh

verse 2
please spare me your regards baby
time is long when youre waiting patiently
that bed used to be so good
now my pillow is a curb in your neighborhood
thought i was one but baby im a fool
because ive been wrong for years

outro
mm oh
ill be craving that way
oh im
craving that way spababadadada
mm oh
ill be craving that way
oh im
craving that way oh i
mm oh
ill be craving that way
oh im
craving that way spababadadadaembed"
