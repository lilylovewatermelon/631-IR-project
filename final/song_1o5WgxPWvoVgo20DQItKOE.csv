i think i forgot the things ive done
its just good to be alive
and i could stay grateful for the sun
though its getting in my eyes
and how was salt lake city dear
do you feel me

cause now you let your heart get filled
with someone elses love
and now youve let your head get held
in someone elses arms
and if i die tomorrow babe would you feel me
feel me

pre chorus
cause you were only a little bit of light
and you were only a minutе of my time
i dont miss you
i miss the way you made mе feel

chorus
like i lost part of me out there
my my my my
when the space between our bodies disappeared
my my my my
even through the pain i cant recall your face
just the ache of knowing everything was gonna change
i got so close to love with you my dear
but i dont miss you
i miss the way you made me feel
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likeverse 2
and there was something in the air
as we drove your parents car
fire we both knew was there
but couldnt bring ourselves to start
i screamed the words inside your head
and hoped youd feel me
feel me

pre chorus
cause you were only a little bit of light
and you were only a minute of my time
i dont miss you
i miss the way you made me feel

chorus
like i lost part of me out there
my my my my
when the space between our bodies disappeared
my my my my
even through the pain i cant recall your face
just the ache of knowing everything was gonna change
i got so close to love with you my dear
but i dont miss you
i miss the way you made me feel
bridge
i know
that the moment i chase is a race that ive already lost
it was long ago
and you were only a break from the fear of being alone
but im sure
that feeling the ache is better than nothing at all

chorus
feels like i lost part of me out there
my my my my
when the space between our bodies disappeared
my my my my
even through the pain i cant recall your face
just the ache of knowing everything was gonna change
i got so close to love with you my dear
i dont miss you
i miss the way you made me feel2embed"
