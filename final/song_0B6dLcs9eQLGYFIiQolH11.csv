and i wish a motherfucker would try and get wit me
cuz im nifty wit the milli when the torch is on
and play every play like its fourth and long
now when the horse is gone i be the shit out the pig
it dont take much to split a fools wig
see im only one shot from makin the headlines
so quick niggas got quarters and deadlines
shakin the fed time
they checkin my bar codes
atf ins and the us marshals
and this aint nathan new to me
capitalize on opportunity
