his name was steve her name was gina
youve never been here before have you
they met at a bar called cabo wabo cantina
he was an insurance salesman from south dakota
she was a first grade school teacher phoenix arizona
no my first time here
they started dancin and it got real hot
then it spilled over to the parkin lot
one more tequila they were fallin in love
one more is never enough

chorus
dont bite off more than you can chew
theres things down here the devil himself wouldnt do
just remember when you let it all go
what happens down in mexico
stays in mexico

verse 2
he woke up in the morning and he made a little telephone call
to check on his wife and his kids back at home in sioux falls
hey babe everything okay
she hopped right in the shower with a heavy heavy mind
what am i doing
he knew it was the first time gina had ever crossed that line
you might also likeprechorus
they walked down to the beach and started drinkin again
jumped into the ocean for a dirty swim
one more margarita then were falling in love
one mores never enough

chorus
dont bite off more than you can chew
theres things down here the devil himself wouldnt do
just remember when you let it all go
what happens down in mexico
stays in mexico
oh mexico

bridge
waiting at the bar at the terminal gate
she says steve i gotta go im gonna miss my plane
he said one more tequila fore you climb on up
she said one mores never enough

chorus
dont bite off more than you can chew
theres things down here the devil himself wouldnt do
just remember when you let it all go
what happens down in mexico
stays in mexico
stays in mexico
stays in mexico
stays in mexico
oh mexicoembed"
