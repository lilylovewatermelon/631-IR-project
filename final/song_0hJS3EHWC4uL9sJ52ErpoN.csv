youre the only thing thats coming in
im getting static from my better sense
nothing on the fm
see ive been praying for a signal
a sign that you havent sent
you might be an angel falling from the heavens
or a stranger from a garden party drunk and roaming ever since

ive got a radio heart and youre the only thing thats coming in
static from my better sense
stagnant on my betterment
im praying for signal or a sign that you havent sent
running from a place where they dont make people like me
i keep the car running
i keep my bags packed
i dont wanna leave just dont wanna leave last
ive been praying for your touch your glance your hand

and hes a better kisser than youd think mom
hes a better listener than most
we took pretty pictures by the sea  mom
fell in love and sailed off
and when the son of man had me in his clutches
the son of man had me in his clutches
the son of man had me in his clutches
the sons of men pulled me to the touch and i loved it
you might also likei hate you more than i miss you
thats not true id hate to miss you
anywhere i go anywhere youve been before
i get the chance to say goodbye
or hello i mean
you dont call
you dont write
you know ive been up for forty days and forty nights and all my fears have multiplied
by the silence in your eyes

does he stay for the way for the air youre movin
youre movin
does he stay for the way for the air youre movin
youre losing it

better hide your love hide your love
dont let it slip away dont let it slip away
you better hide your love
hide your love
dont let it slip away
dont let it slip away
you better hide your love
say hide your love
now now hide your love
hide your love8embed"
