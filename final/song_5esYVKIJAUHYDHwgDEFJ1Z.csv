keep your chin up high
and dont be afraid of the dark

when you walk through a storm
keep your chin up high
and dont be afraid of the dark
at the end of the storm
is a golden sky
and the sweet silver song of a lark

walk on through the wind
walk on through the rain
though your dreams be tossed and blown
walk on walk on with hope in your heart
and youll never walk alone
youll never walk aloneyou might also likeembed"
