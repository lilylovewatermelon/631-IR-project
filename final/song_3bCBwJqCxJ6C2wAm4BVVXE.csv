i still see us making love sometimes
i wake up in cold sweats
i wonder where you are
what you doing i miss you
i think of you i miss us

verse
i remember that silly fight we had soon as your mama left the house
do you remember
you said i wont quite the man that i used to be
and i didnt understand the words coming out your mouth
i remember
every argument like yesterday
still cant believe that you gone away i cant believe it
and i know its a choice that we both done made
that it was best for us just to break apart
but i wanna let you know that youre still in my heart
and you baby you know
that youre still in my heart
like a seed let you grow
i still love you girl no matter where you go
no matter where you are no matter how far
im gon be right there
if you need me im right here
if you want me im right here here here here
and all you gotta do issee trey songz liveget tickets as low as 87you might also like2embed"
