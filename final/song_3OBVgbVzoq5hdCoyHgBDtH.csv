lives swallow the infatuation
cleverly seduced
evils in the stink of you
rise and fall we decompose

verse 1
rest against the sore
push breathe and pull
ripping out compassion
instincts adapting
sin sings a moan
in slides night
unite and spread the heart apart
and smile of pain

chorus 2
i cant show my true embrace
now that youre subdued
i begin to weaken you
rise and fall we decompose

verse 2
prey on the masses
conscience relapses
the less we think and
more we drink our actions are casual
while sin sings a moan
