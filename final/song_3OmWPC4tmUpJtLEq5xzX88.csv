american girls and american guys
well always stand up and salute well always recognize
when we see old glory flyin theres a lot of men dead
so we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

verse 1
my daddy served in the army where he lost his right eye
but he flew a flag out in our yard til the day that he died
he wanted my mother my brother my sister and me
to grow up and live happy in the land of the free

verse 2
now this nation that i love has fallen under attack
a mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
soon as we could see it clearly through our big black eye
man we lit up your world like the fourth of july

chorus
hey uncle sam put your name at the top of his list
and the statue of liberty started shaking her fist
and the eagle will fly and itâ€™s gonna be hell
when you hear mother freedom start ringing her bell
and itll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you
oh brought to you courtesy of the red white and blue
you might also likebridge
oh justice will be served and the battle will rage
this big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
and youll be sorry that you messed with the us of a
cause well put a boot in your ass its the american way

chorus
hey uncle sam put your name at the top of his list
and the statue of liberty started shaking her fist
and the eagle will fly and its gonna be hell
when you hear mother freedom start ringing her bell
and itll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you
brought to you courtesy of the red white and blue
