the night will come
and rip away
her wings of innocence through every word we say
maybe its time
to spit out the core of our rotting union
hopefully before it chokes
us to our senses

chorus
guess its too bad
that everything we have
is taken away

verse 2
swim in the smoke
the hero will drown
intoxicating beauty tears everything down
but still our hands
are bound at the wrists
this romantic tragedy is suffocating from your fist
in a sea of fire

chorus
guess its too bad
that everything we have
is taken away
guess its too bad
that everything we have
is taken away

chorus
guess its too bad
that everything we have
is taken away
guess its too bad
that everything we have

guess its too bad
that everything we have
is taken away
guess its too bad
that everything we have
is taken away
