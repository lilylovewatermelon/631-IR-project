come fly with me lets fly lets fly away
if you can use some exotic booze
theres a bar in far bombay
come fly with me lets fly lets fly away
come fly with me lets float down to peru
in lama land theres a one man band
and hell toot his flute for you
come fly with me lets take off in the blue

prechorus
once i get you up there
where the air is rarefied
well just glide
starryeyed
once i get you up there
ill be holding you so near
you may hear the angels cheer
because were together

chorus
weatherwise its such a lovely day
just say the words and well beat those birds
down to acapulco bay
its perfect for a flying honeymoon they say
so come fly with me lets fly lets fly away
