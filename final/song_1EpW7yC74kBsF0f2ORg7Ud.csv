old mister jackson cuts his grass after church on his tractor only after listening to the country countdown
he remembers all the three cord sessions givin lessons never guessin wed go from dive bars to sold out
he just smiles cant help but grin
when he turns that dial on the fm
hears an old friend he cant believe it
aint that what its all about what its all about yeah

chorus
all i wanna do is make my hometown proud
make em turn it up loud
roll them windows down
all i wanna do is make my hometown proud
gonna give em that sound
everybodys talking bout
we still them same old same old southern boys
still got that same old same old southern voice
were singing now
all i wanna do is make my hometown proud
make my hometown proud
make my hometown proud

verse 2
all the whining through the years all the grindin of the gears all the passion and the tears man it paid off
all the places that we see all the people that we meet it still feels like a dream that were living on
it aint the lights and fame
it aint the smoke and flame
its that sweet hearted smile on my mamas face
