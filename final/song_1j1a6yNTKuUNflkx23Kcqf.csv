hangin with the twobit ladies
soakin up the florida sun
ridin in a new mercedes
wonderin if i ever did anything to have this much fun

prechorus
i hope im sane by the time im done

chorus
cause its a different horizon
its a paradise i find that sets me loose aint it the truth
its a place out on the ocean its a mansion with a view
but all that i can think about is you

verse 2
i been riding down a twolane highway
for pretty much all of my life
tryin to do things my way
wonderin if ill ever get anywhere but where i came from

prechorus
i hope im sane by the time im done

chorus
cause its a different horizon
its a paradise i find that sets me loose oh aint it the truth
its a place out on the ocean its a mansion with a view
but all that i can think about is youyou might also likeembed"
