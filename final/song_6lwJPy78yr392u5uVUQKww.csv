sunday morning rain is falling
steal some covers share some skin
clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
you twist to fit the mold that i am in

refrain
but things just get so crazy living life gets hard to do
and i would gladly hit the road get up and go if i knew
that someday it would lead me back to you
that someday it would lead me back to you

chorus
that may be all i need
in darkness she is all i see
come and rest your bones with me
driving slow on sunday morning
and i never want to leave

verse 2
fingers trace your every outline yeah yeah yeah
paint a picture with my hands
back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
change the weather still together when it ends

chorus
that may be all i need
in darkness she is all i see
come and rest your bones with me
driving slow on sunday morning
and i never want to leave
see maroon 5 liveget tickets as low as 100you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus
and you may not know
that may be all i need
in darkness she is all i see
oh come and rest your bones with me
driving slow
driving slow all i need
yeah yeah

outro
its a flower in your hair
im a flower in your hairembed"
