that youve been calling me
all of the time

everyday oh honey
i dont wanna be following
and falling behind

if youre gonna be walking away
and i dont know why i wouldnt follow
wouldnt follow

you got me looking up
even when im falling down
you got me crawling out of my skin

you got me wondering why
i am underneath this big old sky
stopping the loving getting in
im stopping the loving getting in

and now you say its easy
that you been falling for all of my charm
and getting lost in my smile

never ceases to amaze me
when im chancing my arm
that i still do it with style

youll be with me tomorrow
with me tomorrow

you got me looking up
even when im falling down
you got me crawling out of my skin

you got me wondering why
i am underneath this big old sky
stopping the loving getting in
stopping the loving getting in
yes im stopping the loving getting in

you got me looking up
even when im falling down
you got me crawling out of my skin

you got me wondering why
i am underneath this big old sky
stopping the loving getting inembed"
