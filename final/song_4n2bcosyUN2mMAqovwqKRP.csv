i thought you were just being a girl
the kind that just wants to change me
likes to find all my flaws
thought i had you figured out
i told myself shes crazy
man was i ever wrong
the whole time you were just trying to love me

chorus
i pushed and you pulled
should have just fell into you
but i did what i always do i always do
wanted to talk but i walked away
didnt want to hear what you had to say
stupid me cant believe i never knew
the whole time you were just trying to love me

verse 2
didnt think those tears were real
thought you were just trying to play me
i just stood there and let em fall oh
you were just loving me after all oh

chorus
i pushed and you pulled
should have just fell into you
but i did what i always do i always do
wanted to talk but i walked away
didnt want to hear what you had to say
stupid me cant believe i never knew
the whole time you were just trying to love me
