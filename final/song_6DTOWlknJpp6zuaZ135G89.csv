cross my arm is that old ink stain
god i wish i could erase that name
reminds me that im the one to blame
i used to think that rules were made for breaking
now i question every road ive taken
and i regret every heart ive forsaken
heres my confession

chorus
the mistakes ive made
are coming back to haunt me
like a ghost from a grave
always there to taunt me
you say its okay you say you still want me
but you dont know where ive been
im no stranger to my sins
ive got skeletons ive got skeletons

verse 2
you tell me how a man can be forgiven
start clean on the life hes living
how do you run from a demon
ive tried every single thing i know
it just wont let me go
im tired of walking down the same damn road
towing this load

the mistakes ive made
are coming back to haunt me
like a ghost from a grave
always there to taunt me
you say its okay you say you still want me
but you dont know where ive been
im no stranger to my sins
ive got skeletons ive got skeletons
the mistakes ive made
are coming back to haunt me
like a ghost from a grave
always there to taunt me
you say its okay you say you still want me
but you dont know where ive been
im no stranger to my sins
ive got skeletons ive got skeletons

outro
you say you dont know where ive been
im no stranger to my sins
ive got skeletons ive got skeletons
