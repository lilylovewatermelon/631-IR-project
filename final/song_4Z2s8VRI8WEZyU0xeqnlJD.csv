youre music to my eyes
i had to listen just to find you
i like for you to let me sing along
give you a rhythm you feel

prechorus bradley cooper
i wanna learn your every line
i wanna fill your empty spaces
i want to play the part to reach your heart
sing you a song that you feel

chorus bradley cooper
love let your music be mine
sing while i harmonize
let your melodies fly in my direction
take me to your paradise
on a musical ride
im in love with your music baby
youre music to my eyes

verse 2 lady gaga
your voice is quite a view
i heard a song and then i saw you
i learned the lyrics and knew you were mine
dance the horizon with you
