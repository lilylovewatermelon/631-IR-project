i just wanna say i apologize
for all of the things i put you through

verse 1
anger ran em all off feelings made еm just go
life on line in the north and im sittin hеre mad bout a ho

verse 2
its a panoramic four seater
never let me go i leave my hoes cause i dont need em
staring in your eyes tryna see potential like a soul seeker
lying in my eyes saying you love me you a cold creature
fuck that shit you said just leave cause i dont need you
im gon let that other nigga treat you
my song playing loud through the speakers
while you decide where to party at while you decide where to party at
leaving you never crossed my mind
you wrong if you ever thought of that
now you call i aint ever calling back no
im staying strong now dont worry about me
things that you did ill never forget
if you keep it real you can get the world out me
we can share it all to me it dont mean shit

refrain
fuck that rollsroyce ooh
i just wanna lose this cold heart ooh
i just wanna say i apologize
for all of the things i put you through
baby i done ran that money all up
these hoes mistreated me and baby you cant fault them no no
tell me why you left me on my own own
them hitters coming just ring the alarm lets go2embed"
