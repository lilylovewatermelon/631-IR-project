hey there weird kid in your hightop shoes
sitting in the back of the class i was just like you
always left out never fit in
owning that path youre walking in
mr misunderstood mr misunderstood

verse 2
now your buddies get their rocks off on top 40 radio
but you love your daddys vinyl oldtime rock and roll
elvis costello ray wylie hubbard
and think jeff tweedy is one bad mother
mr misunderstood mr misunderstood

chorus
one day youll lead the charge youll lead the band
guitar hero with lightnin hands
and the girls will like your tattoos and the veins in your arms
theyll be helpless to your musical charms
and theyll all hold up their hands
theyll all wanna dance
mr misunderstood mr misunderstood

verse 3
first time i met alabama hannah i was skinny as a rail
red hair tied up in a blue bandanna
she was hotter than the devils hell
she turned me on to back porch pickers
jackson pollock and gin
her daddy didnt trust my intentions
so he turned to his daddys old 410
im mr misunderstood mr misunderstood

had an axe to grind so off i went
mad at the sun for coming up again
i lost religion found my soul in the blues
rubbed the velvet off my blue suede shoes
yeah everybody held up their hands
and every soul on beale street danced
with mr misunderstood mr misunderstood

verse 4
so i went with it like a colt on my plymouth
through the glass behind my rearview
took a left when the world went right down 16th avenue
played with fire and i played on ledges
every circus stage and county fair
they tried to file my points sand my edges
and i just grew out my hair
im mr misunderstood im mr misunderstood

chorus
theyre standing in line chasing the buzz
til the next big things and already was
and hell if they know what theyre trying to find
if it aint that same old beendone kind
yeah gives the headscratchers fits
wondering how in the hell they missed
im mr misunderstood mr misunderstood
