yesterday has been and gone
tomorrow will i find the sun or will it rain
everybodys having fun except me
im the lonely one
i live in shame

chorus
i say goodbye to romance
goodbye to friends
i tell ya
goodbye to all the past
i guess that well meet well meet in the end

verse 2
ive been the king ive been the clown
now broken wings cant hold me down
im free again
the jester with the broken crown
it wont be me this time around to love in vain

chorus
i say goodbye to romance
goodbye to friends
i tell ya
goodbye to all the past
i guess that well meet
well meet in the end
you might also likebridge
and i feel the time is right although i know
that you just might say to me
what you gonna do what you gonna do
but i have to take this chance
goodbye to friends and to romance
and to all of you
and to all of you
come on now

chorus
i say goodbye to romance
goodbye to friends
i tell ya
goodbye to all the past
i guess that well meet
well meet in the end

verse 3
and the weathers lookin fine
and i think the sun will shine again
and i feel ive cleared my mind
all the past is left behind again
chorus
i say goodbye to romance
goodbye to friends
i tell ya
goodbye to all the past
i guess that well meet
well meet in the endembed"
