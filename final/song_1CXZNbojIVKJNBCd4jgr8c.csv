sittin up on the roof
sneakin a smoke by the chimney
checkin out the moon and the city lights
he takes off his flannel shirt
and he drapes it around her shoulders
slides up behind her and holds on tight
and she says i dont want this night to end
why does it have to end

chorus
tomorrow shell be rolling down i10
baton rouge lsu
eighteen years in her rear view
hes got a friday paycheck lined up down the block
at daddys shop
it aint much but its a job
theyve been dreading this moment all summer long
the night before life goes on

verse 2
ooh
a tear falls off her cheek and
right when it hits his arm he says
come on baby lets get out of here
they take one last drive around town
and man it already looks different
he bangs the wheel and says life aint fair
and this growing up stuff man i dont know
i just dont wanna let you go

tomorrow shell be rolling down i10
baton rouge lsu

the night before life goes on

yeah thats what my mama told me
and just like those kids
i didnt wanna listen to no one
yeah theres nothing you can do
theres nothing you can say
and i know how it feels when love goes away

chorus
tomorrow shell be rolling down i10
baton rouge lsu
eighteen years in her rear view
hes got a friday paycheck lined up down the block
at daddys shop

theyve been dreading this moment all summer long
but here it is they dont have long
the night before life goes on
