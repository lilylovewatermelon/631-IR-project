i just wanna go and skate
every day is go skateboarding day
cruising down the streets of la
wheres that pretty girl from glendale

verse 1
skating down hollywood
i dont even know that song at all
never gonna go back
im gonna stay in la
my love is here to stay

chorus 2
i just wanna go and skate
skate all my problems away
theres that pretty girl from the day off
with you i could never fail

verse 2
head to the sign
what was the best
for my life
you know youre trying to
it didnt work out
youre trying your best
i helped everyone but it wasnt enough
to tell you the truth
i couldnt lie
made it right
you know youre trying to
