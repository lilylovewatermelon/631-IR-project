put your dreams away for now
i wont see you for some time
i am lost in my mind
i get lost in my mind
momma once told me
youre already home where you feel loved
i am lost in my mind

verse 2
oh my brother
your wisdom is older than me
oh my brother
don’t you worry ‘bout me
don’t you worry
don’t you worry
don’t worry about me

verse 3
how’s that bricklaying coming
how’s your engine running
is that bridge getting built
are your hands getting filled
won’t you tell me my brother
cause there are stars up above
we can start moving forward
how’s that bricklaying coming
how’s your engine running
is that bridge getting built
are your hands getting filled
won’t you tell me my brother
cause there are stars up above
we can start moving forward
