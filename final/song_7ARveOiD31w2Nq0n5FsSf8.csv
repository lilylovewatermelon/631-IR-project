every night i live and die
feel the party to my bones
watch the wasters blow the speakers
spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
its just another graceless night
i hate the headlines and the weather
im nineteen and im on fire
but when were dancing im alright
its just another graceless night
prechorus
are you lost enough
have another drink get lost in us
this is how we get notorious oh
cause i dont know
if they keep tellin me where to go
ill blow my brains out to the radio ohohoh tchtch
chorus
all of the things were taking
cause we are young and were ashamed
send us to perfect places
all of our heroes fading
now i cant stand to be alone
lets go to perfect places

every night i live and die
meet somebody take em home
lets kiss and then take off our clothes
its just another graceless night cause
chorus
all of the things were taking
cause we are young and were ashamed
send us to perfect places
all of our heroes fading
now i cant stand to be alone
lets go to perfect places

outro
all the nights spent off our faces
trying to find these perfect places
what the fuck are perfect places anyway
all the nights spent off our faces
trying to find these perfect places
what the fuck are perfect places anyway
all the nights spent off our faces
trying to find these perfect places
what the fuck are perfect places anyway135embed"
