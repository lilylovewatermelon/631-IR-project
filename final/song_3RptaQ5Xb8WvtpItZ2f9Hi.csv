verse 1
bury all your secrets in my skin
come away with innocence and leave me with my sins
the air around me still feels like a cage
and love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again

chorus 1
so if you love me let me go
and run away before i know
my heart is just too dark to care
i cant destroy what isnt there
deliver me into my fate
if im alone i cannot hate
i dont deserve to have you
ooh my smile was taken long ago
if i can change i hope i never know

verse 2
i still press your letters to my lips
and cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
i couldnt face a life without your light without your light
but all of that was ripped apart when you refused to fight

chorus 2
so save your breath i will not hear
i think i made it very clear
you couldnt hate enough to love
is that supposed to be enough
i only wish you werent my friend
then i could hurt you in the end
i never claimed to be a saint
ooh my own was banished long ago
it took the death of hope to let you go

oh oh

chorus 3
so break yourself against my stones
and spit your pity in my soul
you never needed any help
you sold me out to save yourself
and i wont listen to your shame
you ran away youre all the same
angels lie to keep control
ooh my love was punished long ago
if you still care dont ever let me know
if you still care dont ever let me know
