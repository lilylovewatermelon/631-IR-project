if im being real i must confess
some damn days im just trying my best
to get out of bed and get half dressed
like i didnt spend the whole night crying
my mamas crazy and my daddys mean
the apple dont fall far from the tree
hell id be lying right through my teeth
if the sun was always shining

prechorus
thats the kinda dirt i save for the man upstairs
now im sleeping in your shirt and youre right there

chorus
yeah its me you and jesus
yall just listen and dont judge me
just shake your head and love me
when the world comes between us
yall dont give up or givе a damn
you just take me for who i am
and i swear wе can get through anything
me you and jesus

verse 2
words can hurt right to the bone
they type em out like sticks and stones
might cut me deep but i aint alone
cause you always got me
you say im pretty to my core
my heart is something worth fighting for
if this is all i get good lord
i dont need nobody

yall just listen and dont judge me
just shake your head and love me
when the world comes between us
yall dont give up or give a damn
you just take me for who i am
and we can get through anything
me you and jesus

bridge
hes up in heaven and honey youre heaven sent
you would die for me and he already did

chorus
and baby its me you and jesus
yall just listen and dont judge me
just shake your head and love me
when the world comes between us
yall dont give up or give a damn

and we can get through anything
and baby we make one hell of a team
me you and jesus
we can get through anything
