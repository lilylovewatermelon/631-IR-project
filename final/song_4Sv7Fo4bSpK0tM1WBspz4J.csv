okay

verse 1
why am i waking up out of my sleep
thinking of ya babe
you had a hold on me
now im feeling freer than i ever been
you been around love but you never been in

pre hook
um ay running out of shit that i can say
wishing you the best and so i pray

hook
i’ve been waiting for the day
you know it was coming either way
i know that you hate it
but i’m freer than i’ve ever been
something that you’ve never been

verse 2
you had just what you needed to be
everything you want to be
but youd rather run round these streets
now youre feeling freer than youve ever been
but really you feel trapped no need to pretend
you might also likepre hook
um ay running out of shit that i can say
wishing you the best and so i pray

hook
ive been waiting for the day
you know it was coming either way
i know that you hate it
but im freer than ive ever been
something that youve never been

bridge
i know you don’t wanna fuck nobody but me
you don’t wanna touch nobody but me
nobody
nobody
you wanna be

verse 3
saved i’m hoping that you found a way
i’m moving around state to state
i’m living i know you can’t relate
now i’m feeling freer than i’ve ever been
you know i was down
now i’m on the fence
ah ay a lot of bitches wanna ride the wave
most of them was out to take your place
you done went and gave that shit away
hook
i’ve been waiting for the day
you know it was coming either way
i know that you hate it
but i’m freer than i’ve ever been
something that you never been42embed"
