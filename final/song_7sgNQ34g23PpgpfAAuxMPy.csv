lonely are the ones who fall from love
lonely are the other ones who never know it
lonely are the ones who look too up above
lonely are the ones who never show it

chorus
what lights you up
what makes your blood run cold
until tomorrow you can drown away your sorrows
you can drink til the cows come home
but nobody likes drinkin alone
keep movin on
