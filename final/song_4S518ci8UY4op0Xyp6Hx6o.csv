i got my toes in the water ass in the sand
not a worry in the world a cold beer in my hand
life is good today
life is good today

verse 1
well the plane touched down just about three oclock
and the citys still on my mind
bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
i was still in the baggage line
concrete and cars are their own prison bars
like this life im living in
but the plane brought me farther im surrounded by water
and im not going back again

prechorus
i got my toes in the water ass in the sand
not a worry in the world a cold beer in my hand
life is good today
life is good today

chorus 1
adios and vaya con dios
yeah im leaving ga
and if it werent for tequila and pretty señoritas
id have no reason to stay
adios and vaya con dios
yeah im leaving ga
gonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
and grab my guitar and play
see zac brown band liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeverse 2
the four days flew by like a drunk friday night
as the summer drew to an end
they cant believe that i just couldnt leave
and i bid adieu to my friends
cause my bartender shes from the islands
her bodys been kissed by the sun
and coconut replaces the smell of the bar
and i dont know if its her or the rum

prechorus
i got my toes in the water ass in the sand
not a worry in the world a cold beer in my hand
life is good today
life is good today

chorus 2
adios and vaya con dios
a long way from ga
yes and all the muchachas they call me big papa
when i throw pesos their way
adios and vaya con dios
a long way from ga
someone do me a favor and pour me some jaeger and
ill grab my guitar and play
instrumental bridge

chorus 3
adios and vaya con dios
going home now to stay
the señoritas dont careo when theres no dinero yeah

adios and vaya con dios
going home now to stay

outro

and put my ass in a lawn chair toes in the clay
not a worry in the world a pbr on the way
life is good today
