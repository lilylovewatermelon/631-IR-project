listen id be a liar if i told you that i didnt see it coming
be more of a liar if i said hey i didnt want it to be something
you deserve much better for the love that you have shared
i know you wont believe it but girl i swear

prechorus
that i got love for you big love for you
even when im tripping
the fact remains that you will always be my baby
my baby
but dig the truth baby dig the truth
i cant hide my feelings
especially when the whole world can see

chorus
that my heart is in two different places
i got you in my life and i wanna do right
but its hard to let it go
when my love has two different faces
and i cant break ties cause they both look right
someone tell me whats a man to do when hes loving two
and he dont wanna lie but he cant tell the truth
whats a man to do when hes loving two
but he cant keep his heart in two different places
not in two different places

i know you feel it cause you stayed
there is much more to this story
but id be a fool to say i trust her and im always gonna love her
you know that you dont wanna hear
how im living on the edge baby
so i just say yeah baby
she aint nothing but she is real
but why i take her through it

prechorus
when i still got love for you big love for you
even when im tripping
the fact remains that you will always be my baby
my baby
but dig the truth baby dig the truth
i cant hide my feelings
especially when the whole world can see

chorus
that my heart is in two different places
i got you in my life and i wanna do right
but its hard to let it go
when my love has two different faces
and i cant break ties cause they both look right
someone tell me whats a man to do when hes loving two
and he dont wanna lie but he cant tell the truth
whats a man to do when hes loving two
but he cant keep his heart in two different places
not in two different places
bridge
i wanna tell you its over that i aint thinking of her
i wanna really mean it that i want you to see it
that im really trying to leave her behind
and im trying not to make you cry
i wanna tell you that i aint playing games
and im dedicated to receive a change
but when i look in the mirror its the same old man

chorus
that my heart is in two different places oh
i got you in my life my life and i wanna do right
but its hard to let it go
when my love has two different faces faces
and i cant break ties cause they both look right
someone tell me whats a man to do when hes loving two
and he dont wanna lie but he cant tell the truth
whats a man to do when hes loving two
but he cant keep his heart in two different places
not in two different places
