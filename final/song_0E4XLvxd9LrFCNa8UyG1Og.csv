explorers and soldiers
in you and in i
searching and fighting
to learn to realize

straight through our soul
with invisible thread
the pieces undone
are whole now instead

prechorus
the fight were in
has already been won

chorus
arise
for the kingdom has come
arise
for the kingdom has come

verse 2
your story was made of
beauty and soul
were closer to heaven
than well ever know
you might also likewoven in time
scarlett string
to breathe and create
a sacred thing

prechorus
the fight were in
has already been won

chorus
arise
for the kingdom has come
arise
for the kingdom has come

arise
for the kingdom has come
arise
for the kingdom has come1embed"
