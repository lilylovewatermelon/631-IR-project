my first sip made me gag
and i thought i was gonna blow beets
but i took another and pretty soon brother
sour mash started tasting sweet
made me feel brave and strong
bulletproof like i could do no wrong
but i found out before too long what i shouldve known

chorus 1
you can learn to love anything
even a bird in a cage will sing a song
even if its wrong even if it kills you in the end
you can learn to love anything
trade your heart and soul for a ball and chain
anything can bring you pleasure even pain
pick your poison poison
pick your poison

verse 2
ruby lips hid a razor tongue
and a heart blue as glacier ice
i was warned but i was willing
to ignore everybodys advice
the more i gave the more she took
she walked away without a second look
just one more page from that great big book on how

you can learn to love anything
even a bird in a cage will sing a song
even if its wrong even if it kills you in the end
you can learn to love anything
trade your heart and soul for a ball and chain
anything can bring you pleasure even pain
you can learn to love anything
a prison wall a ball and chain
anything can bring you pleasure even pain
pick your poison poison you can learn
pick your poison

outro
pick your poison you can learn
pick your poison
poison poison
pick your poison
pick your poisonembed"
