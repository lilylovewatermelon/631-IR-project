villain man never ran with krills in his hand and
wowont stop rockin til he clocked in a gazillion x2

villain man never ran with krills in his hand and
wont stop rockin til he clocked in a gazillion grand
tillin the wasteland sands
raps on backs of treasure maps stacks to the ceilin fan
he rest when hes ashes
ask em after ten miles in his galashes smashes stashes
chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
a clip a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
they supposed to know it show when his aura glow
get from out the row when he get dough its horrible
time is money spend waste save invest the fess
for ten ks hell cave a chicken chest s
yes yall the dub will get you trickles
the best ballers pitch in and rub to get her nickels
but tuttut he bout to change the price again
it go up each time he blow up like hydrogen
villain here have em shrillin in fear
and wont stop top illin til he a gazillionaire
grillin stare yeah your boy had drama
got em on a mental plane avoided bad karma
once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke
plus a brandnew chrome smoker with the triggers broke
i thought i told em firing pins was separate
he find out later when he tries to go and rep it
took a jehovah money for a arabic torah
charged in advance to translate it and ignored her sorta
one monkey dont stop no slaughter
a junkie wanna cop a quarterton run for the border
know the drill it aint worth the overkill
flow skill still theres no thrill
fill a billion 10k bills in his pillow
villain when it gets realer split the skrilla with—

his agenda is clear
endin this year with dividends to spare here
its not meant for the seein
went through the ceilin after enterin his center bein
a new meanin to sales through the roof
guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth proof
its the return of the tramp
who do a duet jam when ernest goes to camp
for the right earn namean like vern
we need some more oil for the machines to burn learn
jiminy crickets
he gets lucky like winnin free tickets off sickly lyrics
one mans waste is another mans soap
sons fanbase know the brothermans dope
a real weirdo with a bugged rare flow
and the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
he wears a mask so the charge wont grab
on a rooftop with a large stone slab
heads up talk white and thought niggerish
refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
black licorice and equally as yucky
how he handled the money was strictly dan stuckie
monkey hustle man on fire
later for the date than the hadron collider
and cost more it be seemin like a style
doom leave the competition steamin like a pile
smile ding sparklin jewels
in effect like alternate side of the street parkin rules
fools the roach was never dead
live for a week then dehydrate with a severed head
instead it was depicted as flicked in
split the wigs lit1embed"
