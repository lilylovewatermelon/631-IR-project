im leavin this place behind
and im headin down on the road tonight
im off for the hinterlands
way up north to where the tall trees stand
before i commence my ride
im askin lily to be my bride
i know theres another man
but he aint gonna delay my plans

i know she gonna be my wife
gonna fall in love im gonna live my life with her
you know i bet hes not so tough
aint afraid of him cause im a fool for love

verse 2
i come forward to find big jim
well here i am and i guess youre him
i see how you got your name
youre tall as hell and broad as a train

oh the baddest guy in the whole wide land
well im not afraid to fight
lets step outside and ill show you why

verse 3
i lie in the drifting snow
bleeding out as it covers me over
if spring comes before im found
just throw my bones in a hole in the ground
i lost friends along my way
i knew id need em eventually
no im not afraid to die
just mad i left big jim alive

chorus
i know i shouldve never looked back
but you aint gonna win a womans heart like that oh
i never should have called his bluff
i was born to lose cause im a fool for love
outro
i stare into the endless sky
and the sorry tale of my life goes by oh
i drift into the great unknown
no i really dont know where im goin
i stare into the endless sky
and the sorry tale of my life goes by oh
i drift into the great unknown
no i really dont know where im goin11embed"
