if i had all the whiskey ever made in tennessee
id pour it all down in this hole where my heart used to be
and id build a big boat out of shouldnthaves
and wishedidhavedones
set sail to that place in my memory it all started from

chorus
on these amber waves of grain i go back in time
like a ship in a bottle shes locked up inside of my mind
and i know i can find her right where i left her
right where i did her wrong
and as long as shes with me on this ocean of whiskey
i dont care if i come back at all

verse 2
so pour me another and just leave the bottle right here
with each sip that im takin im tastin the warm salty air
there wont be no troubles bartender if its okay
ill stay right here on this bar stool and be on my way

chorus
on these amber waves of grain i go back in time
like a ship in a bottle shes locked up inside of my mind
and i know i can find her right where i left her
right where i did her wrong
and as long as shes with me on this ocean of whiskey
well i dont care if i come back at all
