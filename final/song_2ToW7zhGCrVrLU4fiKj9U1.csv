i was cleopatra i was young and an actress
when you knelt by my mattress and asked for my hand
but i was sad you asked it as i laid in a black dress
with my father in a casket i had no plans
and i left the footprints the mud stained on the carpet
and it hardened like my heart did when you left town
but i must admit it that i would marry you in an instant
damn your wife id be your mistress just to have you around

chorus
but i was late for this late for that late for the love of my life
and when i die alone when i die alone when i die ill be on time

verse 2
while the church discouraged any lust that burned within me
yes my flesh it was my currency but i held true
so i drive a taxi and the traffic distracts me
from the strangers in my backseat they remind me of you

chorus
but i was late for this late for that late for the love of my life
and when i die alone when i die alone when i die ill be on time

bridge
and the only gifts from my lord were a birth and a divorce
but ive read this script and the costume fits so ill play my part

i was cleopatra i was taller than the rafters
but thats all in the past now gone with the wind
now a nurse in white shoes leads me back to my guestroom
its a bed and a bathroom
and a place for the end

outro
i wont be late for this late for that late for the love of my life
and when i die alone when i die alone when i die ill be on time15embed"
