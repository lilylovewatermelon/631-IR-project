hello tell me you know
yeah you figured me out
something gave it away
and it would be such a beautiful moment
to see the look on your face
to know that i know that you know now
and baby thats a case of my wishful thinking
you know nothing
cause you and i
why we go carrying on for hours on and
we get along much better
than you and your boyfriend

chorus
well all i really wanna do is love you
a kind much closer than friends use
but i still cant say it after all weve been through
and all i really want from you is to feel me
as the feeling inside keeps building
and i will find a way to you if it kills me
if it kills me
well how long can i go on like this
wishing to kiss you
before i rightly explode
this double life i lead isnt healthy for me
in fact it makes me nervous
if i get caught i could be risking it all
see jason mraz liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likebaby theres a lot that id miss
in case im wrong

chorus

if i should be so bold
id ask you to hold my heart in your hand
tell you from the start how ive longed to be your man
but i never said a word
i guess im gonna miss my chance again
all i really wanna do is love you
a kind much closer than friends use
but i still cant say it after all weve been through
and all i really want from you is to feel me
as the feeling inside keeps building
and i will find a way to you if it kills me
if it kills me
if it kills me
i think it might kill me
and all i really want from you is to feel me
its a feeling inside that keeps building
and i will find a way to you if it kills me
if it kills me
if it kills me
it might kill me1embed"
