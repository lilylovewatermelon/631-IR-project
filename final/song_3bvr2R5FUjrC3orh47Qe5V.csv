its strange to hear your voice
i did not expect for you to call
you wonder how im doing
how im holding up
since you did me wrong

i cant lie i sometimes cry when i think of how it used to be
i keep my friends with me i stay busy and i dont get much sleep

verse 1
well now wait one minute i
failed to mention
those tears i cried are tears of joy
cause it was no fun there
under your thumb and
now that were done im
getting right every night
with every single everloving girl in sight so

well when all my friends heard what a
you know what you were they
took me out on the town
but then i heard our song and
i dance along but
it felt all wrong cause
she was sweet she let me lead
she never took her everloving eyes off me so
