this is joy this is summer
keep alive stay alive
got your metal on ooh were alone
making sweet love takin time
til god strikes us
thats a pretty fuckin fast year flew by
thats a pretty long third gear in this car
glidin on the 5
the deer run across kill the headlights
pretty fuckin underneath moonlight now
pretty fuckin sunrise in sight
in comes the morning haunting us with the beams
solstice aint as far as it used to be
it begins to blur we get older blur hey
summers not as long as it used to be
everyday counts like crazy smoke haze wait
wanna get soaked
wanna film a tape on a speed boat
we smell of californication strike a pose
everything grows in the congo
everything grows ooh
can you come when i call again

verse 2
on comes the evening gold seeking ends
piece in my hand worth twice than a friend
and two limbs over shoulder carried away
because im stronger and the congo is dim smoke
in comes the morning ah smoke
in comes the morning ah hazeyou might also like61embed"
