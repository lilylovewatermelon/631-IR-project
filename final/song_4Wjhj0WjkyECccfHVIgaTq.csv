kick game run game run it real good
but never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
same nigga that you knew way back when

when you got a bunch of feelings that you dont show
i could tell i could tell i could tell
certain people dont like me no more
new shit dont excite me no more
guess that they dont really make em like me no more uh
you can look me in my eyes and see i aint myself
cause if yall what i created then i hate myself
but still let them girls in and tell em all
leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
im all day with it man am to the pm
niggas hating i just wish that they would say it when they see him oh
