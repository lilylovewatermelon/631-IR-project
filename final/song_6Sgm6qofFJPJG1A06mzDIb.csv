intro jayz pharrell
young its the life
once again its the life yes
i dont know why i get so high oh
its intoxicating man yall dont know why you do what you do
get so high oh get so high high off the life

verse 1 jayz
the allure of breaking the law
was always too much for me to ever ignore
ive got a thing for the bigbody benzes it dulls my senses
in love with a vdub engine
man im high off life fuck it im wasted
bathing ape kicks audemars piguet wrist
my womenfriends get tennis bracelets
trips to venice get their winters replaced with
the sunit aint even fun no more im jaded
man its just a game i just play it to play it
i put my feet in the footprints left to me
without saying a word the ghettos got a mental telepathy
man my brother hustled so naturally
up next was me but what perplexes me
shit i know how this movie ends still i play
the starring role in hovitos way
you might also likechorus jayz pharrell
its just life i solemnly swear
to change my approach stop shaving coke
stay away from hoes put down the toast
cause i be doing the most oh no
but every time i felt that was that it called me right back
it called me right back
man it called me right back oh no

verse 2 jayz
im like a russian mobster drinking distilled vodka
until im under the field with hoffa its real
peel the top up like a toupée mix the water with the soda
turn the pot up make a soufflé
all of yall can get it like grouppage on your twoway
im living proof that crime do pay
say hooray to the bad guy and all the broads
putting cars in their name for the stars of the game
putting caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train
all in the name of love
just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
over the house to take back everything that they claimed
or even the worse pain is the distress
learning youre the mistress only after that love gets slain
and the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
now it gets tough to ever love again
but the allure of the game keeps calling your name
to all the lauras of the world i feel your pain
to all the christies in different cities and tiffany lanes
we all hustlers in love with the same thing
chorus  jayz pharrell
its just life i solemnly swear
to change my approach stop shaving coke
stay away from hoes put down the toast
cause i be doing the most oh no
but every time i felt that was that it called me right back
it called me right back
man it called me right back oh no

verse 3 jayz
i never felt more alive than riding shotgun
in kleins green 5 until the cops pulled guns
and i tried to smoke weed to give me the fix i need 
what the game did to my pulse  with no results
and you can treat your nose and still wont come close
the game is a light bulb with eleventymillion volts
and im just a moth addicted to the floss
the doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
by any means necessary whatever the cost
even if it means lives is lost
and i cant explain why i just love to get high
drink life smoke the blueberry sky blink twice
im in the blueberry 5 you blink three times
i may not even be alive
i mean even james dean couldnt escape the allure
dying young leaving a goodlooking corpse
of course
chorus jayz pharrell
its just life i solemnly swear
to change my approach stop shaving coke
stay away from hoes put down the toast
cause i be doing the most oh no
but every time i felt that was that it called me right back
it called me right back
man it called me right back oh no

outro  jayz pharrell
once again its the life
yeah i said its the life
once i again its the life
oh no i dont know why i
get so high oh
get so high oh
get so high high off the life23embed"
