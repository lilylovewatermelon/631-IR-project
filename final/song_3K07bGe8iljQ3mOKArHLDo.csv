well the road rolls out like a welcome mat
to a better place than the one were at
and i aint got no kinda plan
but ive had all of this town i can stand

verse 2
and i got friends out on the coast
we can jump in the water and see what floats
weve been savin for a rainy day
lets beat the storm and be on our way

prechorus
and it dont matter to me
wherever we are is where i wanna be
and honey for once in our life
lets take our chances and roll the dice

chorus
i can be your lucky penny
you can be my fourleaf clover
startin over

verse 3
this might not be an easy time
theres rivers to cross and hills to climb
some days we might fall apart
and some nights might feel cold and dark
see chris stapleton liveget tickets as low as 36you might also likeverse 4
but nobody wins afraid of losin
and the hard roads are the ones worth choosin
someday well look back and smile
and know it was worth every mile

prechorus
and it dont matter to me
wherever we are is where i wanna be
and honey for once in our life
lets take our chances and roll the dice

chorus
i can be your lucky penny
you can be my fourleaf clover
startin over
startin over

instrumental break

prechorus
it dont matter to me
wherever we are is where i wanna be
and honey for once in our life
lets take our chances and roll the dice
chorus
i can be your lucky penny
you can be my fourleaf clover
startin over
startin over
