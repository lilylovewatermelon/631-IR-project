sit right here its ok
and my words are spoken slurred every single day
sure to find some comfort up against the hallway wall
i know i could never have it all
reaching the next level under oh oh oh
drinking starts this reflex so i dial her number
but the phone was out of order last call was made at 2am
somehow how when its broken yes its always there to mend

chorus
stumble dont humble cause you might get killed
sip but dont tip cause your beer you might spill
think what you feel cause your feelings dont think
here at this office we know just one drink

so god dont prove me wrong
please lord dont prove me wrong again ooo oh
and i been living at this address all week
attractive cause my hair is dull and my clothes are starting to reek
so when im too involved
with those problems i cant solve
wrap my fingers around
the original quality

chorus x2
you might also likeso god dont prove me wrong
please lord dont prove me wrong again oh no
dont prove me wrong ohhh i
please lord dont prove me wrong again and again and again and again
no i cant be wrong
no i
dont prove me wrong again
i cant be wrong
dont prove me wrong again
please lord dont x3
not again
oh god i
