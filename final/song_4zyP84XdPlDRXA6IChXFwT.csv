you really caught me
you really caught me dear
at the bottom where i fall

and slowly dear ask would you dance with me
heres the shades down
the lights off

and i didnt know you
and everything i do
done badly

now ill love you always
even when i say
distract me

and set out tonight at some strange place
if we have no friends here
why have few to begin with

to wake next to you in the morning
and good morning to you
how do you do
a good morning to you
you might also likeand more covers for you
sleep soundly dear
cause i have to go

yeah ill love you always
and when we leave this place
and drive back to carolina
and down to savannah and stay1embed"
