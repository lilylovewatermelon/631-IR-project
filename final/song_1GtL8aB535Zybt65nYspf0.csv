get it fuckin right

verse 1 corey taylor
ive known faces that have disappeared in time
find me wrapped in glass and slowly soaked in lime
all my friends have pictures made to make you cry
ive seen this and wondered what ive done to
calcify

chorus 1 corey taylor  chris fehn
i ignore you
as i close my eyes i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind we let it all slip away
i ignore you
as i close my eyes i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind we let it all slip away

verse 2 corey taylor
i cant stand to see your thalidomide robot face
i dont even try it
you had to be a liar just to infiltrate me
im still drowning

i come toward you
as i close my eyes i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind we let it all slip away
i ignore you
then i close my eyes i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind we let it all slip away

bridge corey taylor
take this away
take this away
i can feel you on my mouth
i can taste you on my fingers
i can hear you like the holy ghost
and kill you if you get too close

chorus 2 corey taylor  chris fehn
as i close my eyes i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind we let it all slip away
i ignore you
as i close my eyes i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind we let it all slip away
outro corey taylor
we let it all slip away
we let it all slip away
we let it all slip away
