heres the truth
i refuse to argue with you baby
cant tell you what to do
but im not some johnnycomelately
so theres the door you can walk right through
cause tonight i dont care about losing you

chorus
oh tonight i dont care about trying to make things right
im just not in the mood and im damn sure not gonna fight tonight
and if this is some kind of premonition
of how its gonna be with you
im out im done baby im through
cause tonight i dont care about you

verse 2
so there it is
thats all that needs to be said baby
i dont care about your friends
and what they seem to think that you need lately
if you dont want to believe me
i guess im every bit of the jerk that you say i am
but tonight i dont give a damn

chorus
cause tonight i dont care about trying to make things right
im just not in the mood and im damn sure not gonna fight tonight
and if this is some kind of premonition
of how its gonna be with you
im out im done baby im through
cause tonight i dont care about you

chorus
cause tonight i dont care about trying to make things right
im just not in the mood and im damn sure not gonna fight tonight
and if this is some kind of premonition
of how its gonna be with you
im out im done baby im through
cause tonight i dont care about you
