kick the dust up cmon

verse 1
all week long it’s a farmin’ town
they’re makin’ that money grow
tractors plows with flashing lights
backin’ up a two lane road
they take one last lap around
that sun up high goes down
and then its on come on
girl kick it on back
z71 like a cadillac

chorus
we go way out where
there ain’t nobody
we turn this cornfield
into a party
pedal to the floorboard
eight up in a four door
burnin’ up a back road song
park it and we pile out
baby watch your step now
better have your boots on
kick the dust up
back it on up
fill your cup up
let’s tear it up up
and kick the dust up kick the dust up

bar downtown they got a line
of people way out the door
10 dollar drinks it’s packed inside
i don’t know what they’re waitin for
got me a jar full of clear
and i got that music for your ears
and it’s like knock knock knock goes the diesel
if you really wanna see the beautiful people

chorus
we go way out where
there ain’t nobody
we turn this cornfield
into a party
pedal to the floorboard
eight up in a four door
burnin’ up a back road song
park it and we pile out
baby watch your step now
better have your boots on
kick the dust up
lets back it on up
fill your cup up
let’s tear it up up
and kick the dust up cmon
bridge
just follow me down ‘neath the 32 bridge
yall be glad you did kick it

chorus 2
we go way out where
there ain’t nobody
we turn this cornfield
into a party
pedal to the floorboard
eight up in a four door
burnin’ up a back road song
park it and we pile out
baby watch your step now
better have your boots on
kick the dust up
back it on up
fill your cup up
that’s what’s up up
let’s kick the dust up25embed"
