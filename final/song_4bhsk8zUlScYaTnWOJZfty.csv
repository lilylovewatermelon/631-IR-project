its such a tired game
will it ever stop
how will this all play out
of sight out of mind now

verse 1
by now we should know how to communicate
instead of coming to blows were on a roll
and there aint no stopping us now
were burning under control
isnt it strange how were all
burning under the same sun
buy now and save its a war for peace
its the same old game
but do we really want to play
we could close our eyes its still there
we could say its us against them
we could try but nobody wins
gravity has got a hold on us all

prechorus 1
could try to put it out
but its a growing flame
using fear as fuel
burning down our name
and it wont take too long
cause words all burn the same
and who were gonna blame now in all
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likechorus
its such a crying crying crying shame
its such a crying crying crying shame
its such a crying crying crying shame shame shame

verse 2
by now its beginning to show
a number of people are numbers that aint coming home
i could close my eyes its still there
close my mind be alone
i could close my heart and not care
but gravity has got a hold on us all
its a terrific price to pay
but in the true sense of the word
are we using what weve learned
in the true sense of the word
are we losing what we were

prechorus 2
its such a tired game
will it ever stop
its not for me to say
and is it in our blood
or is it just our fate
and how will this all play out
of sight out of mind
and who were gonna blame all in all
chorus
its just a crying crying crying shame
its such a crying crying crying shame
its such a crying crying crying shame shame shameembed"
