we were born the same day
we even think the same way
it couldnt be more right
we are what they call a perfect match
somethin that you cant touch
down to the last bone youre my baby

prechorus 1 jc
but too be honest theres just one thing
a part that is missin
you dont seem to care at all

dont you know that i cant breathe without you
tell me tell me just how
what am i suppose to do right now
why cant you love me
