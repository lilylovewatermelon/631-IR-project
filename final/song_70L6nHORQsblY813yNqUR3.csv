a sea of waves we hug the same plank
saw your end
just as id rehearsed over in my brain
saw your end

chorus
the waves suck you in and you drown
if like you should sink down beneath
ill swim down would you
you

verse 2
you hang the anchors over my neck
saw your end
i liked it at first but the more you laughed
the crazier i came

chorus
the waves suck you in then you drown
if like you should sink down beneath
ill swim down with you
is that what you want
you
is that what you want

chorus
if like you should sink down beneath
ill swim down
would you
is that what you want
would you
is that what you want
would you
you
