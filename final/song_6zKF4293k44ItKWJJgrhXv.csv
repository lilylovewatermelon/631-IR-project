i watched you walk away
hopeless with nothing to say
i strain my eyes
hoping to see you again

chorus
this is my curse the longing
this is my curse time
this is my curse the yearning
this is my curse
there is love burning to find you
will you wait for me
will you be there

roh

prechorus
your silence haunts me
but still i hunger for you

chorus
this is my curse the wanting
this is my curse time
this is my curse the healing
this is my curse
there is love burning to find you
will you wait for me

and still i want
and still i ache
but still i wait

verse 2
to see you again
dying inside these walls
dying inside these walls
and i see your face in these tears
in these tears
and i see your face

outro
there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love
there is love25embed"
