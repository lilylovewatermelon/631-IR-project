am i wrong for bein lost
the pressures of bein’ boss exhausted every bone in my body
i cant walk i dont talk i scream i don’t stop to think
im so close to the dream that i cant go to sleep
ironic i know so i need more chronic to roll
tryna find whats more important the money or my soul
its cold im low im caught between the roads
under the hollywood sign you get blinded by the glow uh
yo how could you look me in the face
you sat at the table with my daughter
promisin you got us right after you finished sayin’ grace
why don’t you tell her what youre hiding in the bank
it’s time to cut my lawn and see the snakes
its time to tell the truth to every fan who doesnt understand
that its because of you they had to wait
while you left me here to deal with all the hate
i still smile but feel so fake
it’s no sun the clouds are opaque
so much shade i read on one page
i cant even look at your name without gettin the shakes
what a mistake uh look how you take uh
what doesnt belong to you this was a rape
and if fate send us both to heaven
ima keep a blade in my leather so i can kill you at the gate uh

verse 2
i woke up sweatin tryna forget im in a mansion
cause fans are mad at my expansion
and my friend i thought was family
whod always understand me
got offended cause he jealous
we supposed to be at the grammys
im askin when did pride and passion
get mistaken for handouts and asskissin
the fact is i made it from trailer trash to saks fifth
took it from underground to massive and the come up was classic
back when white boys rapped they gettin they ass kicked
i was battlin puttin these rappers in caskets
i was walkin home gettin jumped after classes
tell me why dont my haters mention that shit
now my rent is due and im a tenant gettin by with no credit
got residue from a sedative i aint get from the medic
my schedule is so fuckin hectic but still im in debt
id be better off dead so life insurance keep my family fed
its because of yall i couldnt separate from my career
cause of yall i hated myself for so many years
cause of you you aint never gonna see me trust
even if i got a wife she just somebody i fuck
chorus
