ill keep holdin you down holdin you down
even though youre not around youre not around

ive tried to get under it
stuck in between it is what it is is what it is

verse 1 ty dolla ign
til it aint
things will never be the same
never be the same again
everything so strange strange
it aint a game no more a game no more woah
we were just gettin lifted
yesterday yesterday
now we just reminiscin
on yesterday yesterday
keep my head above water head above water
my eyes gettin bigger eyes gettin bigger the world gettin smaller
i been gettin richer only made me crazy crazy
mama said im different oh yeah since i was a baby baby

verse 2 lil b
my emotions
gimme a sip of that potion
no my heart is not broken
but i feel like its open
please somebody do surgery
tell the doctor come work with me
i keep lookin at my soul
prayin but only god knows
and ive been workin nine to nine
yeah
but they talk about it
but you know its all fine all fine
but who can say that
i would be the man of your dreams
i will do all that i can
and be all i can be
