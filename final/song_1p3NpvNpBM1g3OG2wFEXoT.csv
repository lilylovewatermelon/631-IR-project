the milky ways shining high up above
when you grow up you will learn all that stuff
but for now close your eyes
close your eyes

sleep little baby try not to squawk
tomorrow and tomorrow youll learn how to walk
to love and laugh to make toast and talk
but for now beddybyes

your blankets handknitted with pure angora wool
your nappy is dry and your tummy is full
of enough antihistamine to chill out a bull
yet still all this gringing

what more could you want for i just cannot guess
you constantly complain to me you should feel blessed
there are children in africa starving to death
and you dont hear them whinging

what more can i do to put a stop to
this mindnumbing noise you are making
where is the line between patting and hitting
when is rocking rocking and when is it shaking
you might also likei dont know what else i can do to try to hush you
my heart says i love you but my brains thinking fuck you
and hoping a child trafficker will abduct you
at least then ill get a few hours in bed

ive shushed and ive cooed and ive even try to sing
obladi oblada in the exact voice of ringo
now all i have left is to hope that a dingo
will sneak in and rip off your fat bitching head
hush little baby dont say a word
papas gonna buy you a mockingbird
in the hope you get avian flu
the nice folk in ae will take care of you

thats it close your eyes shhh not a sound
i can barely see your tiny belly moving up and down
one thing they dont mention in the parenting books
your love for them grows the closer to dead they look1embed"
