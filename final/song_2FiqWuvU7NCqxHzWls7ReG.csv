hush my little one
you must be exhausted

sung
sleep my little kovu
let your dreams take wing
one day when youre big and strong
you will be a king

ive been exiled persecuted
left alone with no defense
when i think of what that brute did
i get a little tense

but i dream a dream so pretty
that i dont feel so depressed
cause it soothes my inner kitty
and it helps me get some rest

the sound of simbas dying gasp
his daughter squealing in my grasp
his lionesses mournful cry
thats my lullaby

now the past ive tried forgetting
and my foes i could forgive
trouble is i know its petty
but i hate to let them live
you might also likenuka
so you found yourself somebody
wholl chase simba up a tree

zira
oh the battle may be bloody
but that kind of works for me

the melody of angry growls
a counterpoint of painful howls
a symphony of death oh my
thats my lullaby

scar is gone but ziras still around
to love this little lad
til he learns to be a killer
with a lust for being bad

nuka
sleep ya little termite
uh—i mean precious little thing

vitani
one day when youre big and strong

zira
you will be a king
the pounding of the drums of war
the thrill of kovus mighty roar
nuka
the joy of vengeance

vitani
testify

zira
i can hear the cheering

nuka  vitani
kovu what a guy

zira
payback time is nearing
and then our flag will fly
against a bloodred sky
thats my lullaby1embed"
