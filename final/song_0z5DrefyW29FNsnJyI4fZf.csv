i went to bed i was thinking about you
aint the same since im living without you
all the memories are getting colder
all the things i dont wanna do over
i went to bed i was thinking about you
i want to talk and laugh like we used to
when i see you in my dreams at night
its so real but its in my mind

prechorus
and now
i guess
this is as good as it gets

chorus
dont wake me
cause i dont wanna leave this dream
dont wake me
cause i never seem to stay asleep enough
when its you im dreaming of
i dont wanna wake up

verse 2
i went to bed i was thinking about you
and how it felt when i finally found you
its like a movie playing over in my head
dont wanna look cause i know how it ends
all the words that i said that i wouldnt say
all the promises i made that i wouldnt break
its last call last song last dance
cause i cant get you back cant get a second chance
see skillet liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeprechorus
and now
i guess
this is as good as it gets

chorus
dont wake me
cause i dont wanna leave this dream
dont wake me
cause i never seem to stay asleep enough
when its you im dreaming of
i dont wanna wake up
dont wake me
were together just you and me
dont wake me
cause were happy like we used to be
i know
ive gotta let you go
but i dont wanna be alone

bridge
these dreams of you keep on growing stronger
it aint a lot but its all i have
nothing to do but keep sleeping longer
dont want to stop cause i want you back
breakdown
dont wake me
cause i dont wanna leave this dream
dont wake me

chorus
cause i never seem to stay asleep enough
when its you im dreaming of
i dont wanna wake up
dont wake me
were together just you and me
dont wake me
cause were happy like we used to be
i know
i gotta let you go
but i dont wanna be alone
dont wake me
i went to bed i was thinking about you cause i dont wanna leave this dream
it ain’t the same since i’m living without you dont wake me
cause i never seem to stay asleep
i know
ive gotta let you go
