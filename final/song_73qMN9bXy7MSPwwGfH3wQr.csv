long handwritten notes deep in your pocket
words how little they mean when youre a little too late
i stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
good girls hopeful theyll be and long they will wait

chorus
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair

verse 2
in dreams i meet you in warm conversation
and we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
and time is taking its sweet time erasing you
and youve got your demons and darlin they all look like me

chorus
cause wе had a beautiful magic love therе
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair

postchorus
woah woah woah oh
