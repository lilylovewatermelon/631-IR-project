im a puzzle
im a walking contradiction
in far from mint condition
cause theres pieces i cant find
sometimes trouble
a can of coke a day addiction
with set in stone convictions
and an open bottom line

prechorus
im an easy read but i aint no open book
got a knack for making things harder than they look

chorus
im a straight shootin
beer drinkin rule breakin
dont think i wont take a good thing too far
im a midnightin backslidin
getaway car drivin
runnin away with your heart
i guess be careful what you wish for is all i meant when i said
what you see is what you get

verse 2
at least im honest
i dont spin it like a record
and i aint acting like im better
than you know i really am
yeah youre dead on it
you got me figured ill admit it
set in my ways hardheaded
but hell i do the best i can

im a straight shootin
beer drinkin rule breakin
dont think i wont take a good thing too far
im a midnightin backslidin
getaway car drivin
runnin away with your heart
i guess be careful what you wish for is all i meant when i said
what you see is what you get

bridge
with me aint no tricks up these sleeves
an acquired taste a constant work in progress

chorus
im a straight shootin
beer drinkin rule breakin
dont think i wont take a good thing too far
im a midnightin backslidin
getaway car drivin
runnin away with your heart
i guess be careful what you wish for is all i meant when i said
what you see is what you get
what you see is what you getembed"
