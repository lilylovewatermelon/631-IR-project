and i didnt know too much
narrowed my eyes tried to cut through lies
i was losing touch

darlin’ i didnt know nothing
hit like a head full of wine
came like a curse i was down in the first
you didnt use your ride

oh my you just gotta take a piece of me
try to tease out the other side
cause darlin’ i just see youve been so sweet to me
ive been waiting on the day all night
would it kill you for some peace of mind
would you take me and not look back
good gracious youre a heart attack

we were something like a movie
but she was more of a show
spread roots wide in the back of my eyes
and she never let it slow

i had my hand full of aces
ran her fingers down the back of my neck
i stepped back when she laid down that jack
i was losing breath
see wild rivers liveget tickets as low as 103you might also likeoh my you just gotta take a piece of me
try to tease out the other side
cause darlin’ i just see youve been so sweet to me
ive been waiting on the day all night
would it kill you for some peace of mind
would you take me and not look back
good gracious youre a heart attackembed"
