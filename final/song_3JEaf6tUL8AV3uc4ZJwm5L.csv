i feel it you feel it
that this was meant to be
i know it you know it
that you were made for me
we cant deny this any longer
day by day its getting stronger
i want it you want it
its what the people wanna see
were like romeo and juliet
families cant divide us
like the tallest mountain or the widest sea
nothings big enough to hide us

prechorus
when we make love its overwhelming
i just touch the heavens
youre an angel youre an angel

chorus
i said this world this world
could leave us any day
but my love for you it will never go away
and i dont wanna go to sleep
cause you are like a dream
for every night i say a prayer
and i swear you are the answer
youre an angel youre an angel youre an angel

so i hold it and you hold it
the promise of tomorrow
