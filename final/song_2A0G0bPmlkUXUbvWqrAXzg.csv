verse 1
she got that wap and the way that she use it saliva with top and she come with a mop
i need to stop been out here rockin the game with these features its over for niggas as soon as i drop
she lookin for love but my hearts away in the box she trippin i changed the locks
never tell nobody you seen me by myself out and about it was me and the glock
sun up to sundown aint nothin else to do but get money so fuck it im workin the block
ap a cool quartermillion im sorry this watch and i come from me punchin no clock
build up some paper got my number in motion and got me a spot and start workin my flock
why you keep textin me wyd and wya you givin off cop
i told lil bro if he cant get a knife get a lock and a sock and just work what you got
i know for sure where she went shell go i aint cuffin these hoes like we swappin em out
we really spin shit i really did shit i cant talk about cause im not for the clout
