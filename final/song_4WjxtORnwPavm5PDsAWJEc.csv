pull the plug in september
i dont wanna die in june
i’d like to start planning my funeral
ive got work to do mmm
pull the plug make it painless
i dont want a violent end
don’t say that youll always love me
cause you know id bleed myself dry for you
over and over again

chorus
doomsday is close at hand
ill book the marching band
to play as you speak
ill feel like throwin up
youll sit and stare
like a goddamn machine
i’d like to plan out my part in this
but you’re such a narcissist
youll probably do it next week
i don’t get a choice in the matter
why would i its only the death of me
only the death of me

bridge
the death of me was so quiet
no friends and family allowed
only my murderer you and the priest
who told you to go to hell
and the funny thing is i wouldve married you
if youd have stuck around
i feel more free than i have in years
six feet in the ground

but youre such a narcissist
that you did it on halloween
i had no choice in the matter
why would i its only the death of me3embed"
