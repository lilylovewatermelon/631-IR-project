careless in our summer clothes splashing around
in the muck and the mire
careless in our summer clothes splashing around
in the muck and the mire

bridge
fell asleep with stains
caked deep in the knees
what a pain

chorus
now hang me up to dry
you wrung me out
too too too many times
now hang me up to dry
im pearly like the white
the whites of your eyes

verse 2
all mixed up in the wash
hot water bleeding our colors
all mixed up in the wash
hot water bleeding our colors

chorus
now hang me up to dry
you wrung me out
too too too many times
now hang me up to dry
im pearly like the white
the whites of your eyes

the whites of your eyes
