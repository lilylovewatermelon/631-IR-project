clicks clicks clicks theyll do anything to get a few
tick tick tick thats the sound before my head explodes
quit quit quit look at you up on your pedestals
quick quick quick here the critics come its time to go
i read your article it kinda hurt me
i dont know who hired you or what your friends say in your circle
but the fact that you released it tells me two things are for certain
they get paid for trashin people i get paid cause i stay workin yeah
dropped the search and they emerge up outta nowhere to the surface
just to peek behind the curtain throwin salt at all my burdens
im aware i shouldnt give this my attention lifes a journey
i should just stay on my path and learn to laugh you think they heard me
ears are burning put em out quiet quiet look around
why dont they find someone way more interesting to write about
us were kinda boring arent we all we do is whine and pout
its confusing so amusing how i argue with myself
hello
i spit it with ease so leave it to me
you doubt it but you better believe
im on a rampage hit em with the record release
depend on the week im prolly gonna have to achieve
another goal let me go when im over the beat
i go into beast mode like im ready to feast
im fed up with these thieves tryna get me to bleed
they wanna see me take an l yep see what i mean
how many records i gotta give you to get with the program
taken for granted im bout to give you the whole plan
open your mind up and take a look at the blueprint
debate if you gotta but gotta hold it with both hands
to pick up the bars you gotta be smart
you really gotta dig in your heart
if you wanna get to the root of an issue
pursuin the mental can be dark and be difficult
but the pay off at the end of it can help you to get through it ayy

verse 2
its time to get back in the swing of things
when my life crashes im not the guy thatll flee the scene
ill take ownership and own it and raise my hand if its me
just remember though im only a man im a human being
dont they see shoot the breeze id rather just stay discrete
people claim theyre in your corner but leave you in times of need
they dont listen do they what they dont listen to anything
ill accept advice if its not presented ignorantly
look costs are high they multiply
then cause divides im forced to fight
the poison i been sippin on has quite the bite it killed me twice
they rigged the lights so yall can see
the parts of mine that arent so bright
see often i apologize then authorize the awful times
to pop up nate like im right behind you
id advise you not to try to climb inside the mind like i do
keep the rhyme book expedite it overnight it
hold it tight and hope that time is on my side
cause if its not then ill decide to override my own demise
i toe the line too close and i could improvise
id empathize but recognize
the fact that i could jeopardize and wreck our lives
you better give me your attention the undivided
chorus
paid my dues made it through woo woo woo
