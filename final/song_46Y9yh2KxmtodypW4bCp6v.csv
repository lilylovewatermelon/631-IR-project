calling tears from deep inside oh youre so exquisite
and in the mirror all midnight eyes
oh if i could remain but its just a visit
all midnight eyes read vacancy

twisted twisting

verse 2
to the lovely dancing lights i begged may i cut in
but they never stopped playing their song
of a joyous song they sing ive heard whispers
on a freezing note i resonate

prechorus
just like romantic verses just like a joyous end
just like a memory it twists me
just like romantic verses just like a joyous end
twist twisting me

chorus
you land as lightly as the new snow cinematic
on to the melting boy and melt away
you light as gently youre so cinematic
bathed in your radiance i melt

in the glitter in the dark sunk into velvet
praying this will never end
in the shadow of a star in static pallor
i realized i never began

prechorus
just like romantic verses just like a joyous end
just like a memory it twists me
just like romantic verses just like a joyous end
twist twisting me

chorus
you land as lightly as the new snow cinematic
on to the melting boy and melt away
you light as gently youre so cinematic
bathed in your radiance i melt

all the colors upon leaving all will turn to grey
all the colors upon leaving all will turn to grey
all grey all the colors all grey upon leaving
all grey all will turn to grey
all grey all the colors all grey upon leaving
all grey all will turn to grey grey
twisting me
chorus
you land as lightly as the new snow cinematic
on to the melting boy and melt away
you light as gently youre so cinematic
bathed in your radiance

outro
you land as lightly as the new snow cinematic
you land as lightly as the new snow and melt away
you land as lightly as the new snow cinematic
bathed in your radiance i melt1embed"
