the rest is empty with no brain but the clever nerd
the best mc with no chain ya ever heard
take it from the tec9 holder
theyve bit but dont know their neck shine from shinola
everything that glitters aint fishscale
lemme think dont let her faint get ishmael
a shot of jack got her back its not an act stack
forgot about the cackalack holla back clackclack blocka
villainy feel him in ya heart chakra charttoppa
startshit stoppa be a smart shoppa
shotacop day around the way bout to stay
but whod a know theres two mo that wonder where the shooter go
bout to jet get him not a bet dead em
let em spit the venom said em got a lot of shit with em
let the rhythm hit em its stronger in the other voice
we makes the joints that make em spread em butta moist
man please the stage is made of panties
from the age of baby hoochies on to the grannies
ban me the dough rake daddy
the flow make her fatty shake patty cake patty cake
for fake if he was anita bakers man
hed take her for her masters hit it once an shake her hand
on some ol thank ya maam an ghost her
she could mind the toaster if she sign the poster
a whole host of roller coaster riders
not enough tracks is it
hot enough black for ya
its too hot to handle you got blue sandals
who shot ya ooh got you new spots to vandal
do not stand still boast yo skills
close but no krills toast for po nils post no bills
coast to coast joe shmoes flows ill go chill
not supposed to overdose nodoz pills
off pride tykes talk wide through scar meat
off sides like how worf rides with starfleet
told ya on some getrich shit
as he gets older he gets colder than a witch tit
this is it make no mistakes
where my nigga go
figaro figaro
os beats and my rhymes attack
a scary act all black like ms mary mack
wait til you see em live on the piano
doom sings soprano like una duociano
my momma told me
blast em and pass her her glass of ol e
not to be troublesome
but i could sure use a quick shot of double rum
no stick of bubble gum
i like ice cream we could skip the weddin
have a nice dream she only let him stick the head inyou might also like108embed"
