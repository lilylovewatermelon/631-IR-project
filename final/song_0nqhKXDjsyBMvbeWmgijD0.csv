yeah i kinda put the cup down for a minute but umm
but honestly it aint nobodys business whats in my cup whats in your cup whats in they cup
its your cup drink it
so whatever the hell was in my cup the only reaction i did was got more popular more successful
than a lot more things that ive ever done i probably should pick that cup back up haha

verse 1
im sittin here lookin at keisha like do you love me do you love me not
damn you hit the spot
taste like candy candy sweet like fruit ooh
wet like water can i love on you
withdrawals im feelin different every day i need a dose
every now and thеn im missin i got my times when i go ghost
but she minе hmm hmm hmm hmm im stampin her
priority status so them other bitches mad at her too mad ha
thumbin through a hunnid thou i spent that times two on you
caught myself cuttin you loose then i pop back up like peekaboo
here i go flyer than most louis v coat
gas station coffee cup full i dont drive boats no
money cant buy happiness but she found love inside a g
head and somethin to eat thats all a thug nigga need
no lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
im displayin my feelings like im wearing em on my sleeve see

prechorus
one minute im done with you the next one i be runnin back
go your way i go my way but somehow we be still attached
tryna find my answers with this cup but aint no truth in that
they be like im dumb for fuckin with you i spend stupid racks

sippin chaser with my reefer cant get my mind off wockesha
watch me put my heart in this cup
in my feelings she my therapist ima talk to this cup i swear

verse 2

im too fucked up i paid four hunnid for a zone that strong
my bitch dont like you youve been fuckin up my home in my house
relapsin every time i try to leave you lone i relapse girl
every nigga in the street lookin for her but she rare
dark skin purple hair stingy with her hard to share i cant
never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody that somebody
drop you and pick you up whenever i feel like it

prechorus

go your way i go my way but somehow we be still attached
tryna find my answers with this cup but aint no truth in that
they be like im dumb for fuckin with you i spend stupid racks
chorus
im sittin here knowing i dont need ya pouring os in the liter
sippin chaser with my reefer cant get my mind off wockesha

in my feelings she my therapist ima talk to this cup i swear
