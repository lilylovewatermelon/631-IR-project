nuvoletta in her lightdress spunn of sisteen shimmers was looking down on them leaning over the bannistars and listening all she childishly could how she was brightened when shouldrups in his glaubering hochskied his welkinstuck and how she was overclused when kneesknobs on his zwivvel was makeacting such a paulse of himshelp she was alone all her nubied companions were asleeping with the squirrels their mivver mrs moonan was off in the fuerst quarter scrubbing the backsteps of number 28 fuvver that skand he was up in norwood’s sokaparlour eating oceans of voking’s blemish nuvoletta listened as she reflected herself though the heavenly one with his constellatria and his emanations stood between and she tried all she tried to make the mookse look up at her but he was fore too adiaptotously farseeing and to make the gripes hear how coy she could be though he was much too schystimatically auricular about his ens to heed her but it was all mild’s vapour moist not even her feignt reflection nuvoluccia could they toke their gnoses off for their minds with intrepifide fate and bungless curiasity were conclaved with heliogobbleus and commodus and enobarbarus and whatever the coordinal dickens they did as their damprauch of papyrs and buchstubs said as if that was their spiration as if theirs could duiparate her queendim as if she would be third perty to search on search proceedings she tried all the winsome wonsome ways her four winds had taught her she tossed her sfumastelliacinous hair like le princesse de la petite bretagne and she rounded her mignons arms like mrs cornwallis–west and she smiled over herself like the beauty of the image of the pose of the daughter of the queen of the emperour of irelande and she sighed after herself as were she born to bride with tristis tristior tristissimus but sweet madonine she might fair as well have carried her daisy’s worth to florida for the mookse a dogmad accanite were not amoosed and the gripes a dubliboused catalick wis pinefully obliviscent

i see she sighed there are menner

the siss of the whisp of the sigh of the softzing at the stir of the ver grose o arundo of a long one in midias reeds and shades began to glidder along the banks greepsing greepsing duusk unto duusk and it was as glooming as gloaming could be in the waste of all peacable worlds metamnisia was allsoonome coloroform brune citherior spiane an eaulande innemorous and un numerose the mookse had a sound eyes right but he could not all hear the gripes had light ears left yet he could but ill see he ceased and he ceased tung and trit and it was neversoever so dusk of both of them but still moo thought on the deeps of the undths he would profoundth come the morrokse and still gri feeled of the scripes he would escipe if by grice he had luck enoupes

oh how it was duusk from vallee maraia to grasyaplaina dormimust echo ah dew ah dew it was so duusk that the tears of night began to fall first by ones and twos then by threes and fours at last by fives and sixes of sevens for the tired ones were wecking as we weep now with them o o o par la pluie

then there came down to the thither bank a woman of no appearance i believe she was a black with chills at her feet and she gathered up his hoariness the mookse motamourfully where he was spread and carried him away to her invisible dwelling thats hights aquila rapax for he was the holy sacred solem and poshup spit of her boshop’s apron so you see the mookse he had reason as i knew and you knew and he knew all along and there came down to the hither bank a woman to all important though they say that she was comely spite the cold in her heed and for he was as like it as blow it to a hawker’s hank she plucked down the gripes torn panicky autotone in angeu from his limb and cariad away its beotitubes with her to her unseen shieling it is de rore coeli and so the poor gripes got wrong for that is always how a gripes is always was and always willbe and it was never so thoughtful of either of them and there were left now an only elmtree and but a stone polled with pietrous sierre but saule o yes and nuvoletta a lass

then nuvoletta reflected for the last time in her little long life and she made up all her myriads of drifting minds in one she cancelled all her engauzements she climbed over the bannistars she gave a childy cloudy cry nu‚e nu‚e a lightdress fluttered she was gone and into the river that had been a stream for a thousand of tears had gone eon her and come on her and she was stout and struck on dancing and her muddied name was missisliffi there fell a tear a singult tear the loveliest of all tears i mean for those crylove fables fans who are ‘keen’ on the prettypretty commonface sort of thing you meet by hopeharrods for it was a leaptear but the river tripped on her by and by lapping as though her heart was brook why why why weh o weh i’se so silly to be flowing but i no canna stay

now while i am not out now to be taken up as unintentionally recommending the silkebjorg tyrondynamon machine for the more economical helixtrolysis of these amboadipates until i can find space to look into it myself a little more closely first i shall go on with my decisions after having shown to you in good time how both products of our social stomach the excellent dr burroman i noticed by the way from his emended food theory has been carefully digesting the very wholesome criticism i helped him to in my princeps edition which is all so munch to the cud are mutuearly polarised the incompatabilily of any delusional acting as ambivalent to the fixation of his pivotism positing as above too males pooles the one the pictor of the other and the omber the skotia of the one and looking wantingly around our undistributed middle between males we feel we must waistfully woent a female to focus and on this stage there pleasantly appears the cowrymaid m whom we shall often meet below who introduces herself upon us at some precise hour which we shall again agree to call absolute zero or the babbling pumpt of platinism and so like that former son of a kish who went up and out to found his farmer’s ashes we come down home gently on our own turnedabout asses to meet margareen

we now romp through a period of pure lyricism of shamebred music technologically let me say the appetising entry of this subject on a fool chest of vialds is plumply pudding the carp before doevre hors evidenced by such words in distress as i cream for thee sweet margareen and the more hopeful o margareena o margareena still in the bowl is left a lump of gold correspondents by the way will keep on asking me what is the correct garnish to serve drisheens with tansy sauce enough the pawnbreaking pathos of the first of these shoddy pieces reveals it as a caseous effort burrus’s bit is often used for a toast criniculture can tell us very precisely indeed how and why this particular streak of yellow silver first appeared on not in the bowel that is to see the human head bald black bronze brown brindled betteraved or blanchemanged where it might be usefully compared with an earwig on a fullbottom i am offering this to signorina cuticura and i intend to take it up and bring it under the nosetice of herr harlene by way of diverting his attentions of course the unskilled singer continues to pervert our wiser ears by subordinating the spaceelement that is to sing the aria to the timefactor which ought to be killed ill tempor i should advise any unborn singer who may still be among my heeders to forget her temporal diaphragm at home the best thing that could happen to it and attack the roulade with a swift colpo di glottide to the lug though maace i will insist was reclined from overdoing this his recovery often being slow and then o on the third dead beat o to cluse her eyes and aiopen her oath and see what spice i may send her how cease thee cantatrickee i fain would be solo arouse thee my valour and save for e’er my true bdur

i shall have a word to say in a few yards about the acoustic and orchidectural management of the tonehall but as ours is a vivarious where one plant’s breaf is a lunger planner’s byscent and you may not care for argon it will be very convenient for me for the emolument to pursue burrus and caseous for a rung or two up their isocelating biangle every admirer has seen my goulache of marge she is so like the sister you don’t know and they both dress a l i k e which i titled the very picture of a needlesswoman which in the presence ornates our national cruetstand this genre of portraiture of changes of mind in order to be truly torse should evoke the bush soul of females so i am leaving it to the experienced victim to complete the general suggestion by the mental addition of a wallopy bound or should the zulugical zealot prefer it a congorool teal the hatboxes which composed rhomba lady trabezond marge in her excelsis also comprised the climactogram up which b and c may fondly be imagined ascending and are suggestive of gentlemen’s spring modes these modes carrying us back to the superimposed claylayers of eocene and pleastoseen formation and the gradual morphological changes in our body politic which professor ebahi–ahuri of philadespoinis ill — whose bluebutterbust i have just given his coupe de grass to — neatly names a boœte … surprises the boxes if i may break the subject gently are worth about fourpence pourbox but i am inventing a more patent process foolproof and pryperfect i should like to ask that shedlock homes person who is out for removing the roofs of our criminal classics by what deductio ad domunum he hopes de tacto to detect anything unless he happens of himself movibile tectu to have a slade off after which they can be reduced to a fragment of their true crust by even the youngest of margees if she will take plase to be seated and smile if i please

now there can be no question about it either that i having done as much have quite got the size of that demilitery young female we will continue to call her marge whose types may be met with in any public garden wearing a very “dressy” affair known as an “ethel” of instep length and with a real fur reduced to 39 and muffin cap to tone they are “angelskin” this fall ostentatiously hemming apologetically over the shirtness of some “sweet” garment when she is not sitting on all the free benches avidously reading about “it” but ovidently on the look out for “him” or so “thrilled” about the best dressed dolly pram and beautiful elbow competition or at the movies swallowing sobs and blowing bixed mixcuits over “childe” chaplain’s “latest” or on the verge of the gutter with some bobbedhair brieffrocked babyma’s toddler the smythe–smythes now keep two domestics and aspire to three male ones a shover a butlegger and a sectary held hostage at armslength teaching his infant majesty how to make waters worse

i am closely watching master pules as i have regions to suspect from my post that her “litde man” is a secondary school — teacher under the boards of education a voted disciple of infan — tulus who is being utilised thus publicly by the seducente infanta to conceal her own more mascular personality by flaunting frivolish finery over men’s inside clothes for the femininny of that totamulier will always lack the musculink of a verumvirum my solotions for the proper parturience of matres and the education of micturious mites must stand over from the moment till i tackle this tickler hussy for occupying my uttentions

margareena she’s very fond of burrus but alick and alack she velly fond of chee the important influence exercised on everything by this eastasian import has not been till now fully flavoured though we can comfortably taste it in this case i shall come back for a little more say farther on a cleopatrician in her own right she at once complicates the position while burrus and caseous are contending for her misstery by implicating her self with an elusive antonius a wop who would appear to hug a personal interest in refined chees of all chades at the same time as he wags an antomine art of being rude like the boor this antonius–burruscaseous grouptriad may be said to equate the qualis equivalent with the older socalled talis on talis one just as quantly as in the hyperchemical economantarchy the tantum ergons irruminate the quantum urge so that eggs is to whey as whay is to zeed like your golfchild’s abe boob caddy and this is why any simple philadolphus of a fool you like to dress an athemisthued lowtownian exlegged phatrisight may be awfully green to one side of him and fruitfully blue on the other which will not screen him however from appealing to my gropesarching eyes through the strongholes of my acropoll as a boosted blasted bleating blatant bloaten blasphorus blesphorous idiot who kennot tail a bomb from a painapple when he steals one and wannot psing his psalmen with the cong in our gregational pompoms with the canting crew
