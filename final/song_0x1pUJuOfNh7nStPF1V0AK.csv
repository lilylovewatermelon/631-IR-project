dahlias they come from me
a promise to get well
that aint workin thinkin that youre no good
dont worry cause im not the kind to kiss and tell
no dahlias and cherry trees
i dont recall them anyway
some lovers know it aint gonna wear out
to each his own the same look what you wasted

chorus
when the lights are cutting out
and i come down in your room
our daily compromise
it is written in your signed armistice
and when the lights are cutting out
and i come down in your room
well well decide as always
here is your signed armistice

verse 2
its time to follow and not to heat it up
requesting this plane is a propeller
in the middle of the course when ambitions are low
head on close hang on before you lose control
the octagon logo had to rip it up
the semaphore message on your lips
some lovers know it aint gonna wear out
to each his own the same one of us is wasted
see phoenix liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus
when the lights are cutting out
and i come down in your room
our daily compromise
it is written in your signed armistice
and when the lights are cutting out
and i come down in your room
well well decide as always
here is your signed armistice

outro
for lovers in a rush for lovers always
foreign lovers in a rush keeping promises
for lovers in a rush for lovers always
for lovers in a rush for lovers always
foreign lovers in a rush keeping promises
for lovers in a rush for lovers always6embed"
