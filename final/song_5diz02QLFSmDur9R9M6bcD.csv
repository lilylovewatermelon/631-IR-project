you ask me to help you
how can i when youve kidnapped and stolen
for all i know even murdered
by nightfall we will have left your earth
you will not see us until it is time
time for what
uicideboy bitch uicideboy bitch

verse 1 ruby da archangel
when i die auction off all my body parts
lets see what oddy costs under my skull the shottys cross
got all these opps on my dick like its made of metal
makin so much money its like my boss is the devil
she loves me she loves me not i done ran out of petals
littered the ground with rose bits ill grip this thorny stem forever
a portrait of my pain an homage to my suffering
same tale i been uncovering
im staining the world grey yall get back to coloring

verse 2 half cig
slickityslickity sloth thug bach
shoot up the mass it will b minor
jabbin my arm no pfizer
dick cuffed like it cum with priors
liars all around me talkin hugs and love
attaching kisses that come with wishes for death
so they can touch my trust
fuck thats some hard motherfuckin truth
still contemplatin suicide just upgraded a couple coupes
morally bankrupt call the skank up to pretend she love me
but i do love you
ho dont talk while you fuckin suckin
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeinterlude ruby da archangel  half cig
uh should we i that was a little short bruh
well fuck bro
can we can we
i just did eight bars cause i thought you said all you had to say
yeah i got more shit to say bro like
well i mean
what tell me
they sayin you lost touch

verse 3 ruby da archangel
who the fuck say ruby done lost his touch
blame my success on lots of luck
but lots of luck didnt get your bitch unfucked
blame my absence on the fact that my dick got stuck
call me evergreen your bitch never seemed like she lost touch
beggin me she wants her jaw fucked
withdraw from dope before i withdraw my cash
use her tongue to collect ash for the stash i guess ill smash
pull off in the gle wagon fucked up i might crash
just thoughts and feelings from the half of me that is white trash

verse 4 half cig
bitch i cheated death aint nothin that i cant do
manipulation shawty i could sell ice to nanook
i could sell ice to the jeweler i could sell christ like im judas
selfrighteous type of shooter make my life insurance shoot up
wet screwed up product of my environment
my therapist was talkin freud i rolled my eyes then fired the bitch
why would i quit my drug of choice is overdosin duh
my dick got no limits im master p pimpin
and makin them bitches say ugh
outro ruby da archangel
you would be horrified at the sight of us
rain rain go away
two hundred on the dash watch me hydroplane
gang gang gangs all grey
from new orleans to ottawa from atlanta to the bay15embed"
