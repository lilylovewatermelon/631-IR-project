i like you when when you take off your face
put away all your teeth
and take us way underneath
because you could die if you take it alone

chorus
i watch you taste it
i see your face
i know im alive
youre shooting stars
from the barrel of your eyes
and it drives me crazy
just drives me wild

verse 2
i kind of like you when when you make up the reel
take the phone in your room
stop the tape or resume
well you could try if you think it will load

chorus
i watch you taste it
i see your face
i know im alive
youre shooting stars
from the barrel of your eyes
and it drives me crazy
just drives me wild
you might also likebridge
every time every time you drive me wild
its a beautiful ride
why its a beautiful ride

chorus
i watch you taste it
i see your face
i know im alive
youre shooting stars
from the barrel of your eyes
and it drives me crazy
just drives me wild8embed"
