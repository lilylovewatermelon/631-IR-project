and ive got only im imagining is  this source 
i could not speak my own voice
and there was no soul  to listen 

i would not even face the sun
i could not even worship the light
i was born to not be me
i was born without belief

i always thought the earth would swallow me in
and nobody would notice me
its a lost time to live
its so bright theres darkness inside

were making tunnels
every sin to a sword 
into a place where i might find
a more soothing eternity

let mе into your light
if you have made it yourself or artificially
show mе the code to your padlock
your secret is safe with me

please understand i was meant to be
the one to spore  the body
i was born to cry out that my appeal untrue 
not exist under star darknessyou might also likeembed"
