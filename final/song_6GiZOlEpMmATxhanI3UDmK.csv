motorcycles in the parking lot
revving their engines and it just wont stop
matches the noise screaming in my head
houston i think we got a problem
where does everybody go when they go
they go so fast i dont think they know
we hate so fast and we love too slow
london i think we got a problem
and when i think about it
i just cant think about it
i try to drink about it
i keep spinning

chorus
ave mary a
where did you go where did you go
how did you know to get out of a world gone mad
help me let go
of the chaos around me
the devil that hounds me
i need you to tell me
child be still
child be still

verse 2
broken hearts all around the spot
i cant help thinking that we lost the plot
suicide bomber and a student shot
tokyo i think we got a problem
but for that theyve got a pill
if that dont kill you then the side effects will
if we dont kill each other then the side effects will
cape town i think we got a problem

where did you go where did you go
how did you know to get out of a world gone mad

if the darkest hour comes
before the light
where is the light
where is the light
if the darkest hour comes
before the light
where is the light
