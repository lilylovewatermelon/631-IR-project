if you say im alive i guess im living
why should i exercise a choice ive been given
tell me everythings fine and peace is coming
i wont listen to the heartache im numbing

prechorus
when the world casts me down and says ive changed
ill survive on all the promises you made to me
guess theres no one to blame
when all youre living on is bread of shame

chorus
bread of shame
when the world says ive changed
bread of shame
just promise me fame ill survive on the bread of shame

verse 2
as long as you say im free
then keep these chains on me
tell me down is up
ill let you fill this broken cup
when the walls fall down
let them fall on me
cause no ones around who believes me
