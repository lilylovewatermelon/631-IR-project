you call me up its like a broken record
saying that your heart hurts
that youll never get over him gettin over you
and you end up crying and i end up lying
cause im just a sucker for anything that you do

prechorus luke  michael luke
and when the phone call finally ends
you say thanks for bein a friend
am i goin in circles again and again

chorus all
i dedicate this song to you
the one who never sees the truth
that i could take away your hurt
heartbreak girl
hold you tight straight through the daylight
im right here when you gonna realise
that im your cure
heartbreak girl

verse 2 calum calum  luke
i bite my tongue but i wanna scream out
you could be with me now
but i end up tellin you what you wanna hear
but youre not ready and its so frustrating
he treats you so bad and im so good to you its not fair

and youll finally forget the day you met him
