with this ink in our skin weve sealed our fate
and the axe comes early only naturally
so what does that matter
theres a bed of skeletons waiting for me on the other side
theyre waiting for my next move next fatal breath
human lives to me seem so unreal cant see through the fog
nothing past a grey wall see past the stereotype
belief structure built up in you
ill tear you down and the one who created you

verse 2
if they didnt have one how would they act
if we didnt have hope how would we behave
would they still feel remorse if they slaughtered innocent beings
or is hope the only thing that keeps you sane

chorus 1
a good friend once told me you are our memory
without them we equal nothing
and all i can see is the place i want to be
suddenly my life was so free
leaves at my feet blown to the ground
their echoes are reaching my ears
nights coming fast suns going down
but keep away from me

keep away from me
its hard to keep me in this place
keep away from me
keep away from me keep away from me
keep away from me
we may have created the beginning mentally
we may have created the beginning physically
to the end of our human existence

i see through you
the fear thats in your eyes

chorus 2
a good friend once told me we are our memory
without them we equal nothing
all i can see is the place i want to be
timeless my life was so free
leaves at my feet blown to the ground
their echoes are reaching my ears
nights coming fast suns going down  confused
i dont know the answers but neither do you6embed"
