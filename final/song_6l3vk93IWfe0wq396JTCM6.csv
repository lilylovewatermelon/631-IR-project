said id never leave her cause her hands fit like my tshirt
tongue tied over three words cursed
running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
bodies intertwined with her lips
now shes feeling so low since she went solo
hole in the middle of my heart like a polo
and its no joke to me
so can we do it all over again

chorus all
if youre pretending from the start
like this with a tight grip
then my kiss can mend your broken heart
i might miss everything you said to me
and i could lend you broken parts
that might fit like this
and i will give you all my heart
so we can start it all over again

verse 2 harry louis
can we take the same road two days in the same clothes
and i know just what shell say if i can make all this pain go
can we stop this for a minute
you know i can tell that your heart isnt in it or with it
and tell me with your mind body and spirit
i can make your tears fall down like the showers that are british
whether were together or apart we can both remove the masks
and admit we regret it from the start

youll never know how to make it on your own
and youll never show weakness for letting go
i guess its still hard if the seeds sown
but do you really want to be alone
