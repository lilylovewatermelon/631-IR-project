verse 1 2d
o green world
dont desert me now
bring me back to fallen town
where someone is still alive
fighting for something new in this
when no one needs the heart of me
and im looking out somewhere ive never been before
been before

instrumental break

verse 2 2d
o green world
dont desert me now
made of you and you of me
but where are we
oh no sells to lie
from the darkest stars that force you
down when you’re in first
does it seem so little to you
i know you now
i know you know me too
you know me too
hope sex and drugs thrust into myself holy
it feels holy
it’s fun when you’re the father in the place you wereyou might also like28embed"
