she eyes me like a pisces when i am weak
ive been locked inside your heartshaped box for weeks
ive been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
i wish i could eat your cancer when you turn black

forever in debt to your priceless advice

meateating orchids forgive no one just yet
cut myself on angel hair and babys breath
broken hymen of your highness im left black
throw down your umbilical noose so i can climb right back

forever in debt to your priceless advice
hey wait i got a new complaint
forever in debt to your priceless advice
