theres this girl
only in my dreams
would she ever care
ever look at me
but theres this boy
hanging off the line
couldnt take any more
couldnt take any more

chorus
theres this girl
i hope she knows
how much she means to me
even though
shell never feel
the way i do
its unbearable
but its true

verse 2
i overthink
every word you say
radio silence
every day
i overthink
every word i speak
i shouldve known
that you hated mе

theres this girl
i hope shе knows
how much she means to me
even though
shell never feel the
the way i do
its unbearable
but its true1embed"
