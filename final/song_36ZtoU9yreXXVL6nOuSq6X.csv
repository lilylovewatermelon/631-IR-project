verse 1
when i discovered you i discovered a piece within
joy like no other you are my closet friend
if you were a number youd be a perfect 10
right out of the blue skies you were heaven sent
the way we made love over and over again
if i had to describe it wouldnt know where to begin
i am so proud to be your next of kin
you prayed over me when i had no reason to live

chorus
candy carmel coated taffies chocolate covered strawberries love so sweet youre my chocolate factory gum drops
mixed with chocolate milk bars theres so much variety love so sweet youre my chocolate factory

verse 2
wait a minute baby
now if i could write a book on how you make me feel
the title would read “a strong black man” and thats for real
ive been going round and round just like a ferris wheel

but aint nobody else on gods great earth for me
heaven stirred us up together and made the perfect chemistry wouldnt change you for the world as long as i exist youre always in the kitchen cooking up my favorite dish yeah
