so im the king of all these things
of this mess i have made
such a waste what a shame
my whole life is a fake
well im a bore and im sure
im a thorn inside of you
that has torn at you for years
the alcohol the demerol
these things never could replace
what a minute with you could do
to put a smile on my face
im a bore and im sure
im a thorn inside of you
that has torn at me for years

chorus
i cant get out of this dead skin
i cant shed my skin
im not sure where to begin
why cant i begin again
i cant get under my dead skin
i cant shed my skin
can i sleep till then

verse 2
phenobarbital and alcohol
these two surely will do
to knock me out keep me down
at least a day or two
when im awake i can taste
how bitter ive become
and its more than i can bear
some days i pray
someone will blow me away
make it quick but let it burn
so i can feel my life fade
well im a waste and i can taste
how bitter ive become
and its more than i can bear

i cant shed my skin
i cant shed my skin

chorus
i cant get out of this dead skin
i cant shed my skin
im not sure where to begin
why cant i begin again
i cant get under my dead skin
i cant shed my skin
can i sleep till thenembed"
