i dont remember much about that time
just the smell of the air and your hand in mine
riding the strip sitting on my lap
in the back of the truck with the only friends i had
it was spring break we were out late
and i thought goodness for heavenâ€™s sake
when i saw you
and then i kissed you

chorus 1
on a balcony over the sun
in a chair by the rail high above everyone
we made love as the waves rolled in
and we owned that town for one weekend
like the tan on my skin our names in the sand
like the sound of the boat
starting up heading out of the bay
girl you faded away

verse 2
i still taste the shots on your lips that night
and the smoke from the club still burns my eyes
feel of your body taking off your dress
waking up that morning in a tangled mess
so if i would have known i would have held on
a little bit longer and stronger with nothing to lose
cause i still see you

in a chair by the rail high above everyone
we made love as the waves rolled in
and we owned that town for one weekend
like the tan on my skin our names in the sand
like the sound of the boat
starting up heading out of the bay
girl you girl you
faded faded away

chorus 2
on a balcony over the sun
in a chair by the rail high above everyone
i watched you drive through the gate
without saying the words i needed to say
like the tan on my skin our names in the sand
like the tears on your face
and the sun going down that day
girl you faded away
you faded away2embed"
