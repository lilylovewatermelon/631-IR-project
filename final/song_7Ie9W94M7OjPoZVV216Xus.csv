im not afraid yeah
to take a stand its been a ride
everybody i guess i had to
come take my hand go to that place to get to this one
well walk this road together through the storm now some of you
whatever weather cold or warm might still be in that place
just lettin you know that youre not alone if youre tryna get out
holla if you feel like youve been down the same road just follow me ill get you there

verse 1
you can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before i lay em
but you wont take the sting out these words before i say em
cause aint no way ima let you stop me from causin mayhem
when i say ima do somethin i do it
i dont give a damn what you think im doin this for me
so fuck the world feed it beans its gassed up if it thinks its stoppin me
ima be what i set out to be without a doubt undoubtedly
and all those who look down on me im tearin down your balcony
no ifs ands or buts dont try to ask him why or how can he
from infinite down to the last relapse album
hes still shittin whether hes on salary paid hourly
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
whichever comes first for better or worse
hes married to the game
like a fuck you for christmas his gift is a curse
forget the earth hes got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
and fuck the whole universe

im not afraid im not afraid
to take a stand to take a stand
everybody everybody
come take my hand come take my hand
well walk this road together through the storm
whatever weather cold or warm
just lettin you know that youre not alone

verse 2
okay quit playin with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
i shouldnt have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know its a wrap
you said you was king you lied through your teeth
for that fuck your feelings instead of gettin crowned youre gettin capped
and to the fans ill never let you down again im back
i promise to never go back on that promise
in fact lets be honest that last relapse cd was ehh
perhaps i ran them accents into the ground
relax i aint goin back to that now
all im tryna say is get back clickclackblaow
cause i aint playin around
theres a game called circle and i dont know how
im way too up to back down
but i think im still tryna figure this crap out
thought i had it mapped out but i guess i didnt
this fuckin black cloud still follows me around
but its time to exorcise these demons
these mafuckers are doin jumpin jacks now
chorus
im not afraid im not afraid
to take a stand to take a stand
everybody everybody
come take my hand come take my hand
well walk this road together through the storm
whatever weather cold or warm
just lettin you know that youre not alone
holla if you feel like youve been down the same road

bridge
and i just cant keep livin this way
so startin today
im breakin out of this cage
im standin up ima face my demons
im mannin up ima hold my ground
ive had enough now im so fed up
time to put my life back together right now

verse 3
it was my decision to get clean i did it for me
admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you
so i could come back a brandnew me you helped see me through
and dont even realize what you did believe me you
ive been through the wringer
but they can do little to the middle finger
i think i got a tear in my eye i feel like the king of
my world haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead no more beef lingers
no more drama from now on
i promise to focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father
so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
you couldnt lift a single shingle on it
cause the way i feel im strong enough to go to the club
or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
cause im raisin the bar id shoot for the moon
but im too busy gazin at stars i feel amazin and
chorus
im not afraid im not afraid
to take a stand to take a stand
everybody everybody
come take my hand come take my hand
well walk this road together through the storm
whatever weather cold or warm
just lettin you know that youre not alone
holla if you feel like youve been down the same road431embed"
