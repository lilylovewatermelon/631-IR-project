you can dance every dance with the guy
who gives you the eye let him hold you tight
you can smile every smile for the man
who held your hand neath the pale moon light

chorus
but dont forget whos takin you home
and in whose arms youre gonna be
so darlin save the last dance for me

verse 2
oh i know that the musics fine
like sparklin wine go and have your fun
laugh and sing but while were apart
dont give your heart to anyone

chorus
and dont forget whos takin you home
and in whose arms youre gonna be
so darlin save the last dance for me

till the night is gone
and its time to go

can he walk you home you must tell him no

and in whose arms youre gonna be
save the last dance for me

verse 5
oh i know that the musics fine
