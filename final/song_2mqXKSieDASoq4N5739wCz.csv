dont ya know youre beautiful
youre different unusual
i love your style its original
seem so unreal like youre mythical

dont ya know
girl dont ya know
hey dont ya know
i know you know

verse
baby i know that you dont see yourself as one of them
but honestly girl i believe that youre a hundred out of ten
youve been going through some things i want you to feel better
and if youre feeling cold here put on my sweater
but when youre feeling down i hope you can remember
i hope you can remember this

chorus
dont ya know youre beautiful
youre different unusual
i love your style its original
seem so unreal like youre mythical

dont ya know
girl dont ya know
hey dont ya know
