in the corner of the bar there stands a jukebox
with the best of country music old and new
you can hear your five selections for a quarter
and somebody elses songs when yours are through

verse 2
i got good kentucky whiskey on the counter
and my friends around to help me ease the pain
til some buttonpushing cowboy plays that love song
and here i am just missing you again

chorus
please mister please dont play b17
it was our song it was his song but its over
please mister please if you know what i mean
i dont ever wanna hear that song again

verse 3
if i had a dime for every time i held you
though youre far away youve been so close to me
i could swear id be the richest girl in nashville
maybe even in the state of tennessee

verse 4
but i guess id better get myself together
cause when you left you didnt leave too much behind
just a note that said im sorry by your picture
and a song thats weighing heavy on my mind
you might also likechorus
please mister please dont play b17
it was our song it was his song but its over
please mister please if you know what i mean
i dont ever wanna hear that song againembed"
