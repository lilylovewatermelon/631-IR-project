sooner or later that spark just disappears
outta nowhere outta nowhere
every time one of us ending up in tears
outta nowhere outta nowhere
is it good that we hurt every day
it this worth all the pain that we feel inside
am i too blind to see this is happening to me
outta nowhere outta nowhere

verse 1 pitbull
i live the fast life going nowhere fast
i seen my past life and politely passed
but i’m already planning on doin it big
for my life after death and live my life after death
baby what you think all the training is for
just to properly prepare you for war
so i keep you on your toes
if you look out for them friends that are really foes
this career tried to swallow us swallow us
paparazzi tried to follow us follow us
i’m everything my momma was
rider survivor a motherfuckin fighter
thank god for this rapping shit thank you
forget the cash its about happiness
normal life that’s for the birds
i work hard so you never say these words

verse 2 pitbull
the critics goin nowhere nowhere
thinking that they know me like the bible oh hell no
but they don’t understand me all well
snitching is a sport now so please do tell
the world i raise hell
yeah i did the crime but i skip jail
i’m just trying to own teams get it player
and dance on the globe like fred astaire
the world is ours baby
it’s just waiting for us so don’t be late late
and we can both aim for the sky
and shoot for the stars and call it a date
now you know that i know that we know
if the world wants war cock back and reload
a normal life that’s for the birds
i work hard so you never say these words
chorus danny mercer

verse 3 jamie drastik
i pop up outta nowhere is that jamie uhhuh oh yeah
if rihanna and chris brown can work it through
then anything is workable workable
and if the world does try to break us up
just let em know that they got some more work to do
theres no such thing as a perfect love perfect love
but there is such thing as a perfect thus perfect thus
theres one thing that im certain of
i say you learn to love same day you learn to trust
what woman dont love a man who works hard
no matter where i work loving be my first job
i clock in never clock out i say its my time
go and tell em watch out
but i need you on the side of me
bust back and stay low like the economy
theres nothing that we try to be
thank god robbing pit took a shot on me
chorus danny mercer
sooner or later that spark just disappears
outta nowhere outta nowhere
every time one of us ending up in tears
outta nowhere outta nowhere
is it good that we hurt every day
it this worth all the pain that we feel inside
am i too blind to see this is happening to me
