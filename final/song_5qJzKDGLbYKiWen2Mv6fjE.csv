i gave you true desire
i gave you eyes to see
i gave you wings of fire
so you could choose to fly with me
i gave your heart a passion
i gave your life a theme
i gave you all the actions
so wont you come and dance with me

chorus all
until the world has stopped revolving
until the birds have left the trees
until the winds have stopped from blowing
youll be loved by me
until the rainbows stop from shining
until the fish dont swim the seas
until the stars have stopped colliding
youll be loved by me

verse 2 tracey
ill be the wind in summer
ill be the sun in spring
ill be the fire in winter
cause i can be your everything
cause i can be your everything
