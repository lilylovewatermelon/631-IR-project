but did you know
i held my breath through every tunnel
i wish i could get over this feeling of slipping under
i never get that far

prechorus
everythings so uncertain
cant find the right direction
you look in the mirror and tell me you see clear
i lie say i can see me but i cant get past this feeling
i talk but no one listens
cant make my own decisions

chorus
every night i lie asleep
trying to wake up from this dream
numb but i still feel it crawling under my skin
i threw it all away but it still stays the same
try and forget my name but its something i just cant change
i threw it all away but it still stays the same

verse 2
every night i lie asleep
trying to wake up from this dream
what did you know
i held my breath through every tunnel
i wish i could get over this feeling of slipping under
i never get that faryou might also like6embed"
