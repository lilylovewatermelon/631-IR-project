i drive all alone at night

i follow the road blind
until the road is dead end
nights in my veins its callin me
racing along these arteries and

chorus 1 josh homme
law is just a myth
to herd us over the cliff

verse 2 josh homme
i follow the road at night
just hoping to find
which puzzle piece fell out of me
i know who you are and i
open the door and climb in
hold me real close and do it again
ache for the touch of my dead end friends

chorus 2 josh homme  dave grohl
and oh i gotta know
is it dead at the end of the road
i can tell by the look in your eyes
were the same my dead end friends and i
you might also likeinstrumental break

verse 3 josh homme
we drive all alone at night
a neverending begin
sweet as a curse just out of reach
awakens the dead end part of me

chorus 3 josh homme  dave grohl
and oh no more wandering
just me and my dead end friends again
yeah

bridge josh homme

dead end friends
dead end friends
