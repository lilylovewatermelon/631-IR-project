every second counts
i dont wanna talk to you anymore and
all these little games
you can call me by the name i gave you yesterday yeah
every minute counts
i dont wanna watch tv anymore yeah
can you figure me out
just doin this to waste more time on the couch

chorus
can you see me im waiting for the right time
i cant read you but if you want the pleasures all mine
can you see me using everything to hold back
i guess this could be worse
walking out the door with your bags
walking out the door with your bags
walking out the door with your bags
walking out the door with your bags

verse 2
pour your glass of wine
mitchell told me i should be just fine yeah
cases under the bed
spill it open let it rush to my head
i dont wanna be forward i dont wanna cut corners
savor this with everything i have inside of me
im not the type to run
i know that were having fun
but whats the rush kissing then my cheeks are so flushed
you might also likebridge
tell you how i felt
sugar coated melting in your mouth
pardon my emotions
i should probably keep it all to myself
know youd make fun of me
know youd make fun of me
know youd make fun of me
know youd make fun of me

chorus
can you see me im waiting for the right time
i cant read you but if you want the pleasures all mine
can you see me using everything to hold back
i guess this could be worse
walking out the door with your bags
walking out the door with your bags
walking out the door with your bags
walking out the door with your bags58embed"
