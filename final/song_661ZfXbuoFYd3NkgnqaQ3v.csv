waiting for the bus stop
waiting for the concrete black top to settle down
long enough for me to get off and get a little ground
im ready for the sea change
helpless felt this coming from a mile away
and now youre looking at me babe and how well separate if we can
cause i still count on one hand the number of good men i know

prechorus
its like im standing on the edge with just a telephone wire
trying to get to you first to say the worlds on fire
holding my breath until i know youre alright
because the water will only rise
when will you realize

chorus
you must become an island
you must become an island
you must become an island
and see for yourself that thats what i am

verse 2
you always dirty up the windows
if you keep em at bay that way no ones gonna surprise you by getting too close
anybody but me though
youve made exceptions to your rules
and now were staring down truth neither one of us wants to know

its like im standing on the edge with just a telephone wire
trying to get to you first to say the worlds on fire
holding my breath until i know youre alright
because the water will only rise
when will you realize

chorus
you must become an island
you must become an island
you must become an island
and see for yourself the horizon is all we have
and see for yourself the horizon is all we have

outro
holding my breath until i know youâ€™re alright
because the water will only rise3embed"
