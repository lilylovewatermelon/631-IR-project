ohoh and you aint got nothing on

too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to leave here with one of them—thats why i call her
and youll be right at home waiting for me
iphone plugged in the wall just waiting for me
club closed at 6 left around 430
yeah so by the time im at your crib—
it’s 5 o clock in the morning and you yawning
but i’ve been drinking all night and i feel like performing
with you in the bedroom floor to the dresser
dont want nothing less cause i’m sure you’re the best you’re the one
so i let you—thats how you show me love
and when we finished you like “damn babe you woke me up” whoa oh
i like you way you put it down like its for both of us oh oh
the sun aint the only thing thats coming up oh yeah
