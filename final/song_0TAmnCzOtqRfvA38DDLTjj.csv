your hand fits in mine like its made just for me
but bear this in mind it was meant to be
and im joinin up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
and it all makes sense to me
i know youve never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
youve never loved your stomach or your thighs
the dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
but ill love them endlessly

chorus zayn  liam
i wont let these little things slip out of my mouth
but if i do its you oh its you they add up to
im in love with you and all these little things

verse 2 louis louis  harry harry harry  niall
you cant go to bed without a cup of tea
and maybe thats the reason that you talk in your sleep
and all those conversations are the secrets that i keep
though it makes no sense to me
i know youve never loved the sound of your voice on tape
you never want to know how much you weigh
you still have to squeeze into your jeans
but youre perfect to me

chorus harry  niall
i wont let these little things slip out of my mouth
but if its true its you its you they add up to
im in love with you and all these little things
you might also likebridge niall
youll never love yourself half as much as i love you
and youll never treat yourself right darling but i want you to
if i let you know im here for you
maybe youll love yourself like i love you oh

breakdown harry all
and ive just let these little things slip out of my mouth
cause its you oh its you its you they add up to
and im in love with you and all these little things

chorus all
i wont let these little things slip out of my mouth
but if its true its you its you they add up to
im in love with you and all your little things87embed"
