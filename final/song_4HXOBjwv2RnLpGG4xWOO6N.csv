verse 1 chris martin
once upon a time somebody ran
somebody ran away saying fast as i can
ive got to go ive got to go
once upon a time we fell apart
youre holding in your hands the two halves of my heart
ohoh ohohoh

interlude rihanna
oh ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh

verse 2 rihanna  chris martin
once upon a time we burned bright
now all we ever seem to do is fight
on and on
and on and on and on
once upon a time on the same side
once upon a time on the same side
in the same game
now whyd you have to go
have to go and throw water on my flame

chorus rihanna
