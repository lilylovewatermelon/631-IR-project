money got your tongue tied

verse 1 pitbull
they said i couldnt do it but i did it
fuck tvt beat the most attention
met with all labels they didnt get it
now im taken over fuck with it
time to get flithy rich try to stay not guilty bitch
they said they used to handle pricks
i believe them when they projects are brick
all they rap about is crack and coke
knowin they aint never dealt crack or coke
yeah its a joke but thanks
cause im laughin all the way to the bank
