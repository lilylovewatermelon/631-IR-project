low down leavin sun
done did everything that needs done
woe is me why cant i see
id best be leavin well enough alone
them neon light nights couldnt stay out of fights
keep ahauntin me in memories
well theres one in every crowd for cryin out loud
why was it always turnin out to be me

chorus
where does it go the good lord only knows
it seems like it was just the other day
i was down at green gables ahawkin them tables
and generally blowin all my hard earned pay
piano roll blues danced holes in my shoes
there werent another other way to be
for lovable losers no account boozers
and honky tonk heroes like me hey hey

chorus
where does it go the good lord only knows
it seems like it was just the other day
i was down at green gables hawkin them tables
generally blowin all my hard earned pay
piano roll blues danced holes in my shoes
there werent another other way to be
for lovable losers and no account boozers and
honky tonk heroes like me
