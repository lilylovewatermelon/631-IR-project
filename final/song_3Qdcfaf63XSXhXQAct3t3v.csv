lets go

verse 1
in the beginning i was upfront
nothing to think about youd always hear me out
we made a pact and never gave up
when everything would change wed always stay the same
something went wrong along the way
you come around and theres nothing left to say
its like were strangers anyway
what more could you ask of me

prechorus
its been a long time coming
but everyones going to hear me out

chorus
if i leave bet youll wish i stayed
make you regret all the things you said to me
you know that time cant help us now
if i leave this if i leave this way

verse 2
ive always been a man of action
never let anything keep a hold of me
could always tell when somethings missing
like i knew everything except for you and me
i cant make you want to stay
god knows i tried but this broke under our weight
i still gave it everything
i guess ill never catch my break
