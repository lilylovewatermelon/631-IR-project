dont look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that ahah
don’t look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that

verse 1
i dont even know her
but i feel a responsibility
to do whats upstanding and right
it’s kinda like a code yeah
and youve been getting closer and closer
and crossing so many lines
