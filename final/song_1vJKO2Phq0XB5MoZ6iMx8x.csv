meet you down at the bottom finish a bottle
you know i know all your problems now
flaked on me back in august
and if im honest youve gotten harder to figure out

prechorus 1
i know that you got everything you wanted
i heard a rumor everybodys talking
about you now

chorus
i really thought that i could fix this but nothings different
how come im stuck on thinking youd grow up youd grow up
i really hoped that wed be past these problems past tense
is it just wishful thinking youd grow up youd grow up

verse 2
dropped it all in a second after your message
do you remember me calling out
meet you back in the wreckage right where you left it
do you regret how i see you now

prechorus 2
you said that you got better when you saw me
i heard a rumor its medicine and molly
youre blacking out
