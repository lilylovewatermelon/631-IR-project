verse 1 2pac
i love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
got a nigga wantin it so bad im about to pass out
wanna dig you and i cant even lie about it
baby just alleviate your clothes time to fly up out it
catch you at a club oh shit you got me fiendin
body talkin shit to me but i cant comprehend the meanin
now if you wanna roll with me then heres your chance
doin eighty on the freeway police catch me if you can
forgive me im a rider still im just a simple man
all i want is money fuck the fame im a simple man
mr international player with the passport
just like aladdin bitch get you anything you ask for
its either him or me champagne hennessy
a favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
witness as we creep to a low speed peep what a ho need
puff some mo weed funk ya dont need
approachin hoochies with a passion been a long day
but ive been driven by attraction in a strong way
your body is bangin baby i love it when you flaunt it
time to give it to daddy nigga now tell me how you want it

verse 2 2pac
tell me is it cool to fuck
did you think i come to talk am i a fool or what
positions on the floor its like erotic
ironic cause im somewhat psychotic
im hittin switches on bitches
like i been fixed with hydraulics
up and down like a roller coaster
im up inside ya i aint quittin til the show is over
cause im a rider in and out just like a robbery
ill probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
get to rockin these nights full of alizé
a livin legend you aint heard about
these niggas play these cali days
c delores tucker yous a motherfucker
instead of tryin to help a nigga you destroy a brother
worse than the others bill clinton mister bob dole
youre too old to understand the way the games told
youre lame so i gotta hit you with the hot facts
once im released im makin millions nigga top that
they wanna censor me theyd rather see me in a cell
livin in hell only a few of usll live to tell
now everybody talkin about us i could give a fuck
like we the first ones to bomb and cuss
nigga tell me how you want it

verse 3 2pac
raised as a youth tell the truth
i got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
lickin shots off from the roof
before i was a teenager mobile phone skypager
game rules im livin major
my adversaries is lookin worried
they paranoid of gettin buried
one of us gon see the cemetery
my only hope to survive if i wish to stay alive
gettin high see the demons in my eyes before i die
i wanna live my life and ball make a couple million
and then im chillin fade em all
these taxes got me crossed up and people tryin to sue me
media is in my business and they actin like they know me
but ima mash out and peel out
i’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin steel out
yeah nigga its some new shit so better get up on it
when you see me tell a nigga how you want it
how do you want it
