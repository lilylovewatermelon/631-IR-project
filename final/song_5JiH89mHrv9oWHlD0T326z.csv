dont blame me for falling
i was just a little boy
don’t blame the drunk caller
wasnt ready for it all

prechorus
you cant blame me darling
not even a little bit i was away
and i’m just an arrogant son of a bitch
who cant admit when hes sorry

chorus
dont call me baby again you got your reasons
i know that youre tryna be friends i know you mean it
dont call me baby again its hard for me to go home
be so lonely

verse 2
i just hope you see me in a little better light
do you think its easy being of the jealous kind
’cause i miss the shape of your lips
you’ll win its just a trick
and this is it so i’m sorry

chorus
dont call me baby again you got your reasons
i know that youre tryna be friends i know you mean it
dont call me baby again it’s hard for me to go home
be so lonely
