one step back from a beat down maniac
im tired of taking a back seat from all the other demons
that are stealing all the good shit
leaving me with nothing but my hands
another stroke down my back tasting all the flames that are
licking around my neck and making me insane
as they pull me down pull me down into my grave
i cant get away

chorus
ooooh it doesnt mean nothing
until your deep inside dancing to the devils swing
whoa it doesnt mean a god damn thing
dance to the devils swing

verse 2
spit down inside im begging for another ride
im trying to find a way to keep it all at
satisfy the needs im craving and
im not taking it lightly oh no
im living inside a dead lie
controlled by the devils eyes and i dont mind it
draw my ace up and roll my snake eyes nightly
hold on baby
see godsmack liveget tickets as low as 45you might also likechorus
ooooh it doesnt mean nothing
until your deep inside dancing to the devils swing
whoa it doesnt mean a god damn thing
until your deep inside dancing to the devils swing

postchorus
whoa dancing dance to the devils swing

bridge
play with my insanity
live inside my darken dreams my darken dreams
hail to the devils swing

chorusoutro
ooooh it doesnt mean nothing
until your deep inside dancing to the devils swing
whoa it doesnt mean a god damn thing
until your deep inside dancing to the devils swing
whoa it doesnt mean a god damn thing oh a god damn thing
dance to the devils swingembed"
