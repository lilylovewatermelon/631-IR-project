dont worry baby sometimes things change
nothing we can do about it now no way
this doesnt come easy but thats just life
we cant keep pretending everythings alright
we told each other it was love before
the simple truth is it just aint no more
the bells stop ringing the music wont play
the crazy little feeling thats faded away
like snowflakes when the weather warms up
like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes
like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain
all the disappearing bubbles in a glass of champagne
like a red kite lost in a blue sky wind
i dont know where the good times end when

chorus
it aint nothing we ever said or ever did wrong
its just love done gone

verse 2
i dont regret a single thing that we did
anytime together we ever spent
i wouldnt change a thing baby you know
sometimes we got to just go with the flow
like snowflakes when the weather warms up
like leaves on the trees when the autumn comes
like the dogwood blossoms in a late spring rain
all the disappearing bubbles in a glass of champagne
like money in a slot machine
dont know what happened to you and me
