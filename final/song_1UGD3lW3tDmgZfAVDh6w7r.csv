intro kanye west
uh
uh
i love it though
i love it though huh you know
chorus kanye west
uh put your hands to the constellations
the way you look should be a sin you my sensation
i know im preachin to the congregation
we love jesus but you done learned a lot from satan
i mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
we aint married but tonight i need some consummation

verse 1 kanye west
may the lord forgive us may the gods be with us
in that magic hour i seen good christians
make brash decisions oh she do it
what happened to religion oh she lose it
she putting on her makeup she casually allure
text message breakups the casualty of tour
how she gon wake up and not love me no more
i thought i was the asshole i guess its rubbin off
hood phenomenon the lebron of rhyme
hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
im looking at her like this what you really wanted huh
why we argue anyway oh i forgot its summertime
see kanye west liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likechorus kanye west
put your hands to the constellations
the way you look should be a sin you my sensation
i know im preachin to the congregation
we love jesus but she done learned a lot from satan
satan satan satan
i mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
we aint married but tonight i need some consummation

verse 2 kanye west
when the sun go down its the magic hour the magic hour
and outta all the colors thatll fill up the skies
you got green on your mind i can see it in your eyes
why you standing there with your face screwed up
dont leave while youre hot thats how mase screwed up
throwin shit around the whole place screwed up
maybe i should call mase so he could pray for us
i hit the jamaican spot at the bar take a seat
i ordered the jerk she said you are what you eat
you see i always loved that sense of humor
but tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
the lyor cohen of dior homme
thats dior homme not dior homie
the crib scarface could it be more tony
you love me for me could you be more phony
chorus kanye west
put your hands to the constellations
the way you look should be a sin you my sensation
havent said a word havent said a word to me this evening
cat got your tongue
instrumental interlude mike dean guitar solo
verse 3 rick ross
lookin at my bitch i bet she give your ass a bone
lookin at my wrist itll turn your ass to stone
stretch limousine sipping rosé all alone
doubleheaded monster with a mind of his own
cherryred chariot excess is just my character
allblack tux niggas shoes lavender
i never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
had cyphers with yeezy before his mouth wired uh
before his jaw shattered climbing up the lords ladder
we still speedin running signs like they dont matter uh
hater talkin never made me mad
never that not when im in my favorite paper tag
therefore g4s at the clearport
when it come to tools fool im a pep boy
when it came to dope i was quick to export
never tired of ballin so its on to the next sport
new mercedes sedan the lex sport
so many cars dmv thought it was mail fraud
different traps i was gettin mail from
polk county jacksonville right in melbourne
whole clique appetites had tapeworms
spinnin teddy pendergrass vinyl as my j burns
i shed a tear before the nights over
god bless the man i put this ice over uh
getting 2pac money twice over
still a real nigga red coogi sweater diceroller
im makin love to the angel of death
catchin feelings never stumble retracin my steps uh
