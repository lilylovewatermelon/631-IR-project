i still have your picture on the wall
i still have the nightmares where i would have to call you to calm down
i still think about you all the time
when i step out of the shower i’m reminded of the night
when we slept in the back of your car
and you left me with a pretty cool scar

chorus
did it hurt
when i kicked you to the curb
now i’m all alone
i guess i’ll never learn

verse 2
your purple sweaters sitting in my room
i tried to wear it but i knew that it would smell like you
i saw you dancing at the show tonight
i stood in the back
and i think that we both know why

chorus
did it hurt
when i kicked you to the curb
now i’m all alone
i guess i’ll never learn
you might also likeoutro
and i lied
when i took you on a drive
and i said i’d never speak to her
i wish i would have kept my word14embed"
