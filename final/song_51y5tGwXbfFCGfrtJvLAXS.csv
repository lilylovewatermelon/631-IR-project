looking back on when i was a little nappyheaded boy
then my only worry was for christmas what would be my toy
even though we sometimes would not get a thing
we were happy with the joy the day would bring
sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
greeted at the back door with boy thought i told you not to go outside
tryin your best to bring the water to your eyes
thinking it might stop her from whoopin your behind

chorus
i wish those days could come back once more
why did those days ever have to go
i wish those days could come back once more
why did those days ever have to go
cause i love them so

verse 2
brother said hes telling bout you playin doctor with that girl
just dont tell and ill give you anything you want in this whole wide world
mama gives you money for sunday school
you trade yours for candy after church is through
smokin cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall you nasty boy
teacher sends you to the principals office down the hall
you grow up and learn that kind of thing aint right
but while you were doing it it sure felt outta sight

i wish those days could come back once more
why did those days ever have to go
i wish those days could come back once more
why did those days ever have to go6embed"
