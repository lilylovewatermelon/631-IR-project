what were you thinking
i guess ill never know
see your eyes blinking
pupils begin to grow
drilling you softly
pulling you in
making your mind up
whats sick or a sin

chorus
open up now let it all go
im quite certain say it aint so
youre corrupted by some sick fuck
oh no
open up now head in the sky
heres the tongue that keeps telling lies
feelings in my mouth
you breathe in but cant breathe out

verse 2
what youve been taking
it makes you talk real slow
how come im thinking
youd be the last to know
choking you gently
gaining control
hand you the shovel
to dig your own hole

open up now let it all go
im quite certain say it aint so
youre corrupted by some sick fuck
oh no
open up now head in the sky
heres the tongue that keeps telling lies
feelings in my mouth
you breathe in but cant breathe out

bridge
choking you gently
gaining control
hand you the shovel
to dig your own hole
open up now let it all go ah
open up now let it all go ah

chorus
open up now head in the sky
heres the tongue that keeps telling lies
feelings in my mouth
you breathe in but cant breathe out
you breathe in but cant breathe out4embed"
