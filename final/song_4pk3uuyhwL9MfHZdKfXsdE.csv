its cold outside im sensing fear
my self control has disappeared
im spinning out at each end
could you be kind and let me in my friend

verse 2
well i sized you up youre not that strong
youre weak inside i knew all along
this made up army you fight in your head
destroyed your worth and pronounced you dead

prechorus
despite the writing on the wall
my futures bleak and rather small
thats all you could ever take from me
ive got nothing to lose so let me be

chorus
theres no more love
theres no more love
theres no more love

postchorus
the cruelest joke that has played on me
is all planned out so i cant leave
now quietly i will walk away
there is no bad blood but i cant stay
cause theres no more love yeah
cause theres no more love yeah
