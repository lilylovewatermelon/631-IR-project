it feels like im walking on air
when we walk down our street
when the neighbors stop to watch us walk by
you can hear em talking let them talk
sometimes i think that youre the only reason
the sun still shines when it shines
and when this wicked world starts bringing me down
i tell myself that im one lucky guy

chorus
i got the girl holding all the cards
i got the girl shes a work of art
i got the girl whos gonna break my heart

verse 2
she likes to wear her stripe with her plaids
and she wont brush her hair i swear
she dont like wearing shoes in december
but i dont care i dont care
what she wears

chorus
i got the girl holding all the cards
i got the girl shes a work of art
i got the girl whos gonna break my heart
you might also likeverse 3
if i was a holy man id get down on my knees
so the angels that watch over her would give a break to me
holy mother of saint bubble gum and sister bandaid knees
wont you please pray for the ones like me
but the truth is someday
somebody is going to take her you see
but the queen of hearts will always be
a fiveyearold princess to me to me

chorus
i got the girl holding all the cards
i got the girl shes a work of art
i got the girl whos gonna break my heart

i got the girl shes going to leave her mark
i got the girl shes a work of art
i got the girl shes going to break your heart

i got the girl shes going to leave her mark
i got the girl shes a work of art
i got the girl shes going to break your heartembed"
