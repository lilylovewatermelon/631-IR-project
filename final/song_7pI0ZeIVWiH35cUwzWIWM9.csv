lent you outsidaz and my new badu
while you were thinking i didnt have a clue
tough to sort files with your voice in my head
so then i bribed you downstairs with a marlboro red uh
and now i feel so small discovering you knew
how much more torture would you have put me through
you probably saw me laughing at all your jokes
or how i did not mind when you stole all my smokes yeah

chorus
and although my pride is not easy to disturb yeah
you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
with your battered jeans and your beasties tee
now i cant work like this no no with you next to me

verse 2
and although hes nothing in the scheme of my years
it just serves to bludgeon my futile tears
and im not use to this no no
i observe yeah i dont chase
but now i sit with consequences thrust in my face yeah
and the melodramas of my day deliver blows
and that surpass your rejection it just goes to show
a simple attraction that reflects right back to me
so im not as into you as i appear to be
you might also likechorus
and although my pride is not easily disturbed yeah
you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
with your battered jeans yeah and your beasties tee
now i cant work like this no with you next to me

verse 3
his message was brutal but the delivery was kind
maybe if i get this down ill get it off my mind yeah
oh it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks yeah
despite my frustration for the way that he thinks
and i knew the truth when it came would be to that effect
at least youre attracted to me which i did not expect
didnt think youd get my number down as such
but ive never hated myself for my age so much yeah

chorus
and although my pride yeah is not easy to disturb yeah
you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
so with your battered jeans yeah and your beasties tee
now i cant work like this no no with you next to me yeah
and although my pride yeah is not easy to disturb yeah
you sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb
so with your battered jeans yeah11embed"
