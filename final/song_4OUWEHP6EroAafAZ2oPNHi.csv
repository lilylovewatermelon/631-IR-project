what am i supposed to do with this heart
with this heart with this heart
how do i take it off if i love at all
its like a work of art
in love we all will fall but
we fell a little harder
what am i supposed to do with this heart
with this heart with this heart
it may be wrong but it feels right
to be lost in paradise

chorus
im so lost in paradise
if i open up my eyes
i can see the storm i can see the sky
i can see the darkness flashing lights
all my fears gone tonight
let me stay
im lost in paradise

verse 2
how was i to know that my love was delusional
somebody told me how to mend
a brokenhearted soul
in love we all will fall but
we fell a little harder
what am i supposed to do with this heart
with this heart with this heart
it may be wrong but it feels right
to be lost in paradise
