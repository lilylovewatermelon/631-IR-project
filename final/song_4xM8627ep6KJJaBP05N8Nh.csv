i cant move
frozen i said im frozen
i cant move away from what i need
i heard a priest got shot yesterday
for no reason now i hope hes where the heavens lay heavens lay
ya i hope hes in a better place hes looking at life like the enemy
when really life is a friend to me theres get it hot like the end of may
money will never make cents let it change
haha get it let it change
and in case i ever edit what i say
i just hope that we are living for a better day
if i could write a letter to the world
this is everything that i would have the letter say
i cant seem to move in this place im in
im frozen
i cant move away from what i need
i know this pretty girl that got sent away
shes looking at life to a century
shes got light skin and shes featherweight
and never thought that she would make that mistake
the lights in the car went out
and the cops came following to take away her license plate
she fell asleep at the wheel n got the brakes
and now shes living life at a different pace
she killed her best friend and she cant erase
the fact that it happened so we aint got time to waste
the only time we got is the time we make
and that time can never be replaced
i cant seem to move in this place im in
im frozen
i cant move away from what i need
the economy is so bad
its like theres no gas
i have a neighbor that has no dad
so he becomes angry n so sad
and prays to god that he will flow past
and in the moment these things feel like movies
but his life is broken n theres no cash
i wont brag about what i do have
and ill never complain about what i dont have
cause what i dont have keeps me better still
so dont ever try to put me on this peddistill
i had a best friend whos in heaven now
and i just keep on wishing that they let him down
i cant seem to move in this place im in
im frozen
i cant move away from what i needyou might also likeembed"
