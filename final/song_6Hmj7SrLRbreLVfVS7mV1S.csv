something filled up
my heart with nothing
someone told me not to cry
but now that im older
my hearts colder
and i can see that its a lie

verse 2
children wake up
hold your mistake up
before they turn the summer into dust
if the children dont grow up
our bodies get bigger but our hearts get torn up
were just a million little gods causing rain storms
turning every good thing to rust
i guess well just have to adjust

bridge
with my lightning bolts aglowing
i can see where i am going to be
when the reaper he reaches and touches my hand

outro
with my lightning bolts aglowing
i can see where i am going
with my lightning bolts aglowing
i can see where i am gogoing
