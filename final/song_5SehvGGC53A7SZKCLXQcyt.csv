verse 2
what i say when i want to be enough
what a beautiful day for making a break for it
well find a way to pay for it
maybe from all the money we made razorblade stores
rent a racehorse and force a sponsor
and start a concert a complete diversion
start a mob and you can be quite certain
well win but not everyone will get out
no no
well win but not everyone will get out
no no
well win but not everyone will get out

chorus
east is up im fearless when i hear this on the low
east is up im careless when i wear my rebel clothes
east is up when bishops come together they will know that
