slowly we watch the degradation of the civilization
the rise and fall of all we are stands before us

verse 1
this place is evil
is there an answer
this world is vile
we are the answer
oh

verse 2
how long until we die
die from the inside out
how much is enough for us to see the light
how much blood must be spilled

chorus
contest the lies
we cannot be so blind
hear their cries
dont wait til daylight dies daylight dies

verse 3
when there is blood on our hands
how can we how can we ignore the truth
see killswitch engage liveget tickets as low as 89you might also likechorus
contest the lies
we cannot be so blind
hear their cries
dont wait til daylight dies

bridge
the cost of one life
the price of one soul
is too much to bear

verse 4
no more broken promises
our shattered hearts will heal
no more broken promises
no more no more

chorus
contest the lies
we cannot be so blind
hear their cries
dont wait til daylight dies

outro
how long until it dies
how long how long
how long until it dies
how long how longembed"
