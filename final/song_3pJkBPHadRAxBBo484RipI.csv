take a left here boy take it slow
dont get distracted by that radio
i just rolled my eyes and i said daddy i know
im fifteen i aint green like some ol ten year old

chorus
what i wouldnt give to be sixteen wild and free
cruisin up and down main in my f150
roll the windows down bass too loud from this burnt cd
ill be right where i wanna be when im sixteen sixteen yeah
sixteen

verse 2
now that i can drive finally feel alive but i got this curfew
sneakin in late smellin like my girlfriends perfume yeah
people talkin bout college and knowledge and thats alright
but all im thinkin bout is an unsupervised saturday night

chorus
what i wouldnt give to be eighteen wild and free
buzzin off a can of that grizzly wintergreen
lookin old enough to pull off this fake id
ill be right where i wanna be when im eighteen eighteen
eighteen yeah

im old enough to smoke im old enough to vote
but they turn me away when i go to the cottoneyed joe
they say the grass is always greener and i believe thats right
but my friends are off to vegas and theyre leavin me behind

chorus
what i wouldnt give to be twentyone wild and free
open up a cold one and drink it legally
chase a bunch of girls go see the world let my wild streak run

yeah when im twentyone itll be alright
yeah itll all be alright when im twentyone

outro
now im twentyfive and im drinkin wine with my wife at home
got a couple dogs and a couple songs on the radio
and we sit around and we laugh about how we used to be
when all we cared about was turnin sixteen7embed"
