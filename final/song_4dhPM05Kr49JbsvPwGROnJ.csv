tale as old as time
true as it can be
barely even friends
then somebody bends
unexpectedly

just a little change
small to say the least
both a little scared
neither one prepared
beauty and the beast

ever just the same
ever a surprise
ever as before
ever just as sure
as the sun will rise

tale as old as time
tune as old as song
bittersweet and strange
finding you can change
learning you were wrong

certain as the sun
rising in the east
tale as old as time
song as old as rhyme
beauty and the beast
tale as old as time
song as old as rhyme
beauty and the beast
you might also likespoken
off to the cupboard with you now chip its past your bedtime goodnight loveembed"
