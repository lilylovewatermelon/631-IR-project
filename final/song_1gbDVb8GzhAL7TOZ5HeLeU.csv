turn me down to the ground
i want to feel the coolness on my face
lie me down show me how
i can begin to hold you endlessly

prechorus
and i dont sleep so i dont dream of leaving
and when i wake i face the night
and i dont speak i listen to the breathing
i sometimes think i hear my fate

chorus
so is it any wonder
that im finding someone in this place here next to me
and is it any wonder that we found each other
ive found another who meets the same
is it any wonder

verse 2
dont explain by its name
we write our words forever in the space
who could say chance again
chooses to bring together you and me

prechorus
now i dont sleep so i dont dream of leaving
i lie awake and face the night
i lie awake and dream of you

so is it any wonder
that im finding someone in this place here next to me
and is it and wonder that you made it here
we found another who meets the same
and is it any wonder that im finding
someone in this place here next to me
and is it and wonder that you made it here
i found another who meets the sameembed"
