verse 1
hurdle my opponents run through problems
unstoppable i jump over obstacles
stop my grind like stop sunshine so improbable
probable mission impossible
i said it two times nigga nigga stop lying
bullshit you selling now im just not buying
flow so nice but the kids not kind
swear its sicker than a new flu they got called swine
standing on point like a unicorn
strapped with a unibomb
everdays a workday but dont wear uniform
gucci mane a dapper don
trouble like a capricorn
trapper month going on a money makin marathon
you the joker i be robin
and the riddle is the batmans throne
try not to fuck my money up and rap career like pacman jones
thumb print me finger print me
but can we agree to disagree
im from east atlanta 6 where the boys dump bricks
but we dont bump the blueprint 3
wanna box me just like max b
but you cant fuck me like razb
like ali imma float like a butterfly sting like a bee cuz its big gucci gucci

verse 2
streets derailed me
but god didnt fail me
opportunity knocked but it just emailed me
da nailed me watch them jail me
take it like a champ while the whole world mail me
young dont like me jay outsells me
nothing in the world kanye couldnt tell me
you can beat anyone but gucci
job so hard i can hardly do it
cause whatever that i heard use to let that
bet if you had the chance to youd mute me
convicted felon my left wrist yelling
my stash here you go and my bones done swellin
crazy so i need prozac really
my home kept skep and my folks so eerie
so hardworkin that my bones still reary
fall in the club then the hoes start cheerin
so hear me hear me i know yall hear me
i dont like life to much not really
high like britney stoned like jimmy
got a second chance like vick in philly
this aint snap music this is trap music
new boys in cali yeah they got a jerk movement
bricksquad niggas we rep the block
gucci mane i work forks and pots
