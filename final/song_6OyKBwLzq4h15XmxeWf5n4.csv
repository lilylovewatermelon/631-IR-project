morgan v hennigan us district court for massachusetts 1974

the seek button on the fords radio is working the downtown recedes miles of neighborhoods fill the windshield the seek function locks on someplace in stereo college fm probably yeah a new friend says whas up whas goin on the radio has another button vol which gets jacked repeatedly while the ford hurtles happily to the source of the noise not to the stations broadcast booth on a campus across the river nor to its transmission towers in the suburbs but rather to rjam productions in north dorchester where black kids from bostons nowintegrated high schoolslatin madison park jeremiah burke mattapancut demos and dream of being bigger than even the radios new friend a young man named schoolly d who right now at speakerdamaging volume sounds darn big before we start this next record… schoolys saying the record in question is called signifying rapper a brief bloody tale of ghetto retribution from side 2 of schoollys smoke some kill
the black areas are cut away from the white areas a federal judge ruled in 74 and evidence is everywhere that nothings changed since then on the southbound left of the fitzgerald expressway pass 20 blocks of grim irishcatholic housing projects the western border of belfast complete with sinn fein graffiti and murals depicting a glorious united ireland a neighborhood where the gadfly will get his fibula busted for praising the 74 court order that bused them from wherever it is they livethe third world fer crissakesinto 97percentwhite south boston on the expressways right is the place the fibulabusters are talking about the simultaneous northern border of haiti jamaica and georgia a territory that maps of boston call north dorchester

uniting the two sides of the expressway is just about nothing both neighborhoods are tough and poor both hate the college world across the river which because of bostons rotten public schools they will never see as freshmen and kids from both neighborhoods can do this hating to the beat of undergraduate radio which this fine morning features suburban kids with student debt broadcasting the art of a ghetto philadelphian roughly their age once much poorer than they but now on royalties from smoke some kill very much richer

not that the shared digging of black street music is news or even new twenty years ago when morgan v hennigan bostons own brown v board of education was inching through the courts and even darkcomplected italians were sometimes unwelcome in the irish precincts east of the expressway kids in bostons little belfast sang along with james brown over the radio

say it loud
im black and im proud
say it loud
im black and im proud

except that halfway through the infectious funk the crewcuts realize what theyre saying jesus christ im proud to be black fer chrissakes like when youre in the porno store you know and you get lost or something and you find yourself in the mens part you know not the part for men in the part thats about men jesus and you get the hell outta there and so they hummumble the suppressed parts

say it loud
im mmm hum proud
say it loud
mum hum hum proud

but rap isnt funk rock or jazz and the vast crossover move broadcasting ghetto music over college radios to ghettos of a different color is no simple reenactment of past crossovers how for example does the singalong fan of smoke some kill mumble his way through these lines
black is beautiful
brown is sick slick stiff
yellows ok
but white aint shit

rjam productions modestly headquartered in a mixed blackhispanic field corner section of north dorchester is as follows

 one 1 fourcar garage fitted with dubbing and remastering gear worth more than most of the rest of the real estate on the block
 one 1 touchtone telephone leased
 two 2 chevy blazers vanityplated rjam1 and rjam2 each equipped with cellular phones and slick tape decks also leased
 one 1 vcr with kathleen turners body heat cued up on the morning in question
 most importantly eight 8 promising acts under binding contract

if as has happened to many local labels rjam were liquidated to satisfy creditors these would be the pieces but there are stores of value in the converted garage beyond the reach of the auctioneers gavel schoolly d the original signifying rapper looms irresistibly from the pages of rap fanzines hiphop and the source and rjams prime unauctionable asset is the consuming ambition of the artists in its stable to be the next schoolly d or the next ice t or kool moe dee or l l cool j or whoevers the special hero of the kid cutting the demo on this particular morning the dream is to be the next mc lytea hardrapping woman known for jams like mc lyte vs vanna whyte and 10 dissince today is tamtams day and tamtam is at 16 a tough girl in the mc lyte mold who like mc lyte can dance look good and tell men to beat it all at once

or so claims tamtams producer promoter and dutch uncle gary smith who opened rjam on martin luther kings birthday 89 with his older brother nate nate the elder statesman is 25 gary 22 runs the company while nate travels with his boyhoodfriendturnedboss quadrupleplatinum princederived rappersinger bobby brown rjam was founded in part with an investment from the 23yearold multimillionaire brown a native of roxbury brown now lives in los angeles

nate and gary smith turn a healthy profit making demos at 500tape but the brothers arent in the health business their aim to follow in the corporate footsteps of def jam a once similarly tiny production company run from a basement in hollis queens which since its basement days has given america public enemy l l cool j the beastie boys and much of the rest of that culturequake called rap gary smith doesnt compare rjam to def jam and unlike def jams russell simmons gary produces pop soul and rb as well as straight rap and actually prefers rb but how many sophomores at nearby jeremiah burke can afford to dream in rb to front music lessons and 500 for an nthhand sound setup find three friends to learn drums bass and keyboards and then raise another 500 to make a demo at rjam anybody with a larynx can rap however and rjams brisk business in rap demos pays the taxman boston edison and the chevrolet motor credit corp

twenty minutes farther south on the fitzgerald expressway across the neponset river and into the pricey suburbs is the scene of john cheevers boyhood more recently celebrated as massachusetts miracle country where technology ventures are started at the rate of five per week four of which will fail within 12 months rjams gary smith is secret brother to the men of the suburban chambers of commerce sharing their worries about cash flow overhead and the enforceability of his contracts but garys world and theirs are as far apart as those of ward and eldridge cleaver worriers in suburbia fear that ballooning property values will hike taxes on computer executives seaside homes in garys neighborhood property values are actually falling

waiting less than patiently for tamtam gary honks twice a tall grave girl with an angels heartshaped face crosses the ghetto street and climbs into the back seat of rjam1 she has apparently at least two voices the cynical sexy rant heard on tape this morning telling pebbles men aint worth it and the whisper in which she now says hello

as rjam1 recrosses north dorchester heading back to the soundproof studios to get the days work started gary and dj reese hash out production details tamtams a dignified island in the back seat and a shiver accompanies the thought that this could be the motor city in 63 with berry gordy and an eightypound teenage diana ross just voted best dressed at cass technical high school driving crosstown to record a little number called where did our love go

ask tamtam about diana ross and she gives a beatific smile shes 16 she can remember only with difficulty the first rap she ever listened to when rap was new and she was 8 rundmc or somebody she mumbles in response to what suddenly seems a foolish question about her influences like most of raps black audience as distinct from raps white audience which is usually a decade older tamtam has no firsthand recollection of james brown except as a source for rap she is too young to have attended segregated schools she was in diapers during the violent first few months of desegregation in boston and cant remember the awful day in 74 when proneighborhood marchers from irish south boston came upon a black pedestrian at city hall and beat him with polemounted american flags
tamtam has star presence and like many who do she seems to see very little of what goes on around her the price of the stars intense focus on self she reminds you of senator gary hart he too had star presence in front of a crowd hart was riveting in the elevator riding up to the auditorium he was barely there being barely there in the neighborhood tamtam calls home is probably not such a bad thing and perhaps her drive to be star someday is an elaborate way to wall out the now and here ambition is finally a form of hope a scarce commodity in north dorchester

back in rjams control booth dj reese and producer ralph stacey are programming the rhythm track for what will be ho youre guilty drum parts are taken from a roland tr909 rhythm composer a synth which electronically reproduces programmed beats on the users choice of drummatrix the tr909s keys on a console designed to resemble vaguely the familiar piano are named after the sound each createsbass snare midtom hitomand the sounds are named after the actual drums which until the tr909 were required to make those sounds the tr909 even sports a key named hand clap making it possible for the first time ever to clap hands with a single finger rendering obsolete the zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping the finished ho youre guilty will sound lush with percussion melody and instrumental breaks not one human musician will be employed in the recording process

each percussion line is programmed onto the mixing board as a separate track a snare track a bass track a clap track etc reese has been studying the classics lately too viz james browns dead on the heavy funk from 75ish including the ageless groove funky president in which james announces his thirdparty candidacy some of bobby byrds dead guitar and a holy moment when james exhales rhythmically have been isolated from a storebought cassette of dead rerecorded on clean tape then rererecorded onto a computerreadable memory diskette from which the sample is retrieved and altered by ralph stacey using a roland d50 linear synth the guitar and the exhalation then go as altered from the synth to yet another of the 24 tracks on the big mixing board reese the dj will weave a seamless rhythm track out of these 24 strands

as reese and ralph stacey mix the 24 tracks onto one master tape tamtam sips lemonade in the corner of the booth you ask her if she is interested someday in learning about the obscure digital technology the two men manipulate on her behalf she doesnt seem to register the question the other career besides rap id like to pursue is modelling she says im fiveseven thats the perfect height for a model

mixing takes the rest of the day producer ralph stacey at one late point corners you with a flinty stare and an uncomfortable question why do you want to write about rap anyway it is lucky that at that minute reese is done mixing tomorrow the rjam staff will tape tamtams vocal track and lay this over reeses rhythm track then the sound will be fattened with stacks of horns guitar hooks bells canned applause and whatever else they decide to take from other tapes or work up on the rolands the final demo tape of ho youre guilty will then be shopped to the 20 major minor and tiny labels who might release the demo as a 12inch single

everyones ready to call it a day gary smiths already huddled with some new wannabe stars in rjams reception area reese plays the mixed rhythm track once through over the big speakers in the control booth and tamtam immediately stands modelling forgotten utterly alert reese gestures to her with maestro hands she raps at an absent antoinette in the hard sexy voice you havent heard since this morning extemporaneous but on beat

im a female
youre just a fairytale

the smallw we here are two white boston males one native one ofttransplanted both residing in somerbridge a dim ethnicportuguese neighborhood whose gentrification we abet m is an attorney with a taste for jazz blues funk d a grad student and wouldbe drifter who watches tv instead of sleeping our cultural tastes and interests are day and night they converged only lately when ds stereo arrived ups and we discovered we shared an uncomfortable somewhat furtive and distinctively white enthusiasm for a certain music called raphiphop about our passions and discomforts we could determine only that they were vague  distinct contexts and cathexes brought to bear across the same ethnic distance on the same thing for instance we agreed that real or serious rap is not jj fad or tone loc or beasties egyptian lover or fat boys not experiments or freakshows or current commercial crossover slush serious rapa unique us innercity fusion of funk technified reggae teentoteen hardcore rock and the early 70s poetry of the black experience of nikki giavonni the last poets etchas since its late70s delivery at the recordscratching hands of afrika bambaataa and his zulu nation sugarhill gang kool herc and his automated herculords and grandmaster flash always had its real roots in the neighborhood the black gangbanger underground black music of and for blacks

our point of departure essaywise was always less what we know than what we felt listening less what we liked than why for this attempt at an outside sampler we plunked down and listened to thousands of hours of rap trying to summon a kind of objective critical purely aesthetic passion that the music itself made impossible for outsiders raps easy to move to hard to dissect the more we listened and thought and drank beers and argued the more we felt that the stuffs appeal for two highbrow upscale whites was just plain incongruous because serious rap has right from the start presented itself as a closed show usually critical questions of culture context background and audience reduce quickly to vexed questions about prepositions not here no question that serious rap is and is very selfconsciously music by urban blacks about same to and for same to mainstream whites its a tight cohesion that cant but look from outside the cultural window like occlusion clannishness sic and inbreeding a kind of reverse snobbery about whats def and fresh and inthescene that eerily recalls the exclusionary codes of college societies and wasponly country clubs serious rap is a musical movement that seems to revile whites as a group or establishment and simply to ignore their possibility as distinct individualsthe great white male is raps grand inquisitor its idiot questionerits alien other no less than reds were for mccarthy the musics paranoia together with its hermetic racial context helps explain why from the outside it appears to us just as vibrant and impassioned as it does alien and scary

other incongruities rap is a music essentially without melody built instead around a digitally synthesized drum and backbeat often about as complex as five idle fingers on a waitingroom table enhanced by sampled pirated krush grooves licks or repetitive chordseries conceived and recorded by prerap rock icons the whole affair characterized by a distinctive spare noisy clattering style whose obsessive if limited thematics revolve with the speed of lowi amperage around the performative circuit of the mcrapper and his recordscratching soundmixing sancho panza the dj

the rapper the guy in the cameo cut or kangol hat pricey warmup unlaced adidas extra thick gold chain or oversized medallion offers lyrics that are spoken or bellowed in straight stressed rhymed verse the verses syntax and meter often tortured for rhythmic gain or the kind of limboingforrhyme we tend to associate with doggerel about men from nantucket the lyrics nearly always selfreferential tend to be variations on about half a dozen basic themes themes that at first listen can seem less alien or shocking than downright dull eg just how badcoolfreshdef the rapper and his lyrics are just how equally unallthese his music rivals are how troublesome vacuous and acquisitive women are how wonderful it is to be paid in full for rapping instead of stealing or dealing how gangs are really families caines constant bad news and in particular how sex and violence and yuppie toys represent perfectly the urban black lifedrive to late80s american glory

the masks are many too many for anything really but direct aural inspection rap personae can change frequently even within single albums the rapper delivering hard violent black nationalist communique on one cut dubbing against trinidadian steel drums on another basking in big label eclat on a third cracking a head and then defly outwitting someone muscled and dumb cooing to his bitch and then on the flip side threatening to go get his gun again if she cant learn whos boss though any crew naturally wants its own distinctive game and face the quintessential rap group is unquintessential chameleonesque this is either by weird design or its a symptom and symbol of 80s facelessness…or most likely its just a good old venerable synecdoche of raps genre itself one thats now moving so fast it cant quite fix on its own identity  much less hold still for anything like cool critical classification or assessment from outside
the mcs alice toklasesque dj hovers ever nearby over his buffet of connected turntables and the black germanness of a whole lot of digital editing  playback equipment his responsibility is the song behind and around the rap  the backbeat krush groove and the sound carpet ie a kind of electric aural environment a chaos behind the rappers rhymed order a digitalized blend of snippets squeaks screams sirens snatches from pop media all mixed and splattered so that the listener cannot really listen but only feel the resultant mash of samples that results the most recognizable of these samples range from staccato recordscratches to james brown and funkadelic licks to mlks public dream to quotidian pop pap like the theme from shaft brady bunch dialogue and 50s detergent commercials

we have now read every review and essay to do with serious underground hiphop available in every single online periodical  xcept for one or two underground newsletters viz the city sun freshest circulated in parts of the bronx demimonde where learning about rap is as hard for white outsiders as scoring fine china white or aks from the kind of sedulous bibliomaniacal research to be expected of conscientious lawyers and phds the following has become clear outside england where the punkweaned audience has developed a taste for spectaclethroughwindows for vicarious rage and protest against circumstances that have exactly 0 to do with them most of what rolling stone calls devoted rock consumers meaning we postbabyboomers plus almost all established rock critics tend to regard noncrossover rap as essentially boring and simplistic or swaggering and bellicose and dangerousat all events basically vapid and empty because of its obsessive selfreferentiality…in short as closed to them to us as a music unrecognizable as what weve been trained and adverted to buy as pop great to dance to of course but then what might the white audience for todays mainstream expect rap whether fecund or sterile is todays pop musics lone cutting edge the new the unfamiliar the brainresistedwhilebodyboogies and that resisted alien exhilarating cutting edge has always been black

what have you left me what have i got
last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
my homey got jacked
my mothers on crack
my sister cant work cause her arms show tracks
madness insanity
live in profanity
then some punk claim that they understandin me
give me a breakwhat world do you live in
death is my sexguess my religion

what makes this stuff so much more disturbing more real to outsiders than the punk rock even those of us who remember it could never quite take seriously maybe even a closed music has to have some kind of detente with received custom i always found it tough to listen straightfaced to a nihilist lecture from someone with a chartreuse mohawk and an earring in his eyelid who punctuates his delivery with vomit and spit all doctrine and pronouncement exclusively anti this punk of a decade past afforded even willing mainstream listeners no easement across cultural void nothing human to grab onto i have no idea what a punk performer thinks feels is daytoday in fact i always suspected he had no day but just retreated to his plush coffin at cockcrow can you imagine a punk with fourfoot hair and spiked jacket and nosering say eating a bologna sandwich replacing a light bulb putting a quarter in a meter not me boy and even barnum who knew fear sells also knew that freakshows arent frightening when the freakishness supplants all resemblance 0 affinity  0 empathy and fear requires empathy as much as it does menace or threat

public enemy and nwa ice t and schoolly d discomfit us our friends the critics we read and cornered because the hard rappers lyrics are conscientious about being offor the real lives and attitudes of recognizable if alien persons heres where its a level up from mere spectacle ideology in hard rap is always informed by incident or named condition this makes rap not only better than punk but way scarier serious hard raps afford white listeners genuine horsesmouth access to the lifeanddeath plight and mood of an american community on the genuine edge of imexplosion an ugly new subnation weve been heretofore conditioned to avoid remand to the margins not even see except through certain carefully abstract attenuating filters

for outsiders rap is hard to dissect easy to move to the command is dance dont understand participate dont manipulate rap is a fortress protected by the twin moats of talk and technology the first is that nu style of speakthe dialect drug de la soul calls itthat rappers fashion from jive and disseminate through record stores to all of us some inwords like fly meaning finelooking have been in coin since the beginning now venerable as old english because they turn up on grandmaster flash cuts from 82 others like dead presidents rap for  are either coming into or going out of currency depending on when you read this rap a club language has myriad ways to describe ones own or others looks fly is how a man digs a woman one would never describe oneself as fly even when cataloguing ones own attractions done more in rap than anyplace except perhaps village voice personals fresh means irresistibly stylish oftmodified by funky crazy or stoopid predominantly used to convey the flyness of things other than women including oneself or ones rap which two concepts rappers like schizophrenics cant always keep separate in their heads dope means def and def means crazy funky stoopid fresh synonyms include the shit the it the cool the thang the word the grooviest the categorical imperative die weltanschung the thatwhichpotterstewartwouldknowifhesaw a def rapper is so styledefining as to make the stylish mere copycats to be def is to rap to the beat of a different drum machinenot seeking solitude but rather confident that others will follow the def rapper mcs a def rap which rap defly tells of its own and the rappers defnessso def as mcmanager entrepreneur russell rush simmons brags that it had to be on a label called def jam

rap celebrates power equating strength with style and style with the i in individuality rappers disdismissthe styleless faceless to ill is to be weak or wrong to bite is to thieve anothers dope beat and only the ill would bite

early remastered pop was the first fake music ever since what the record buyer of 63 experienced as aural event on his turntable couldnt happen live rock began to become an illusion of event which technology made possible rock became more like the movies starting down a long road at the end of which was mtv

not that this kept phil spector up nights the gurus of the studio had fatter fish to clean for the new freedom to shape sound had come at a price with each magnetic jump from live as tape was made of tapes which were themselves tapes of tapes the hiss and crackle of interference multiplied dual highbias media with 2 units each of sonic garbage per 10000 units of elvis presley retaped on similar 2unitsper10000 tape became 4 units of hiss retaped 8 then 16 then 32 as the sound got fuller it decayed

the solution was a breakthrough called multitrackingusing recorders that could capture and play back on 2 as in stereo 4 as in 67s thenearshattering sergeant peppers lonely hearts club band 12 16 and today 24 parallel tracks eliminating the hiss of transference from one machine to the next rhythms melodies harmonies could all be captured on separate tracks allowing the performer or producer to mix and listen and remix adding vocals or lead instrument on yet another track rap edisons like kool herc grandmaster flash and afrika bambaataa began as party djs not musicians their wiring of twin turntables to a mixer allowing them to stack the sound of two different records while rapping into a mike was a kind of crude extemporaneous multitracking technological loops like those in the nasaesque studios of cbs and polygram were now in the hands of the homeboys carter was president the bee gees with five topten hits in twelve months were king

digital recording the science dividing rjams tamtam on tape from tamtam as heard live is a technology that converts music to codes or digits the codes are read by a computer one combining sophisticated soundtocode translation hardware with a numbercrunching cos and a highresponse synthesizer at speeds of 40000 digits per second and up the recorded sounds reduced to numbers can be shaped mangled muffled amplified and even canonized hardware then translates the digits as read and altered back into sound which can itself be recorded on multitrack and combined with yet more sounds the result hissfree reproduction on an infinity of tracks each of which can itself be manipulated infinitely

digital recording part of the 80s seachange in how pop gets made divides the responsibility for the final song more or less equally between the performer the engineer at the mixing board the producer who coordinates the multitracking and mixing process and the electronic hardware that actually makes the music we buy the latest synthesizers produce notes from pure electric current instead of electronically amplified vibrations with voltagemeters rather than hands or feet determining everything from key to pitch to timbre to attackdelay envelope another nonrap term denoting the microtimed counterpoised quality of a notes duration how a notes soundquaverstructure as it builds is different from its sound and structure as it fadesthe manipulation of a pianos footpedals for example affects the delay component of each note and chords envelope the kurzweil 250 a stateoftheart system is a 1track12018note synthesizer linked by software to an apple macintosh plus which serves as an exhaustive library of digitized sound the kurzweil could put all of culture in a blendertake janet leighs cremoracurdling scream from psycho store it in the mac program the synth such that an f will be reproduced as janet leighs f scream then play we shall overcome as if screamed by janet leigh store this treat similarly bachs st matthews passion except with vast choruses of screaming janet leighs then mary had a little lamb then twist and shout by the isleys not the beatles all as screams then replay the four as one horrific jumble or select amidst the jumble and then whatever you came up with in the final painstakingly remixed mix you could play backwards and call that finished or never finish its like holding music at gunpoint you can make it door do to you whatever you can think of whim is the only limit

basically we decided we were into rap because even mediahype aside this music had some kind of hard edge to it date of composition here is july 89 think back this last has been a fiscal year in which madonnas back on top in which covers of classic covers of classic tunes are themselves covered and then climb corporate charts in which rod stewarts out of cryogenics and back on top mtvs ceased to be anything but a long commercial for itself and the interests of corporate labels bobby mcferrin makes a platinum mint and then several commercial jingles out of a burbled synthreggae invitation to be happy a song that has the same verbalprepackaging feel as wheres the beef

this last year heavy metals fakesatanist male models accounted for 12 of total us record sales u2 filmed a 20000000 homage to their own selfrighteousness and bonos ever more illdisguised megalomania a year when even good old rem finally went corporatepop with green when good old springsteen trashed his bride when as modest and nascent a talent as tracy chapman earned cymbalcrashing critical raves for her competent updated frappe of baez and armatrading so desperate were pop critics and consumers for any voice at once comprehensible and even remotely fresh just not a notable pop year at all except in rap rap appears in the famished late 80s as potentially a genuine musical scene the way early jazz rock the summer of love folkprotest god even the way new wave and punk were scenesthe sword here simultaneously meaning something new to look at something loud and upsetting oh please veronica lets not have a scene and best an identifiable set of places in time where large forces meet marry and beget whether by virtue or default rap is pretty much what there is to like right now if you want to regard todays pop as anything more than covert jingles in 44time in our opinion

but so the point is we enjoy it plus weve developed some theses about why serious rap is important both as artforownsake and as a kind of metaphorwithlarynx for a subbedculture unique in its distillation of the energy and horror of the american present

rap is expanding gaslike through the 80s dry time growing from house party schtick gang anthem a smalllabel fad with the sort of pop lifespan you measure with eggtimersthen somehow when we werent looking into scene movement on the airfinally in the last 24 months assuming the fecund role of genuine genre exploding into subspecies now faster than you can track theres now dubs mix of rap and reggae houses mix of rap and 70s hugeafrod funk acid houses psychedelic hiphop there is black rap for white massconsumption tone loc rundmc black rap for local set and house consumption countless local stars and wannabes in every large city ultrablack rap superstars for the whole marginal nation inside heavy d public enemy big daddy kane white rap for white masses the execrable beastie boys there is hispanic salsainfluenced rap out of different west coast barrios rap fused with west indian or islamic traditional music in digital underground eric b and rakim and others or fused with ohsodanceable rb in the new jack swing offshoot bobby brown mc hammer even gay and bohemian young urban bs have their trendsetters in teddy riley and guy de la soul kwabe etc etc a major impediment to sampling this scene is the kaleidoscopic fury with which the scene itself is changing if youre reading this in print its already dated

and the rap worlds vitality is one of replacement as well as variety allowing the genre to remain fresh as band after band is seduced into the real music biz this scene is hydralike almost the moment a rap artist like rundmc or l l cool j breaks through into majormarket mix appeal mtvs land of corporate bankability certain reactions within the urban underground that spawned them can almost always be observed the breakthrough bands bboys themselves are without qualms about the pop bigtime after all theyve been rapping all along about their entitlement to money and status about the inevitable rewards of their freshness and unbiteable voice their postbreakthrough raps tend all often to become celebrations of their new wealth and fame of the nowenhanced authority of their messagethough its hard to feature public enemy rapping about a blackmilitant renaissance about revolution and american apocalypse while lilywhite cbs records pays them millions for the distribution rights to just such exhortations to cut corporate throats

nevertheless back in the underground scene the breakthrough bands tight set of original fans tends to hang loyal to await feverishly their crews spots on the same music tv they love to dis in short there are comparatively few of the accusations of selling out that accompanied a similarly oxymoronic coopting phenomenon in late60s protest rock which if you think about it is passing strange the white mainstream other against which serious rap aligns and defines itself makes the 60s establishment too look downright benign

our opinion then from a distance not only is a serious rap serious poetry but in terms of the size of its audience its potency in the great 80s market its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture weve been encouraged sadly to write off6 its quite possibly the most important stuff happening in american poetry today real viz academic us poetry a world no less insular than rap no less strange or stringent about vocab manner and the contexts it works off has today become so inbred and against its professed wishes inaccessible that it just doesnt get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical sandalshod readers doesnt get to move or inform more than a fraction of that readership most of the moved being poets themselves doesnt generate revenue for much of anyone save the universities to whom the best phdpoets rent their names and time  and especially does not inspire a whole cultures youth to try to follow in their connecticutcatalogue brogans prints because of raps meteoric rise though youve got poor kids tough kids underachievers a lost generation more young peopleostensibly forever turned off language by tv video games and low usde budgetsmore of these kids hunched over notebooks on their own time trying to put words together in striking and creative ways than the usa has probably ever had at one time that few of these will become stars matters far less than the grim stats about say the tiny percentage of playground basketball phenoms who actually ride sports out and up from subclass status the same verbal skills and enthusiasms rap values and values enough to let rapdissing stand symbolically for fighting or killing can obviously be applied in mainstreamapproved productive waysgeds college standard written english perhaps someday even adcopywriting

but is this wildfire of urban rap ambition raging around converted fourcar garages like north dorchesters rjams in spite of the genres neardisciplinary prosodic restrictions or because of them cant really tell probably doesnt matter the fact remains that were important poetry presently defined in terms of what makes important art important in a supplyside democracy popularity effect the separation of fan from his cash staid journals like poetry and american poetry review would be featuring some number of fadecut multipleearringd authors photos in each issue and highbrow public readings would always carry their back row fraction of bangers ready to listen rude to wilbur and levertov and ashbery just as eg rimbaud and pound did to their own contemporaries  to the delight and invigoration of a times poetry

 and even just the prospected fantasy of seeing public enemys beclocked flavor fav and like a jorie graham or amy clampitt sitting down over beer and celestial seasonings to hash out the debate over linebreaks in dactylic pentameter a very serious young homeboy in italian silk and pentagonal shades serving as interpreter is enough to make us hereby officially lobby for the admission of rhymes renaissanceat least under the stringent rhythmic demands rap has forced on rhymeasformto the cold corridors of serious appreciation

unlike the mostly docile poetry and fiction of the late 80s though raps own quality the def freshness of the mcs bit is set up to be judged primarily in the context of what it is against in case you thought we forgot rap is first of all a movement in rock music and thus the timehonored requirement is that the rap scene set itself very consciously athwart those circumstances and forces whose enormity is required by all rock n roll to justify one of its essential roles rebellionagainst except now watch the objects of the rebellion alter spread grow in urgencyfrom the 50s parents and principals homework hot rods the sweet hurt of teen love to the urban 80s police violent death homelessness the lure of ecstatic drugs that dehumanize weaponry fatherlessness the animal emptiness of sex wo love the almost trilaterally sinister white establishment the governments responsible the governments    everyone else life as a series of interruptions from an angry slumber about what the electric voices say you must have and the human voices say you may not about the betrayal of the past of the promises exacted by carmichael x and the nowformal martyrdom of king
