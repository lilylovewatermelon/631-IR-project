d major baby

chorus
ive been scarred by your love left my heart bleedin’
my soul posted in the shadows with some dark demons
im on the eway in a fast foreign car speedin
223 spit out quick when that chopper ringin’
we aint never duckin beef bitch we not vegan
my lil niggas bout that action they be glock squeezin
red beams on his head now his top leakin
i heard that boy got man down and now the opps grievin’

verse 1
i miss mike durb i won’t forget the things you used to say
my friends got killed on the same block where we used to play
i know that death come unexpected you cant choose a day
i swear i pop so many pills shit got me losin’ weight
one minute life was so hard shit had me losin faith
i know my haters checkin on me i been doin great
i couldn’t get wrapped up in that drama had to move away
everything could change depend on what you do today
you gotta live with each decision that you choose to make
i used to hustle to survive i found a newer way
remember high speeds in the hot car tryna lose the jakes
you got your life in your hands until you lose a case
so much potential in the lives these niggas threw away
daydreamin bout my freedom every night i used to pray
i got that check and stayed loyal make sure my shooters straight
heard he went unidentified them hollows chewed his face

ive been scarred by your love left my heart bleedin
my soul posted in the shadows with some dark demons
im on the eway in a fast foreign car speedin
223 spit out quick when that chopper ringin
we aint never duckin beef bitch we not vegan
my lil niggas bout that action they be glock squeezin
red beams on his head now his top leakin
i heard that boy got man down and now the opps grievin

verse 2
lil duck hop out in traffic let them things bust
lil joe be buggin hell make you give your chain up
this shit too deep no i can never give my gang up
shitll never be the same them trenches changed us
my niggas gone i miss them days when we came up
if i could be with you give all the money and the fame up
that pain was so unbearable i almost gave up
first we was broke but now im swervin in that range truck
we was wildin in them streets a savage what they named us
when its violence on our side of town they blame us
smith  wesson torch a nigga he get flamed up
them 40 shells crack his head fuck your brain up
