i almost got drunk at school at 14
where i almost made out with the homecoming queen
who almost went on to be miss texas
but lost to a slut with much bigger breastes
i almost dropped out to move to la
where i was almost famous for almost a day

chorus
and i almost had you
but i guess that doesnt cut it
almost loved you
i almost wish you wouldve loved me too

verse 2
i almost held up a grocery store
where i almost did 5 years and then 7 more
cause i almost got popped for a fight with a thug
cause he almost made off with a bunch of the drugs
that i almost got hooked on cause you ran away
and i wish i wouldve had the nerve to ask you to stay

chorus
and i almost had you
but i guess that doesnt cut it
almost had you
and i didnt even know it
you kept me guessin and now im destined
to spend my time missin you
i almost wish you wouldve loved me too
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likebridge
here i go thinking bout all the things i couldve done
im gonna need a forklift cause all the baggage weighs a ton
i know we had our problems i cant remember one

verse 3
i almost forgot to say something else
and if i cant fit it in ill keep it all to myself
i almost wrote a song about you today
but i tore it all up and then i threw it away

chorus
and i almost had you
but i guess that doesnt cut it
almost had you
and i didnt even know it
you kept me guessin and now im destined
to spend my time missin you

outro
and i almost had you
almost had you
almost had you
i almost wish you wouldve loved me too
wish you wouldve loved me too5embed"
