verse 1
i dont dare to let it show
therefor you will never know
what i really feel inside
and how i lay awake at night

prechorus
will i ever fall in love
and if i do will it be with you
will i ever fall in love
and will you be the one for me

chorus
will i ever fall in love
and if i do will it be with you
will i ever fall in love
and will you be the one for me

postchorus

and will you be the one for me
