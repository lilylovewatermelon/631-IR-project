i dialed seven digits five times today
just to hear you say you love or hate me
ill take anything
i just wanna hear your voice
cut through the line like a heartshaped knife
cut me down baby one more time
good or bad baby
yes no maybe
its driving me crazy

chorus
wont you pick up the phone
i can pick up some wine
i can pick you up in my pickup truck
and we can pick up right where we left off
aint that what we both want
pick up the pieces girl
it aint that broke
pick up the past and just let it go
put down that over menever wanna see me againgoodbye kinda stuff and pick up

verse 2
youre putting me through hell one ring voicemail
