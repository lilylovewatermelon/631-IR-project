she said she wanna tell me everything all night long
she said she wanna get her name into a song
so we go dancing in the daylight and everything is good right now
i can hold my pain in and we can have our love for a while

chorus
but you better stop and save yourself
you could have anyone else
stop save yourself
you could have anyone else
stop save yourself
you could have anyone else
stop save yourself
ooh you better save yourself

verse 1
she said she wanna get up into my biz for a day
and i could have her i could keep her but i can’t make it rain
so i’m listening to the rain drum listening to the silent sound yeah
while i’m hearing everybody else screaming out loud

chorus
boy you better stop save yourself
you could have anyone else
stop save yourself
you could have anyone else
stop save yourself
you could have anyone else
stop save yourself
ooh you better save yourself
ooh you better save yourself

verse 2
yeah i’m sleeping with a snake tonight
and nowadays what’s wrong feels right
i was a bastard of the worse kind
i looked you in the eyes still told you a lie
drinking cheap champagne no i can’t complain
pushed into the lights these are the pressures of fame
and it’s still all good there’s only one thing wrong
you know what it is and i told you
well i’m a monster

outro
i’m turning into a monster
and i don’t want to be a monster anymore no
i’ve got to leave you alone
but i can’t leave you alone
oooh
oooh
oooh
oooh
ooohembed"
