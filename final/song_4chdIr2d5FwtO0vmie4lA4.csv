weve tried so hard to understand
but we cant
we held the world out in our hands
and you ran away
it takes some time to let you go
and it shows

chorus
cause all we know
is falling it falls
and remember
cause i know that we wont forget at all

verse 2
now we could follow you back home
but we wont
is this what you had waited for
just to be alone
it takes some time to let you go
and it shows

chorus
cause all we know
is falling it falls
and remember
cause i know that we wont forget at all

you never said
this wasnt what you wanted
was it was it
this isnt what you wanted
this isnt what you wanted

chorus
cause all we know
is falling it falls
remember
cause i know that we wont forget at all7embed"
