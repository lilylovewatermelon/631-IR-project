i heard a knock upon my door the other day
i opened it to find death staring in my face
the feel of mortal stalking still reverberates
everywhere i go i drag this coffin just in case

verse 1
my bodys trembling sends shivers down my spine
adrenaline kicks in shifts into overdrive
your secrets keep you sick your lies keep you alive
snake eyes every single time you roll with crooked dice

prechorus
i felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
the kind of dark that haunts a hundredyearold house
i wrestle with my thoughts i shook the hand of doubt
running from my past im praying feet dont fail me now

chorus
ive lost my goddamn mind it happens all the time
i cant believe im actually meant to be here
trying to consume the drug in me is you
and im so high on misery cant you see

verse 2
i got these questions always running through my head
so many things that i would like to understand
if we are born to die and we all die to live
then whats the point of living life if it just contradicts

i felt the darkness as it tried to pull me down
the kind of dark that haunts a hundredyearold house
i wrestle with my thoughts i shook the hand of doubt
running from my past im praying feet dont fail me now

chorus
ive lost my goddamn mind it happens all the time
i cant believe im actually meant to be here
trying to consume the drug in me is you
and im so high on misery cant you see

and im so high on misery cant you see
