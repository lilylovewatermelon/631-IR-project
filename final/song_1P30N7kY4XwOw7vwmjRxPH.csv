call me out you stayed inside
the one you love is where you hide
shot me down as i flew by
crash and burn i think sometimes
you forget where the heart is

answer no to these questions
let her go learn a lesson
its not me youre not listening
now cant you see somethings missing
you forget where the heart is

chorus
take you away
from that empty apartment you stay
and forget where the heart is someday
if ever you loved me youd say its okay

verse 2
waking up from this nightmare
hows your life whats it like there
is it all what you want it to be
does it hurt when you think about me
and how broken my heart is

take you away
from that empty apartment you stay
and forget where the heart is someday
if ever you loved me youd say its okay

bridge
its okay to be angry and never let go
it only gets harder the more that you know
when you get lonely if no ones around
you know that ill catch you when youre falling down
we came together but you left alone
and i know how it feels to walk out on your own
maybe some day i will see you again
and youll look me in my eyes and call me your friend

chorus
take you away
from that empty apartment you stay
and forget where the heart is someday
if ever you loved me youd say its okay
its okay
its okay4embed"
