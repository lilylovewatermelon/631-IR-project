when my pass came in you dropped the ball
it didnt change the way i feel
and i was wishing id break down your walls
the kiss will know if lips stay still

prechorus 1
there is a line i crossed
and when you missed i lost
im not a loser
girl you know that ill be back again

chorus
my dear i went for the steal
maybe it was rushed
oh my crush ive got a crush

verse 2
i suppose that i could hold it in ooh
but you excite my every cell
sources say that senses are your friends
my senses say that i should tell

prechorus 2
you that im not ashamed
you might just feel the same
but you have to try it
if youre ever really gonna know

my dear i went for the steal
maybe it was rushed
oh my crush ive got a crush

bridge
i want to i need to
i have to have you
youre so much to touch
girl youre too much and i cant control it
youve got me all over the road

chorus
my dear i went for the steal
maybe it was rushed
oh my crush damaging my soul

outro
you blew me off but i dont mind
i just get better with time
and so do you so do you so do you
oh oh oh my crushembed"
