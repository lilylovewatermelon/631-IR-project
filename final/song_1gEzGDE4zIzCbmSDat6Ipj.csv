there was a bad taste in our mouths
awareness didnt come too soon
but you finally tasted it too
its just another case of fucking up
a perfectly good afternoon
every manner that i forgot
could have helped me out of acting cruel

but i wasnt in the least distraught
though my jokes were bombing
i got to feeling like my timing was off
but baby thats just not me

so as far as anyone can see
theyd be helpless not to agree
theyre driving miles between us three
it was them versus you versus me

and as soon as we drove right through
thirty seconds without a word
it was then that i knew for sure
i wasnt gonna hear a word from you

and the road became the radio
and we scowled at the beautiful trees
i was thinking of what went wrong
i thought baby its not just me
you might also likeso as far as anyone can see
theyd be helpless not to agree
theyre driving miles between us three
it was them versus you versus me

so as far as anyone can see
theyd be helpless not to agree
theyre driving miles between us three
it was them versus you versus me x 9embed"
