verse 1
i dont do black music i dont do white music nope
i make fight music for high school kids
i put lives at risk when i drive like this
i put wives at risk with a knife like this ah shit
you probably think im in your tape deck now
im in the backseat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
ducked the fuck way down waitin to straight jump out
put it over your mouth and grab you by the face — what now
oh you want me to watch my mouth how
take my fuckin eyeballs out and turn em around look
ill burn your fuckin house down circle around
and hit the hydrant so you cant put your burnin furniture out oh my god oh my god
im sorry there must be a mixup
you want me to fix up lyrics while our president gets his dick sucked
fuck that take drugs rape sluts
make fun of gay clubs men who wear makeup
get aware wake up get a sense of humor
quit tryin to censor music this is for your kids amusement the kids
but dont blame me when little eric jumps off of the terrace
you shoulda been watchin him apparently you aint parents

verse 2
so whos bringin the guns in this country hm
i couldnt sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in london
and last week i seen this schwarzenegger movie
where hes shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi
i see these three little kids up in the front row
screaming go with their seventeenyearold uncle
im like guidance aint they got the same moms
and dads who got mad when i asked if they liked violence
and told me that my tape taught em to swear
what about the makeup you allow your twelveyearold daughter to wear hm
so tell me that your son doesnt know any cuss words
when his bus drivers screamin at him fuckin him up worse go sit the fuck down you little fucking prick
and fuck was the first word i ever learned
up in the third grade flippin the gym teacher the bird look
so read up bout how i used to get beat up
peed on be on free lunch and changed school every three months
my lifes like kind of what my wifes like what
fucked up after i beat her fuckin ass every night ike
so how much easier would life be if nineteen
million motherfuckers grew to be just like me
chorus
‘cause i never knew i knew i would get this big

i never knew id get him to slit his wrist
i never knew id get him to hit this bitch

i never knew i knew id affect this kid
i never knew id get him to slit his wrist
i never knew id get him to hit this bitch
