chorus joji
so lost in these diamonds
so lost in this paradise
dont speed on that highway
we need you to shine bright
when life gets too complicatеd
will you stand with me after dark
i will stay in the limеlight
like a beautiful afterthought
like a beautiful afterthought

verse 2 benee
sometimes youd ask me for something different
hated when you did it i wish that you didnt
i would do things and youd get annoyed i
shouldve never done them i wish i was different
why do we have to step away now
its been a year been a couple days now
since you called me sayin youre worried
been hard for me dealin with this space now
no company wishin we could sit down
cause im sorry but you dont want me
