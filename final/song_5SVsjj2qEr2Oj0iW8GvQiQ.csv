a heartbeat skip relationship inside a bubble bath
an icing drip below your lip so we undo the math
a sudden slip between my pathetic sedatives
a reallife script of how mistakes became our medicine so
delay the hurtful words of complicated overcast
please take the message that im picking up my chin at last
i said my confidence it gets stronger when youre next to me
but we pray from miles away in quest for what we long to be

chorus
i might crumble i might take a fall again
still missing you
i might crumble i might take a fall again
still missing you
i might crumble i might take a fall again
but youre my everlasting friend
everlasting friend

verse 2
a heartbeat skip relationship so we would stay up late
a teardrop drip below your lip beside the airport gate
a sudden slip from where we used to be a year ago
a reallife script of how our hands would hold and not let go
but delay the mournful words of complicated overcast
please take the message that you taught me how to live at last
but i said my confidence it gets stronger when youre next to me
but we wave respect goodbye in quest for what we long to be

still missing you
i might crumble i might take a fall again
still missing you
i might crumble i might take a fall again
but youre my everlasting friend
will you be coming home
everlasting friend
my everlasting friend will you be coming home
everlasting friend

chorus
i might crumble i might take a fall again
still missing you
i might crumble i might take a fall again
still missing you
i might crumble i might take a fall again

outro
i might crumble i might take a fall again
i might crumble i might take a fall again
i might crumble i might take a fall again
i might crumble i might take a fall again
i just want to know that youll be coming home
i just want to know that youll be coming home
i just want to know that youll be coming home
i just want to know that youll be coming homeembed"
