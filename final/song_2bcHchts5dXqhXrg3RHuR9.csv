i dont want nothin i cant use nothin
take care into the hall and if you see my friends
tell em im fine not using nothin

almost burned out my eyes and threw my ears down to the floor
i didnt see nothin i didnt hear nothin
stood there like a block of stone knowing all i had to know
and nothing more man thats nothin

brothers our troubles are locked in each others arms
and you better pray that they never find you
cause your back aint strong enough the burdens doublefold
they crush you down down into nothing

being born is going blind and bowing down a thousand times
to echoes strung on pure temptation
sorrow and solitude these are the precious things
and the only words that are worth rememberingsee colter wall liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeembed"
