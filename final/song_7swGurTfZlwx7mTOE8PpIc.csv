verse 1
jesus called me collect last night
it took all of me not to answer
daddy warned me the perils of playing
hard to get with god as his standard
flying high and fearless baby
ive kissed death a thousand times before

chorus
remember me for who i was not who i am
ill pray you never understand this sweet
sweet sweet sweet november
remember me for who i was not who i am
ill pray you never understand this sweet
sweet sweet sweet november

bridge
take take time time
flow flow shine shine
brilliant brilliant light light
angel angel fly fly

verse 2
heard you fucking with tommy again
we both member where that landed you last time
that nigga dont really love you girl
he just beds you every night its his pasttime
blind eye and the fearless darling
you two might just do it raw tonight
heaven help if he leave you girl
i bet you bought two new thongs this time

ill pray you never understand this sweet
