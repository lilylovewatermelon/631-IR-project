faded off of that bottle
livin like no tomorrow
i like you cause im lifted
and you like me cause im gifted
buttoned down in designer
that dolce and that gabbana
painted just like an angel
i thank the lord that he made you

refrain
i see it in your eyes
passion you cant deny
girl we can live that life
i see it all

prechorus
there we are
smokin on rolled cigars
hollywood boulevard
i can see it all now
you could be
bigger than your fantasies
standing right next to me

chorus
i see it all now
youre a star
i can see it all now
you look
you might also likeverse 2
like you straight out a movie
naked in the jacuzzi
stuntin like you madonna
that beautiful persona
energy go crazy
i might have your babies
and i dont usually say this
i swear its not cause im faded

refrain
i see it in your eyes
passion you cant deny
girl we can live that life
i see it all

prechorus
there we are
smokin on rolled cigars
hollywood boulevard
i can see it all now
you could be
bigger than your fantasies
standing right next to me

chorus
i see it all now
youre a star
i can see it all now
you look
outro
there we are
smokin on rolled cigars
hollywood boulevard
i see it all now
youre a star14embed"
