same lips red same eyes blue
same white shirt couple more tattoos
but its not you and its not me
tastes so sweet looks so real
sounds like something that i used to feel
but i cant touch what i see

chorus
were not who we used to be
were not who we used to be
were just two ghosts standin in the place of you and me
trying to remember how it feels to have a heart beat

verse 2
the fridge light washes this room white
moon dances over your good side
and this was all we used to need
tonguetied like weve never known
tellin those stories we already told
cause we dont say what we really mean

chorus
were not who we used to be
were not who we used to be
were just two ghosts standin in the place of you and me
were not who we used to be
were not who we used to be
were just two ghosts swimmin in a glass half empty
trying to remember how it feels to have a heart   beat

chorus
were not who we used to be
were not who we used to be
were just two ghosts standin in the place of you and me
were not who we used to be
we dont see what we used to see
were just two ghosts swimmin in a glass half empty
trying to remember how it feels to have a heart beat

outro
trying to remember how it feels to have a heart beat
im just trying to remember how it feels to have a heart beat101embed"
