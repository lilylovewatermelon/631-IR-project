whenever i start feeling strong
im called a bitch in the night
but i dont need these 14 karat guns to win
i am a woman i insist its my life

this is my chance to release
and be brave for you youll see

i am wind and hurricane the stormy sky and rain
when you run dry ill flood your pain

in between the moments of the lady ive become
a voice speaks through the noise like drums
