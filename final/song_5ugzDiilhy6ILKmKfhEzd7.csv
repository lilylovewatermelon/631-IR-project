youre keeping in step in the line
got your chin held high and you feel just fine
cause you do what youre told
but inside your heart it is black and its hollow and its cold

chorus
just how deep do you believe
will you bite the hand that feeds
will you chew until it bleeds
can you get up off your knees
are you brave enough to see
do you wanna change it

verse 2
what if this whole crusades a charade
and behind it all theres a price to be paid
for the blood which we dine
justified in the name of the holy and the divine

chorus
just how deep do you believe
will you bite the hand that feeds
will you chew until it bleeds
can you get up off your knees
are you brave enough to see
do you wanna change it

so na√Øve
i keep holding on to what i wanna believe
i can see
but i keep holding on and on and on and on
on and on and on and on

outro
will you bite the hand that feeds you
will you stay down on your knees
will you bite the hand that feeds you
will you stay down on your knees
will you bite the hand that feeds you
will you stay down on your knees
will you bite the hand that feeds you
will you stay down on your knees
will you bite the hand that feeds you
will you stay down on your knees
will you bite the hand that feeds you
will you stay down on your knees
will you bite the hand that feeds you
will you stay down on your knees
will you bite the hand that feeds you
will you stay down on your knees11embed"
