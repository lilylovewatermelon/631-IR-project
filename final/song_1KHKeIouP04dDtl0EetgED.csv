lets go

verse 1
its not easy making a name for yourself
where do you draw the line
i never thought id be in this far
lets have some fun and never change up for anyone
try not to miss me when im gone

prechorus
woahohoh woahohoh
i sold my soul to the open road
ill live my life alone

chorus
you wont find me in the same spot believe me
i could never stop my lifes turned upside down
meet me out past the train tracks im leaving
and not coming back youre right and i was wrong
this town will be the downfall of us all

verse 2
im gonna need you to try to follow along
i did the best that i could to try to write you songs
now go tell them we sold out like were the ones who changed
i write what i feel i say what i mean you cant buy sincerity
