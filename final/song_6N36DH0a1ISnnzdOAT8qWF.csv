provided for by his care
and the breast of one mother
and when you separate the world
remember the relation that bonded thee
to love and unity
and prefer not a stranger
before thy own love
if thy brothers in adversity
assist him
if thy sisters in trouble
forsake her not
so shall the fortunes of thy father
attribute to the support of his whole race
in his care we continue to evolve in your love to each other
