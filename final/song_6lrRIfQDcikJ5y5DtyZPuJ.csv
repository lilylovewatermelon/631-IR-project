uh uh uh

verse 1 fabolous lil mo
baby girl you know my situation
and sometimes i know you get impatient
but you dont put on a show to get ovations
take it to court and go through litigations
and i respect you gangsta
treat you like a princess and put some on your neck to thank ya
shes my pinch hitter
when the startin lineup aint playin right
i come off the bench wit her
it might sound like im gassin ya
but it take time to get from the backseat to the passenger
we been creepin and sneakin just to keep it from leakin
we so deep in our freakin that we dont sleep on the weekend
wifeys a little bit uptight
wonder why i keep coming home in the middle of the night
itll be alright if yall bump heads itll be a fight mmm
but i said itll be alright cmon

chorus mike shorey lil mo both
i really wanna be wit you be wit you
but i gotta be real wit you real wit you

i cant leave you alone no
and i know im livin wrong

you aint never step outta line or get outta pocket
so i made sure canary sent out your locket
to protect you ill get out and cock it
and you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket oh
you gon play dumb if cops do come through
i gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
but i know the boutiques and shops you run through
so i cop her one and cop you one too
you always get a daily page weekly ring
plus you aint too shy to do them freaky things
i aint gotta put a band on your finger
or worry bout you tellin the whole world im your man while i spring her
at first you was somethin i denied
somethin i would slide just to do somethin in the ride
but shorty theres somethin you provide
cause the entrée aint as good mmm
without somethin on the side you know

chorus mike shorey lil mo both
i really wanna be wit you be wit you
but i gotta be real wit you real wit you
i cant leave you alone no

verse 3 fabolous lil mo
