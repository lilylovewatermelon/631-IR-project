heart beatin fast let a nigga know that he alive live live live
fake niggas mad snakes
snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived rived rived rived
dont be sleepin on your level
cause its beauty in the struggle nigga beauty beauty
goes for all yall
its beauty in the struggle nigga beauty beauty
let me explain yeah

verse 1
its beauty in the struggle ugliness in the success
hear my words and listen to my signal of distress
i grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less
compared to some my niggas down the block man we were blessed
and life cant be no fairy tale no once upon a time
but i be goddamned if a nigga dont be tryin
so tell me momma please why you be drinking all the time
does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind
cause pain still lingers on mine
on the road to riches listen this is what youll find
the good news is nigga you came a long way
the bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
think being broke was better

verse 2
for whats money without happiness
or hard times without the people you love
though im not sure whats bout to happen next
i ask for strength from the lord man up above
cause i been strong so far but i can feel my grip loosenin
quick do somethin before you lose it for good get it back and use it for good
and touch the people how you did like before
im tired of livin with demons cause they always invitin more
think being broke was better now i dont mean that phrase with no disrespect
to all my niggas out there livin in debt
cashin minimal checks turn on the tv see a nigga rolex
and fantasize about a life with no stress
i mean this shit sincerely and as a nigga who was once in your shoes
livin with nothin to lose i hope one day you hear me
always gon be a bigger house somewhere but nigga feel me
long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
always gon be a whip thats better than the one you got
always gon be some clothes thats fresher than the ones you rock
always gon be a bitch thats badder out there on the tours
but you aint never gon be happy til you love yours
chorus
no such thing as a life thats better than yours love yours
no such thing as a life thats better than yours love yours
no such thing as a life thats better than yours love yours
no such thing no such thing
