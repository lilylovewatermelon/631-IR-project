all the windows swear to miss you
and the doors are cell block tight
sweet sedation sweep the issues
and the clocks about to strike
did it call you down are you back just yet
waiting now please come set me free
and the only sound is a minute left

prechorus
this could be this could be the last time

chorus
its a chance to fix mistakes
one more for the last time
dont you throw our dreams away
dont waste this chance with your smile
ten seconds left on this dial
this could be the last time

verse 2
along the staircase i dream to hear you
in a whisperquiet room
space for thinking space to scream to
but the echoes sound like you
not the stars at night in a pitchblack sky
i dont know just want to see you
but the time is right and it only flies
see the allamerican rejects liveget tickets as low as 245you might also likeprechorus
this could be this could be the last time

chorus
its a chance to fix mistakes
one more for the last time
does it throw our dreams away
dont waste this chance with your smile
ten seconds left on this dial
this could be the last time

postchorus
its only us its only now
a simple wish its only tonight
this could be the last time
now ive made our last mistake

bridge
one more for the last time
this could be this could be
does it blow our dreams away
this could be this could be

chorus 2
dont waste this chance with your smile
this could be this could be
ten seconds left on this dial
this could be this could be
this could be the last time
outro
its only us its only now
its only tonightembed"
