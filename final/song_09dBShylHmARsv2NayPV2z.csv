everyone and everything around mes always changing
everyone except me im stayin the same as if i was nothing
i dont sing my songs i bleed them i dont write unless i mean them
without cold the snows just rain without my voice its all the same

its okay were just scared hey

i dont really need to sleep much longer
but the longer i sleep the slower my heart beats
theres fire on my floor telling me to sleep some more
cry a little louder if you know what this means

chorus

its okay were just scared its okay were just scared
its okay were just scared its okay were just scared
its okay were just scared its okay
