i heard somebody knocking at the door
and i had a drink in hand
but i was looking for something more
when i put my eyes on you i fell in love with you
for the last time
i remember the dark brown of your eyes
and your olive skin and the look of sin
yeah you took me by surprise
when i put my hands on you
i fell in love with you
for the last time

chorus
because the brighter that we shine
leaves a bigger shadow in our wake
a story we can tell another time
but if this was love and i was wrong
then ill admit the mistakes we made were always mine
were always mine

verse 2
i told you to go left then i went right
though i told you that i loved you you couldnt tell i was lying
cause i put a spell on you
when i put my eyes on you
for the last time
and maybe im too young to settle down ohoo
cause i know that youd be good for me
but that i wouldnt stick around
and i dont wanna hurt you darling
i dont want to let you down again
for the last time
