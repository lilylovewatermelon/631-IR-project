verse 1 lil dude
we will never die real niggas they multiply
i watch my mother cry my man watched his mother get high
you know that ima do it i dont even gotta try
im smokin 93 that shit that put me in the sky
man hold that shit down you dont gotta fuckin lie
these bitches stay around they just tryna get high
them choppers they come supersized took a couple lives
i got a tear drop on my face but i will never cry
and she cant come around if she not down for the ride
sippin too much lean my stomach up another size
aint into all the hype cause niggas tell too many lives
and i know he dont want beef cause he wanna stay alive
