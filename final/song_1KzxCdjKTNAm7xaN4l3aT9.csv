its her first night on the town since she was just eighteen
a lady down on love and out of hope and dreams
the ties that once bound her now are broke away
and shes like a baby just learning how to play
she never thought that love could ever end so soon
her mind drifts back in time to a midsummer moon
when he asked her to marry and she gladly said okay
and a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday

chorus
now shes a lady down on love
she needs somebody to gently pick her up
shes got her freedom but shed rather be bound
to a man who would love her and never let her down

verse 2
well i know a lady thats down on her love
cause i used to hold her and have that special touch
but work took me a way from home late at nights
and i wasnt there when she turned out the lights
then both of us got lonely and i gave into lust
and she just couldnt live with a man she couldnt trust
