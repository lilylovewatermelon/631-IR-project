at any given small town buddy you can spot her
trucker hat buffalo flannel at the concert
grew up on mariah and shania down
a red dirt road driveway road driveway
diet coke can rollin round in her camry
wants to be a mama yeah she wants to get married
if you look up a country girl in the dictionary
youd see her face

prechorus
just when you think you got her figured out
thats when you learn you dont know nothin bout
when she goes

chorus
come pick me up in your truck i wanna drive
lets hit a buckten again down 55
thats my little rock n roll right there
crank til the speakers blow i swear
saying dont be a girl boy lets take another shot
dance with me now im making out in the parking lot
down home angel with a whole nother side
shes the oh no there she goes turning up my stereotype

verse 2
mama knows her heart but dont know about her tattoos
her and casamigos put together equal bad news
she can stop you all from turning just by looking at you
and now im a lucky sob when she says to me
see cole swindell liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likechorus
come pick me up in your truck i wanna drive
lets hit a buckten again down 55
thats my little rock n roll right there
crank til the speakers blow i swear
saying dont be a girl boy lets take another shot
dance with me now im making out in the parking lot
down home angel with a whole nother side
shes the oh no there she goes turning up my stereotype
