verse 1
yeah you wished for it me i worked for it
everyone passed on me like kurt warner
search warrant needed your career went missin
this aint overnight this is year ten visions
peers listen and they know that im up next
thats your girl why she do whatever russ says
success is somethin that im blessed with mentally yeah
i got plaques for my raps and my melodies
cant forget about the beats too im the best kept secret
real shit or fake shit pledge your allegiance
i was off for so long now im on though
bitch im talkin dont you interrupt this god flow
thank you to anyone who ever slammed the door on me
because of you i did it myself so it means more to me
