no im not color blind
i know the world is black and white
i try to keep an open mind
but i just cant sleep on this tonight

chorus
stop this train
i want to get off and go home again
i cant take the speed its moving in
i know i cant
but honestly wont someone stop this train

verse 2
dont know how else to say it
dont want to see my parents go
one generations length away
from fighting life out on my own

chorus
stop this train
i want to get off and go home again
i cant take the speed its moving in
i know i cant
but honestly wont someone stop this train

verse 3
so scared of getting older
im only good at being young
so i play the numbers game
to find a way to say that life has just begun

bridge 1
had a talk with my old man
said help me understand
he said turn 68 youll renegotiate

chorus
dont stop this train
dont for a minute change the place youre in
and dont think i couldnt ever understand
i tried my hand
john honestly well never stop this train

bridge 2
once in a while when its good
itll feel like it should
and theyre all still around
and theyre still safe and sound
and you dont miss a thing
til you cry when youre driving away in the dark
chorus
singing stop this train
i want to get off and go home again
i cant take the speed its moving in
i know i cant
cause now i see ill never stop this train27embed"
