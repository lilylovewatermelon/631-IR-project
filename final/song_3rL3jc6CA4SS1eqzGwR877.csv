dont you cherish me to sleep ohoh ohohoh
never keep your eyelids clipped
hold me for the pops and clicks
i was only for the fathers crib

verse 2
hair old long along
your neck onto your shoulder blades ohoh ohohoh
always keep that message taped
cross your breasts you wont erase
i was only for your very space

verse 3
hip under nothing
propped up by your other one face way from the sun
just have to keep a dialogue
teach our bodies haunt the cause
i was only trying to spell a loss

verse 4
joy its all founded
pincher with the skin inside ohoh ohohoh
you pinned me with your black sphere eyes
you know that all the ropes untied
i was only for to die beside
you might also likebridge
so its storming on the lake
little waves our bodies break
theres a fire going out
but theres really nothing to the south
swollen orange and light let through
your onepiece swimmer stuck to you

verse 5
sold im ever
open ears and open eyes ohoh ohohoh
wake up to your starboard bride
who goes in and then stays inside
oh the demons come they can subside

voicemail outro
really great sorry i like really dont want to be with people right now i cant really do it14embed"
