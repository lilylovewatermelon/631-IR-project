i wont suffer be broken get tired or wasted
surrender to nothing or will give up what i
started and stop this from end to beginning
a new day is coming and i am finally free

chorus

run away run away go chase yourself
run away run away now ill attack

verse 2
i wouldve kept you forever but we had to sever
it ended for both of us faster than a
kill off this thinking its starting to sink in
im losing control now but without you i can finally see

chorus
run away run away ill attack
run away run away go chase yourself
run away run away now ill attack

your honesty like a back that hides a knife
i promise you i promise you
i am finally free
