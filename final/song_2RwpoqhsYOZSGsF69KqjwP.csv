you stopped saying goodnight
that was the first sign that you were letting go
now you dont see me the same way
youre looking at me like im only getting old

prechorus
and iii shoulda known
that you were only scared to be alone

chorus
i couldnt say much i was distracted
you seemed so anxious like you had something to hide
tell me its nothing i dont believe you
i know that look you get when youre about to lie
i feel so stupid mmmm
cause i still say goodnight

verse 2
i always tried to impress you
got so dressed up and you never seemed to care
your ridiculous expectations lack of validations
was nеver fucking fair

prechorus
and iii shoulda known
that you were only scarеd to be alone
