all of us believe that this is not up to you
the fact of the matter is that its up to me
hey hey hey hey hey hey lets go

verse 1
how can we fake this anymore anymore
to turn our backs away and choose to just ignore
choose to just ignore
some say some say its ignorance
it makes me feel some innocence
some say it takes away a part of me
that i wont let go of

chorus
tell me why cant you see its not the way not the way
when we all fall down it will be too late
why is there no reason we cant change no reason
when we all fall down who will take the blame will it take

verse 2
nothing could ever be this real be this real
a life unsatisfied that i could never feel i could never feel
some say this futures not so bright
that some cant make the sacrifice so bright
its much more than just black and white
and i wont follow
see sum 41 liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likechorus
tell me why cant you see its not the way not the way
when we all fall down it will be too late
why is there no reason we cant change no reason
when we all fall down who will take the blame will it take

bridge
times like these ive come to see how
everything but time is running out
hey hey hey hey hey hey
what all of us believe in what we need
hey hey hey hey hey hey
what we haves what we dont see

chorus
tell me why cant you see its not the way not the way
when we all fall down it will be too late
why is there no reason we cant change no reason
when we all fall down who will take the blame will it take

outro
cant you see its not the way not the way
so how long has this gone i dont see this ending
when we all fall down it wont be too late
its too late we cant change what has now begun
why is there no reason we cant change no reason
we have time its not right why are we pretending
when we all fall down who will take the blame will it take
we fit along for so long we knew this all alongembed"
