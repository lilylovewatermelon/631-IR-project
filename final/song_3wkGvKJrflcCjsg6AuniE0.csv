hard to follow my dreams workin this 9 to 5
people keep tellin me my check is on the way
so sun up to sundown im grindin tryin to make it by
prayin for my shift to come and take away the pain
that day is finally here
that day is finally here
that day is finally here
new shoes new clothes new whip new chain
new wrist knew that knew this finally here
that day is finally here
that day is finally here
new shoes new clothes new whip new chain
new wrist knew that knew this

verse 1
no no i wont settle for nothing less than the air that i breathe
iii know its a struggle but who the hell gon do it for me
who the hell gon do it free
if i dont get up and bust my ass thats my motto
i cant put my faith in the lotto
luck dont stay nowhere near where i go
unless you ride that muthafucka
and you be lucky enough to get away in the grave
what can i do what can i say i tried to get paid
but i got grazed the bullet went through
but i aint get paid
now what do i appreciate my job
hey boss im comin in late

verse 2
lil cousin got it right
and bike without no frame ride the same rides without no brain
life aint life without no shame
if i make it out the hood damn right im gon change
my cell phone number
but the area code still gon be 305 tho
my friends who was my friends just like my kin
walked em in model
but please wipe your feet on the rug
you can keep your shoes on its all love
boy let me stop im dreamin too much now who the hell
gon give up a million bucks
nobody but god right now i could use me one of them black cards
im scarred i fell apart i came here with stars its hard huh

verse 3
ffffindin me
that day i been tryin to reach that pay i been dyin to see
boy them folk wouldnt lie to me
i thought money aint grow on trees
depends on the roots how you plant that seed
they quit you cant see no leaves
hold up i need my versaces
grace covers of magazines my mother she proud of me
myself i the one who the haters thought wasnt gon be shit
big yachts every day i get seasick i was broke the prefix
my book say why yall gave that nigga some cash
i wrote a song about it wanna hear it here it goes
