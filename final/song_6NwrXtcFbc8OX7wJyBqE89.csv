verse 1 liz
just an outline made of skin
and my walls are paper thin
i wanna let you color me in me in me in
feel like i’m drowning from the sound
of all the silence all around
my thoughts are bound i’m going down
i’m turning inside out

prechorus liz
this time i finally need a light a light
tired of seeing in black and white white

chorus liz
having flashes in my mind
can’t take the ticking of time
the time that’s passing by

prechorus liz
this time i finally need a light a light
tired of seeing in black and white white

chorus liz
having flashes in my mind
can’t take the ticking of time
the time that’s passing by

tired of seeing in black and white white

chorus liz
having flashes in my mind
can’t take the ticking of time
the time that’s passing by
