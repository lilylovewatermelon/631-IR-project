you pull on your armour
you put up defences
why do you want to
because im here to protect you
so take it easy
ill make it so easy
you can lay your head down
and well leave it til tomorrow

chorus
you seem to believe you belong to somebody else
when you leave me alone in this world you know that im in hell
do you know what its like to be lonely and by yourself

verse 2
when your life is tangled
you wear your disguises
but why do you need to
when im standing here beside you
so take it easy
i make it so easy
you can lay your head down
and well leave it til tomorrow

chorus
you seem to believe you belong to somebody else
when you leave me alone in this world you know that im in hell
do you know what its like to be lonely and by yourself
you might also likebridge
slipping through my fingers and into anothers
tell me why wont you turn back

chorus
you seem to believe you belong to somebody else
you know what its like you shouldnt have to be told
when you leave me alone in this world you know that im in hell
its hard enough when youre alone in the world
do you know what its like to be lonely and by yourself
you seem to believe you belong to somebody else
you know what its like you shouldnt have to be told
when you leave me alone in this world you know that im in hell
its hard enough when youre alone in the world
do you know what its like to be lonely and by yourselfembed"
