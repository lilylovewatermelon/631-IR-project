i dont care where as long as youre with me
and im with you and you let me

let me love you like a woman
let me hold you like a baby
let me shine like a diamond

dont make me be bittersweet
let me love you like a woman
let me hold you like a baby
let me hold you like a baby

verse 2
i come from a small town far away
i only mention it cause im ready to leave la

we could get lost in the purple rain
talk about the good ol days
we could get high on some pink champagne
baby let me count the ways
