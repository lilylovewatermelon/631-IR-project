verse 1 kanye west
i know its past visiting hours
but can i please give her these flowers
the doctor dont wanna take procedures
he claim her heart cant take the anesthesia
itll send her body into a seizure
that lil thing by the hospital bed itll stop beepin
hey chick im at a loss for words
what do you say at this time remember when i was nine
tell her everything gon be fine but i be lyin
her family cryin they want her to live and she tryin
im arguin like what kind of doctor can we fly in
you know the best medicine go to people thats paid
if magic johnson got a cure for aids
and all the broke motherfuckers passed away
you telling me if my grandmas in the nba
right now shed be okay
but since she was just a secretary
working for the church for 35 years
things sposed to stop right here
my grandfather tryin to pull it together he strong
thats where i get my confidence from
i asked the nurse did you do the research
she asked me can you sign some tshirts
bitch is you smokin reefer
you dont see that we hurt but still–
see kanye west liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likehook bill withers  tony williams
i smile
when roses come to see me
and i cant wait for a sunny day seeing it through your eyes
cant wait for the clouds to break

verse 2 kanye west
they outside of the emergency room room
you can feel my heartbeat beat beat
if she gon pull through we gon find out soon
but right now she sleep sleep sleep
my momma say they say she could pass away any day
hey chick what these doctors know anyway
let me see the xrays i aint no expert im just hurt
cousin kim took off of work
plus my aunt shirley aunt beverly aunt klaye and aunt jean
so many aunties we could have an auntie team
feel like amerie its just 1 thing
when they said that she made it you see they eyes gleam
i think we at a alltime high
to get there we run we fly we drive
cause with my family we know where home is
so instead of sending flowers we the roses

hook bill withers  tony williams
i smile
when roses come to see me
and i cant wait for a sunny day seeing it through your eyes
