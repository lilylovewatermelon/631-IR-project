theres just one kind of coffee at the café
a couple kinds of beer at amoco
where hard work pays and jesus saves
weekends come and hell gets raised
dont eat much we cant hunt fish or grow

chorus
and we like life that way
sweet and slow and simple
aint for much we pray
cause all we needs a little
so just remember when youre drivin through nowhere
to us thats the middle of somewhere

verse 2
it may look like some empty off the interstate
placе between where youvе been and where you go
the folks round here we call it home
from the cradle to the stone
we dont mind its all weve ever known

chorus
and we like life that way
sweet and slow and simple
aint for much we pray
cause all we needs a little
so just remember when youre drivin through nowhere
to us thats the middle of somewhere

bridge
i know its just another drop in the ocean of map dots
but it means more than the world to us

chorus
cause we like life that way
sweet and slow and simple
it aint for much we pray
cause all we needs a little
so just remember when youre drivin through nowhere
so just remember when youre drivin through nowhere
to us thats the middle of somewhere
