where did you go when i woke up
you were gone
find someone to replace you
ill never be alone
i sit around so anxious for you to
call my phone
she went up to heaven said shell be back
later on

hook
in love with an angel she dont belong to me
im in love x3
in love with an angel she dont belong to me
im in love x3
in love with an angel she dont belong to me
im in love x3
in love with an angel
im in love x7

verse 2
and i just cant chase the clouds
out of my mind
shes the cause of my heart ache but i
ill be fine
cause when we kiss theres no playing around
theres no time
