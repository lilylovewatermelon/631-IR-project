ooh

verse 1
this time youre really dead
once followed but always led
you thought youd rise above it all
its all inside your head
all rippin it up in shreds
i know someday you’re gonna fall

chorus
and i dont wanna say i told you so
but i told you so now youve lost control
and i dont wanna be the rise and fall
gimme more or nothin at all

interlude
mm

verse 2
youre in an awful way
sucked in by what you crave
they just can’t wait to see you crawl
and you can only laugh
give in to the other half
theyre only tearin down your walls
see the offspring liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likechorus
and i dont wanna say i told you so
but i told you so now youve lost control
and i dont wanna be the rise and fall
gimme more or nothin at all

guitar solo

bridge
theyve come to see you rise and fall
theyre only tearin down your walls
theyve come to see you rise and fall
and i dont wanna say youve lost control

chorus
and i dont wanna say i told you so
but i told you so now youve lost control
and i dont wanna be the rise and fall
gimme more or nothin at allembed"
