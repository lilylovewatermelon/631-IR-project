late one night behind corn whiskey
i fell asleep with a guitar in my hand
i dreamed about the ghosts of mississippi
and the blues came walking like a man

verse 1
without a word i passed that guitar over
he tuned it up like id never seen
a crooked smile was his expression
then he closed his eyes and began to sing

chorus 2
oh lord why have you forsaken me
got me down in mississippi
where i dont want to be
oh lord why have you forsaken me
got me down in mississippi
where i dont want to be

verse 2
when i woke up i looked into the mirror
i saw no reflection for a while
but as my eyes came into focus
i recognized that crooked smile
see the steeldrivers liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likechorus 2

got me down in mississippi
