prop open the door
i can actually see my breath tonight
but that doesnt mean im breathing
crack a smile just for the sake of it
this could take a while a long while
silence is golden
especially in this case

prechorus spencer chamberlain aaron gillespie
im not too sure that i want it to be this way
open mouth closed eyes no words are escaping
its all a blur its too dark to see aint it pretty
the way it all streaks together at night
together at night

chorus spencer chamberlain
i think its time to turn around
i really want to go home tonight
i think its time to turn around
i really want to go home tonight

postchorus spencer chamberlain
i feel like this is going nowhere
i feel like this is going nowhere
try to think of something quick
and trust the direction of the driver

no lights no lights no signs no signs

what an easy way to break the ice
