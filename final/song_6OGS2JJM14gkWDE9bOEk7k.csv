you aint got a dress that i dont like
you aint got a pair of jeans that dont fit you just right
theres not a minute in the day
that you dont knock me out you dont blow me away

prechorus
but girl now that the suns gone down whoaohoh
looking at you right here and now baby

chorus
something about that southern sky
sitting back behind that moon
it goes perfect with your eyes
girl tonight looks good on you
its something about the way youre smiling
making the stars fall right on queue
i just gotta tell you baby
tonight looks good on you

verse 2
i can taste the midnight on your lips
makes me just wanna lean in for another kiss
wind blowing your hair around
girl it makes me want to lay you down
youve been beautiful a million times
but ive never seen you look like this no

something about that southern sky
sitting back behind that moon
it goes perfect with your eyes
girl tonight looks good on you
its something about the way youre smiling
making the stars fall right on queue
i just gotta tell you baby
tonight looks good on you

bridge
looks so good on your skin
i dont ever no i never
i dont ever ever want to end baby

chorus
something about that southern sky
sitting back behind that moon
it goes perfect with your eyes
girl tonight looks good on you
its something about the way youre smiling
making the stars fall right on queue
i just gotta tell you baby
tonight looks good on you

outro
tonight looks good on you
i just gotta tell you baby
you look good at party
good at the bar
something bout underneath these stars
you look good at the house
good in the car
youre looking so good anywhere you are
tonight tonight looks good on you
tonight looks good on you
i just gotta tell you baby9embed"
