i am not a stranger to the dark
hide away they say
cause we dont want your broken parts
ive learned to be ashamed of all my scars
run away they say

but i wont let them break me down to dust
i know that theres a place for us
for we are glorious

when the sharpest words wanna cut me down
im gonna send a flood gonna drown em out
i am brave i am bruised
i am who im meant to be this is me

im not scared to be seen
i make no apologies this is me
