stood in the rain and watched you go
i feel a lump in my throat
and this is far from joy ooh
ooh hey
i never seemed to learn
that high makes things harder
that high i get from you
ooh oh

chorus
ive figured out that joy is not in your arms
i know ill always ache with an empty heart
i think its time to run cause im seeing stars
im seeing stars watch me fall apart

verse 2
i think of dying all the time
but ive got joy to take my side
fear is my favorite ride ooh
hey oh

chorus
ive figured out that joy is not in your arms
i know ill always ache with an empty heart
i think its time to run cause im seeing stars
im seeing stars watch me fall apart

ive figured out that joy is not in your arms
i know ill always ache with an empty heart
i think its time to run cause im seeing stars
