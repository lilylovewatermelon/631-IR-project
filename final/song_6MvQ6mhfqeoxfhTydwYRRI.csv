you build me up you knock me down
provoke a smile and make me frown
you are the queen of runaround
you know its true
you chew me up and spit me out
enjoy the taste i leave in your mouth
you look at me i look at you
neither of us know what to do

chorus
there may not be another way to your heart
so i guess id better find a new way in
i shiver when i hear your name
i think about you but its not the same
i wont be satisfied til im under your skin

verse 2
immobilized by the thought of you
im paralyzed by the sight of you
im hypnotized by the words you say
not true but i believe em anyway
so come to bed its getting late
theres no more time for us to waste
remember how my body tastes
you feel your heart begin to race
