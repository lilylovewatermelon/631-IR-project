with a corncob pipe and a button nose
and two eyes made out of coal

frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
he was made of snow but the children know
how he came to life one day

there must have been some magic in
that old top hat they found
for when they placed it on his head
he began to dance around

o frosty the snowman
was alive as he could be
and the children say he could laugh and play
just the same as you and me

frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
with a corncob pipe and a button nose
and two eyes made out of coal

frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
he was made of snow but he came to life one day

there must have been some magic in
that old top hat they found
for when they placed it on his head
he began to dance around
you might also likefrosty the snowman
knew the sun was hot that day
so he said lets run
and well have some fun
now before i melt away

frosty the snowman
had to hurry on his way
but he waved goodbye saying
dont you cry
ill be back again some dayembed"
