he wants to be he wants to be with everything under the sun
he wants to be he wants to be with everything under the sun

chorus
and like a legend who rises and unfolds
i cannot be his only one

verse 2
he makes me feel he makes me feel like you used to
whoa like you used to
he makes me feel he makes me feel like you used to
whoa like you used to

chorus
and like a fickle flower when it first sees the light
i cannot show just how i fight
and like a fickle flower when it first sees the light
i cannot show just how i fight

bridge
babe i saw you walking it was after midnight
carrying nothing except for a flashlight
you wanted to be romeo so low at my window
you wanted to be romeo so low at my window
will you open the door for me if you believe in chivalry
will you open the door for me if you believe in chivalry
for i do not think you low though you bow to me soso
i do not think you low though you bow to me soso
i know you want to drink from the purest wine
but the drink is far more sour than you would ever think

he wants to be he wants to be with everything under the sun
and she wants to burn she wants to burn hot like that sun
whoa hot like that sun

chorus
just like a legend who rises and unfolds like a legend
i cannot be his only one his only one
and like a callous cold callous woman like a woman who never sees
shell never know what she did done

outro
so like this legend that rises and unfolds
ill never be his only oneembed"
