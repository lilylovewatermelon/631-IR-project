verse 1
i think prince might have said it best
when he said the beautiful ones  they hurt you every time
she’s the reason for all my stress
and yet she’s the only one that can truly ease my mind
prechorus
and i think that we could be alright
with the way the we just chill
how she touch me and how she kiss you
if it wasnt for her other guys
i can’t stand to think that he’s getting the same loving that i get
chorus
so tell me what is it gonna be
make the decision theres just one rule
tell him that you want me
i know what i want girl i want you
what is it gonna be
verse 2
i cant get enough make your mind up
let me know what you want not complaining okay
i am wanna be your man but hes in the way
so i cant understand
prechorus
and i think that we could be alright
with the way that we just chill
how she touch me and how she kiss me
if it wasnt for her other guys
i cant stand to think that hes getting the same loving that i get
chorus
so tell me what is it gonna be
make the decision theres just one rule
tell him that you want me
i know what i want girl i want you
what is it gonna be
bridge
and its hard to see you happy
its probably cause you just left and thats so unfair to me baby
only if you could get rid of him we could be happy
baby let me know
chorus
whats it going to be
make the decision theres just one rule
tell him that you want me
i know what i want girl i want you
