every time we lie awake
after every hit we take
every feeling that i get
but i havent missed you yet
every roommate kept awake
by every sigh and scream we make
all the feelings that i get
but i still dont miss you yet
only when i stop to think about it

chorus
i hate everything about you
why do i love you
i hate everything about you
why do i love you
