look i just want to break up all your shit
call your mama phone let her know that she raised a bitch
then dial tone click
and fuck your little fakeass friends
comin round actin like they my bros
i seen yall little group texts
where you all like to brag about your hoes
and you can tell your little bitch
i screenshotted all her naked pics
oh you wanna send nudes to my man
wake up and see your boobs on the gram lil bitch
i cannot stand you right hand to jesus
i might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers
smash your tv from best buy
you gon turn me into left eye
i dont wanna hear bout invasion of privacy
i had a feelin it turns out you lie to me
im holdin back everything thats inside of me
how you out fuckin with bitches that follow me

verse 2 cardi b
all i can see is you and her in different scenarios
beyoncé on my stereo resentment on repeat
ima make you a bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach
serve it to you like here you go nigga bon appétit
look did you give it to her raw you love her or nah
you risk your whole home for a ho from the bar

gettin more mad at you thinkin bout stabbin you
dont even know that you this close to dyin
you gon wake up like why you got an attitude
