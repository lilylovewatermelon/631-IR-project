lets kiss not fight
try to do whats right tonight
make love not war

lets kiss not fight

verse
tonight well make the prettiest song
that no one will ever hear
no one will ever hear
no one will ever
these aint the times to be alone
cliché the end is near
cliché the end is near
cliché the end is
quickly approaching while we carry on
no one is promised another day
why cant the story end like fairytales often do
before i let you leave ive got to say

chorus
lets kiss not fight
try to do whats right tonight
make love not war
what the hell are we living for
lets kiss not fight
try to do whats right tonight
make love not war
what the hell are we living for

chorus
lets kiss not fight
try to do whats right tonight
make love not war
what the hell are we living for
lets kiss not fight
try to do whats right tonight
make love not war
what the hell are we living for
lets kiss not fight
try to do whats right tonight
make love not war
what the hell are we living for
lets kiss not fight

make love not war
what the hell are we living forembed"
