on my phone

verse 1
time spent sitting all alone time spent looking at my phone
time spent sitting all alone time spent looking at my phone
i try to pull the curtains back turn you off but cant detach
when all i want and all i know is time spent looking at my phone
on my phone

verse 2
find me when the lights go down signing in and signing out
gods descend to take me home and find me staring at my phone
im wondering where the hours went as im losing consciousness
my sullen face is all aglow time spent looking at my phone

chorus 1
last thing that you need is the new shiny feature
all the memories youve shared devoured by perverted creatures
nothing can compete with the first time you saw her
passing strangers on the street spending every moment looking at their phones
on my phone

verse 3
time spent sitting all alone time spent looking at my phone
time spent sitting all alone time spent looking at my phone
i call you you dont call me back almost had a heart attack
im listening to the window moan time spent looking at my phone
you might also likechorus 2
clouds are getting full so you close all the windows
i would never let you die even if our love is ornamental
you know what you need is a way to remember
you can never find the time if you spend everyday looking at your phone

instrumental bridge

chorus 3
you should come with me we can lose ourselves in nothing
copy faces from the feed and then try to turn them into something
even if you choose to believe that its ending
youll come back to me again you can go ahead and stop pretending
