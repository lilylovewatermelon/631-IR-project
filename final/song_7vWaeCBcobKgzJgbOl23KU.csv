my legs are dangling off the edge
the bottom of the bottle is my only friend
i think ill slit my wrist again and im gone gone gone gone
my legs are dangling off the edge
a stomach full of pills didnt work again
ill put a bullet in my head and im gone gone gone gone

verse 1 charlie scene
gone too far yeah im gone again
its gone on too long tell you how it ends
im sitting on the edge with my two best friends
ones a bottle of pills and ones a bottle of gin
im twenty stories up yeah up at the top
i polished off this bottle now its pushing me off
asphalt to me has never looked so soft
i bet my mama found my letter now shes calling the cops
i gotta take this opportunity before i miss it
cause now i hear the sirens and theyre off in the distance
believe me when i tell you that ive been persistent
cause im more scarred more scarred than my wrist is
ive been trying too long with too dull of a knife
but tonight i made sure that i sharpened it twice
i never bought a suit before in my life
but when you go to meet god you know you wanna look nice

so if i survive then ill see you tomorrow
yeah ill see you tomorrow

chorus charlie scene  danny
my legs are dangling off the edge
the bottom of the bottle is my only friend
i think ill slit my wrist again and im gone gone gone gone
my legs are dangling off the edge
a stomach full of pills didnt work again
ill put a bullet in my head and im gone gone gone gone

verse 2 johnny 3 tears
we hit the sky there goes the light
no more sun whys it always night
when you cant sleep well you cant dream
when you cant dream well whats life mean
we feel a little pity but dont empathize
the old are getting older watch a young man die
a mother and a son and someone you know
smile at each other and realize you dont
you dont know what happened to that kid you raised
or what happened to the father who swore hed stay
i didnt know cause you didnt say
now mama feels guilt yeah mama feels pain
when you were young you never thought youd die
found that you could but too scared to try
looked in the mirror and you said goodbye
climbed to the roof to see if you could fly
prechorus charlie scene  danny
so if i survive then ill see you tomorrow
yeah ill see you tomorrow

chorus charlie scene  danny
my legs are dangling off the edge
the bottom of the bottle is my only friend
i think ill slit my wrist again and im gone gone gone gone
my legs are dangling off the edge
a stomach full of pills didnt work again
ill put a bullet in my head and im gone gone gone gone

outro petra christensen
i wish that i could fly way up in the sky
like a bird so high oh i might just try
i wish that i could fly way up in the sky
like a bird so high oh i might just try
