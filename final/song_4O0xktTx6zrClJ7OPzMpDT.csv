can you turn the beat up
a little louder
there you go

verse 1
people love you when they on your mind
a thought is loves currency
and i been thinkin bout her all the time
i never seen somebody put together perfectly
what would i have to do to call you mine
someone like you is so hard to find
you can open up your eyes or you can walk in blind
all i ask is that you hurry i wont hurt you dont you worry
listen to me ima set you free
he aint gonna break your heart again
go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
when your imaginations on pretend
i never thought that it would feel this way
you never taught me how to heal the pain
i wish you caught me on a different day
when it was easier to be happy

chorus
just a little taste and you know she got you
can you hide away can you hide away
sound of silence as they all just watch you
i kinda find it strange how the times have changed
i wish we could go and be
free once baby you and me
we could change the world forever
and never come back again
lets leave it all in the rearview
lets leave it all in the rearview girl
you dont have to cry
you dont have to cry

mend a broken heart girl if you can
i dont expect you to be capable
you got the world right in your hands
that responsibility is unescapable
i promise that ill be a different man
please give me the chance to go and live again
im havin some trouble can you give a hand
it seems perfection really is so unattainable
dont even say you bout to end it all
your life precious aint no need to go and kill yourself
im not so sure that theres an end at all
i wish the truth would just reveal itself
who do you call to make it to the top
and who do you call to make the shootin stop
and who do you call to give the coupe a wash
after everything i did i think im still myself

chorus
just a little taste and you know she got you
can you hide away can you hide away
sound of silence as they all just watch you
i kinda find it strange how the times have changed
i wish we could go and be
free once baby you and me
we could change the world forever
and never come back again
lets leave it all in the rearview
lets leave it all in the rearview girl
you dont have to cry
you dont have to cry169embed"
