back and forth that voice of yours keeps me up at night
help me search to find the words that eat you up inside
i go side to side like the wildest tides in your hurricane
and i only hide what is on my mind because i cant explain

chorus
what if i do lord what if i dont
id have to lose everything just to find you
what if i do lord what if i dont
id have to lose everything just to find you

verse 2
its my turn this soul wont burn so throw me in the fire
trophies earned and lessons learned from wicked little liars
we could pave new roads with their cold gravestones and wind them through the pines
should i stay or should i go alone i cannot decide

chorus
what if i do lord what if i dont
id have to lose everything just to find you
what if i do lord what if i dont
id have to lose everything just to find you
