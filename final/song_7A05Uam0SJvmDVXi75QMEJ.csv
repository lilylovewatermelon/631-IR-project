your smile
will always be one of my favorite things
like backyard barbecues and front porch swings
an evenin breeze
through a window screen

verse 2
your smile
makes me feel just like a child inside
like christmas mornin sparkling red and bright
and grandpas pipe
and my first bike

chorus
your smile
like daylight dripping through the mountain pines
pure sunshine summertime
your smile
like a wheat field in the southern breeze
apple trees
sweet and ripe

verse 3
your smile
so much joy from such a simple thing
like an old wheelbarrow filled with summer rain
a blue sky day
and sun on my face
see josh turner liveget tickets as low as 45you might also likeand your smile

chorus
your smile
like daylight dripping through the mountain pines
pure sunshine
summertime
your smile
like a wheat field in the southern breeze
apple trees
sweet and ripe

verse 4
your smile
right there with butter beans and cherry pie
and all the other simple joys of life
that warm my heart
and make it all worthwhile
