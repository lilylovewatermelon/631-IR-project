how can you see into my eyes
like open doors
leading you down into my core
where ive become so numb

prechorus amy lee
without a soul soul
my spirits sleeping somewhere cold
until you find it there and lead it back home

chorus paul mccoy amy lee
wake me up
wake me up inside
i cant wake up
wake me up inside
save me
call my name and save me from the dark
wake me up
bid my blood to run
i cant wake up
before i come undone
save me
save me from the nothing ive become

verse 2 amy lee

you cant just leave me ooh oh
breathe into me and make me real make me real
bring bring me me to life

verse 3 paul mccoy amy lee
all this time i cant believe i couldnt see
kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
ive been sleeping a thousand years it seems
got to open my eyes to everything
without a thought without a voice without a soul
dont let me die here
there must be something more
bring me to life

chorus paul mccoy amy lee
wake me up
wake me up inside
i cant wake up

save me from the nothing ive become
