yeah ohh yeah yeah ohh
i feel like dancing i feel like dancing
i smell something in the air thats making me high
i said i smell something in the air thats making me high

verse 1
okay here we go doremifaso fasolatidaso
lyrical roscoe kick back the tabasco
you motherfuckers must just not know the ticktock so
time to show you the most kickass flow in the cosmos
picasso with a pickaxe a sick asshole
tictactoe cross your sixpack with xacto
knives stranglin wives with thick lasso
big bags of the grass zigzags im with the doc so
you know how that go skull and the crossbones
this is poison to boys and girls who do not know
you do not wanna try this at home my lil vato
this is neither the time nor the place to get macho
so crack a sixpack sit back with some nachos
maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
its not what you expected nor what you thought so
bout time that you wake the fuck up smell the pot smoke

chorus
it must be the ganja its the marijuana
thats creeping up on me why im so high
maybe its the henny that has gotten in me
whatevers got into me i dont mind
i said its the ganja its the marijuana
thats creeping up on me why im so high
maybe its the henny that has gotten in me
whatevers got into me i dont mind

your dreams are gettin fulfilled ooh im literally gettin a chill
spittin at will me and dre have just finished splittin a pill
youre submittin to skill sittin still
im admittin im beginnin to feel like i dont think anyones real
faced with a dilemma i can be dalai lama
and be calm or bring drama a step beyond of jeffrey dahmer
please dont upset me mama youre lookin sexy mama
dont know if its the lala or the rum and pepsi mama
dont wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
be used as extra topping the next time i make a pizza
how many people you know who can name every serial
killer who ever existed in a row
put em in chronological order beginnin with jack the ripper
name the time and place from the body the bag the zipper
location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped
the trunk that they were stuffed in the model the make the plate
and which model which lake they found her in how they attacked the victim
say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
which knife and which gun what kid what wife and which nun
dont stop i like this its fun the fuckin nights just begun

chorus
it must be the ganja its the marijuana
thats creeping up on me why im so high
maybe its the henny that has gotten in me
whatevers got into me i dont mind
i said its the ganja its the marijuana
thats creeping up on me why im so high
maybe its the hindi that has gotten in me
whatevers got into me i dont mind
verse 3
when im behind the mic dynamites what its kinda like
youre stuck with the same stick that youre tryna light
behind the board sits dre legends are made this way
isnt it safe to say this is the way it should be
maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
heres a dosage of the antidote now you give him some
he can give her some she can give them some
get behind a linndrum make up a beat and cure the sucker syndrome
the spinnin drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin some
startin from scratch and then endin up at the ending of
capable of winnin a pulitzer
so unbelievable its a titanium cranium thats full of sur–
–prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
you stare into your stereos high
good evening this isnt even a weed thing
i aint even smoke anything i aint even drinking

chorus
it must be the ganja its the marijuana
thats creeping up on me why im so high
maybe its the henny that has gotten in me
whatevers got into me i dont mind
it must be the ganja its the marijuana
thats creeping up on me why im so high
maybe its the hindi that has gotten in me
whatevers got into me i dont mind44embed"
