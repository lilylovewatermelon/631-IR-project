ladies and gentlemen
introducing the chocolate starfish
and the hotdog flavored water
bring it on
get the fuck up
yeah check one two
listen up listen up
here we go here we go

verse 1
its a fucked up world world and a fucked up place place
everybodys judged by their fucked up face
fucked up dreams dreams fucked up life life
a fucked up kid with a fucked up knife
fucked up moms moms and fucked up dads dads
its a fucked up cop with a fucked up badge
fucked up job job with fucked up pay
and a fucked up boss this a fucked up day
fucked up press press with fucked up lies lies
while lethals in the back with the fucked up eyes

refrain
hey its on
everybody knows its on
hey its on
everybody knows its on

aint it a shame that you cant say fuck fuck
fucks just a word and its all fucked up
like a fucked up punk punk with a fucked up mouth mouth
a nine inch nail ill get knocked the fuck out
fucked up aids aids from fucked up sex sex
fakeass titties on a fucked up chest
were all fucked up so what you wanna do
with fucked up me and fucked up you
chorus
you wanna fuck me like an animal
youd like to burn me on the inside
you like to think that im a perfect drug
just know that nothin you do will bring you closer to me

verse 3
aint life a bitch bitch a fucked up bitch a bitch
a fucked up sore with a fucked up stitch
a fucked up head head its a fucked up shame
swingin on my nuts is a fucked up game
jealousy fillin up a fucked up mind
its real fucked up like a fucked up crime
if i say fuck two more times
thats fortysix fucks in this fucked up rhyme
prechorus
