my whole life in a plastic sack
temperatures falling
like a drug you sucked me in

late at night when im all alone
cant sleep cause somethings wrong
think i need something
like a drug i just cant win

on my knees darling so demanding
find a vein sweetheart plug yourself in

youre like a drug that i just cant kick
i give you up and it makes me sick
the shakes come on and they come on quick
youre like the drug that i just cant quit

my friends say youre no good for me
they tell me constantly
i never listen
like a drug youre everything

on my knees darling so demanding
find a vein sweetheart plug yourself in
you might also likeyoure like a drug that i just cant kick
i give you up and it makes me sick
the shakes come on and they come on quick
youre like a drug that i just cant quit

they try to fade you i try to get clean
oh youre never gonna leave
youve taken all of me and
i feel so strung out

thought i heard you said something like
youll get your pill
and theres only one way out of here

youre like a drug that i just cant kick
i give you up and it makes me sick
the shakes come on and they come on quick
youre like a drug that i just cant quitembed"
