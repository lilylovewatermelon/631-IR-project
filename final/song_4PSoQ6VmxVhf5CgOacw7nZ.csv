touchoftrent be wildin with it

verse 1 lil durk
they told me its all love but i love all
im cash appin a couple hundred whenever my brother call
sometimes i like to scandalize feel like im above em all
it was a joke when he copped out now he wanna jump the wall
them niggas always with some goofies gettin jumped at malls
i was tired of fuckin it was one more condom i made the condom fall
from stall  dean jacket that shit turned to gucci scarf
like fuck the whole world no matter who involved

verse 2 lil durk
man its all love
you cant love me without my brother cause its all us
im off a perc my brother doodie he off a small bus
but im a baller when i pass the ball i yell hut
gotta watch them cheesy sneaky bitches they be stealin nut
i talk down on the trenches hoes knowin damn well i still fucked
but the money keep me insane and i aint know what a homie was
i was fucked up in the trenches i aint even know what a rollie was
i used to look up to this nigga but he gave his homie up
cause his daughter twelve years old he gotta go do twentyone
and i dont fuck with no fuck niggas so these niggas dont owe me nothin
grown niggas act like kids actin like they benjamin button
put my own fee down for my lawyer that shit was twentyone hundred
had a deep talk with my dawg and he still wasnt comin
with a gun or without his gun i say he still not runnin
and he tote his gun like 50 but he still one hundred nigga

verse 3 lil durk
its all love i thought it was real
he took a percocet wasnt all tryna pop a pill
tryna prove a point to pop off first he aint your dawg for real
i gotta acknowledge that lam truck cause i had a bonneville
i dont get mad when the guys tell me no cause i know my mama will
different niggas they rockin polo im rockin tommy hil
trenches niggas theyll drop it all when its time to kill
first time was a throw off on my backgrounds when i signed a deal
they say its favoritism nah these the ones i love the most
i bought her two three diamond chokers cause she love to choke
1942 with a small pill she love the boat
durkio smurkio yeah she love the goat
yeah i love them g locks
got away from all them phony niggas i had to detox
they dont even shoot at niggas no more they love to beatbox
walked up out your life with a pair of socks
thats two hundred thats them g socks
