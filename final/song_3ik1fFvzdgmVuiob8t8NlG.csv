it’s been a long time coming yes but now i’ve met the one
you are the only girl and you are the only one i love
keep holding me i’ll never let you go
we’ll travel around this world and take it nice and slow
you are my obligation my only inspiration
i will be there for you in any given situation
when your world gets dark and when we are apart
ill be there to send you all my love

chorus
you are my love my love my love
all of my love my love my love

verse 2
you spend your whole life searching
but now you search no more
listen to your heart because your heart you can’t ignore
please you must believe me i wanted to tell you this
i finally found a purpose and a reason to exist
i pick you up when you stumble and now even when you fall
i lift you upon your feet to help you to keep you standing tall
one life to live lord its never felt so right
ill be there to spend with you my life

chorus
you are my love my love my love
all of my love my love my love
see stick figure liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likebridge
one thing is for certain i got no doubt about you
time it come and go but this love is here to stay
somewhere in this world
there’s someone out there who’s for you
and when love come around don’t let it slip away my love
