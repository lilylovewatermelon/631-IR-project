in pastures blue and green
ill follow you and youll follow me
my fabrics mystery
ill wave your loyalty in the freezing
breeze so desperately

chorus
and another one comes down
and another one comes down
and another one comes down

verse 2
i think i see my life
he bows all slyly and gentlelike
hes never had the right
ive never lived without
his sad and jealous eyes

chorus
and another one comes down
and another one comes down
and another one comes down
theyd say
let your love grow tall
let your love grow tall
tall as the grass in the meadow
or the dunes on the shore
like the buildings in the city
and your children on the floor
you might also likeinterlude

verse 3
but its the thought that counts
quiet minds dont know their worth
they know what to do
so ill pray for them and ill pray for you
till my face turns blue

chorus
and another one comes down
and another one comes down
and another one comes down
theyd say
let your love grow tall
let your love grow tall
tall as the grass in the meadow
or the dunes on the shore
like the buildings in the city
and your children on the floor
like the darkness in the forest
like my frightened worried eyes
or the roots in the soil
are the skies telling lies3embed"
