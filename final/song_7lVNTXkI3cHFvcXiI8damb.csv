verse 3 diddy
i had a girl that wouldve died for me
didnt preciate her so i made her cry for me
every night she had tears in her eyes for me
caught a case shorty took the whole ride for me
at first we were friends then became lovers
you was more than my girl we was like brothers
all night we would play fight under covers
now you gone cant love you like i really wanna
but every time i think about your pretty smile
and how we used to drive the whole city wild
damn i wish you wouldve had my child
a pretty little girl with diddys style
shit is wild
all them days that i reminisce
about the way i use to kiss them pretty lips
but as long as you happy ima tell you this
i love you girl and youre the one that i will always miss
i love you yeah
