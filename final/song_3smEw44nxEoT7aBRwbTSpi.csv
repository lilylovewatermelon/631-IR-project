i put the kush in the stogie yeah i put the bentley in drive

yall niggas thought i lost it im awesome
i just took a break to teach a young nigga how to boss it
like when kg went to boston
or when melo went to the knicks
and he brought jr smith and they both started ballin
big bro went from serving birds to pelicans in new orleans
let me take a break let me catch my breath

verse 2 euro
sometimes i think im michael jordan michael tyson
michael phelps and michael jackson
might just drop my fucking tape and fuck around it might go platinum
howd i do that off of freebies fill my double cup with ether
got the same buzz as niggas with an album off of features
see im doing it again got a tool in the timbs now the rules gotta bend
no tools in the gym but i gotta bring it in
because niggas wanna flex but they really slim jim
gotta point it at him him fuck it and him
all i wanna do is kill kill for the ching ching
got a best friend and the best friend got a twin
gotta fit em all in now thats a win win win win
the rooms spinning cause im faded
watch how you run up on these businessmen theyre gang related
i said i like the way she dance she like the way i made it
fuck me without paying the rent imagine if i paid it
i owe you one girl i owe you ones
money always been the main attraction
homie told me women always been the main distraction
and im too focused i just hate to get disturbed
im busy making millions and she just started laughing
so you know i had to

verse 3 cory gunz
when im mad is when i donâ€™t even wanna mask on
war paint like a baboon and my bitch got a red ass on
young money cash money to the dirt of me
so for certainly ima get my blast on
to the face of a fuck nigga trying to fuck with us
think they can make it if they can run a decathlon
stay blazing i mack on play brave and get back home
with them aks crack arms with a straight face that calm
and i fain gaze and attack on with a straight razor in that palm
any nigga want it he gotta get it
the yappa got it rolling and rocking with it
i got a nigga showing and popping picking and going
packing a fight everybody hit the floor he shot the men and boom
pallbearers cold mobs militia all bishops odawgs
you shouldve drove off hitting on bitches and poor dogs
looking the nose off looking like im flicking the stove off
when im kicking the stove off kicking the doors off
everybody hit the deck still bodies get thrown off
say making a remarkable pay
meeting grandpa at a doc or a bay
bad bitch hide the grippers i may
fucking killing unbook come the coppers and spray
twizzie get the chicken they plot him hopping the gate
if you get to trippin then you get shot in the face
euro got the bitch in the kitchen popping the safe
sorry to say no eye witness you finish you gotta bang
