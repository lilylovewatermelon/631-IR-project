and i turn around and youre not there
oh it hurts to know youre still so far away
though i know deep inside you still care
and i want you ooh really want you
oh anyway and anyhow
ive waited such a long time for your sweet love
and i need you back home with me now

cause its not enough to say that you love me
and its not enough to say that you care
and its not enough when you say that you need me
if i wake up and still youre not there
and its not enough to say that you love me
its not enough to say that you care
and its not enough when you say that you need me
if i wake up and still youre not there
oh do you care

oh please believe me its not easy
when youre so many miles from home
oh i need you here to hold and comfort me
im so tired of being alone

cause its not enough to say that you love me
and its not enough to say that you care
and its not enough when you say that you need me
if i wake up and still youre not there
see bonnie tyler liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeyou gotta try to understand
that a woman like me just needs a man to love
oh yes she does
i know you love me loud and clear but if youre not here
its not enough you know

its not enough to say that you love me
and its not enough to say that you care
and its not enough to say that you need me
if i wake up and still youre not there
its not enough to say that you love me
its not enough to say that you care
and its not enough when you say that you need me
if i wake up and still youre not there
if i wake up and still youre not there oh
oh no no no its not enough
oh no no no its not enoughembed"
