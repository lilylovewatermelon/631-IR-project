enter dauphine and haughty

hau
i assure you sir dauphine it is the price and estimation
of your virtue only that hath embarkd me to this adventure and
i could not but make out to tell you so nor can i repent me of
the act since it is always an argument of some virtue in our
selves that we love and affect it so in others

daup
your ladyship sets too high a price on my weakness

hau
sir i can distinguish gems from pebbles—

daup aside
are you so skilful in stones

hau
and howsover i may suffer in such a judgment as yours by
admitting equality of rank or society with centaure or mavis—

daup
you do not madam i perceive they are your mere foils

hau
then are you a friend to truth sir it makes me love you
the more it is not the outward but the inward man that i affect
they are not apprehensive of an eminent perfection but love flat
and dully

cen within
where are you my lady haughty

hau
i come presently centaure—my chamber sir my page shall
shew you and trusty my woman shall be ever awake for you you
need not fear to communicate any thing with her for she is a
fidelia i pray you wear this jewel for my sake sir dauphine—

enter centaure

where is mavis centaure

cen
within madam a writing ill follow you presently

exit hau

ill but speak a word with sir dauphine

daup
with me madam

cen
good sir dauphine do not trust haughty nor make any credit
to her whatever you do besides sir dauphine i give you this
caution she is a perfect courtier and loves nobody but for her
uses and for her uses she loves all besides her physicians give
her out to be none o the clearest whether she pay them or no
heaven knows and shes above fifty too and pargets see her in
a forenoon here comes mavis a worse face then she you would
not like this by candlelight

reenter mavis

if youll come to my chamber one o these mornings early or late
in an evening i will tell you more wheres haughty mavis

mav
within centaure

cen
what have you there

mav
an italian riddle for sir dauphine—you shall not see it
ifaith centaure—

exit cen

good sir dauphine solve it for me ill call for it anon

exit

cler coming forward
how now dauphine how dost thou quit
thyself of these females

daup
slight they haunt me like fairies and give me jewels
here i cannot be rid of them

cler
o you must not tell though

daup
mass i forgot that i was never so assaulted one loves
for virtue and bribes me with this
shews the jewel
—another loves me with caution and so would possess me a
third brings me a riddle here and all are jealous and rail each
at other

cler
a riddle pray let me see it
reads
sir dauphine i chose this way of intimation for privacy the
ladies here i know have both hope and purpose to make a
collegiate and servant of you if i might be so honoured as to
appear at any end of so noble a work i would enter into a fame
of taking physic tomorrow and continue it four or five days
or longer for your visitation mavis
by my faith a subtle one call you this a riddle whats their
plain dealing trow

daup
we lack truewit to tell us that

cler
we lack him for somewhat else too his knights reformadoes
are wound up as high and insolent as ever they were

daup
you jest

cler
no drunkards either with wine or vanity ever confessd
such stories of themselves i would not give a flys leg in
balance against all the womens reputations here if they could
be but thought to speak truth and for the bride they have made
their affidavit against her directly—

daup
what that they have lain with her

cler
yes and tell times and circumstances with the cause why
and the place where i had almost brought them to affirm that they
had done it today

daup
not both of them

cler
yes faith with a sooth or two more i had effected it
they would have set it down under their hands

daup
why they will be our sport i see still whether we will
or no

enter truewit

true
o are you here come dauphine go call your uncle
presently i have fitted my divine and my canonist dyed
their beards and all the knaves do not know themselves they
are so exalted and altered preferment changes any man thou
shalt keep one door and i another and then clerimont in the
midst that he may have no means of escape from their cavilling
when they grow hot once again and then the women as i have
given the bride her instructions to break in upon him in the
lenuoy o twill be full and twanging away fetch him

exit dauphine

enter otter disguised as a divine and cutbeard as a canon lawyer

come master doctor and master parson look to your parts now
and discharge them bravely you are well set forth perform it
as well if you chance to be out do not confess it with standing
still or humming or gaping one at another but go on and talk
aloud and eagerly use vehement action and only remember your
terms and you are safe let the matter go where it will you
have many will do so but at first be very solemn and grave like
your garments though you loose your selves after and skip out
like a brace of jugglers on a table here he comes set your
faces and look superciliously while i present you

reenter dauphine with morose

mor
are these the two learned men

true
yes sir please you salute them

mor
salute them i had rather do any thing than wear out time so
unfruitfully sir i wonder how these common forms as god save
you and you are welcome are come to be a habit in our lives
or i am glad to see you when i cannot see what the profit can
be of these words so long as it is no whit better with him whose
affairs are sad and grievous that he hears this salutation

true
tis true sir well go to the matter then—gentlemen
master doctor and master parson i have acquainted you
sufficiently with the business for which you are come hither and
you are not now to inform yourselves in the state of the question
i know this is the gentleman who expects your resolution and
therefore when you please begin

ott
please you master doctor

cut
please you good master parson

ott
i would hear the canonlaw speak first

cut
it must give place to positive divinity sir

mor
nay good gentlemen do not throw me into circumstances let
your comforts arrive quickly at me those that are be swift in
affording me my peace if so i shall hope any i love not your
disputations or your courttumults and that it be not strange to
you i will tell you my father in my education was wont to
advise me that i should always collect and contain my mind not
suffering it to flow loosely that i should look to what things
were necessary to the carriage of my life and what not embracing
the one and eschewing the other in short that i should endear
myself to rest and avoid turmoil which now is grown to be
another nature to me so that i come not to your public pleadings
or your places of noise not that i neglect those things that make
for the dignity of the commonwealth but for the mere avoiding
of clamours and impertinencies of orators that know not how to be silent and for the cause of noise am i now a suitor to you you
do not know in what a misery i have been exercised this day what
a torrent of evil my very house turns round with the tumult i
dwell in a windmill the perpetual motion is here and not at
eltham

true
well good master doctor will you break the ice master
parson will wade after

cut
sir though unworthy and the weaker i will presume

ott
tis no presumption domine doctor

mor
yet again

cut
your question is for how many causes a man may have
divortium legitimum a lawful divorce first you must understand
the nature of the word divorce a divertendo—

mor
no excursions upon words good doctor to the question briefly

cut
i answer then the canonlaw affords divorce but in a few
cases and the principal is in the common case the adulterous
case but there are duodecim impedimenta twelve impediments as we call them all which do not dirimere contractum but irritum
reddere matrimonium as we say in the canonlaw not take away the bond but cause a nullity therein

mor
i understood you before good sir avoid your impertinency of
translation

ott
he cannot open this too much sir by your favour

mor
yet more

true
o you must give the learned men leave sir—to your
impediments master doctor

cut
the first is impedimentum erroris

ott
of which there are several species

cut
ay as error personae

ott
if you contract yourself to one person thinking her another

cut
then error fortunae

ott
if she be a begger and you thought her rich

cut
then error qualitatis

ott
if she prove stubborn or headstrong that you thought
obedient

mor
how is that sir a lawful impediment one at once i pray
you gentlemen

ott
ay ante copulam but not post copulam sir

cut
master parson says right nec post nuptiarum benedictionem
it doth indeed but irrita reddere sponsalia annul the contract
after marriage it is of no obstancy

true
alas sir what a hope are we fallen from by this time

cut
the next is conditio if you thought her free born and she
prove a bondwoman there is impediment of estate and condition

ott
ay but master doctor those servitudes are sublatae now
among us christians

cut
by your favour master parson—

ott
you shall give me leave master doctor

mor
nay gentlemen quarrel not in that question it concerns not
my case pass to the third

cut
well then the third is votum if either party have made a
vow of chastity but that practice as master parson said of the
other is taken away among us thanks be to discipline the fourth
is cognatio if the persons be of kin within the degrees

ott
ay do you know what the degrees are sir

mor
no nor i care not sir they offer me no comfort in the
question i am sure

cut
but there is a branch of this impediment may which is
cognatio spiritualis if you were her godfather sir then the
marriage is incestuous

ott
that comment is absurd and superstitious master doctor i
cannot endure it are we not all brothers and sisters and as much
akin in that as godfathers and goddaughters

mor
o me to end the controversy i never was a godfather i
never was a godfather in my life sir pass to the next

cut
the fifth is crimen adulterii the known case the sixth
cultus disparitas difference of religion have you ever examined
her what religion she is of

mor
no i would rather she were of none than be put to the
trouble of it

ott
you may have it done for you sir

mor
by no means good sir on to the rest shall you ever come
to an end think you

true
yes he has done half sir on to the rest—be patient
and expect sir

cut
the seventh is vis if it were upon compulsion or force

mor
o no it was too voluntary mine too voluntary

cut
the eight is ordo if ever she have taken holy orders

ott
thats supersitious too

mor
no matter master parson would she would go into a nunnery
yet

cut
the ninth is ligamen if you were bound sir to any other
before

mor
i thrust myself too soon into these fetters

cut
the tenth is publica honestas which is inchoata quaedam
affinitas

ott
ay or affinitas orta ex sponsalibus and is but leve
impedimentum

mor
i feel no air of comfort blowing to me in all this

cut
the eleventh is affinitas ex fornicatione

ott
which is no less vera affinitas than the other master
doctor

cut
true quae oritur ex legitimo matrimonio

ott
you say right venerable doctor and nascitur ex eo quod
per conjugium duae personae efficiuntur una caro—

mor
heyday now they begin

cut
i conceive you master parson ita per fornicationem aeque
est verus pater qui sic generat—

ott
et vere filius qui sic generatur—

mor
whats all this to me

cler
now it grows warm

cut
the twelfth and last is si forte coire nequibis

ott
ay that is impedimentum gravissimum it doth utterly annul
and annihilate that if you have manifestam frigiditatem you
are well sir

true
why there is comfort come at length sir confess yourself
but a man unable and she will sue to be divorced first

ott
ay or if there be morbus perpetuus et insanabilis as
paralysis elephantiasis or so—

daup
o but frigiditas is the fairer way gentlemen

ott
you say troth sir and as it is in the canon master
doctor—

cut
i conceive you sir

cler
before he speaks

ott
that a boy or child under years is not fit for marriage
because he cannot reddere debitum so your omnipotentes—

true aside to ott
your impotentes you whoreson lobster

ott
your impotentes i should say are minime apti ad
contrahenda matrimonium

true
matrimonium we shall have most unmatrimonial latin with
you matrimonia and be hangd

daup
you put them out man

cut
but then there will arise a doubt master parson in our
case post matrimonium that frigiditate praeditus—do you
conceive me sir

ott
very well sir

cut
who cannot uti uxore pro uxore may habere eam pro sorore

ott
absurd absurd absurd and merely apostatical

cut
you shall pardon me master parson i can prove it

ott
you can prove a will master doctor you can prove nothing
else does not the verse of your own canon say
haec socianda vetant connubia facta retractant

cut
i grant you but how do they retractare master parson

mor
o this was it i feared

ott
in aeternum sir

cut
thats false in divinity by your favour

ott
tis false in humanity to say so is he not prorsus inutilis
ad thorum can he praestare fidem datam i would fain know

cut
yes how if he do convalere

ott
he cannot convalere it is impossible

true
nay good sir attend the learned men they will think you
neglect them else

cut
or if he do simulare himself frigidum odio uxoris or so

ott
i say he is adulter manifestus then

daup
they dispute it very learnedly ifaith

ott
and prostitutor uxoris and this is positive

mor
good sir let me escape

true
you will not do me that wrong sir

ott
and therefore if he be manifeste frigidus sir—

cut
ay if he be manifeste frigidus i grant you—

ott
why that was my conclusion

cut
and mine too

true
nay hear the conclusion sir

ott
then frigiditatis causa—

cut
yes causa frigiditatis—

mor
o mine ears

ott
she may have libellum divortii against you

cut
ay divortii libellum she will sure have

mor
good echoes forbear

ott
if you confess it

cut
which i would do sir—

mor
i will do any thing

ott
and clear myself in foro conscientiae—

cut
because you want indeed—

mor
yet more

ott
exercendi potestate

epicoene rushes in followed by haughty centaure mavis mistress otter daw and lafoole

epi
i will not endure it any longer ladies i beseech you
help me this is such a wrong as never was offered to poor
bride before upon her marriage day to have her husband
conspire against her and a couple of mercenary companions
to be brought in for forms sake to persuade a separation
if you had blood or virtue in you gentlemen you would not
suffer such earwigs about a husband or scorpions to creep
between man and wife

mor
o the variety and changes of my torment

hau
let them be cudgelld out of doors by our grooms

cen

hau

is about the town and wears as good colours when he lists

true
be brief sir and confess your infirmity shell be afire
to be quit of you if she but hear that named once you shall not
entreat her to stay shell fly you like one that had the marks
upon him

mor
ladies i must crave all your pardons—

true
silence ladies

mor
for a wrong i have done to your whole sex in marrying this
fair and virtuous gentlewoman—

cler
hear him good ladies

mor
being guilty of an infirmity which before i conferred
with these learned men i thought i might have concealed—

true
but now being better informed in his conscience by them
he is to declare it and give satisfaction by asking your public
forgiveness

mor
i am no man ladies

all
how

mor
utterly unabled in nature by reason of frigidity to
perform the duties or any the least office of a husband

mav
now out upon him prodigious creature

cen
bridegroom uncarnate

hau
and would you offer it to a young gentlewoman

mrs ott
a lady of her longings

epi
tut a device a device this it smells rankly ladies
a mere comment of his own

true
why if you suspect that ladies you may have him
searchd—

daw
as the custom is by a jury of physicians

laf
yes faith twill be brave

mor
o me must i undergo that

mrs ott
no let women search him madam we can do it
ourselves

mor
out on me worse

epi
no ladies you shall not need i will take him with all
his faults

mor
worst of all

cler
why then tis no divorce doctor if she consent not

cut
no if the man be frigidus it is de parte uxoris that we
grant libellum divortii in the law

ott
ay it is the same in theology

mor
worse worse than worst

true
nay sir be not utterly disheartened we have yet a
small relic of hope left as near as our comfort is blown
out clerimont produce your brace of knights what was that
master parson you told me in errore qualitatis een now—
aside
dauphine whisper the bride that she carry it as if she were
guilty and ashamed

ott
marry sir in errore qualitatis which master doctor did
forbear to urge if she be found corrupta that is vitiated or
broken up that was pro virgine desponsa espoused for a maid—

mor
what then sir

ott
it doth dirimere contractum and irritum reddere too

true
if this be true we are happy again sir once more here
