the condition of a man who is about to be an inyanga1 is this at first he is apparently robust but in process of time he begins to be delicate not having any real disease but being very delicate he begins to be particular about food and abstains from some kinds and requests his friends not to give him that food because it makes him ill he habitually avoids certain kinds of food choosing what he likes and he does not eat much of that and he is continually complaining of pains in different parts of his body and he tells them that he has dreamt that he was being carried away by a river he dreams of many things and his body is muddled2 p 260 and he becomes a house of dreams3 and he dreams constantly of many things and on awaking says to his friends my body is muddled today i dreamt many men were killing me i escaped i know not how and on waking one part of my body felt different from other parts it was no longer alike all over at last the man is very ill and they go to the diviners to enquire

the diviners do not at once see that he is about to have a soft head4 it is difficult for them to see the truth they continually talk nonsense and make false statements until all the mans cattle are devoured at their command they saying that the spirit of his people demands cattle that it may eat food

so the people readily assent to the diviners word thinking that they know at length all the mans property is expended he being still ill and they no longer p 261 know what to do for he has no more cattle and his friends help him in such things as he needs

at length an inyanga comes and says that all the others are wrong he says i know that you come here to me because you have been unable to do any thing for the man and have no longer the heart to believe that any inyanga can help you but my friends i see that my friends the other izinyanga have gone astray they have not eaten impepo5 they were not initiated in a proper way why have they been mistaken when the disease is evident for my part i tell you the izinyanga have troubled you the disease does not require to be treated with blood6 as for the man i see nothing else but that he is possessed by the itongo7 there is nothing else he is possessed by an itongo your people8 move in him they are divided into two p 262 parties some say no we do not wish that our child should be injured we do not wish it it is for that reason and no other that he does not get well if you bar the way against the itongo you will be killing him for he will not be an inyanga neither will he ever be a man again he will be what he is now if he is not ill he will be delicate and become a fool and be unable to understand any thing i tell you you will kill him by using medicines just leave him alone and look to the end to which the disease points do you not see that on the day he has not taken medicine he just takes a mouthful of food9 do not give him any more medicines he will not die of the sickness for he will have what is good10 given to him

so the man may be ill two years without getting better perhaps even longer than that he may leave the house for a few days and the people begin to think he will get well but no he is confined to the house again this continues until his hair falls off and his body is dry and scurfy and he does not like to anoint himself people wonder at the progress of the disease p 263 but his head begins to give signs of what is about to happen he shows that he is about to be a diviner by yawning11 again and again and by sneezing again and again and men say no truly it seems as though this man was about to be possessed by a spirit this is also apparent from his being very fond of snuff not allowing any long time to pass without taking some and people begin to see that he has had what is good given to him

after that he is ill he has slight convulsions and has water poured on him and they cease for a time he habitually sheds tears at first slight and at last he weeps aloud and in the middle of the night when the people are asleep he is heard making a noise and wakes the people by singing he has composed a song and men and women awake and go to sing in concert with him

in this state of things they daily expect his death12 he is now p 264 but skin and bones and they think that tomorrows sun will not leave him alive the people wonder when they hear him singing and they strike their hands in concert they then begin to take courage saying yes now we see that it is the head13

therefore whilst he is undergoing this initiation the people of the village are troubled by want of sleep for a man who is beginning to be an inyanga causes great trouble for he does not sleep but works constantly with his brain his sleep is merely by snatches and he wakes up singing many songs and people who are near quit their villages by night when they hear him singing aloud and go to sing in concert perhaps he sings till the morning no one having slept the people of the village smite their hands in concert till they are sore and then he leaps about the house like a frog and the house becomes too small for him and he goes out leaping and singing and shaking like a reed in the water and dripping with perspiration

at that time many cattle are eaten the people encourage his becoming an inyanga they employ means for making the itongo white that it may make his divination very clear at length p 265 another ancient inyanga of celebrity is pointed out to him14 at night whilst asleep he is commanded by the itongo who says to him go to soandso go to him and he will churn for you emeticubulawo15 that you may be an inyanga altogether then he is quiet for a few days having gone to the inyanga to have ubulawo churned for him and he comes back quite another man being now cleansed and an inyanga indeed

and if he is to have familiar spirits there is continually a voice saying to him you will not speak with the people they will be told by us every thing they come to enquire about and he continually tells the people his dreams saying there are people16 who tell me at night that they will speak for themselves to those who come to enquire at last all this turns out to be true when he has begun to divine at length his power entirely ceases and he hears the spirits who speak by whistlings17 speaking to him and he answers them as he would answer a man and he causes them to speak by asking them questions if he does not understand p 266 what they say they make him understand every thing they see the familiar spirits do not begin by explaining omens which occur among the people they begin by speaking with him whose familiars they are and making him acquainted with what is about to happen and then he divines for the people

this then is what i know of familiar spirits and diviners

if the relatives of the man who has been made ill by the itongo do not wish him to become a diviner they call a great doctor to treat him to lay the spirit that he may not divine but although the man no longer divines he is not well he continues to be always out of health this is what i know but although he no longer divines as regards wisdom he is like a diviner for instance there was undayeni his friends did not wish him to become a diviner they said no we do not wish so fine and powerful a man to become a mere thing which stays at home and does no work but only divines so they laid the spirit but there still remained in him signs which caused the people to say if that man had been a diviner he would have been a very great man a firstclass diviner
p 267

as to the familiar spirits it is not one only that speaks they are very many and their voices are not alike one has his voice and another his and the voice of the man into whom they enter is different from theirs he too enquires of them as other people do and he too seeks divination of them if they do not speak he does not know what they will say he cannot tell those who come for divination what they will be told no it is his place to take what those who come to enquire bring and nothing more and the man and the familiar spirits ask questions of each other and converse

when those who come to seek divination salute him he replies o you have come when i am alone the spirits departed yesterday i do not know where they are gone so the people wait when they come they are heard saluting them saying good day they reply good day to you masters and the man who lives with them also asks them saying are you coming they say they are it is therefore difficult to understand that it is a deception when we hear many voices speaking with the man who has familiar spirits and him too speaking with them

p 268

the way in which a person begins to be a diviner

uthlabo18 is known by causing a sensation of perforation19 of the side and the man says i have pain under the armpit beneath the shoulderblade in my side in the flesh it causes the feeling as if there was a hole there the pain passes through my body to each side

the men ask what is this disease for it resembles nothing but uthlabo

he replies yes yes i too say it is uthlabo it is that which comes out20 from the side of my body and will not let me breathe neither will it let me lie down

at length the doctor who knows the medicines for uthlabo cures it but black people call it also ukxulo21 and say it is caused by the itongo22 and when a p 269 man is constantly affected23 by uthlabo black men say the itongo is walking in him amatongo are walking in his body if the disease lasts a long time they at length go to enquire of diviners they come and say he is affected by the itongo he is affected by his people who are dead24 there was one of them who was an inyanga and this man has the itongo in his body his people p 270 wish him to have a soft head25 and become a diviner when he has been initiated

the diviners say do not give him any more medicines do you not see when you get uthlabomedicines for him the disease does not cease when you give him medicine do you not thereby increase the disease leave him alone his people are in him they wish him to dream

and if one of his people who is dead was an inyanga the diviners who come to divine call him by name and say soandso is in him it is he who says he is to be an inyanga it is a great inyanga that possesses him that is what the diviners say they say the man who was an inyanga who is walking in his body was also an inyanga who could dig up poisons26 he used to dig them up and since he who used to p 271 dig up the poison of the sorcerers by which they destroyed others has taken possession of this man he too as soon as be has been initiated will have a white itongo27 and will dig up poisons as soandso one of his people used to do leave him alone as regards medicines throw away medicines and give him no more you will kill him if you do you think they will cure him they will not cure him he is purposely thus affected the amatongo wish p 272 him to become a white28 inyanga be quiet and see if the amatongo do not give him commands at night in his sleep you will see him come home in the morning not having seen him go out having had medicines revealed to him which he will go to the mountains to dig up you will see he has dug up cleansingubulawo and he will churn it and make it froth and drink it and cleanse himself by it and so begin to be an inyanga and at other times he will be commanded to fetch impepo which he will go to the marsh to pluck

the amatongo tell him to kill cattle for the dead are very fond of demanding flesh of one whom they wish to make an inyanga he slaughters them for his people who are dead and others enter his kraal29 he slaughters constantly and others again come in in their place the cattle being derived from his treatment of disease and from divining and digging up poisons when men are perishing being destroyed by sorcerers he goes and digs up the poisons and purifies those whom the sorcerers are poisoning

p 273
when the amatongo make a man ill he cries hai hai hai30 they cause him to compose songs and the people of his home assemble and beat time to the song the amatongo have caused him to compose—the song of initiation—a song of professional skill

some dispute and say no the fellow is merely mad there is no itongo in him others say o there is an itongo in him he is already an inyanga

the others say no he is mad have you ever hidden things for him to discover by his inner sight since you say he is an inyanga

they say no we have not done that

they ask how then do you know he is an inyanga

they say we know it because he is told about medicines which he goes to dig up

they reply o he is a mere madman we might allow that he is an inyanga if you had concealed things for him to find and he had discovered what you had concealed but you tell us what is of no import as you have not done this

as they are talking thus and disputing about concealing things p 274 for him to find at night when he is asleep he dreams that the man of his people who is dead and who is causing him to begin to be an inyanga tells him saying they were disputing with each other saying you are not an inyanga

he who is beginning to be an inyanga asks why do they say i am not an inyanga

he replies they say you are not an inyanga but a mere mad man and ask if they have hidden things for you to discover since the others say you are an inyanga

he says tell me who they are who say so

he replies soandso and soandso were disputing

the man asks do you say they lie when they say so
he replies be quiet because they say so i say you shall be a greater inyanga than all others and all men in the world shall be satisfied that you are a great inyanga and they shall know you

the man who is beginning to be be an inyanga says for my part i say they speak the truth when they say i am mad truly they have never hidden anything for me to find

then the man who was an inyanga p 275 he who is initiating him says just be quiet i will take you to them in the morning and you appear on a hill do not come upon them suddenly but appear on a hill which is concealed and cry hai hai hai cry thus on the hill which is concealed that they may hear when you cry hai hai hai if they do not hear then go on to a hill which is open do not expose yourself much as soon as you expose yourself cry hai hai hai so that they may just hear when they hear that it is you go down again from the hill and return to the one which is concealed so i say they will see and understand that they have spoken of a man who is beginning to be a doctor they shall know by that that when they said you were a mad man and not an inyanga they were mistaken

so he does so he cries hai hai hai on a hill which is hidden they do not hear him distinctly they hear only a continual sound of nkene nkene nkene nkene31 one of them says it sounds as though there was some one singing others say we do not hear we hear only an echo

the itongo comes to him and tells him that they cannot hear p 276 and bids him go out a little on the open hill and then return again to the hill which is hidden

so he departs at the word of the itongo and goes out to the open hill and cries hai hai hai and they all hear that it is he they are again disputing about him and as soon as they hear that it is he they say can it be sirs that he comes about the matter we were disputing about saying he is mad

others32 say o why do you ask he comes on that account if indeed you said he was not an inyanga but a madman

the great man of the village to which the inyanga is approaching says i too say he is mad just take things and go and hide them that we may see if he can find them

they take things one takes beads and goes and hides them others take picks and go and hide them others hide assagais others bracelets others hide their sticks others their kilts others their ornaments others their pots others hide baskets and say just let us see if he will find all these p 277 things or not others hide cobs of maize others the ears of amabele or sweet cane or of ujiba or the heads of upoko

some say o if he find all these things will he not be tired why have you hidden so many

they say we hide so many that we may see that he is really an inyanga

they reply stop now you have hidden very many things

they return home and wait then the itongo tells him on the concealed hill for it had already said to him keep quiet they are now hiding things do not begin to appear they wish to say when you find the things that you saw when they hid them be quiet that they may hide all the things then they will be satisfied that you are an inyanga now the itongo tells him they have now hidden the things and gone home it is proper for you now to go to the home of the people who say you are mad and not an inyanga

so he comes out on the open mountain and runs towards their home being pursued by his own people who are seeking him for he went out during the night and p 278 they did not hear when he went out very early in the morning when it was still dark when the horns of the cattle were beginning to be just visible34 he reaches their home and his own people who were looking for him and have now found him come with him on his arrival he dances and as he dances they strike hands in unison and the people of the place who have hidden things for him to find also start up and strike hands he dances and they smite their hands earnestly

he says to them have you then hid things for me to find

they deny saying no we have not hidden things for you to find

he says you have

they deny saying it is not true we have not

he says am i not able to find35 them

they say no you cannot have we hidden then things for you to find

he says you have

they deny declaring that they have not done so but he asserts that they have

when they persist in their denial p 279 he starts up shaking his head he goes and finds the beads he finds the picks and the kilts and the bracelets he finds the cobs of maize and the ears of the amabele and ujiba and of upoko he finds all the things they have hidden they see he is a great inyanga when he has found all the things they have concealed

he goes home again as soon as he has found all the things and not one thing remains outside where they had hidden it on his return to their home from the river whither he had gone to find what was hidden he is tired and the amatongo say to him although you are tired you will not sleep here we will go home with you this is what the amatongo say to the inyanga when he is tired with finding the things

the inyangas people who accompany him say just tell us if he is not an inyanga

and he says i have found all the things whieh you hid there is nothing left outside all things are here in the house i was commanded to come to you for you said i was not an inyanga but a madman and asked if my people had hidden things for me to find p 280 just say who told me the things about which you were speaking you said i was mad you thought you were just speaking do you think the amatongo36 do not hear as you were speaking they were listening and when i was asleep they told me that i was a worthless inyanga a mere thing

then the people make him presents one comes with beads and gives him another brings a goat another an assagai another a bracelet another brings an ornament made of beads and gives him the chief of the village gives him a bullock and all the chief men give him goats because he had come to their village at the bidding of the amatongo

uguaise

the doctor of divination the isanusi ibuda or umungoma

the doctor is called isanusi37 or ibuda38 or inyanga of p 281 divination39 or umungoma40 for when people are enquiring of a diviner they say true umungoma doctors who treat disease are different p 282 from those who divine for a man is a doctor of disease if he is able to treat disease and diviners point out the doctor of medicine who is successful they tell those who enquire of them to go to a certain doctor whom they know to have successfully treated the disease from which their friend is suffering and so they go to the doctor of medicine that has been pointed out by the diviners and if he has the disease which the diviners say he has he will be cured by the medicines of the doctor that they point out

but if the doctor of medicine treats the sick man and he does not get well he says this disease masters me since the diviners did nothing more than send you to me just go and hear what other diviners say then perhaps some diviner will tell you the medicine with which i can cure this man

so they assent saying o you say truly it is proper for us to go to hear what other diviners may say perhaps we shall find one who will tell us the medicine with which you can cure him so they go to other diviners to hear whether they will all give the same advice

when they come to the diviner they do not say to him we are p 283 come to enquire they merely go and salute him saying yes yes dear sir good news41 thus the diviner understands that they have come to enquire so they sit still and the diviner sits and salutes them saying good day they reply yes yes dear sir

he says o let be these people have come in a time of dearth we have no food ready we are hungry and the beer which we had we finished yesterday we cannot tell where you can get any food

they reply o sir we cannot get much food we are very hungry food cannot be obtained for our parts if we get boiled maize we shall say we have got food we were not wishing for that food you are calling for sir we for our parts are wishing for nothing but boiled maize we understand that you are calling for beer

he says o get them some food cook them some porridge cook for them very thick porridge so his wives cook for them

when their food has been cooked he pours some snuff into his hand and takes it there in the p 284 house he shudders and yawns and then goes out of doors to a clump of trees and sends a man to call them the man calls them and they go to the clump of trees to the diviner

he tells them to pluck rods for beating the ground they go and pluck the rods and return and sit down he takes out his snuffbox pours snuff into his hand and takes it and they do the same

when they have taken snuff he tells them to smite the ground some say hear others say true

you are come to enquire about sickness

they smite the ground for him

he says it is a human being that is ill

they smite the ground he says it is a great man you have already been to another friend of mine

they smite the ground vehemently

he says smite the ground that i may understand what that friend of mine to whom you went seeking divination said to you

they smite the ground he says there is my friend42 who told the disease by which he is affected

p 285

they smite the ground vehemently and say right

he says there is someone to whom that friend of mine sent you he is a doctor not a divining doctor he is a doctor of medicine

upon that they smite the ground vehemently

he says do you question me do not leave me

they say we cannot question you for you speak the very facts themselves we put to the question a man that talks at random and does not mention the very nature of the disease

then he says smite the ground again that i may understand what medicine my friend told him to give to cure him

they smite the ground and say to him diviner tell us at once the medicine that will cure him for since you have seen the man to whom your friend directed us we shall hear from you the medicine too that will cure him

he says i am about to tell you our people43 say they will tell you

they say we are glad diviner that your people are white44 and unite with our people p 286 that the case may turn out well for we have no more hope that he will recover for as regards the doctor whom your friend pointed out we trusted in our hearts saying since the diviner has told us the doctor that can cure him he will now be cured and get well we went to the doctor whom your friend mentioned but lo we saw the disease passing onward tending to get worse and worse and began to wonder saying let be for we were trustful and of good courage saying perhaps he will get well for the diviner says so they go on we have just said these words because you said them first you saw that we had already been to another diviner if you had not said we had already gone to another diviner we should not have said them we say them because you already said them

he says smite the ground that i may tell you the medicine that will cure him

they then smite the ground vehemently

he says for my part i tell you that the medicine that will cure him is inyamazane45 p 287 the man has umsizi46

p 288

they then smite the ground and say we will hear from you diviner for our parts we know nothing now we can do nothing now we are fools there is no longer any wisdom in us and as for the words you say promising to tell us the medicine which will cure him in our hearts we no longer say that even the medicine you mention will cure him we now say that death will carry him away captive we have no more courage for the disease is there we do not understand for he is now affected with hiccup

he says smite the ground then smite the ground then at that point of hiccup that i may tell you

they smite

he says the hiccup is nothing i will give him medicine for hiccup and it will cease

they say we are glad diviner for what you say but we do not know it is customary for all doctors to say so and yet the man gets worse and dies you doctors no longer inspire us with courage it is customary for them all to speak thus and we now rejoice when we see a man already p 289 in health and then we say he is a diviner when we see the man getting well if the disease increases we do not say the inyanga has divined we say he has wandered he is lost if a man has got well we say the diviner has divined and we praise him much saying he is one who divines forsooth we say so because the man has got well

he says smite the ground that i may tell you

they smite the ground

he says the hiccup is nothing our people say it is not dangerous they say the hiccup is nothing they say they will tell you a medicine that will cure him they find fault with my friend to whom you went seeking divination they say he did not see what medicine would cure him he merely pointed out a doctor to treat him and did not mention the medicine which would cure him

then they smite the ground he says smite the ground vehemently

they do so he says he never named the medicine which would cure him so i am going to tell you the medicine which will restore him to health and you leave off the p 290 tears you have been shedding47 thinking he was already dead

they reply diviner we will hear what you say we merely beat the ground48 we weep tears are our portion49 whilst we are here we do not know what will happen—whether during this days sun we shall find him still living

he says smite the ground you will find him still alive smite the ground that i may tell you of a man who treats disease who will do him good who will come to him and cure him on the very day he comes

they smite the ground

he says i say go to such and such a doctor of such and such a place he will give you umsizimedicine and he will himself come and give him an expressed juice50 to drink and he will drink it after that he will scarify him51 and give him medicine52 p 291 he will get well on the day the doctor comes with the expressed juice i will give you hiccupmedicine and do you give it him it will keep him alive53 until the doctor whom i have mentioned to you comes he will cure him

so he gives them hiccupmedicine to keep him alive

then they go back to the diviners house to eat the food which has been cooked for them they enter the house and the people give them food they eat and are satisfied and their hunger ceases they enquire if it is dark some say that it is now dark the diviner who has just divined for them says o sleep here and go in the morning

they refuse saying o on no account diviner we must go for see you have given us medicine we wish that the man should drink this medicine whether we reach home in the night or whether we reach home in the morning it will not matter we wish him to take this medicine

so the diviner agrees saying surely you are right but if you reach him with this medicine of mine and the doctor is ever so far away until he comes it will keep him alive further as to p 292 this medicine even if i come to a man so ill as to be raised by others he being unable to raise himself and make him drink this medicine he will raise himself even though before he could not do so

they set out at once by night and reach their home in the morning they find the people assembled in the sick mans hut they squeeze out for him the hiccupmedicine they have brought into a cup he being still affected with hiccup they make him drink it when he has drunk it he is seized with hiccup again and he becomes sensible54 the people in the hut are alarmed and say truly is he not now just about to die55

those in the house look at each other and enquire of those who have brought the medicine saying o how the man has lighted up what kind of medicine is that of the doctors

they say o as to the doctor we merely bring the medicine the diviner gave it to us and said it would keep him alive till the doctor came to treat the disease he said he would not die if we reached home with this medicine until the doctor came whom he named

p 293

but he lights up only and does not die they take courage from what the diviner said they stay one night and on the following morning say o yes the diviner pointed out a doctor of such a place to come and treat him he said he has umsizi and that the doctor will bring medicine for him to drink then he will give another medicine and scarify him so now we will go to that doctor

they rejoice and say we are glad it is well for you to go truly since you gave him the hiccupmedicine he has not had the hiccup all night we now see that you went to a diviner who speaks56 truth and knows the disease you have brought the right medicine we now have confidence we now see that his eyes are bright

so they go to the doctor which the diviner has pointed out they do not go any more to the first doctor for he told them he could not do any thing for the sick man and asked why the diviner had not mentioned the medicine with which he might cure the patient

they reach the doctors when they reach him they make obeisance saying eh dear sir they go into the house they salute them saying good day p 294 and they return the salutation saying yes sirs they say whence do you come

they say from our home

where are you going

we have come to this place57

what business have you here

they say o sirs we are come to the doctor one of our people is ill

they say is there then any doctor here

they reply o sirs you can tell us where the doctor is we have come to him

those in the house laugh

the others say o sirs do not laugh at us we are in trouble

they say what troubles you

they say o we are troubled by disease one of our people is ill

they ask as you have come here have you heard that there is a doctor here

they say yes we have heard that there is one here

they say who told you

they reply o sirs we cannot make a great secret of it for we have come here because we went to a diviner and he showed us the path and told us there was a doctor here we did not know it for we had gone to another diviner and p 295 he pointed out another doctor who he said would cure the sick man we went to that doctor and he treated him but could do nothing at length he told us he could do nothing and that the diviner of whom we had enquired erred because he did not name the medicine with which he could cure the patient so we agreed with that doctor and went to another diviner on our arrival he told us that there was a doctor here who could cure the sick man and now you see us sirs we have come

they say o yes yes there is a man here who treats disease

they say tell us where he is

they say there he is

and he says yes yes it is i tell me why you have come here to me

they say we come sir on account of sickness for the diviner sent us here to you

the doctor says did the diviner when you asked him tell you with what medicine i could cure him

they say we asked him and he told us the medicine with which you could cure him he said he had umsizi and that you could cure him with umsizimedicine

he says what have you brought for me58

p 296

they say sir we have not brought any thing when you have cured him you shall pick out for yourself the cattle you like at our home

he says what will you give me to cause me to quit my hut

they say sir we will give you something to cause you to quit the hut it is at home—a goat

he says is it possible that you come to take me away with a goat to go to a man whom i am going to cure

they say o dear sir do not trouble yourself with talking there is also a bullock at home to take you away we say that as we have only the diviners word you will never cure him for he is very ill

he says i shall cure him because the diviner told you to come to me and asks what medicine did the diviner say i could cure him with

they reply o dear sir he said you would cure him by giving him an expressed juice and then you would give him another medicine and scarify him and that p 297 he would get well on the very day you go to him that is what the diviner said

he says go home then and i will come the day after tomorrow

they object saying o dear sir go with us do not stay behind

and at length he assents saying well then i will go with you

so he goes with them taking with him plants to express their juice for him and other medicines and medicines to rub into the scarifications at length they reach their home with the doctor on his arrival he makes the man drink the expressed juice and then gives him other medicine and scarifies him he asks for a goat and kills it and makes medicine with it and gives it to him he asks also for a bullock and makes medicine with it and gives him

the people see that he will cure him59 he becomes strong and eats the flesh of the goat and the bullock they ask how is the pain now

he replies o be silent sirs i am still earnestly looking out for it i shall feel whether it is still p 298 there tomorrow and then tell you i have indeed had some sleep i will tell you tomorrow sirs whether that man is a doctor or not

indeed night comes and there is no return of the pain he sleeps in the morning they ask him how he is

he says o sirs i shall now get well

the doctor then says i have now cured him show me my cattle i am going in the morning i wish to see them and in the morning drive them home i say let me see them before i lie down

they say o yes dear sir you are right we now see that your patient is nearly well

so they shew him his cattle they point out a young cow with a heifer by her side and a calf of a year old—three altogether

they say say what you think doctor we say there are your cattle

he says i thank you for the cattle but give me something to wipe my eyes with60

so they give him a goat he kills the goat and places the gallbladder in his hair he says i shall leave medicines with you that you may wash him with them i have now entirely finished for my part

the diviner mistaken

it is said a man begins to be a diviner by being ill it is said he is made ill by the amatongo and he has many goats killed for him and when they have been killed he carries the gallbladders in his hair it is a sign that a man is becoming a diviner if he wears many gallbladders after that he begins to be a diviner

on his initiation he goes like one mad to a pool and dives into it seeking for snakes having found them he seizes them and comes out of the water with them and entwines them still living about his body that the people may see that he is indeed a diviner61 after that they begin to try him in many ways to see whether he will become a trustworthy diviner they then go to him and the diviner hears them say they have come to divine and he tells them to smite the ground that he may understand why p 300 they have come and they smite the ground and cry hear—and he then says you have come for such and such a matter—and then they smite the ground—he then says you have come for so and so and he proceeds to tell them what has taken place as regards that about which they have come and he tells them what the man about whom they have come has done they then reward him if they see that he has divined about matters which they understand and depart and when they reach home they do as the diviner tells them perhaps it turns out in accordance with what the diviner has said perhaps it does not so turn out when they see that it has not turned out in accordance with his word they go to another diviner and perhaps what he says comes to pass that is what i have heard

once at pietermaritzburg a heifer belonging to mr g my white master was lost we looked for it but could not find it we then asked mr g to give us a shilling that we might enquire of a diviner for we were now troubled with looking for it and did not know where to look for it any further he gave us a shilling and we went to a diviner who lives near the zwartkop on our arrival we found him sitting in the p 301 cattlepen and we saluted saying eh dear sir and sat down

they saluted us and we replied

the diviners people asked us whence we came

we told them we came from pietermaritzburg and had come to enquire of the diviner

they said why have you come here

we told them we had come on our own account some cattle62 having been lost we then asked for snuff and they gave us some and we took it and after that the diviner said let us go yonder outside the village

he went out and we followed him he said to us strike the ground that i may understand my friends what is the reason that you have come to me

we smote our hands together and said hear

he said you are in trouble

we said hear

he said let me just understand what kind of a bullock it is

we smote our hands together

he said it is a cow

we smote our hands

he said no it is an ox

we smote our hands

p 302

he said no it is not an ox

we smote our hands

he said you are in trouble lads

we smote our hands

he said but the cow was lost a long time ago

and there he spoke truly

we smote our hands

he said just let me understand if it was stolen by any one

we smote our hands

he said no it was not stolen by men but it is still living

we smote our hands

he said it is one that is lost

and there too he spoke the truth

we smote with our hands

he said let me just understand of what colour it is

we smote with our hands

he said it is a red and white cow

but there he made a guess and did not speak truly

we smote our hands

he said no it is a heifer it is not yet in calf

we smote our hands

and there too he spoke truly

he said let me understand if the heifer is still living or not

we smote our hands

he said no the heifer is dead

p 303

we smote our hands

he said no it is still living

he said let me just understand where it is

we smote our hands

he said it is in the mimosa thorncountry

we smote our hands

he said just let me understand in what part of the thorncountry it is

we smote our hands

he said it has gone down the umsunduze

we smote our hands

he said just let me understand if it is still living

we smote our hands

he said it is still living and eating umtolo and umunga63 go and look for it there and you will find it

we thought we understood that he had now told us the place for for some time we had not known where to go to look for it

then we gave him the shilling and returned to pietermaritzburg when we came to mr g we told him that the diviner said it was in the thorncountry and that we were to go and look for it down the umsunduze

he told us to go and look for it in the place mentioned by the diviner we went to look for it going down the umsunduze as p 304 we went along we looked for it going towards the thorncountry which he had pointed out at length we got as far as ts and sought for it in that neighbourhood we could not find it for the thorns were very thick as we went we enquired at all the native villages in the thorncountry the people said they knew nothing about it and others told us to go to t the white man who ate up the cattle of the people that were lost64 but we were afraid to go to him for he is a passionate white man who beats any coloured men whom he does not know if he see them passing through his land so we went back to pietermaritzburg without going to t and told mr g that we had not found the heifer at the place pointed out by the diviner so he told us to give up the search we did so and that was the end of it

the account of ukanzi

the following narrative gives an interesting and striking instance of the power a bold man may possess even over venomous snakes the snakes caught by the diviners and hung in festoons about their bodies are probably charmed in some such manner as here related of ukanzi it is quite possible that both possessed medicines which are either offensive or pleasing to snakes by which they caused them to be afraid or gentle but it is not necessary to suppose that ukanzi used any such medicines the mere daring and yet cautious coolness with which he approached the snake is quite sufficient to explain why it became so cowed before him but how are we to explain his insusceptibility to the snake poison why did the poisoned fangs broken off and remaining in his lips produce no symptoms it is likely that he was naturally insusceptible to the influence of such animal poisons just as others possess a natural intense susceptibility to it so that the sting of a bee has in them been followed by fatal consequences this is much more likely than that he possessed any powerful remedies by the use of which he rendered the snake poison innocuous the son inherited the same insusceptibility of course all statements as to the invariable efficacy of some particular remedy possessed by savages must be received with great caution and if subjected to rigid enquiry would probably prove not to be founded in wellobserved facts

the account of ukanzi the son of unjoko and of his knowledge of snakepoison

he is a man who causes us to wonder much at his knowledge there is no one in our country like him who can render inert the poison of snakes he is a man trusted to the uttermost in cases of snakebites

if any one is bitten by any kind of snake he does not say he p 306 does not possess the remedy65 for that kind of snakepoison no for his part he is only gladdened by all kinds of snakes nothing prevents his curing the bite of any of them if a man is said to have been bitten by some deadly snake he at once selects the proper remedy

and he continually separates the remedy for the poison which is in the body and that which is in the viscera and keeps them distinct

a proof that he is a doctor is that the snakes which he catches are to him no more than mice i once saw this with my own eyes and did not merely hear it by report he caught a great snake called umdhlambila the rock imamba when we were hunting when we the hunting party came under a precipice there was a snake in a tree basking in the sun we saw it occupying the whole tree it was of a grey colour its eyes were piercing it was fearful when it looked at any one

we called him saying here is your game he came running and asking where it was we pointed it out and he saw it he laid his weapons on the ground and climbed the tree and went to it i said in my heart i shall now see p 307 for since he has not taken a stick what will he do to this snake which is as large as a post66 will it not devour him67 he p 308 put his hand in his mouth and gently bit it all over he took it p 309 out and extended it towards the snake it started and raised its head and turned in every direction wishing to escape but his hand followed it constantly wherever it went on the tree when i thought it would strike him on his head he withdrew himself and it did nothing and then raised his hand again at length it became gentle and laid its head in his hand not placing it there in a hostile manner but laying its head with all gentleness in his hand and letting him do what he liked with it he seized its head and put it in his mouth and chewed it the snakes teeth broke in his mouth he picked out the teeth when he had killed the snake and nothing happened it was as if he picked out thorns merely he took no medicine to counteract the poison he merely picked out the teeth

we who were standing on the ground wondered and said ukanzi was a sorcerer he drew the snake towards himself and twisted it round his body and came down with it he got some grass and tied the snake up in it and went home with it saying for my part i have now killed my game i shall prepare it at home so he carried it away

and his son ugidinga resembles p 310 his father in his power of catching snakes he having learnt of his father

when he reached home with the snake he skinned it and separated the skin and the flesh and selected different portions of the body he roasted it that it might not decay but dry he boiled it with other snakepoison remedies the heart was set aside by itself and the body by itself and he had thus two remedies—that obtained from the heart and that from the body

if a man walking with ukanzi were bitten by a snake he would give him a little powder to lick with his tongue and say that is all i have now cured you the man would go on in fear not believing that he was cured for he had not seen much medicine or much treatment but at length he saw when they had gone a great distance and nothing happened and there was no swelling and it was as if his being bitten at all was a mistake such then was how he acted

but as to his knowledge no one knew by what means he cured all kinds of snakebites in this manner but it was said he first treated himself with powerful medicines for even if a snake ran into a hole he would catch it by p 311 the tail and it would turn round and bite him it was no matter to him but he would catch it by the head and kill it by placing it in his mouth and adopted no treatment whatever for the bite any more than if he had been bitten by a mouse

consulting the diviner

if a man is ill the people go to a diviner to enquire of him he says the man is suffering from disease or perhaps he says he is injured by some one who is a sorcerer they go home now knowing the man who practises sorcery

but others dispute saying no the diviner lies that man is not a sorcerer others say he speaks the truth at length the man hears that the diviner has pointed him out as a sorcerer he is angry and leaves the place and goes to be a dependent among other people but the people believe in what the diviner says but others do not believe

if a man is ill they go to enquire of the diviner he says the man is made ill by the idhlozi let them eat an ox the man will get well if they eat an ox they eat an ox they worship the amatongo and kill it

when they have eaten all the p 312 flesh and the man does not get well but is constantly ill until he dies some say the diviner lies others say he was called by the amatongo a diviner cannot conquer the amatongo

when he is dead they go to enquire of the diviner he says he has been called by the amatango they wish him to die and go and live with them and yet people do not cease to enquire of the diviner sometimes they say the diviner is true sometimes they say he is false for when a man is ill they will enquire of a diviner and the diviner says if they kill an ox the man will get well they kill an ox and the man gets well and then they believe in the diviners word and yet forsooth the man would have got well after a time but the people believe he has been saved by the amatango

when a man is ill they call doctors to see him they treat him and when he gets well they demand cattle telling him he must pay because they have cured him he pays and after he has paid he is ill again and goes to the same doctor whom he has paid he treats him but does not remove the disease and tells him it masters him and the sick man asks his ox to be sent back that he may go to other doctors they p 313 go to others they treat him perhaps they cure the disease then the first doctor feels hurt and says that the sick man was cured by him but they have paid the man that gave him physic last

when a doctor treats a sick person he kills an ox and cuts away the tendons of the legs and mixes them with medicines and chars them till they are dry when they are dry they are powdered and the sick man is scarified and the medicines are rubbed into the scarifications and the gall is poured on him that the amatongo may come and see him and lick him that he may get well

men go to the diviner that he may tell them what they wish to know they merely go to him and on their arrival do not tell him for what purpose they have come they are silent but he tells them they have come on some matter of importance they assent by striking the ground if they strike vehemently they do so because they hear the diviner mention things which they know and about which they have come to him if he mentions things unknown to them they strike the ground slightly if he mentions the very things they know they strike vehemently

p 314

if any thing is lost an ox for instance they go to a diviner and he tells them that if they look for it in a certain place they will find it they go to the place he mentions and find it but if they do not find it where he says they say the diviner is false he does not know how to divine they then go to another who is known to divine truly he tells them and they go and seek there if they find it they believe in that diviner and say he is a true diviner

to bar the way against the amatongo and against disease supposed to be occasioned by them

when a doctor bars the way68 for p 315 man who has isidhlaho69 he takes certain known medicines with him to the sick man and takes some of his blood and goes to a hard anthill which the ants will repair again if broken down he makes a hole in it and places in it the medicine with the blood of the sick man and closes up the hole with a stone and leaves the place without looking back70 till he gets home so it is said the disease is barred out and will never return again

when we bar the way with a frog of the river we catch a frog and take it home when the patient has been scarified over the p 316 most painful spot the blood is taken from that place and is placed in the frogs mouth and it is carried back to its place it is handled gently lest it should die so the disease is barred out from the man

again if a woman has lost her husband and she is troubled excessively by a dream and when she is asleep her husband comes home again and she sees him daily just as if he was alive and so she at last wastes away and says i am troubled by the father of soandso71 he does not leave me it is as though he was not dead at night i am always with him and he vanishes when i awake at length my bodily health is deranged he speaks about his children and his property and about many little matters therefore at last they find a man who knows how to bar out that dream for her he gives her medicine and says there is medicine when you dream of him and awake chew it do not waste the spittle which collects in your mouth whilst dreaming do not spit it on the ground but on this medicine that we may be able to bar out the dream

p 317

then the doctor comes and asks if she has dreamt of her husband she says she has he asks if she has done what he told her the woman says she has he asks whether she has spit on the medicine he gave her to chew the spittle which collected in her mouth whilst dreaming she says she has he says bring it to me then and let us go together to the place where i will shut him in

the doctor treats the dream with medicines which cause darkness he does not treat it with white medicines for among us black men we say there are black and white ubulawo therefore the doctor churns for the woman black ubulawo because the dream troubles her

so he goes with her to a certain place to lay the itongo perhaps he shuts it up in a bulb of inkomfe72 the bulb has a little hole made in its side and the medicine mixed with the dreamspittle is placed in the hole and it is closed with a stopper the bulb is dug up and placed in another hole and the earth rammed down around it that it may grow

he then leaves the place with the woman saying to her take care that on no account you look back but look before you constantly p 318 till you get home i say the dream will never return to you that you may be satisfied that i am a doctor you will be satisfied of that this day if it returns you may tell me at once

and truly the dream if treated by a doctor who knows how to bar the way against dreams ceases and even if the woman dreams of her husband the dream does not come with daily importunity she may dream of him occasionally only but not constantly as at first the people ask her for a few days after how she is she replies no i have seen nothing since perhaps it will come again they say formerly was there ever a time when he did not come the woman says there was not there used not to be even one day when he did not come i am still waiting to know whether he is really barred from returning

the doctor prevails over the dead man as regards that dream at length the woman says o soandso is a doctor see now i no longer know any thing of soandsos father he has departed from me for ever

such then is the mode in which dreams are stopped73

p 319

umwahleni the diviner

there was a great inyanga among our people whose name was umwathleni if a sorcerer came by night he would awake in the middle of the night and drive the man away perhaps he would scold him hefore quitting the hut saying soandso go back to your own village i see what you are doing and he would drive him away in the middle of the night he was a very celebrated inyanga of our people

sometimes he would go out when it was about to dawn and proceed to the river and go into a pool and would come out having his face smeared with white earth and go home having his neck entirely circled with a living imamba he would catch it and twist it round his neck or wear it as a fillet when he reached home he was fearful to look at and he would call the people of the village to come and sing the songs he had composed

he was a very active doctor he hopped about the whole house like a bird starting from one place and pitching in another and the songs were said to be songs which the amatongo gave him his songs were different from ours he composed a first part for the p 320 women and then a second part the women smote their hands and sang the first part for him and he sang the response alone indoors playing many pranks

but the izinyanga of the present time are said no longer to resemble those of former times for this umwathleni in order that men might see that he was an inyanga had many things concealed for him to find on the day he was formally declared to be an inyanga all the things which are hidden whether great or small become the property of the inyanga the people then acted thus with umwathleni and tested his skill as an inyanga that it might be known that he was an inyanga indeed when he came to find the things which were concealed he had his body ornamented and daubed with white clay when he reached his home the people had already hidden all kinds of things in very obscure places both out of doors and in the houses for him to find o he resembled a mad man entering the house already many crowds of people were assembled who had come to see the wonder he went rapidly and took out of the place of concealment whatever was hidden and placed it before the people he entered the house and took out whatever was hidden there he went down to the p 321 river and took out whatever was hidden there all these things became his that he might be celebrated and people say umwathleni is a diviner for it is the custom among black men to conceal things for a diviner to find that he may be seen to be a diviner so this was done for umwathleni but among diviners of the present time there is no longer any clear evidence that they are diviners and we now say they have not eaten impepo and we call them amabuda that is things which do not speak the truth

when we say a diviner has not eaten impepo we speak of reality impepo means true knowledge if any one has eaten the impepo which is eaten by real diviners or if he says he has really eaten it we say no it is not the impepo which diviners eat he ate another kind but when it is said he has not eaten impepo we mean that his divination does not resemble the divination of real diviners impepo means especially that clearness of perception74 which a diviner possesses nothing is too hard for him but he sees a difficult thing at once so we say of such a diviner he has eaten impepo p 322 it is this which the diviners people say

this is the impepo which we see but as regards the impepo of which we are speaking we do not say that a man may eat it because it is said to impart to diviners clear inner sight and so become a diviner himself no it cannot make him a diviner by itself if there is nothing within him which can unite with the impepo and make him clearsighted

there are two kinds of impepo white impepo has its own peculiarities we believe especially in white impepo but we do not believe at all in the black impepo75 that which arises after eating it is dark for example if a man dreams continually of a man he does not wish to see he eats the black impepo and drives him away by it that should he come again he may not see him distinctly nor understand who it is or when we sacrifice we do not take the black impepo but always the white and one always finds the white impepo in the folds of the sleeping mats of old and young that they may have distinct dreams

p 323

divining with sticks and bones

the account of diviners when they begin to enter on divination no one knows that a man will be a diviner he begins by being affected with sickness it appears about to cease but it does not it is in this respect at the commencement that diviners and those that have familiar spirits are alike they differ in their mode of divination for the diviner with familiar spirits does not resemble another diviner

when a diviner divines for people even he tells back to the people the truth which he first took from them if as regards that which is done by the diviner we put all together we shall say it is the people who divine for the diviner does not begin with any thing that he has not heard from the people who come to divine

there appears to be great cunning in the diviner for when he divines he says smite the ground that i may understand why you have come the people strike the ground

he says there is one thing only about which you have come they strike gently he tries to establish that which he says and tells them to strike the ground but they again strike gently as at p 324 first and he leaves that which he was saying and perceives that they do not assent and that he is going astray then he goes on nibbling till he hits upon something they know

when he says as you came on such an account and nothing else why do you not strike the ground then they smite and freely use the divining sticks saying thus to him you hit the mark there now then he will proceed carefully following that footprint of truth and trying to make it into a continuous track76 they assent to some things to others they object by striking gently they continually turn him back from his wandering by striking gently at last he perceives that the real importance of the disease starts from that point which he just touched on at first and he continually starts from the first words to which they gave their assent and continually goes near them till he finds out the truth by asking and nibbling until he is on the right track

having succeeded thus far he now begins to speak also about things with which they are not acquainted knowing that they will now believe in the things he p 325 says though they are not acquainted with them but because he has satisfied them by the truths he spoke at first they will not despise any of his words but every thing he says will be true in their eyes such is the method of diviners

we say he is told because he too asks of himself in the hearing of the people denying the correctness of what he himself has said and says just let me see what the disease is turning about continually and looking hither and thither it is evident that he is seeking and that the thing is lost to him and as to his finding it if those who come to enquire do not know it is not found at all therefore we say the diviners too are told for there are those who do not know how divination is managed and when disease occurs one is sent who forsooth never went to enquire of a diviner before and does not know how it is managed and even if he does know he murmurs in his heart saying o when i go to a diviner who knows i find him just like myself and he too wants me to tell him the truth there is no such thing as a diviner a diviner forsooth ought to tell me things which i know and which i do not know and not nibble at the affair like a man who knows nothing

p 326

the wise man then says in his heart no i see that these diviners are told by themselves they know nothing why do they nibble at the affair instead of telling the truth at once

so then such a man when he goes to enquire says for my part i shall be a man who knows nothing and you too soandso it is well when the diviner tells us to smite for us to smite vehemently at every thing even when he does not speak truly we will be set right by him we will say that every thing is true that the diviner says for we do not know any thing we are going to enquire of one who knows

and so they dispute nothing the diviner says they smite in assent to every thing till the diviner is confused and at length asks them saying o my friends did you ever smite in this manner when enquiring of a diviner before

they say o sir again and again we are they who enquire

he asks have you acted thus with all diviners

they say yes for as to us truly we neither know what is false nor what is true the diviner will distinguish in all such matters

p 327

he remains silent takes snuff and shakes his head and says no my friends you do not smite properly the diviner is the thumb77 why do you smite the ground vehemently whatever i say there being nothing which you dispute

they reply o truly sir we should not have come to you if we had known any one thing have we not come to you to hear from you what is the very truth

he says no you do not understand we diviners are told if people smite as you smite we know nothing

p 328

such is the position of diviners we may entertain doubts about them they are not like those who have familiar spirits they are told for they take the words from the people who come to enquire

john for example went to enquire of a diviner when his sister was ill wishing to know what was the cause of her illness but when he smote the ground he smote mechanically assenting to every thing the diviner said for he said to himself for my part i know nothing it is the diviner that shall point out to me the real facts of the case

the diviner reproved him saying surely my friend did you ever enquire of a diviner in this way before

john replied in the affirmative saying o it is i indeed who enquire78 for i am now the responsible head of our village there is no other man in it there is no one but me

the diviner said i see you do not know how to enquire of a diviner at length he devised a plan with one of his own people saying this man has not the least notion of divination just go and ask him that he may tell p 329 you why he has come that you may smite the ground for me in a proper manner

so indeed the man said to john the diviner says you do not know how to divine tell me the cause of your coming you will see that we smite the ground for him vehemently when he speaks to the point and if he does not speak to the point we do not smite much

john said in answer for my part i do not understand what you say i have merely come to the diviner for no other purpose than to hear of him the nature of a disease i did not come to talk with you about it for my part i shall hear from the diviner what the disease is

so he refused to tell him and the man went back to the diviner he said let him come to me again that we may hear

so john again smote the ground vehemently and thus expressed his assent to every thing the diviner said until he became quite foolish and said o my friend i see indeed that you do not know how to enquire of a diviner

he said this because there was no point where john assented very much nor where he assented slightly that he might see by his p 330 assenting slightly that he had not hit the mark he expected if he hit the mark john would smite the ground vehemently but if he missed it he would strike gently so he left off divining and said no my friend i never met with a man who enquired like you he could do nothing

john said o then my friend as you do not see the nature of the disease dow give me back my shilling that i may betake myself to another diviner

so the diviner gave him back the shilling his name was umngom’ung’umuntu79

john then went to unomantshintshi one who divined by means of pieces of stick the name of these pieces of stick is umabukula the mode of divining by them is remarkable

so john came to the sticks their owner took them and laid them on the ground he chewed some medicine and puffed it over them that they might tell him truly the very facts of the case divination by these sticks does not resemble that by a diviner for the owner of them enquires of them unomantshintshi asked them saying tell me how old p 331 is the person who is ill and they said but as they have no mouth they speak thus—if they say no they fall suddenly if they say yes they arise and jump about very much and leap on the person who has come to enquire in this way they told john the character of his sisters illness and traced out every little ramification of it which was known to john so john assented and left his shilling with the sticks and said this is what i want that the diviner should tell me things which i know without having asked me any question i shall know that he has divined by his telling me the symptoms of the disease which are known to me

their mode of speaking is this—if it is asked where the disease has seized the patient the sticks jump up at once and fix themselves on the place where the sick man is affected if it has affected the abdomen they fix themselves on the abdomen of the man who has come to enquire if the head they leap upon his head they go over every joint of the body that is affected by the disease or if they are asked where the doctor is who can cure the sick man they leap up and lie down in the direction of the place where the doctor lives if the owner of them knows for certain the name of a p 332 doctor who lives among the tribe to which the sticks point he mentions the name to them if it is he they mean they jump up and down and fix themselves on their owner and he knows thereby that they assent

many believe in the umabukula more than in the diviner but there are not many who have the umabukula those whom i know who have them are that same unomantshintshi and ukaukau these i know there is a third undangezi a red man of the house of undhlovu of whom my uncle used to enquire when i was a lad and came back with many things which the umabukula had said the umabukula of which john enquired gave him an exact account of his sisters illness saying truly where the disease began and where they had gone to enquire as to its nature he believed fully and went home satisfied

this then is the account of the umabukula and of the diviner they differ from each other they are not the same

as regards divination by bones the bones of all kinds of wild beasts are used there is that of the elephant and that of the lion and the bones of all great and well known wild beasts

p 333

the diviner by bones when any one comes to him to enquire unfastens the bag in which the bones are kept chews some little medicine and puffs on them he then pours them out and picks out the bones of certain animals with which he is about to divine they fill both his hands he brings them all together and throws them on the ground all the bones fall but what the bones say is not clear to the man who comes to enquire if he is not accustomed to them he sees nothing and does not know what it means

the owner of the bones manages them all properly when one in falling rests on another—if for instance it is the bone of an elephant and of the hyena—he says what does the elephant and hyena say and afterwards by his management of the bones he tells the enquirer that the bones say so and so that he sees that the bones say this and that

and the man replies yes the bones mention that for which i came here

then the owner of the bones says to the man just take them yourself and ask them why it is so

he throws them down and the owner then manages them properly p 334 and tells him what the bones say he says you see this bone standing in this manner it speaks of a certain matter in your village this says you must do soandso they say every thing the man knows

and a person by accustoming himself to divine with bones himself manages them properly from that proper management the matter is made evident and he sees for himself the diviner just points it out to him and then follows him when he has already seen by himself what the bones say such then is the mode of divining by bones

i myself once went to enquire of the bones there was a goat of umjijane one of my brothers which had been yeaning for some days and we wondered why it did not give birth to its young we went to a diviner the brother of umatula who divined with bones on coming to him we made obeisance saying eh friend your affairs80 we went home with him to his village he took a little medicine and chewed it and puffed on his bag in which the bones were kept he rubbed them p 335 and poured them out on the ground he managed them and said o what does the goat mean there are two kids—one white and the other there it is it is grey what do they mean

we replied we do not know friend we will be told by the bones

he said this goat which is a female black goat is yeaning but it is as though she had not yet yeaned but what do you say you say the goat is in trouble o i say for my part when i see the bones speaking thus i see that the young ones are now born the bones say the itongo of your house umjijane says you never worship it there is nothing the matter it says it has helped you very much the disease which sorcerers have poured upon your village is great it would have taken effect but the amatongo of your house would not allow it the goat has been made ill wilfully by sorcerers the bones say when you reach home the goat will have given birth to two kids when you reach home return thanks to the amatongo this is what the bones say

we gave him money and went home i not believing that there was any truth in it for the bones did not speak but i had heard p 336 a man speaking for them when we reached home we found the goat now standing at the doorway with two kids—one white and the other grey i was at once satisfied we sacrificed and returned thanks to the amatongo

magical practices81

it is said that doctors are the authors of magical practices as when a doctor takes a pot and pours water into it and then begins to medicate it but i do not understand the medication how it is done he then kindles a fire under the pot but it does not boil82 he kindles a very great fire

or he may take an assagai or a p 337 needle and place even a large pot on it and it does not fall that is called an umlingo or magical practice

i myself once saw this a doctor had a lot of bones hung on a string they are called umabukula i saw the doctor act thus with the bones he had hung them on a string and came to our village to divine for my father he first swept the ground and prepared a broad space he then took the bones in his hands shook them violently and praised them by name saying i come that i may hear buthluzabonunga mabalamaji83 he then scattered them on the ground they formed a line standing up on the ground and pointing to his bladder he then interpreted for them saying the bones say the disease is in the bladder they knew by that that the disease was umsizi a disease which is seated in the bladder

it is called also an umlingo if when a chief is about to fight p 338 with another chief his doctors cause a darkness to spread among his enemies so that they are unable to see clearly84

other modes of divining

there is among black men a something which is divination within them when any thing valuable is lost they look for it at once when they cannot find it each one begins to practise this inner divination trying to feel where the thing is for not being able to see it he feels internally a pointing which tells him if he will go down to such a place it is there and he will find it at length it says he will find it at length he sees it and himself approaching it before he begins to move from where he he sees it very clearly indeed and there is an end of doubt that sight is so clear that it is as though it was not an inner sight but as if he saw the very thing itself and the place where it is so he quickly arises and goes to the place if it is a hidden place he throws himself into it as though there was something that impelled him to go as swiftly as the wind and in fact he finds the thing if he has not acted by mere headguessing if it has been done by p 339 real inner divination he really sees it but if it is done by mere headguessing and knowledge that he has not gone to such a place and such a place and that therefore it must be in such another place he generally misses the mark

when cattle are lost and it is not known where they are a little animal whose name is isipungumangati85 is found and we ask it saying mantis where are the cattle we hold it in our hand and place it with its pointed head looking upwards if it points in another direction with its head and it is clear in what direction it points we shall pay no attention to the various directions in which it points but look earnestly to the place where it points its head steadily and perhaps we find them there and perhaps we do not

p 340

chiefs divine

as to the custom of a chief of a primitive stock of kings among black men he calls to him celebrated diviners to place him in the chieftainship that he may be really a chief and not be one by descent merely but by adding a chieftainly character by calling doctors who possess medicines and charms and these doctors place him in the chieftainship86

one comes and performs many ceremonies telling the chief the power of his medicines another does the same he performs ceremonies and says for my part in order that you may know that i am a doctor it would be well for you to levy an army to attack another chief whilst i am treating you with my medicines that you may understand me there is ubulawo if you churn it in your vessel87 and call soandso you p 341 may see whether you will not cut him off in a very little time it is well for you to begin this very day whilst i am here

truly then the vessel of the chief is first used by the doctors when he churns88 it he calls the chief who is the enemy of his chief and lauds ancient chiefs who are now dead if the ubulawo froths up the doctor shouts his name aloud and says to his chief behold thou son of soandso hereafter thou mayst take me to task i say on the very day when you go out against him you will destroy him if there were any danger i would tell you and the doctor tells the chief how to use the vessel and to consider thoroughly the action of the ubulawo which is churned that he may see what will happen by looking into the vessel89

when he has finished his instruction the doctor says you can take me to task if it does not turn out in accordance with what i say i will cast away my medicines and be no longer a doctor

so the doctor leads out an army that he may go with it he goes round about it and burns his p 342 medicines and says even their assagais shall constantly miss you he goes a little way with it and returns from the top of the hill and then returns to the chief

and if they already have any thing belonging to the chief that is attacked when the army is led forth the chief sits without moving on a circlet made of medicines within which that which belongs to the other is placed whilst he does this he says i am overcoming him i am now treading him down he is now under me i do not know by what way he will escape90

such then is the vessel of the chief his vessel is a diviner to him for if there is any place about which the chief is angry he goes to his vessel and churns it continually and spits in the direction of the person he hates he spits before sunrise at the time of churning his vessel and subdues the man he hates

a chief does thus with his vessel and he generally mentions what he is about to do before it is done saying such and such will happen and you will do so and so and so it is when an army is led out the men look for a word to come from the chief to give them courage that they may know what kind of people it is to whom p 343 they are going and it is as though they knew this beforehand

but it is so because again and again the chief is accustomed to say you will not see any army i say i have already killed soandso i have seen him here again and again you will only take the cattle there are no men but mere women

the word of the chief gives confidence to his troops they say we are going only the chief has already seen all that will happen in his vessel such then are chiefs they use a vessel for divination

in like manner also a young man that has powerful ubulawo when he churns it calls on the name of the daughter of such an one churning it at the same time if the ubulawo froths up he knows that he has prevailed over her he takes some things belonging to her and places them in a pot and thus churns her that her heart may regard him it is the same as the churning of a man who is churned by a chief

it is the same as regards petty chiefs if one has gone away from his chief the chief says although soandso has departed he will come back again i am now sitting upon him i do not know by what way he will go away from p 344 me such then is the conduct of a chief with a vessel

a chief is troubled and is afraid and gets thin if when he churns his vessel it no longer gives propitious indications he is greatly troubled it is as though he was about to die or about to be killed by another chief he has no strength if his vessel does not give him confidence such then is the confidence of a chief with which he trusts in his vessel

various kinds of ubulawo having been bruised they are placed in the vessel and water is poured on them and the chief churns them continually and this is what we mean by a chiefs vessel it is not a divining vessel if nothing is placed in it if such a vessel is lost it is a great matter with the chief there will be much trouble and many men die after the loss of the vessel if it is not found the diviners point out many men and many are killed the doctors crowd together to produce courage in the chief by their medicines and by words of encouragement until his fear ceases when he sees that he continues to live

p 345

the chiefs vessel

a chief among the amazulu practises magic91 on another chief before fighting with him something belonging to that chief is taken and the other washes himself with intelezi92 in order that he may overcome the other when they begin to fight and forsooth the one was conquered long ago by having his things taken and practised upon by magic

and if the cattle fly from an enemy their dung and the earth which retains the marks of their footprints are taken to the chief that he may churn them and sit upon them and the men say the chief is now sitting upon them he has already eaten them up we shall find them and when they have found them they say the doctor of the chief is a doctor indeed

the dung and earth which retains the mark of the footprints are placed in the chiefs vessel a circlet is made with medicines93 p 346 in which portions of them are wrapped up the chiefs vessel is placed on the circlet and they then wait when he has done this the chief says i have now conquered them those cattle are now here i am now sitting upon them i do not know in what way they will escape

the isitundu is a vessel which is well sewn with palmetto fibres it is large but its mouth is small it is said to be an isitundu because its mouth is just large enough to admit the hand all the knowledge of the chief is in this vessel94 if he wishes to kill another chief he takes something belonging to that chief and puts it in the vessel and practises magic on it that he may kill him when he has no power left

when a chief has taken another chief95 he churns him in his vessel and at once calls him when he calls him he inspects carefully the mode in which the ubulawo acts and says but i say that although i am cutting off the head of soandso yet i say you will meet with an army i see that he stands firm by his manliness p 347 i see this in my vessel when i am churning him i see that the ubulawo is hard96 when i call him but i say i shall cut off his head but do you fight with determination they burn they are a fire97

he also tells them if they will eat the cattle without any loss to themselves saying i say you will eat up the cattle when the sun rises whilst it is still rising you will already have overcome him i have already overcome him i see it in my vessel i say the cattle will come here tomorrow morning to report that you have conquered

therefore the army goes out courageously saying there is no enemy with which we shall have to fight our chief has already bound soandso we shall stab mere watermelons98 which are unable to resist

divining by familiar spirits

when my aunt was ill the wife of my father by adoption99 my father went to the forestcountry to find a doctor to dig up the poison which was killing her the people directed him to a doctor with familiar spirits1 saying go to umancele it is he who will help you when he came to him he said my friend you see i come to you for i have got no good from all the other doctors i think that perhaps you can help me more than they i wish you to go with me in the morning umancele assented

in the morning there was a p 349 change of weather and he staid at umanceles house many days there was very heavy rain so that they could not set out on the first fine day they set out we saw them on their arrival not knowing the day on which they would come

when they came all the people that lived with us were told that the familiar spirits had come all the people collected in the house of umantshayo the sick person her sickness was not that she was in suffering she was sick because all her children died we who went in to salute the doctor did not know for certain that he had familiar spirits but we heard it said by other people that he had we had seen nothing with our own eyes

when we had gone in to salute some saluted the familiar spirits but others before they saluted heard the spirits saluting them saying good day soandso calling the person by his name he started and exclaimed o whence does the voice come i was saluting umancele yonder

in the morning they all went out to the gateway of the village to enquire of the diviner but umancele said o unkomidhlilale2 my fathers name which was p 350 given him by the spirits for my part i cannot give you a single word one way or the other3 there are masters4 who will answer you

and they did answer saying unkomidhlilale we cannot divine unless you pay us do you not see that we have come to help you give us a bullock that we may show you the things which are killing you

we did not see any one speaking with unkomidhlilale we merely heard a word telling him to get a bullock we looked round saying o umanceles mouth is quite still whence does the voice come we all stared one at the other

unkomidhlilale went into the cattlepen to look for a bullock and selecting one said here is your bullock my masters truly if you are come to give me life again i cannot refuse a bullock even though there are none left they have all gone to the doctors i give one which was left the spirits returned thanks and said it is well we thank you for the bullock my father sat down

the spirits spoke saying unkomidhlilale it is your wife who is sick she is still young you p 351 are astonished and say what is this for i took this wife from her father when she was still a little girl she came here to me and gave birth to a female child after that she could not have children she gave birth for the ground5 how has this happened but we are about to tell how this happens to your wife you ask where your wife walked over poison6 but she has no where walked over poison the disease came to your house when you were drinking beer it is a man who injured her your wife died7 for her beauty she went out to make water but the man was watching her and when she went back he took the earth which was saturated with her urine and wrapped it up and said in his heart how now then does the matter stand since she refused me and would not be my wife i will bereave her that is i will kill her children that she too may be troubled as well as me

the spirits said he did thus—he took poisonous plants8 and p 352 bound them up with the earth impregnated with her urine and made little bags of skin in which he placed the mixture and buried them under the fireplace of his own hut that when the woman had a call of nature and went to make water she might have a burning in her bladder he injured her by these means after that indeed she became pregnant but miscarried9 the spirits continued but we spirits can go and dig up the mixture we can go and take it and bring it here and show it to you we cannot advise you to go to a doctor for the sake of obtaining his advice that he may cause that which is injuring you to rot the doctors can do nothing we spirits will go we will go tomorrow today we are tired we are now going to rest

others came forward who had been injured at the same time with her and said you know masters that we lived together and were hated by that man

p 353

the spirits said to undayeni we know that you are unkomidhlilales son you too are injured on account of your wifes beauty it was not liked that she should marry one so ugly as you are but you took her to wife because you were powerful—because you had so many beautiful cattle which were an object of admiration to the maidens father and so he gave her to you and that excited hatred in the others heart and he said how is it that ujadu has given so beautiful a damsel to so ugly a beggar as that i will kill him and force him to leave her and when he is dead we shall see whether i shall marry her or not you were made ill on that account but the spirits10 of your people would not allow you to be killed but said it cannot be permitted that our child should be killed on account of the beauty of his wife we gave him cattle that he might marry and we be honoured for treating him well but notwithstanding that undayeni although you are living now you are being killed and the ancestral spirits give you no help for that sorcerer is constantly longing to bring home your corpse11 we are going to dig up that by which you are injured p 354 and you shall see it with your own eyes

on the following morning the spirits said give us some food that we may eat and set out the people fetched food and beer in a pot and placed it before umancele he and his people ate and drank it all the spirits returned thanks and said we thank you we are now going we are going with the spirits of your people—with ukcuba and ubutongwane and all the people of your house12 we do not say that we shall take that which is killing you without difficulty we shall fight with the spirits of that place but we shall conquer them and bring back what we are going for so good bye13 they went

we umancele and his people remained we wondering and asking how will this matter turn out the spirits went away for three days umancele remained with us we asked him when the spirits would come back again he replied they may come perhaps tomorrow if they do not find it a difficult work where they are gone and they conquer them but i do not myself know the day of their return for they did not tell me for they go to an enemy p 355 we shall know only by their arrival

when we asked how we should know when they arrived umancele said you will hear them speak and if you are making a great noise and talking aloud they will say be quiet we are come and if you do not hear they will call him by name who is making the noise and say be quiet you soandso do you not hear thus it will be when they come

umancele was amongst us like a stranger not like a doctor he and his peoople ate and drank

on the fourth day in the afternoon one spirit came and we heard it saying i have come umancele asked who are you it replied i am soandso giving the name of the spirit umancele again enquired saying o soandso where are all the rest it replied o we are troubled they remain behind the people are dying14 the enemy is stabbing us they will not let us dig up the poison but we too have our men and they are fighting with them i have come to ask for food we are hungry i am going back i shall not sleep here

p 356

the people fetched food and placed it before umancele both solid food and beer he ate it all the spirit returned thanks and said good bye umancele asked when they would come back it said i do not know for the people are tired from the time we got there all three days we have been constantly fighting till today perhaps we may come tomorrow i cannot say we shall see by and bye it departed

we retired to rest on the fifth day on the morrow at noon as we were sitting unconscious of any thing we heard the spirits speaking at the upper part of the house saying cease your noise we are come but we are not all here some have been carried away by the river

umancele asked who they were

they replied ubutongwane he would not cross he was afraid of the water but all the things which we went to fetch are not here they too were carried away by the water the little bag of soandso the one with such and such things in it has been carried away and that of soandso but other things are here the bag of soandso and of soandso and of all the others who are poisoned we bring with us

p 357

we heard our mothers whispering that the spirits had come we asked when they came they said just now at noon but they say your father has been carried away by the river and some of the things also we went out saying just let us go and hear too we went into the house and sat down and truly we heard it was so the spirits were speaking we tried to discover where the voice came from we looked earnestly at umanceles mouth we did not see him speaking we could not understand where the voice was

the spirits said we have all come they related all the acts of the army they said we conquered them in order that we might conquer them we made an attack with fire and so conquered them we remained watching the fire that when it had gone out we might dig up the things which we have brought so we dug them up and have brought them all you will see them in the morning every one of them

on the following day at noon every thing was taken out of the house and the floor was smeared with cowdung that all dust might be taken away the floor dried and all the people of our villages15 p 358 collected to see the things which had come the old people men and women were chosen to go into the house the young people female and male were separated they did not go in but remained outside they said young people could not go in it was not proper for them to see the things of wicked sorcery

as they were still speaking the spirits said arrange yourselves properly and be quite quiet and truly they were absolutely silent the spirits said look about you for that which falls they waited and watched they heard something fall from above like a thing thrown by some one it fell with a sound many things fell in this way until all had fallen when all had fallen the spirits said collect them all are now here they collected them when there was any thing they did not see they heard a spirit saying see there is something else there it is near such a wattle and there is another by such a wattle16 they collected every thing

the spirits said you now have every thing go to the rocks in the river and spread them abroad there you will there see p 359 the things which you have been looking for soandsos little bag and such and such a thing you will see and that thing of soandso they distinguished all the little bags according to the persons to whom they belonged

they said go then and cast them into the water when you have seen them that they may be carried away by it you will get well and she whose children died will get well and he who is sick will rejoice that you may know that we are indeed diviners

so they went and spread them out by the water some found their beads some found earth bound up others found pieces of their old tattered garments others their rags all found something belonging to them they threw them into the water and they were carried away they washed their hands and bodies saying we cannot go home with the stench of this filth upon us

when they came home we asked our mothers in whispers if they had found all our things they replied yes surely we believe that they are diviners we have seen the things there was that of soandso which we used to see before it was lost we saw every thing which we knew we now believe that we shall get well

p 360

on the morrow umancele was given his bullock he took his leave and went home we gave thanks saying go in prosperity our masters we have seen your skill but we are now looking out for our recovery they departed

we remained in expectation umantshayo became pregnant her months were ended she gave birth to a child after five days it was attacked with violent sickness and diarrhœa it died we lost heart again and said o since it was said the poison which was killing us has been dug up whence comes this o we shall look back again when we see that it is thus we shall be satisfied and say that even digging up the poison is of no use we are in trouble

she remained a long time she became pregnant her months were ended she gave birth to a child it lived a few days again it was seized with the same disease and died

we said o what is the real truth in this matter for we see that we are still weeping why did we give our bullock where is the truth of the matter since even now we see no child born to live o the spirits are deceiving us they did not take away the poison which was killing us they p 361 sewed up to deceive us their own things in the bags that they might come and take our bullock we do not see that they dug up the poison for us we are dying notwithstanding and to this day the children of umantshayo die

and undayeni did not get the least rest he was always ill and at last died not a single doctor helped him all were unsuccessful and he trifled with my fathers wife who had no doctor who could cure her all failed and the people of undayeni had the same cause of complaint that we had

another account

i once went to a person with a familiar spirit to enquire respecting a boy of ours who had convulsions my father and brother and mothers and i wondered what was the nature of the disease since it was a new thing we saw at first sight that it was something about which we must enquire of the diviner we set out and went to the person with a familiar spirit we made obeisance saying eh friend we come to you for good news we waited the doctor said good day we replied saying yes she poured out some snuff and took it she then yawned and stretched and also p 362 shuddered and said they who divine are not yet here

we remained a long time and at length we too took some snuff when we were no longer thinking of the reason of our coming we heard that the spirits were come they saluted us saying good day we looked about the house to see where the voice came from

the spirits said why are you looking about for we merely salute you

we said we look about because we cannot see where you are

they said here we are you cannot see us you will be helped by what we say only

the voice was like that of a very little child it cannot speak aloud for it speaks above among the wattles of the hut

we replied to the salutation

the spirits said you have come to enquire about something

the person whose familiars they were said strike the ground for them see they say you came to enquire about something

so we struck the ground

they said that about which you have come is a great matter the omen has appeared in a man

we struck the ground and asked saying how big is the p 363 man in whom the omen has appeared

they replied it is a young person

we struck the ground vehemently there when we perceived that she17 had hit the mark

they said i say the omen is a disease

we smote the ground vehemently

they said it is disease in the body of that young person they said let me see what that person is it is a boy

we assented strongly

they said he does not yet herd he is still small

we smote violently on the ground

they said but you wonder at what has occurred to him they said strike the ground that i may see what that is which has occurred to the body of the little boy

we struck the ground vehemently and said we will hear from you for you have seen that it is a little boy

they said there he is i see him it is as though he had convulsions

upon that we smote the ground vehemently

p 364

they said what kind of convulsions are they enquire of me

we said we have nothing to ask about for behold you know you have already first told us for it is proper that you should tell us to ask if you were not going the right way but as we perceive that you are going the right way what have we to ask of you

they replied i tell you to ask for perhaps i am going wrong

we said no you are not going wrong you are going by the way which we ourselves see

they said the disease began in the child when he began to walk when he was very young you did not see the disease—when was a little infant at length when he began to laugh the disease had not yet appeared at length he began to sit up it not having yet appeared at length he began to go on all fours it not having yet appeared at length he began to stand before he was affected by it when he began to lift his foot from the ground to toddle the disease came upon him when you saw the disease you saw it without expecting anything of the kind he died in his mothers arms his mother poured water on him when he was turning up his eyes she uttered a great p 365 cry you started and ran into the house when you entered he had again come to life the mother said you heard me cry my child was dead do you not see he is wet i poured water over him for some time and therefore he has come to life again the spirits continued i have now told you this deny if what i say is not true

we replied we can in no way dispute what you say we have told you already that you were going by the right path

the spirits said this disease resembles convulsions you have come to me to know what is this disease which is like convulsions

we said just so you say truly we wish to hear from you spirit you will tell us the disease and its nature that we may at length understand of what nature it is for you have already told us the name of the disease tell us also the medicines with which we shall treat it

they replied i will tell you the disease you are greatly alarmed because you say the child has convulsious and a child with convulsions is not safe he burns himself in the fire i shall tell you what caused this disease just smite on the ground boys that i p 366 may understand if the child is the only son of his father

we said yes he is his only son

they said smite the ground that i may understand what relation you are to the child since you come here to enquire

we smote vehemently on the ground

they said the boy is your brother smite the ground that i may see if he is really your brother born of your own father or not not so he is not really the son of your father your fathers are brothers he is your brother because your fathers were brothers

we smote the ground violently

they said smite that i may understand which is the older of the two fathers i say boys your own father is dead smite that i may understand where he died there he is i see him he died boys in the open country he was stabbed with an assagai by what tribe was he stabbed

we smote the ground vehemently

they said he was stabbed by the amazulu on this side the utukela that is where your father died boys the father of that child is your uncle because he was your fathers brother he was the elder of the two

p 367

they said let me now tell you the disease which has attacked the boy his disease is like convulsions but it is not convulsions and you are greatly alarmed because you think it is convulsions but i shall tell you for you will not again see him have a fit i shall tell you what to do when you get home did you ever sacrifice for him you have never sacrificed for him

they said let me just see where you live you live among the amathlongwa that is the tribe where you live let me just see where you were born you belong to the amadunga just let me see since you are here among the amathlongwa why you were separated from the amadunga to come here you quarrelled with your own people and so came here to the amathlongwa smite the ground that i may see if you have built your own village

we smote the ground

they said you have not yet built it you live in the village of another you have not yet built your own village on the hill as for the boy the disease attacked him in the village where you now are smite the ground that i may see what relation the man with whom you live is to you

we smote the ground

p 368

they said he is your cousin on the mothers side i see nothing wrong in the village of your cousin he is good i see no practising of sorcery there i see that the village is clear you eat with your eyes shut for you have nothing to complain of what i shall tell you is this it is the ancestral spirits that are doing this it is not convulsions the child has for my part i say he is affected by the ancestral spirits

we wondered that we should continually hear the spirits which we could not see speaking in the wattles and telling us many things without our seeing them

the spirits said i point out your ancestral spirits when you reach home you shall take a goat there it is a he goat i see it

we said how do you see it

they said be silent i will tell you and satisfy you as to its colour it is white that is it which has just come from the other side of the ilovo from the amanzimtoti it is now a large he goat you shall sacrifice it and pour its gall on the boy you will go and pluck for him itongomedicine i see that itongo it says that your village is to be removed from its present place and built on the hill does not the itongo ask why has the village staid so long in the midst of another p 369 it injures the lad saying let the village remove from this place the he goat you will sacrifice to your grandrnother it is she who refuses to allow the child to die for your grandfather had been earnest to kill him that he might die and be buried in accordance with his wish i tell you this to satisfy you i tell you that if the disease returns you may come back to me and take your money i tell you that this disease is caused by the ancestral spirit because it wishes that your village should remove

the spirits said now i have divined for you so give me my money

we took out the money

then they said to her whose familiars they were take it there is the money

they added i just take this money of yours you will come and take it again if the disease returns i say it will never return again

the woman with the familiar spirits sat in the midst of the house at the time of full daylight when we enquired of her for the spirits cannot go alone when they are going to divine their possessor goes with them for if they wish to go they tell their possessor saying to her let us go to such a p 370 place wherever they wish to go the possessor of them cannot speak18 she usually says little for she too enquires of the spirits and says soandso when you say so do you tell the people who come to enquire of you the truth in reply they say they do tell the truth and those who come to enquire will see it she says tell them the truth they will come to me here if they come to take back their money and if you tell them falsehoods i shall give them back their money again if you do not tell them the truth i shall give it back to them the spirits assent saying you may give it back for our parts we speak truly we tell no lies

so the possessor of the spirits took the money

the spirits said to us go in peace we wondered when they bid us go in peace without our seeing them they told us to give their services to all our people at home we said we would

they said when you get home do exactly what i have told you

we replied yes we will do all you have told us to do

so we went home on our arrival we found the child better as we were speaking with him our father came into the house and we said o father we never had such confidence in a doctor when we heard we said the spirit has divined the spirits divined they told us all things—our birth and the order of our birth and that he with whom we live is our cousin they told us every thing they said the boy has nothing the matter with him that will kill him they said we are alarmed thinking he has convulsions and we assented saying yes yes we think he has convulsions the diviner denied saying no he has not convulsions he is possessed by a spirit the spirit says that your village must be moved the spirits pointed out a white goat and directed that it should be sacrificed for the child and the village be moved and they ordered us to pluck for him itongomedicine and sacrifice the goat they said if the disease returned we were to go and take back our money

our father said o they have divined both as regards the disease and our relations with our cousin we see they have divined why did not our ancestral spirits tell me in a dream that there p 372 was something which they wanted instead of revealing themselves by coming to kill the child in this way what prevented them from telling me in a dream what they complained about instead of revealing themselves by coming to kill the child in this way without saying any thing to me first these dead men are fools why have they revealed themselves by killing the child in this way without telling me go and fetch the goat boys

we went to fetch the goat from the house we killed it and poured the gall over the boy our cousin went to pluck the itongomedicine he squeezed the juice into a cup and gave it to the boy to drink and left the cup outside the kraal19 the goat was eaten

we worshipped the ancestral spirits saying we shall see that the child is possessed by a spirit by his getting well and not getting ill again we shall say the spirit has lied if he is still ill we shall see by his recovery and shall then say the spirits have told the truth we do not understand why you have killed such a child as this what prevents you from making old people ill that is a good spirit which appears in dreams and tells what it wants p 373 such were the words with which we addressed the spirits

our father said i shall now quit this place with my village in the morning and put it in a place by itself why when i thought i was living in peace am i still obliged to be a wanderer there is a site of an old village i will examine it well i shall now remove the village may the new place be healthy and good and this boy of mine be no longer ill if he is still ill i shall say he is not possessed with a spirit and i will quarrel with the spirits and say they have not divined properly our father said thus he said i will look at the new site in the morning let us go together my cousin and look at the new site and inspect it well for i say i am still a wanderer for the ancestral spirits have killed me for staying here

so he and his cousin went in the morning to inspect the site they went to a place on the river umathlongwa and thoroughly inspected it and thought it good and that it was a proper place for us to build on for there was water near they returned home

in the morning we took our axes and went to cut wattles and poles for the village when we had finished cutting the people of our village left that of our cousin p 374 and went to it and then we completed it the boy was not ill any more it turned out in accordance with the word of the spirit he was not ill again at length he took out the calves at milking time and herded the calves at length he not only herded the calves and goats but all the cattle—calves goats sheep and cows and at length he grew to be a man his name is umpini he is now a diligent man next year he will milk the cows

the name of the woman with the familiar spirits is umkaukazi it was not a man but a woman she saw us for the first time when we saluted her on our arrival for we too had been told by others that she was a great diviner she lived on the umtwalume by the sea at a distance from us it is a day and a halfs journey from thisembed"
