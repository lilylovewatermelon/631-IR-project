outro
yeah yeah
we live in an environment whose entire population of critics and no painters to be found
where have all the storytellers gone
just when did i become so eaten up by moss and covered in a cloak of popularity
and then i lose my voice in between the echoes of selfserving prophecy
a captain without his ship a chief—a chief without a tribe
a raging megalomaniac who only speaks to hear his cheeks slap together and worship the sound of his own voice
a muffled cry—a muffled cry—a muffled cry—a muffled cry
power concaved inside a woman
to configure through the mythical power of the trees the graphics being paper th—
paper thin garments and garments and garments and garments and garments and garments and garments and garments
pray for summer days
the rain and wind is so strong outside my window
and winters always searching for another
i hear—i hear his cheeks slap together and worship his own voice
lou—louder okay alright
im so tired of the demands of this world her nagging voice
the song she sings the songs that she desires
she cries out in the heat of her passions
her legs spread ready for—ready for a stranger
the captain without his ship a chief with—a chief without a tribe
a raging megalomaniac who only speaks to hear his cheeks slap together and worship the sound of his own voice
i dare not take another drink until its gone
just when did i become so eaten up by moss and covered in a cloak of popularity
when i lose my voice in between the echoes of selfserving prophecy4embed"
