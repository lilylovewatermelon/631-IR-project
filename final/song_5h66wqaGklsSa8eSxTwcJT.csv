this dont usually happen like this though fuck it

verse
i woke up to like ninetynine missed calls
thats like ninetynine people i probably pissed off
like damn nigga i was on a jail call
damn niggas make me hate my cell phone
like damn my nigga im in the studio
last time i dropped an album was like a year ago
yeah you tellin me you starving but i been there though
like growin up breakfast lunch and dinner wasnt cereal
i know whats up
you just wanna be all in the videos and smoke it up
i know you aint really with the shits but you just throw it up
pretty bitches in my city litty they just going up
nigga you just wanna be around me cause my money up
heard them goofy niggas tryna line me they dont want smoke with us
had to pop an addy i was down yeah had to focus up
most my niggas dogs i hit up bitches that my homies fucked
i hear too much me in niggas songs so i had to switch it up i had to switch it up
pick out diamonds in particular cause im just rich as fuck
rest in peace to that boy trayvon i got my hoodie up
they know exactly how we give it up shoot a bully up
and you bitches know that i cannot waste no time
bitch im really grindin
if i ever said i love you never mind it
especially when i feel like you out here thottin
i threaten you but i fuck with you lets be honest
i hide the fact that i love to smoke on exotic
flowers i give you all my hours
i fuck around i miss you though i promise
bonnie and clyde issues guns around us
no bozos in my circle they get cut quick
we cant even get around i got my hoodie on in public
house arrest in florida they always checked up on me
so when i was in the studio i said i was in publix
if you could walk in my shoes you could walk on water
percocets like nyquil got me buying sawedoffs
since i been in high school i been feeling heartless
i swear i was like you now look at me ballin
10k on one fit fly like i departed
stay with that rocket ooh i go j harden
cant tell if i got it but i stay on it
and they stay frontin but it aint nothin
cause i make money talkin big money
mmh if i go broke stay away from me
mmh if i go broke ima take money yeah
i might go broke in my late hundreds
its hard not to talk money cause i got money now
and these chains around my neck over two hundred thou
and puma just gave me a budget i should say fuck it
and give it to the schools cause they need it more than i need it now
swear i paid my dues i should speak up more though im playin quiet
tryna keep it cool like the time i was in the studio with future and his goons
sittin next to my favorite rapper actin scared to say it to him
used to bump march madness poppin addys because of you
after you and drizzy dropped then i got in tune yeah
drizzy thats my broski i appreciate you too yeah
first time in the garden it was all because of you yeah
i probably was odin to do a song but i was new yeah
i cant lie oh you was like my idol ask my crew yeah
right when i thought viral was viral tekashi blew yeah
and thats my nigga too i fuck with you i swear to god
type of nigga keep that shit a hundred cameras off
and im the type of nigga you might see in saint laurent
