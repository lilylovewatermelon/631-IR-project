walk with me
ay if you hear me out there
lord walk with me
i get down on my knees every night and say
walk with me
hahahaha yeah
lord walk with me
im going to war im going to war

verse 1 young buck
you never know when deaths coming all you hear is gunshots
lil kids get to running old ladies get off the block
then the popsicle truck music comes to a stop
niggas get on the floor with they front doors locked
syringes and sirens the only thing on the street
people act like they dont know who did it but they know its me
every days a death threat but i aint dead yet
so i go put a hole in a nigga from the next set
dont know where i slept at just know where my tec at
its the first of the month my bitch aint got her check yet
juvie left me in california i dont respect that
i love him too much to beef so ima accept that
but ima just step back and focus on buck
tired of riding in yours im bout to buy my own truck
got to try my own luck get rich or die tryin
its gunit til im gone lord knows i aint lying niggas

first there was two sets of footprints in the sand
then there was one set of footprints in the sand
when times get hard and shit hits the fan
god dont walk with me he carry me man
first there was two sets of footprints in the sand
then there was one set of footprints in the sand
when times get hard and shit hits the fan
god dont walk with me he carry me man

verse 2 young buck
you dont know what i been through to get what i done got
if you looked through a scope you couldnt hit what i done shot
couldnt flip what i done copped couldnt tip what i done topped
tah murdah you all talk like a clip without a glock
when you holla gunit on some other shit
you need to do the research and see who you fucking with
i smoke all your weed up go run up your beeza
your baby momma want me i dont want that skeeza
shes scratched my beamer but i aint seenher
when i catch the bitch ima gangsta leanher  whoa
we be playin in them videos with them pretty hoes

lord knows i keep all my jewels froze
as long as the check come then fuck the award shows

verse 3 young buck
half of these kids never read the bible
but they can tell you how to kill a man better than i do
the reason they fucked up they all been lied to
i know what it feels like when a nigga misguide you
my momma stay in the projects and i been having money
i went bought her a house but she told me she aint want it
what right then i understood that the hoods in my blood
so i hollered cashville lettin em know where im from
niggas know i got a gun when i come to the club
and if it go down you better tell your people to duck
why should i slow down i just got started targeting artists
wait til the bullets start hopping out the cartridge
i come to get it popping pray to god the news watching
so when they see him his niggasll know who got em
we came from the bottom to the top from hoopties to a drop
and kill or be killed is the attitude i got nigga
chorus 50 cent
first there was two sets of footprints in the sand
then there was one set of footprints in the sand
when times get hard and shit hits the fan
god dont walk with me he carry me man
first there was two sets of footprints in the sand
then there was one set of footprints in the sand
when times get hard and shit hits the fan
god dont walk with me he carry me man
