lets begin with the day i met her
and how fast this good ole boys world got better
sky got bluer the grass got greener
just the first few seconds after id first seen her

verse 2
like my favorite song on a new set of speakers
my best old jeans and my brokein sneakers
a home run pitch floatin right down the middle
the sweet music made when the bow hits the fiddle

chorus
shes right on the money
she goes direct to my heart
and when it comes to lovin me
shes everything i need bullseye perfect
shes right on the money

verse 3
shes no red lights when ive overslept
shes a three point jump shot thats nothing but net
a hand full of aces when the dealers done dealin
im forever on a roll thats how shes got me feeling

chorus
shes right on the money
she goes direct to my heart
and when it comes to lovin me
shes everything i need bullseye perfect
shes right on the money
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likebridge
shes the best cook thats ever melted cheese
i aint much around the house but i aim to please
theres absolutely no reason to doubt her
when she says i wouldnt last ten minutes without her

chorus
shes right on the money
she goes direct to my heart
and when it comes to lovin me
shes everything i need bullseye perfect
shes

outro
ohhhh right on the money
she goes directly to my heart
and when it comes to lovin me
shes everything i need bullseye perfect
