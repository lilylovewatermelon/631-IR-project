out on our own
dreamin in a world that we both know
is out of our control
but if shit hits the fan were not alone

prechorus ashe
cause youve got me and you know
that ive got you and i know

chorus ashe
if the tide takes california
im so glad i got to hold ya
and if the sky falls from heaven above
oh i know i had the best time fallin into love
weve been livin on a fault line
and for a while you were all mine
ive spent a lifetime givin you my heart
i swear that ill be yours forever til forever falls apart
til forever falls apart

verse 2 finneas
so this is it thats how it ends
i guess theres nothing more romantic than dyin with your friends
and im not sorry for myself
i wouldnt want to spend a minute lovin anybody else
