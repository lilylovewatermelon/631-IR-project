sweet love yeah

verse 1
i didnt mean it when i said i didnt love you so
i shoulda held on tight i never shoulda let you go
i didnt know nothin i was stupid i was foolish
i was lyin to myself
i couldnt have fathomed i would ever be without your love
never imagined id be sitting here beside myself
guess i didnt know you guess i didnt know me
but i thought i knew everything i never felt

prechorus
the feelin that im feelin now that i dont hear your voice
or have your touch and kiss your lips cause i dont have a choice
oh what i wouldnt give to have you lyin by my side
right here cause baby we belong together

chorus
when you left i lost a part of me together
its still so hard to believe
come back baby please
come back come back come back come back
cause we belong together
who else am i gon lean on when times get rough who else
whos gonna talk to me on the phone til the sun comes up who else
whos gonna take your place there aint nobody better who else
oh baby baby we belong together

i cant sleep at night when you are on my mind
bobby womacks on the radio
singin to me if you think youre lonely now
wait a minute this is too deep too deep
i gotta change the station
so i turn the dial tryna catch a break
and then i hear babyface i only think of you
and its breakin my heart
im tryna keep it together but im fallin apart

prechorus
im feelin all out of my element
throwin things cryin
tryna figure out where the hell i went wrong
the pain reflected in this song
aint even half of what im feelin inside
i need you need you back in my life baby my life my life
we belong together

chorus
when you left i lost a part of me together
its still so hard to believe
come back baby please
come back come back come back come back
cause we belong together
who else am i gon lean on when times get rough who will
whos gonna talk to me on the phone til the sun comes up who will
whos gonna take your place there aint nobody better who will
oh baby baby we belong together baby
we belong together who will
postchorus
when you left i lost a part of me who will
its still so hard to believe who will
come back baby please
come back come back come back come back
cause we belong together
who am i gonna lean on when times get rough who will
whos gon talk to me til the sun comes up who will
whos gon take your place there aint nobody better who will
oh baby baby we belong together
