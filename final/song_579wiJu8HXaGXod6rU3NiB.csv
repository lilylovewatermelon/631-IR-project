use every crayon color that youve got
a fishing pole sinks faster than a tackle box
nothing turns a day around like licking a mixing bowl
i learned that from a three year old

verse 2
a garbage can is a damn good spot to hide truck keys
why go inside when you can go behind a tree
walking barefoot through the mud
will knock the rust right off your soul
i learned that from a three year old

chorus
you can be a cowboy on the moon
dig to china with a spoon
talk to jesus on the phone
say i love you all day long
and when youre wrong you should just say so
i learned that from a three year old

verse 3
mama is an angel i heard him tell the man upstairs
he went on and on and back and forth
like god was laying there
tonight i sleep me down to lay and pray to keep my soul
yeah i learned that from a three year old

you can be a cowboy on the moon
dig to china with a spoon
talk to jesus on the phone
say i love you all day long
and when youre wrong you should just say so
i learned that from a three year old

outro
sometimes all you need is a hand to hold
couple arms to kill the cold
and when your wrong you should just say so
i learned that from a three year old
yeah honey i learned that from our three year oldembed"
