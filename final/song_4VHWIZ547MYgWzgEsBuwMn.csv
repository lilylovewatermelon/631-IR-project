every time i hear that whistle whine
from a lonesome locomotive coming down the line
it carries my mind away to another place in time
when train traveling across the land was the only way to fly
am i a fool to think it glamorous
boxcaring like a hobo it must have been rough
but a simpler way of life is what it really means to me
when we werent so dependent on money to bee free

chorus
i hear you train are you traveling my way
wont you let me ride your rails right back to yesterday
who knows what i could see from that old time machine
but there you go again train traveling
there you go again train traveling

verse 2
im lying on a rotten wooden floor
smell yesterdays whiskey here rattling at the door
railroad man looking for me im scared as i can be
i open my eyes and realize its just another dream

chorus
