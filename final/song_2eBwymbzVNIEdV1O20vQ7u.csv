it started way back in third grade
i used to sit beside emmylou hayes
a pink dress a matching bow and her pony tail
she kissed me on the school bus but told me not to tell

verse 2
next day i chased her round the playground
across the monkey bars to the merrygoround
and emmylou got caught passing me a note
before the teacher took it i read what she wrote

chorus
do you love me do you wanna be my friend
and if you do
well then dont be afraid to take me by the hand
if you want to
i think this is how love goes check yes or no

verse 3
now were grown up and shes my wife
still like two kids with stars in our eyes
aint much changed i still chase emmylou
up and down the hall around the bed in our room

verse 4
last night i took her out in a white limousine
twenty years together she still gets to me
cant believe its been that long ago
when we got started with just a little note
