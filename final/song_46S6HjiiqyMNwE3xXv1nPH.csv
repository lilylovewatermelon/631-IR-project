ohoh yeah

verse 1
i feel these four walls closin in
face up against the glass
im lookin out mmm
is this my life im wonderin
it happened so fast
how do i turn this thing around
is this the bed i chose to make
theres greener pastures im thinkin about mmm
wide open spaces far away

prechorus
all i want is the wind in my hair
to face the fear but not feel scared

chorus
wild horses i wanna be like you
throwing caution to the wind ill run free too
wish i could recklessly love like im longing to
i wanna run with the wild horses
run with the wild horses oh
yeah yeah oh yeah yeah

i see the girl i wanna be
riding bareback carefree along the shore
if only that someone was me
jumping headfirst headlong without a thought
to act and damn the consequence
how i wish it could be that easy
but fear surrounds me like a fence
i wanna break free

prechorus
all i want is the wind in my hair
to face the fear but not feel scared oh

chorus
wild horses i wanna be like you
throwing caution to the wind ill run free too
wish i could recklessly love like im longing to
i wanna run with the wild horses
run with the wild horses
i wanna run too oh

bridge
recklessly abandoning myself before you
i wanna open up my heart
tell him how i feel
chorus
oh wild horses i wanna be like you
throwing caution to the wind ill run free too
wish i could recklessly love like im longing to
i wanna run with the wild horses
run with the wild horses
run with the wild horses oh
yeah yeah oh mmm

outro
i wanna run with the wild horses
