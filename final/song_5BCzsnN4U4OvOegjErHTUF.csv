we got london on da track

verse 1 lil durk
how you steady screamin out child support you don’t even support your own child
you dont support none of your niggas locked in them cages waitin for trial
i was always one of them niggas who the whole hood pray make it out
don’t shoot the innocent bystanders you gon slide then make it count
goin round this bitch like you real with it whole time you a clown
fuck if you aint otf or 4pf i think out loud
i cant trust you if you run off with some clothes i can just imagine pounds
chicago hoes act like they love you but rob you or just put you down
friends or not you touch one of my chains them niggas gon put you down
im savin’ style bulletproof trackhawk cost me a hunnideighty thou’
my main homie talked shit behind my back but i was so in denial
you changеd on me same niggas with me thе same was at my trial

chorus lil durk

save me save me save me save me save me
i came up kinda hard i hope i dont come out crazy
i read between the lines you really being shady
militant minded whole lotta ars we like the navy
riding round town with lil kee in the 300 blackout
i put the guys on pause that’s the only reason they back out
i signed up for the streets not ufc i aint gon tap out
they gave big bro a mandatory ten he bout to max out
when he take a pic his racks out he go in the house his strap out
he done really worked his ass off he been at it his whole life
he dont have a book if he start writing he dont care about excitement
he been tryna take his time he done finally got it right
hes important and he thinks he needs drugs to keep goin
he loves her he loves her not he dont be knowin
he stay gettin a lot of guap he dont be showin
he stay with a fucking glock he dont trust no one

chorus lil durk
all these drugs i want medical
so high im on cloud 9 i need a parachute
