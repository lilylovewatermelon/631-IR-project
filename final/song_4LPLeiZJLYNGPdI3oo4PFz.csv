ive got a sea of flowers
but all these hours are just mine alone
no ones home
buy me the finest china
each time i dine its always me alone
with the heater on

prechorus 1
left to your own devices
a master of disguises
why is that not surprising
its like youre midas

chorus
ohohoh ohohoh now all i see is gold
all i see is gold
ohohoh ohohoh now all i see is gold
all i see is gold

verse 2
youre probably somewhere sunny
and im here wondering if you dream of me
while youre by the sea
of all the people passing
your face appears in everyone i see
but youre not with me

and now i just cant tell if
thats just the way you felt
when we were just beginning
youve turn to midas

chorus
ohohoh ohohoh now all i see is gold
all i see is gold
ohohoh ohohoh now all i see is gold
all i see is gold

bridge
and when you hold my hand
i dont feel anything
all i feel is cold
and all i see is gold

interlude
ooh its like youre midas

chorus
ohohoh ohohoh now all i see is gold
all i see is gold
ohohoh ohohoh now all i see is gold
all i see is gold
ohohohohohoh all i see is gold
all i see is gold
