oh did you hear the thunder
or the rain
means im coming home again
means im coming home my friend

oh did you steal my name
oh you jack of all trades
youre the master of none
oh the race has begun
i was born a champion
i was born to jump and run

chorus
oh did you hear the rain
oh the rain woo
you can try and run and hide
tearing at the chain
oh lucifers inside

verse 2
oh did your siblings tell you
i was wastin up your time
oh now youre wastin mine
you put me back in line
and im countin every link
and i guess you think thats fine

oh did i send a shiver
down your spine
well i do it all the time
its a little trick of mine
did i make you shake your knees
did i make him spill his wine
lord im spreadin like disease

oh lucifers inside
oh lucifers inside

chorus
oh did you hear the rain
oh the rain woo
you can try and run and hide
tearing at the chain
means im coming home again
means im coming home my friend
oh lucifers inside
oh lucifers inside
