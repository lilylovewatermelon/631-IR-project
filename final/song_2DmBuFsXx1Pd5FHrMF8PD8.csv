sun shines clouds rain
train whistles blow and guitars play
preachers preach farmers plow
wishes go up and the world goes round

chorus
and i love you
it just comes natural
it just comes natural

verse 2
seasons change rivers wind
tumbleweeds roll and the stars shine
wind howls dawn breaks
cowboys riding time slips away

chorus
and i love you
it just comes natural
its what i was born to do
dont have to think it through
baby its so easy loving you
it just comes natural

bridge
its what i was born to do
dont have to think it through
baby its so easy loving you

fire burns waves crash
seeds grow and good things last
ships sail dreams fly
night falls and full moons rise

chorus
and i love you
it just comes natural
and i love you
it just comes natural
it just comes natural
it just comes natural1embed"
