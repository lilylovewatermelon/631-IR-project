you are the hole in my head
you are the space in my bed
you are the silence in between
what i thought and what i said
you are the nighttime fear
you are the morning when its clear
when its over youre the start
youre my head and youre my heart

chorus
no light no light
in your bright blue eyes
i never knew daylight could be so violent
a revelation in the light of day
you cant choose what stays and what fades away
and id do anything to make you stay
no light no light no light
tell me what you want me to say

verse 2
through the crowd i was crying out and
in your place there were a thousand other faces
i was disappearing in plain sight
heaven help me i need to make it right

you want a revelation
you want to get right
but its a conversation
i just cant have tonight
you want a revelation
some kind of resolution
you want a revelation

chorus
no light no light
in your bright blue eyes
i never knew daylight could be so violent
a revelation in the light of day
you cant choose what stays and what fades away
and id do anything to make you stay
no light no light no light
tell me what you want me to say

would you leave me
if i told you what ive done
and would you leave me
if i told you what ive become
cause its so easy
to say it to a crowd
but its so hard my love
to say it to you out loud
chorus
no light no light
in your bright blue eyes
i never knew daylight could be so violent
a revelation in the light of day
you cant choose what stays and what fades away
and id do anything to make you stay ohoh
no light no light no light
tell me what you want me to say

outro
you want a revelation
you want to get right
but its a conversation
i just cant have tonight
you want a revelation
some kind of resolution
you want a revelation
you want a revelation
you want to get right
but its a conversation
i just cant have tonight
you want a revelation
some kind of resolution
tell me what you want me to say24embed"
