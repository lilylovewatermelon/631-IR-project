staring at the carnage praying that the sun would never rise
living another day in disguise
these feelings cant be right lend me your courage to stand up and fight on tonight
stand up and fight

verse 1
the fighting rages on and on to challenge me you must be strong
i walk your land but dont belong two million soldiers cant be wrong
its no fun but ive been here before
im far from home and im fighting your war
not the way i pictured this i wanted better things
some are scared others killing for fun i shot a mother right in front of her son
take this from my consciousness and please erase my dreams

chorus
fight for honor fight for your life
pray to god that our side is right
and though we won i still may lose
until i make it home to you
i see our mothers filled with tears
grew up so fast where did those years go
memories wont let you cry
unless i dont return tonight

verse 2
so many soldiers on the other side i take their lives so they cant take mine
scared to make it out alive now murders all i know
nobody tells me all the reasons were here
i have my weapons so theres nothing to fear
another day another life but nothing real to show for
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
fight for honor fight for your life
pray to god that our side is right
and though we won i still may lose
until i make it home to you
i see our mothers filled with tears
grew up so fast where did those years go
memories wont let you cry
unless i dont return tonight

bridge
staring at the carnage praying that the sun would never rise
living another day in disguise
these feelings cant be right lend me your courage to stand up and fight

verse 3
watching the death toll rise wondering how im alive
strangers blood on my hands shot all i can
there are no silent nights watching your brothers all die
to destroy all their plans with no thought of me
no thought of me no thought of me

outro
walk the city lonely
memories that haunt are passing by
a murderer walks your streets tonight
forgive me for my crimes dont forget that i was so young
fought so scared in the name of god and country11embed"
