verse 1
whoa now i think this woman went and put a hex on me
whoa now whyd i let her go and put that sex on me
whoa now i probably shouldnt have watched that girl undress for me
the scent of her perfume in the air
got it feeling different in here yeah

prechorus
she took my breath away
on to some fancy ship
into another place
such an expensive trip
but she didn’t make me pay for it with my money

chorus
it’s the sins of my father
he left the debt to his son
to pay the girl who’s a mother
collector wont let me run no
but she didn’t make me pay for it with my money
i paid for the sins of my father
