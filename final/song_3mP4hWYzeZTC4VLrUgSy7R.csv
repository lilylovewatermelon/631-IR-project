spirit of marilyn callin me audibly
bawling she said that she would never leave continued to torture me
telling me to come with her underneath my comforter
and she brought a gun with her pills and some rum with her
took me on the balcony telling me to jump with her
yeah im in the ghost but i aint doing stunts with her
i aint trying to be that haters wanna see that
but i got em aggy cause i win the gold like gabby

verse 2 alicia keys
shes just a girl and shes on fire
hotter than a fantasy lonely like a highway
shes living in a world and its on fire
feeling the catastrophe but she knows she can fly away

prechorus alicia keys
oh she got both feet on the ground
and shes burning it down
oh she got her head in the clouds
and shes not backing down

chorus alicia keys
this girl is on fire
this girl is on fire
shes walking on fire
this girl is on fire

oh we got our feet on the ground
and were burning it down
oh got our head in the clouds
and were not coming down

this girl is on fire
shes walking on fire fire fire
this girl is on fire

bridge alicia keys
everybody stands as she goes by
cause they can see the flame thats in her eyes
watch her when shes lighting up the night
nobody knows that shes a lonely girl
and its a lonely world
but she gon let it burn baby burn baby
