its kinda like jumpin out of a plane
stompin on the gas to outrun a train
a ten pound bass on a ten dollar zebco reel
there aint no question youre the one
when you come around girl here it comes
its something like nothing i never thought id feel

chorus
this feels like something i dont want to miss
you know what im saying when i say this
oh baby this feels a lot like love
this feels like a gift sent from above
that writers write about poets speak of
oh baby this feels a lot like love

verse 2
usually when somebody gets this close
i wave goodbye and say adios
but youre making me wanna want to just hang around
yeah i want to be here when the sun comes up
share a first sip from your coffee cup
and share a last kiss after the sun goes down

chorus
this feels like something i dont want to miss
you know what im saying when i say this
oh baby this feels a lot like love
this feels like a gift sent from above
that writers write about poets speak of
oh baby this feels a lot like love
this feels like something i dont want to miss
you know what im saying when i say this
oh baby this feels a lot like love
this feels like a gift sent from above
that writers write about poets speak of
oh baby this feels a lot like love
oh baby this feels a lot like lovesee easton corbin liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeembed"
