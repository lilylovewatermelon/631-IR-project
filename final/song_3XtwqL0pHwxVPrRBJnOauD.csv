another painful day is done
if i could convince myself i was over you now
id find a way to go on somehow

chorus
but the pain just grows stronger every day
i think of you and im on my way
down memory lane with your hand in mine
guess im just not the healing kind

another december and the cold winds blow
and nights without you are so long
i stare at our picture through the firelights glow
and where you are right now i just dont know
