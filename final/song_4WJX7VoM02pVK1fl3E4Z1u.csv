once upon a time our world was on fire
and i loved to watch it burn
wild and reckless never any limits
guess i had a lot to learn
cause fire turns to embers
embers to ashes that blow away too soon
now everything after you is like

chorus
having wine after whiskey
it went from do anything for you babe
to you don’t even miss me
once you’ve tasted a love that strong you can’t go back
and you can’t settle on anything less
and that’s what gets me
it’s like having wine after whiskey

verse 2
lookin back i guess its really for the best
still you’re something that i crave
even though i know it was right to let you go
you’re a habit hard to break
i got used to bein high
and nothing that i try seems good enough right now
it’s all so watered down

like having wine after whiskey
it went from do anything for you babe
to you don’t even miss me
once you’ve tasted a love that strong
you can’t go back and you can’t settle on anything less
and that’s what gets me
it’s like having wine after whiskey

outro
once you’ve tasted a love that strong you can’t go back
and you can’t settle on anything less
and that’s what gets me
its like having wine
it’s like having wine after whiskey4embed"
