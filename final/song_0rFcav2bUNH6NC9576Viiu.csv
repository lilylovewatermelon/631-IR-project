go ahead you can say its my fault
if it still hurts at all
i thought one of these days you might call
when you were feelin small

starin at the clock
and i know im not on your mind

i wonder what would happen if i die
i hope all of my friends get drunk and high
would it be too hard to say goodbye
i hope that its enough to make you cry
maybe that day you wont hate me

the memories wont fade wont fade
