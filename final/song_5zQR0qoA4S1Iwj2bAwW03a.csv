its come to my attention
that i dont show enough
of what i think
its only when i drink i open up
but i promise that i love you
even with that hairdo
im sorry i made fun of it
its not your fault it looks like shit like shit

prechorus
i have never tolerated someone for so long
ive never laughed so much
i havent written a sad song

chorus
theres no one else id rather fall asleep with
and dream with
youre my best friend in the world

instrumental bridge

verse 3
when were ninetyeight and ninetynine ninetynine
tumbling down the stairs
youll barely catch me in time tumbling down
well argue about what to watch on tv
finally pick a movie then well fall asleep asleep
well still be a little bit strange
some things never change
see laufey liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likeprechorus
its funny cause you drive me halfinsane
a universe without you would be thoroughly mundane

chorus
theres no one else id rather fall in love with
and that is my best friend in the world

outro
youre my best friend in the world4embed"
