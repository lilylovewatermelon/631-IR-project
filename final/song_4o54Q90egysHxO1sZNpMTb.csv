i never thought that id be here
i never thought id have short hair
i never grow up in my head
although my heart and soul are dead

im alone
in my mind
i belong
in new york city
in new york city
in new york city
in new york city
in new york

verse 2
i want to cry in your hands
i want to die in your hands
because i hate what ive become
oh i guess that ill just run

im alone
