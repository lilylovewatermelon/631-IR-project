im officially going in
and refusing to come out
unless im bloody
lets go

verse 1
id like to think i pride myself on being humble
and let these other motherfuckers lose touch like a fumble
cause you can keep a level head and have fun too
but i came to promote the game 
at least till my names in the same lane as 
you gonna have to respect me for making being uncool cool
 with sandals ray bans skinny pants and flannels
so insecure im tugging at my tshirt
cause i swear the girl behind me staring at my love handles
i just wanna change the channel or delete them
where the fuck is adam sandler when you need him
im christopher walken
on my papercut shit againthank god for walkmans
and i gotta thank god often
cause otherwise id be like these other guys

hook
this type of scene just aint my thing
and everybody too cool for school
and yet somehow i never felt so alone
in a room full of people
so now imma seat on this stoop
and imma gonna lace up my boots
and keep on walking till i make my way home
see gym class heroes liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likeverse 2
can someone tell me how i got here in the first place
cause honestly in my opinion this the worst place
i mean i even said hello to a few girls
i feel like brad pitt stuck in cool world
cause everything is so foreign
and all the conversations boring
i mean im practically snoring
could somebody please show me the door man
cause i dont think that i can take it
everybody here is extra hip like replacements
thats probably why i aint sayin shit
oh what the hell i might as well get wasted
cause id rather be sedated
than conversate about whose sneakers are more outrageous
or whose outfits the latest
i think ill blow jokes on you greatest

hook
this type of scene just aint my thing
and everybody too cool for school
and yet somehow i never felt so alone
in a room full of people
so now imma seat on this stoop
and imma gonna lace on my boots
and keep on walking till i make my way home
bridge
ladies and gentlemen
boys and girls
id advise you all
to the papercut chronicles ii
it dont get much better

hook
this type of scene just aint my thing
and everybody too cool for school
and yet somehow i never felt so alone
in a room full of people
so now imma seat on this stoop
and imma gonna lace on my boots
and keep on walking till i make my way homeembed"
