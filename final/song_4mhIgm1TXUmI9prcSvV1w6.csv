it was love at first sight
i know from the way she looked at me
her eyes said it all
long days and nights we spent
until she dropped the bomb on me
when she said that she
was unhappily married with children

chorus
and i wish i never met her at all
even though i love her so
she got love for me
but she still belongs to someone else

verse 2
it hurts so bad for sure
because she wants to be with me
but she cannot be with me
she chose to stay at home
so they could be a family
for the children
but what about me

chorus
and i wish i never met her at all
even though i love her so
she got love for me
but she still belongs to someone else

maybe in another life
things could be the way we both desired
its a catch22
either way it went
someone had to lose

chorus
and i wish i never met her at all
even though i love her so
she got love for me
but she still belongs to someone else
and i wish i never met her at all
even though i love her so
she got love for me
but she still belongs to someone else

outro
i wish i wish i never met her at all
i wouldnt hurt so much inside
oh i wouldnt feel this pain
if i never met her at all at all at all
wish i never wish i never9embed"
