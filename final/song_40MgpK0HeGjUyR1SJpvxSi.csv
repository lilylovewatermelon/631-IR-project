brakes on brakes on the car is runnin empty
brakes on brakes on the car is runnin empty

it plagues my mind
and it keeps us right here
and it keeps us here

my ears my eyes my brain is slowly bustin
black smoke red sky the televisions sayin
downhill headon another crash is comin
downhill headon another crash is comin

theres a science to fear
it plagues my mind
and it keeps us right here
and the less we know
the more we sit still
my babys stuck on a road
that leads to nowhere nowhere
nowhere nowhere nowhere

brakes on brakes on
brakes on brakes on
brakes on

chorus 2
theres a science to fear
it plagues my mind
and it keeps us right here
and the less we know
the more we sit still sit still
my babys stuck on a road
that leads to nowhere nowhere
nowhere nowhere nowhere4embed"
