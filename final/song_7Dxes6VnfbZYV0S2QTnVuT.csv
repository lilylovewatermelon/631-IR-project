i wish girls you loved never gave back diamond rings
i wish every porch had a swing
wish kids still learned to say sir and maam and how to shake a hand
i wish every state had a birmingham

prechorus
i wish everybody knew all the words to mama tried
i wish monday mornins felt just like friday nights

chorus
and i wish even cars had truck beds
and every road was named copperhead
and coolers never run out of cold bud light
and i wish high school home teams never lost
and back road drinkin kids never got caught
and i wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
i wish honkytonks didnt have no closin time
and i wish grandpas never died

verse 2
i wish sundays on a creek bank would never end
wish i could learn to drive again
wish the first time seventeen she was my everything kiss in a chevrolet
could happen every day
see riley green liveget tickets as low as 7you might also likeprechorus
i wish everybody overseas was gonna make it home
i wish country music still got played on country radio

chorus
and i wish even cars had truck beds
and every road was named copperhead
and coolers never run out of cold bud light
and i wish high school home teams never lost
and back road drinkin kids never got caught
and i wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
and i wish honkytonks didnt have no closing time
and i wish grandpas never died
never died

bridge
and i wish good dogs never got grey and old
i wish farms never got sold

chorus
and i wish even cars had truck beds
and every road was named copperhead
and coolers never run out of cold bud light
and i wish high school home teams never lost
and back road drinkin kids never got caught
and i wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
and i wish honkytonks didnt have no closing time
and i wish grandpas never died
i wish grandpas never died6embed"
