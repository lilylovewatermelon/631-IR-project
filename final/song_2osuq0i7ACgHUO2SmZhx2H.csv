she got down on hands and knees
one ear against the ground
holding her breath to hear something
but the dirt made not a sound tonight

echoes of songs still lurk on distant foreign shores
where we danced just to please the gods that only ask for more
and so it goes
but still we give ourselves to this
we cant spend our lives waiting to live

chorus
on cold nights in a prayer for dawn
but the daylight isnt what she wants
the concrete calls my name again
im falling through the cracks i slip

verse 2
the postcard says wish you were here but id rather i was there
holding on to the simple things before they disappear
thats what i meant
but that was then and this is now
ill make it up to you somehow

chorus
on cold nights in a prayer for dawn
but the daylight isnt what she wants
the concrete calls my name again
im falling through the cracks i slip

a destination a fading smile
another station another mile
another day gone i swore that i will
be there before dawn
so be there i will

she got down on hands and knees
one ear against the ground
holding her breath to hear something anything at all
the dirt whispered child im coming home

chorus
on cold nights in a prayer for dawn
but the daylight isnt what she wants
the concrete calls my name again
im falling through the cracks i slip4embed"
