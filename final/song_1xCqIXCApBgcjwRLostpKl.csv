there we go

verse 1
i could write a song with my new piano
i could sing about how love is a losing battle
not hard its not hard
its not hard its not hard
its not hard its not hard
its not hard its not hard
and i could sing about cupid and his shooting arrow
in the end youd find out that my heart was battered
real hard real hard
its so hard its so hard
real hard real hard
its that hard its that hard

prechorus
but id rather make a song they can play on the radio
that makes you wanna dance

but id rather make a song they can play on the radio
that makes you wanna grab your lovers hand
