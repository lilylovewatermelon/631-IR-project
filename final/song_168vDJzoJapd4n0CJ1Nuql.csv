i am living without you
you think everything will be fine
i find making it hard to lie
realize nothing is left inside

im about to break some fucking off
going to lose my mind
im about to break some fucking off
i feel im feeling fine
im about to break some fucking off
no it wont be fine
im about to break some fucking off

verse 2
my lies are going to hurt you
my faith is not going to wait this time
i play games just to spite you
i know youre gonna believe this time

chorus
im about to break some fucking off
going to lose my mind
im about to break some fucking off
i feel im feeling fine
im about to break some fucking off
no it wont be fine
im about to break some fucking off
