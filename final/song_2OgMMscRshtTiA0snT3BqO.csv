perfect girl in my life that will make it right

i need a girl with finesse look good in a dress to kiss and caress
i need a woman with less drama stress no fethumaness
i need a female who would know what to do when the cops come through
or if things get dim shell put on her timbs and role with the crew
i need a girl who smart who thinks with her heart when things falling apart
i need a girl if i need a pint of blood shell donate a quart
i need a lady who will trust me when im out at night
one who when its my darkest hour shes my ray of light

me mamis a soldier and a roller and thats just the girl i need
