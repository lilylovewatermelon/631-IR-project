i had so much champagne up in the club
and ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
i’mma leave all my problems out on the floor
i’mma drink so much that i can’t make it home
so would you take me home yeah
i had so much champagne up in the club
and ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
i’mma leave all my problems out on the floor
i’mma drink so much that i can’t make it home
so would you take me home yeah

refrain
now we rollin’ up stayin’ out all night
stayin’ out all night stayin’ out all night
getting drunk stayin’ out all night
stayin’ out all night stayin’ out all night
crashing a party stayin’ out all night
stayin’ out all night stayin’ out all night
getting this money stayin’ out all night
stayin’ out all night stayin’ out all night

verse 1
leaving all my problems at the door
pouring up soon as you think it’s enough they bringin’ more
hanging onto what niggas told me “get your paper up”
you work hard for what you got they could never take it from you
all you need is a little patience let me demonstrate
all my niggas in the game we talkin’ ‘cause we been through it
rolling weed in raw papers taking shots gin got me faded
if i get back to your spot won’t know how i made it
now i made my way in the game
so much money don’t know how a nigga stayin’ the same
i’m too straight i get high all day i take it straight to the brain
i stay fly all week like seven days on a plane
came here to spend it not leave with it
got kk rolled up let my team hit it
some bombay let’s sip ‘til it’s mayday
that fuck shit don’t play
laughs

verse 2
yeah keep the good times rollin’ and the champagne pourin’
on the plane and i don’t know where i’m goin’
make sure my team keep ballin’ and the hoes keep callin’
and the money keep fallin’ on the floor
where you tryna go only care about what’s in your drink
you tryna go hard don’t think about tomorrow
don’t care about what people think
you don’t care about waitin’ outside
you be with everybody up in the front
you yellin’ “face down ass up” up in the club
and now we all turning up let’s party
i’m in the club rolling weed like i’m marley
smoking dearly departed
that’s kill too real come to me get it started
and the bottles be poppin’ like its 4th of july
we just pourin’ them shots back shooting corks in the sky
pouring some for the girls and pouring more for my guys
cause we made it my niggas i just wanna thank my niggas
hear them niggas talking shit but they ain’t my niggas
refrain
now we rollin’ up stayin’ out all night
stayin’ out all night stayin’ out all night
getting drunk stayin’ out all night
stayin’ out all night stayin’ out all night
crashing a party stayin’ out all night
stayin’ out all night stayin’ out all night
getting this money stayin’ out all night
stayin’ out all night stayin’ out all night

hook
i had so much champagne up in the club
and ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
