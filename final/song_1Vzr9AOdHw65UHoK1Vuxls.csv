you saw me crying in the chapel
the tears i shed were tears of joy
i know the meaning of contentment
now im happy with the lord
just a plain and simple chapel
where humble people go to pray
i pray the lord that ill grow stronger
as i live from day to day

chorus
ive searched ive searched and ive searched ive searched
but i couldnt find
no way on earth to gain
peace of mind

verse 2
now im happy in the chapel
where people are of one accord one accord
yes we gather in the chapel
just to sing and praise the lord

chorus
youll search youll search and youll search youll search
but youll never find
no way on earth to gain
peace of mind

take your troubles to the chapel
get down on your knees and pray knees and pray
then your burdens will be lighter
and youll surely find the way and youll surely find the way3embed"
