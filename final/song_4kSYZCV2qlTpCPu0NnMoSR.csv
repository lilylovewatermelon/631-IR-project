interlude mf doom
ladies and gentlemen welcome to the debut grand opening
of madvillain bistro bed and breakfast bar and grill
cafe lounge on the water
where we offer you the finest of the finer things
twenty four hours a day seven days a week
three hundred and sixty five days a year
live on the beats we have the one and only madlib
we also have king geedorah on the mix
yesterdays new quintet is here viktor vaughn quasimoto
and im your host the supervillain
just lay back and have a good time
enjoy the music you know what im sayin
id like to dedicate this next joint to my mans you know
big hookie and baba from the laundromat
