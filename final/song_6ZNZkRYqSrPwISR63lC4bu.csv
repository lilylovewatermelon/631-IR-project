verse 3
from summer hill to the hills up in hollywood
a house full getting to it you know how we do it
yea we smoke great and we drink good
then we ball hard just like gs should
buy what we want drive what we want
g4 up up and away we go we fly where we want
haters smile like they like it when they really dont
wish they could just wish me away that what they really want
i really hate his ass i dont like him either
well do a song together maybe then we can beat him
somehow he must be stopped something must be done
if we cant knock him off lets just try him when he get caught with guns
and if he really done and we really won
any more ideas i got some suggestions anyone
how bout we stay up all night on the blog sites
spread vicious lies and nasty rumors we could all write
but thats all right let the nerds hate
cause in my face though them words getin ate
and hatins hard work when i just bounce back
this god work tell all the haters im back
