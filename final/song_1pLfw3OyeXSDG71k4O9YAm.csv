if you need your car towed
if that volkswagen breaks down
on the way out of this town
i know a guy
ill make a few calls
if you need something part time
til youre back on your feet
i know a guy

chorus
and if youre looking for someone barely hanging on
lost the only thing that he ever loved
wishing you would come over
do anything just to hold you
if youre trying to find a man
who lost his mind
doesnt sleep at night
unless hes dreaming about you
laying right here beside him
praying someday you might feel like forgiving
and think about giving him one more try
then i know a guy

verse 2
if you would ask me
to think of a person that didnt deserve you
i know a guy
and if you needed a man to never really listen
not know what hed be missing
i know a guy

and if youre looking for someone barely hanging on
lost the only thing that he ever loved
wishing you would come over
do anything just to hold you
if youre trying to find a man
who lost his mind
doesnt sleep at night
unless hes dreaming about you laying right here beside him
praying someday you might feel like forgiving
and think about giving him one more try
then i know a guy

bridge
yeah i know a guy
who feels like a fool
hes been hating himself for what he put you through
hed take it all back if he only knew how
he knows that youve probably moved on by now

chorus
but if youre looking for someone barely hanging on
lost the only thing that he ever loved
wishing you would come over
give anything just to hold you
if youre trying to find a man
who lost his mind
doesnt sleep at night
unless hes dreaming about you laying right here beside him
praying someday you might feel like forgiving
and think about giving him one more try
then i know a guy
outro
one one more try
