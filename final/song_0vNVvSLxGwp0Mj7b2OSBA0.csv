a fragment of a turkish tale

no breath of air to break the wave
that rolls below the athenians grave
that tomb which gleaming oer the cliff
first greets the homewardveering skiff
high oer the land he saved in vain
when shall such hero live again

fair clime where every season smiles
benignant oer those blessed isles
which seen from far colonnas height
make glad the heart that hails the sight
and lend to loneliness delight
there mildly dimpling oceans cheek
reflects the tints of many a peak
caught by the laughing tides that lave
these edens of the eastern wave
and if at times a transient breeze
break the blue crystal of the seas
or sweep one blossom from the trees
how welcome is each gentle air
that wakes and wafts the odours there
for there the rose oer crag or vale
sultana of the nightingale
the maid for whom his melody
his thousand songs are heard on high
blooms blushing to her lovers tale
his queen the garden queen his rose
unbent by winds unchilled by snows
far from the winters of the west
by every breeze and season blest
returns the sweets by nature given
in softest incense back to heaven
and grateful yields that smiling sky
her fairest hue and fragrant sigh
and many a summer flower is there
and many a shade that love might share
and many a grotto meant for rest
that holds the pirate for a guest
whose bark in sheltering cove below
lurks for the passing peaceful prow
till the gay mariners guitar
is heard and seen the evening star
then stealing with the muffled oar
far shaded by the rocky shore
rush the nightprowlers on the prey
and turn to groans his roundelay
strange—that where nature loved to trace
as if for gods a dwelling place
and every charm and grace hath mixed
within the paradise she fixed
there man enamoured of distress
should mar it into wilderness
and trample brutelike oer each flower
that tasks not one laborious hour
nor claims the culture of his hand
to bloom along the fairy land
but springs as to preclude his care
and sweetly woos him—but to spare
strange—that where all is peace beside
there passion riots in her pride
and lust and rapine wildly reign
to darken oer the fair domain
it is as though the fiends prevailed
against the seraphs they assailed
and fixed on heavenly thrones should dwell
the freed inheritors of hell
so soft the scene so formed for joy
so curst the tyrants that destroy
he who hath bent him oer the dead
ere the first day of death is fled
the first dark day of nothingness
the last of danger and distress
before decays effacing fingers
have swept the lines where beauty lingers
and marked the mild angelic air
the rapture of repose thats there
the fixed yet tender traits that streak
the languor of the placid cheek
and—but for that sad shrouded eye
that fires not wins not weeps not now
and but for that chill changeless brow
where cold obstructions apathy
appals the gazing mourners heart
as if to him it could impart
the doom he dreads yet dwells upon
yes but for these and these alone
some moments aye one treacherous hour
he still might doubt the tyrants power
so fair so calm so softly sealed
the first last look by death revealed
such is the aspect of this shore
tis greece but living greece no more
so coldly sweet so deadly fair
we start for soul is wanting there
hers is the loveliness in death
that parts not quite with parting breath
but beauty with that fearful bloom
that hue which haunts it to the tomb
expressions last receding ray
a gilded halo hovering round decay
the farewell beam of feeling past away
spark of that flame perchance of heavenly birth
which gleams but warms no more its cherished earth
clime of the unforgotten brave
whose land from plain to mountaincave
was freedoms home or glorys grave
shrine of the mighty can it be
that this is all remains of thee
approach thou craven crouching slave
say is not this thermopylæ
these waters blue that round you lave—
oh servile offspring of the free—
pronounce what sea what shore is this
the gulf the rock of salamis
these scenes their story not unknown
arise and make again your own
snatch from the ashes of your sires
the embers of their former fires
and he who in the strife expires
will add to theirs a name of fear
that tyranny shall quake to hear
and leave his sons a hope a fame
they too will rather die than shame
for freedoms battle once begun
bequeathed by bleeding sire to son
though baffled oft is ever won
bear witness greece thy living page
attest it many a deathless age
while kings in dusty darkness hid
have left a nameless pyramid
thy heroes though the general doom
hath swept the column from their tomb
a mightier monument command
the mountains of their native land
there points thy muse to strangers eye
the graves of those that cannot die
twere long to tell and sad to trace
each step from splendour to disgrace
enough—no foreign foe could quell
thy soul till from itself it fell
yet selfabasement paved the way
to villainbonds and despot sway
what can he tell who treads thy shore
no legend of thine olden time
no theme on which the muse might soar
high as thine own in days of yore
when man was worthy of thy clime
the hearts within thy valleys bred
the fiery souls that might have led
thy sons to deeds sublime
now crawl from cradle to the grave
slaves—nay the bondsmen of a slave
and callous save to crime
stained with each evil that pollutes
mankind where least above the brutes
without even savage virtue blest
without one free or valiant breast
still to the neighbouring ports they waft
proverbial wiles and ancient craft
in this the subtle greek is found
for this and this alone renowned
in vain might liberty invoke
the spirit to its bondage broke
or raise the neck that courts the yoke
no more her sorrows i bewail
yet this will be a mournful tale
and they who listen may believe
who heard it first had cause to grieve
far dark along the blue sea glancing
the shadows of the rocks advancing
start on the fishers eye like boat
of islandpirate or mainote
and fearful for his light caïque
he shuns the near but doubtful creek
though worn and weary with his toil
and cumbered with his scaly spoil
slowly yet strongly plies the oar
till port leones safer shore
receives him by the lovely light
that best becomes an eastern night

who thundering comes on blackest steed
with slackened bit and hoof of speed
beneath the clattering irons sound
the caverned echoes wake around
in lash for lash and bound for bound
the foam that streaks the coursers side
seems gathered from the oceantide
though weary waves are sunk to rest
theres none within his riders breast
and though tomorrows tempest lower
tis calmer than thy heart young giaour
i know thee not i loathe thy race
but in thy lineaments i trace
what time shall strengthen not efface
though young and pale that sallow front
is scathed by fiery passions brunt
though bent on earth thine evil eye
as meteorlike thou glidest by
right well i view and deem thee one
whom othmans sons should slay or shun

on—on he hastened and he drew
my gaze of wonder as he flew
though like a demon of the night
he passed and vanished from my sight
his aspect and his air impressed
a troubled memory on my breast
and long upon my startled ear
rung his dark coursers hoofs of fear
he spurs his steed he nears the steep
that jutting shadows oer the deep
he winds around he hurries by
the rock relieves him from mine eye
for well i ween unwelcome he
whose glance is fixed on those that flee
and not a star but shines too bright
on him who takes such timeless flight
he wound along but ere he passed
one glance he snatched as if his last
a moment checked his wheeling steed
a moment breathed him from his speed
a moment on his stirrup stood—
why looks he oer the olive wood
the crescent glimmers on the hill
the mosques high lamps are quivering still
though too remote for sound to wake
in echoes of the far tophaike
the flashes of each joyous peal
are seen to prove the moslems zeal
tonight set rhamazanis sun
tonight the bairam feasts begun
tonight—but who and what art thou
of foreign garb and fearful brow
and what are these to thine or thee
that thou shouldst either pause or flee

he stood—some dread was on his face
soon hatred settled in its place
it rose not with the reddening flush
of transient angers hasty blush
but pale as marble oer the tomb
whose ghastly whiteness aids its gloom
his brow was bent his eye was glazed
he raised his arm and fiercely raised
and sternly shook his hand on high
as doubting to return or fly
impatient of his flight delayed
here loud his raven charger neighed—
down glanced that hand and grasped his blade
that sound had burst his waking dream
as slumber starts at owlets scream
the spur hath lanced his coursers sides
away—away—for life he rides
swift as the hurled on high jerreed
springs to the touch his startled steed
the rock is doubled and the shore
shakes with the clattering tramp no more
the crag is won no more is seen
his christian crest and haughty mien
twas but an instant he restrained
that fiery barb so sternly reined
twas but a moment that he stood
then sped as if by death pursued
but in that instant oer his soul
winters of memory seemed to roll
and gather in that drop of time
a life of pain an age of crime
oer him who loves or hates or fears
such moment pours the grief of years
what felt he then at once opprest
by all that most distracts the breast
that pause which pondered oer his fate
oh who its dreary length shall date
though in times record nearly nought
it was eternity to thought
for infinite as boundless space
the thought that conscience must embrace
which in itself can comprehend
woe without name or hope or end

the hour is past the giaour is gone
and did he fly or fall alone
woe to that hour he came or went
the curse for hassans sin was sent
to turn a palace to a tomb
he came he went like the simoom
that harbinger of fate and gloom
beneath whose widelywasting breath
the very cypress droops to death—
dark tree still sad when others grief is fled
the only constant mourner oer the dead

the steed is vanished from the stall
no serf is seen in hassans hall
the lonely spiders thin gray palldd
waves slowly widening oer the wall
the bat builds in his haram bower
and in the fortress of his power
the owl usurps the beacontower
the wilddog howls oer the fountains brim
with baffled thirst and famine grim
for the stream has shrunk from its marble bed
where the weeds and the desolate dust are spread
twas sweet of yore to see it play
and chase the sultriness of day
as springing high the silver dew
in whirls fantastically flew
and flung luxurious coolness round
the air and verdure oer the ground
twas sweet when cloudless stars were bright
to view the wave of watery light
and hear its melody by night
and oft had hassans childhood played
around the verge of that cascade
and oft upon his mothers breast
that sound had harmonized his rest
and oft had hassans youth along
its bank been soothed by beautys song
and softer seemed each melting tone
of music mingled with its own
but neer shall hassans age repose
along the brink at twilights close
the stream that filled that font is fled—
the blood that warmed his heart is shed
and here no more shall human voice
be heard to rage regret rejoice
the last sad note that swelled the gale
was womans wildest funeral wail
that quenched in silence all is still
but the lattice that flaps when the wind is shrill
though raves the gust and floods the rain
no hand shall close its clasp again
on desert sands twere joy to scan
the rudest steps of fellow man
so here the very voice of grief330
might wake an echo like relief—dg
at least twould say all are not gone
there lingers life though but in one—
for many a gilded chambers there
which solitude might well forbear
within that dome as yet decay
hath slowly worked her cankering way—
but gloom is gathered oer the gate
nor there the fakirs self will wait
nor there will wandering dervise stay
for bounty cheers not his delay
nor there will weary stranger halt
to bless the sacred bread and salt
alike must wealth and poverty103
pass heedless and unheeded by
for courtesy and pity died
with hassan on the mountain side
his roof that refuge unto men
is desolations hungry den
the guest flies the hall and the vassal from labour
since his turban was cleft by the infidels sabre

i hear the sound of coming feet
but not a voice mine ear to greet
more near—each turban i can scan
and silversheathèd ataghan
the foremost of the band is seen
an emir by his garb of green
ho who art thou—this low salam80
replies of moslem faith i am
the burthen ye so gently bear
seems one that claims your utmost care
and doubtless holds some precious freight—
my humble bark would gladly wait

thou speakest sooth thy skiff unmoor
and waft us from the silent shore
nay leave the sail still furled and ply
the nearest oar thats scattered by
and midway to those rocks where sleep
the channelled waters dark and deep
rest from your task—so—bravely done
our course has been right swiftly run
yet tis the longest voyage i trow
that one of—    

sullen it plunged and slowly sank
the calm wave rippled to the bank
i watched it as it sank methought
some motion from the current caught
bestirred it more—twas but the beam
that checkered oer the living stream
i gazed till vanishing from view
like lessening pebble it withdrew
still less and less a speck of white
that gemmed the tide then mocked the sight
and all its hidden secrets sleep
known but to genii of the deep
which trembling in their coral caves
they dare not whisper to the waves

as rising on its purple wing
the insectqueen82 of eastern spring
oer emerald meadows of kashmeer
invites the young pursuer near
and leads him on from flower to flower
a weary chase and wasted hour
then leaves him as it soars on high
with panting heart and tearful eye
so beauty lures the fullgrown child
with hue as bright and wing as wild
a chase of idle hopes and fears
begun in folly closed in tears
if won to equal ills betrayed
woe waits the insect and the maid
a life of pain the loss of peace
from infants play and mans caprice
the lovely toy so fiercely sought
hath lost its charm by being caught
for every touch that wooed its stay
hath brushed its brightest hues away
till charm and hue and beauty gone
tis left to fly or fall alone
with wounded wing or bleeding breast
ah where shall either victim rest
can this with faded pinion soar
from rose to tulip as before
or beauty blighted in an hour
find joy within her broken bower
no gayer insects fluttering by
neer droop the wing oer those that die
and lovelier things have mercy shown
to every failing but their own
and every woe a tear can claim
except an erring sisters shame

the mind that broods oer guilty woes
is like the scorpion girt by fire
in circle narrowing as it glows
the flames around their captive close
till inly searched by thousand throes
and maddening in her ire
one sad and sole relief she knows—
the sting she nourished for her foes
whose venom never yet was vain
gives but one pang and cures all pain
and darts into her desperate brain
so do the dark in soul expire
or live like scorpion girt by fire
so writhes the mind remorse hath riven
unfit for earth undoomed for heaven
darkness above despair beneath
around it flame within it death

black hassan from the haram flies
nor bends on womans form his eyes
the unwonted chase each hour employs
yet shares he not the hunters joys
not thus was hassan wont to fly
when leila dwelt in his serai
doth leila there no longer dwell
that tale can only hassan tell
strange rumours in our city say
upon that eve she fled away
when rhamazans last sun was set
and flashing from each minaret
millions of lamps proclaimed the feast
of bairam through the boundless east
twas then she went as to the bath
which hassan vainly searched in wrath
for she was flown her masters rage
in likeness of a georgian page
and far beyond the moslems power
had wronged him with the faithless giaour
somewhat of this had hassan deemed
but still so fond so fair she seemed
too well he trusted to the slave
whose treachery deserved a grave
and on that eve had gone to mosque
and thence to feast in his kiosk
such is the tale his nubians tell
who did not watch their charge too well
but others say that on that night
by pale phingaris85 trembling light
the giaour upon his jetblack steed
was seen but seen alone to speed
with bloody spur along the shore
nor maid nor page behind him bore

her eyes dark charm twere vain to tell
but gaze on that of the gazelle
it will assist thy fancy well
as large as languishingly dark
but soul beamed forth in every spark
that darted from beneath the lid
bright as the jewel of giamschid
yea soul and should our prophet say
that form was nought but breathing clay
by alla i would answer nay
though on alsirats arch i stood
which totters oer the fiery flood
with paradise within my view
and all his houris beckoning through
oh who young leilas glance could read
and keep that portion of his creed
which saith that woman is but dust
a soulless toy for tyrants lust
on her might muftis gaze and own
that through her eye the immortal shone
on her fair cheeks unfading hue
the young pomegranates blossoms strew
their bloom in blushes ever new
her hair in hyacinthine flow
when left to roll its folds below
as midst her handmaids in the hall
she stood superior to them all
hath swept the marble where her feet
gleamed whiter than the mountain sleet
ere from the cloud that gave it birth
it fell and caught one stain of earth
the cygnet nobly walks the water
so moved on earth circassias daughter
the loveliest bird of franguestan
as rears her crest the ruffled swan
and spurns the wave with wings of pride
when pass the steps of stranger man
along the banks that bound her tide
thus rose fair leilas whiter neck—
thus armed with beauty would she check
intrusions glance till follys gaze
shrunk from the charms it meant to praise
thus high and graceful was her gait
her heart as tender to her mate
her mate—stern hassan who was he
alas that name was not for thee

stern hassan hath a journey taen
with twenty vassals in his train
each armed as best becomes a man
with arquebuss and ataghan
the chief before as decked for war
bears in his belt the scimitar
stained with the best of arnaut blood
when in the pass the rebels stood
and few returned to tell the tale
of what befell in parnes vale
the pistols which his girdle bore
were those that once a pasha wore
which still though gemmed and bossed with gold
even robbers tremble to behold
tis said he goes to woo a bride
more true than her who left his side
the faithless slave that broke her bower
and—worse than faithless—for a giaour

the suns last rays are on the hill
and sparkle in the fountain rill
whose welcome waters cool and clear
draw blessings from the mountaineer
here may the loitering merchant greek
find that repose twere vain to seek
in cities lodged too near his lord
and trembling for his secret hoard—
here may he rest where none can see
in crowds a slave in deserts free
and with forbidden wine may stain
the bowl a moslem must not drain

the foremost tartars in the gap
conspicuous by his yellow cap
the rest in lengthening line the while
wind slowly through the long defile
above the mountain rears a peak
where vultures whet the thirsty beak
and theirs may be a feast tonight
shall tempt them down ere morrows light
beneath a rivers wintry stream
has shrunk before the summer beam
and left a channel bleak and bare
save shrubs that spring to perish there
each side the midway path there lay
small broken crags of granite gray
by time or mountain lightning riven
from summits clad in mists of heaven
for where is he that hath beheld
the peak of liakura93 unveiled

they reach the grove of pine at last
bismillah94 now the perils past
for yonder view the opening plain
and there well prick our steeds amain
the chiaus95 spake and as he said
a bullet whistled oer his head
the foremost tartar bites the ground
scarce had they time to check the rein
swift from their steeds the riders bound
but three shall never mount again
unseen the foes that gave the wound
the dying ask revenge in vain
with steel unsheathed and carbine bent
some oer their coursers harness leant
half sheltered by the steed
some fly beneath the nearest rock
and there await the coming shock
nor tamely stand to bleed
beneath the shaft of foes unseen
who dare not quit their craggy screen
stern hassan only from his horse
disdains to light and keeps his course
till fiery flashes in the van
proclaim too sure the robberclan
have well secured the only way
could now avail the promised prey
then curled his very beard96 with ire
and glared his eye with fiercer fire
though far and near the bullets hiss
ive scaped a bloodier hour than this
and now the foe their covert quit
and call his vassals to submit
but hassans frown and furious word
are dreaded more than hostile sword
nor of his little band a man
resigned carbine or ataghan
nor raised the craven cry amaun
in fuller sight more near and near
the lately ambushed foes appear
and issuing from the grove advance
some who on battlecharger prance
who leads them on with foreign brand
far flashing in his red right hand
tis hetis he i know him now
i know him by his pallid brow
i know him by the evil eye
that aids his envious treachery
i know him by his jetblack barb
though now arrayed in arnaut garb
apostate from his own vile faith
it shall not save him from the death
tis he well met in any hour
lost leilas love—accursed giaour
as rolls the river into ocean
in sable torrent wildly streaming
as the seatides opposing motion
in azure column proudly gleaming
beats back the current many a rood
in curling foam and mingling flood
while eddying whirl and breaking wave
roused by the blast of winter rave
through sparkling spray in thundering clash
the lightnings of the waters flash
in awful whiteness oer the shore
that shines and shakes beneath the roar
thus—as the stream and ocean greet
with waves that madden as they meet—
thus join the bands whom mutual wrong
and fate and fury drive along
the bickering sabres shivering jar
and pealing wide or ringing near
its echoes on the throbbing ear
the deathshot hissing from afar
the shock the shout the groan of war
reverberate along that vale
more suited to the shepherds tale
though few the numbers—theirs the strife
that neither spares nor speaks for life
ah fondly youthful hearts can press
to seize and share the dear caress
but love itself could never pant
for all that beauty sighs to grant
with half the fervour hate bestows
upon the last embrace of foes
when grappling in the fight they fold
those arms that neer shall lose their hold
friends meet to part love laughs at faith
true foes once met are joined till death

with sabre shivered to the hilt
yet dripping with the blood he spilt
yet strained within the severed hand
which quivers round that faithless brand
his turban far behind him rolled
and cleft in twain its firmest fold
his flowing robe by falchion torn
and crimson as those clouds of morn
that streaked with dusky red portend
the day shall have a stormy end
a stain on every bush that bore
a fragment of his palampore
his breast with wounds unnumbered riven
his back to earth his face to heaven
falln hassan lies—his unclosed eye
yet lowering on his enemy
as if the hour that sealed his fate
surviving left his quenchless hate
and oer him bends that foe with brow
as dark as his that bled below

yes leila sleeps beneath the wave
but his shall be a redder grave
her spirit pointed well the steel
which taught that felon heart to feel
he called the prophet but his power
was vain against the vengeful giaour
he called on alla—but the word
arose unheeded or unheard
thou paynim fool could leilas prayer
be passed and thine accorded there
i watched my time i leagued with these
the traitor in his turn to seize
my wrath is wreaked the deed is done
and now i go—but go alone

the browsing camels bells are tinkling
his mother looked from her lattice high—
she saw the dews of eve besprinkling
the pasture green beneath her eye
she saw the planets faintly twinkling
tis twilight—sure his train is nigh
she could not rest in the gardenbower
but gazed through the grate of his steepest tower
why comes he not his steeds are fleet
nor shrink they from the summer heat
why sends not the bridegroom his promised gift
is his heart more cold or his barb less swift
oh false reproach yon tartar now
has gained our nearest mountains brow
and warily the steep descends
and now within the valley bends
and he bears the gift at his saddle bow—
how could i deem his courser slow
right well my largess shall repay
his welcome speed and weary way
the tartar lighted at the gate
but scarce upheld his fainting weight
his swarthy visage spake distress
but this might be from weariness
his garb with sanguine spots was dyed
but these might be from his coursers side
he drew the token from his vest—
angel of death tis hassans cloven crest
his calpac103 rent—his caftan red—
lady a fearful bride thy son hath wed
me not from mercy did they spare
but this empurpled pledge to bear
peace to the brave whose blood is spilt
woe to the giaour for his the guilt

a turban carved in coarsest stone
a pillar with rank weeds oergrown
whereon can now be scarcely read
the koran verse that mourns the dead
point out the spot where hassan fell
a victim in that lonely dell
there sleeps as true an osmanlie
as eer at mecca bent the knee
as ever scorned forbidden wine
or prayed with face towards the shrine
in orisons resumed anew
at solemn sound of alla hu
yet died he by a strangers hand
and stranger in his native land
yet died he as in arms he stood
and unavenged at least in blood
but him the maids of paradise
impatient to their halls invite
and the dark heaven of houris eyes
on him shall glance for ever bright
they come—their kerchiefs green they wave
and welcome with a kiss the brave
who falls in battle gainst a giaour
is worthiest an immortal bower

but thou false infidel shall writhe
beneath avenging monkirs scythe
and from its torments scape alone
to wander round lost eblis throne
and fire unquenched unquenchable
around within thy heart shall dwell
nor ear can hear nor tongue can tell
the tortures of that inward hell
but first on earth as vampire sent
thy corse shall from its tomb be rent
then ghastly haunt thy native place
and suck the blood of all thy race
there from thy daughter sister wife
at midnight drain the stream of life
yet loathe the banquet which perforce
must feed thy livid living corse
thy victims ere they yet expire
shall know the demon for their sire
as cursing thee thou cursing them
thy flowers are withered on the stem
but one that for thy crime must fall
the youngest most beloved of all
shall bless thee with a fathers name—
that word shall wrap thy heart in flame
yet must thou end thy task and mark
her cheeks last tinge her eyes last spark
and the last glassy glance must view
which freezes oer its lifeless blue
then with unhallowed hand shalt tear
the tresses of her yellow hair
of which in life a lock when shorn
affections fondest pledge was worn
but now is borne away by thee
memorial of thine agony
wet with thine own best blood shall drip
thy gnashing tooth and haggard lip
then stalking to thy sullen grave
go—and with gouls and afrits rave
till these in horror shrink away
from spectre more accursed than they

how name ye yon lone caloyer
his features i have scanned before
in mine own land tis many a year
since dashing by the lonely shore
i saw him urge as fleet a steed
as ever served a horsemans need
but once i saw that face yet then
it was so marked with inward pain
i could not pass it by again
it breathes the same dark spirit now
as death were stamped upon his brow
tis twice three years at summer tide
since first among our freres he came
and here it soothes him to abide
for some dark deed he will not name
but never at our vesper prayer
nor eer before confession chair
kneels he nor recks he when arise
incense or anthem to the skies
but broods within his cell alone
his faith and race alike unknown
the sea from paynim land he crost
and here ascended from the coast
yet seems he not of othman race
but only christian in his face
id judge him some stray renegade
repentant of the change he made
save that he shuns our holy shrine
nor tastes the sacred bread and wine
great largess to these walls he brought
and thus our abbots favour bought
but were i prior not a day
should brook such strangers further stay
or pent within our penance cell
should doom him there for aye to dwell
much in his visions mutters he
of maiden whelmed beneath the sea
of sabres clashing foemen flying
wrongs avenged and moslem dying
on cliff he hath been known to stand
and rave as to some bloody hand
fresh severed from its parent limb
invisible to all but him
which beckons onward to his grave
and lures to leap into the wave

dark and unearthly is the scowl
that glares beneath his dusky cowl
the flash of that dilating eye
reveals too much of times gone by
though varying indistinct its hue
oft with his glance the gazer rue
for in it lurks that nameless spell
which speaks itself unspeakable
a spirit yet unquelled and high
that claims and keeps ascendancy
and like the bird whose pinions quake
but cannot fly the gazing snake
will others quail beneath his look
nor scape the glance they scarce can brook
from him the halfaffrighted friar
when met alone would fain retire
as if that eye and bitter smile
transferred to others fear and guile
not oft to smile descendeth he
and when he doth tis sad to see
that he but mocks at misery
how that pale lip will curl and quiver
then fix once more as if for ever
as if his sorrow or disdain
forbade him eer to smile again
well were it so—such ghastly mirth
from joyaunce neer derived its birth
but sadder still it were to trace
what once were feelings in that face
time hath not yet the features fixed
but brighter traits with evil mixed
and there are hues not always faded
which speak a mind not all degraded
even by the crimes through which it waded
the common crowd but see the gloom
of wayward deeds and fitting doom
the close observer can espy
a noble soul and lineage high
alas though both bestowed in vain
which grief could change and guilt could stain
it was no vulgar tenement
to which such lofty gifts were lent
and still with little less than dread
on such the sight is riveted
the roofless cot decayed and rent
will scarce delay the passerby
the tower by war or tempest bent
while yet may frown one battlement
demands and daunts the strangers eye
each ivied arch and pillar lone
pleads haughtily for glories gone
his floating robe around him folding
slow sweeps he through the columned aisle
with dread beheld with gloom beholding
the rites that sanctify the pile
but when the anthem shakes the choir
and kneel the monks his steps retire
by yonder lone and wavering torch
his aspect glares within the porch
there will he pause till all is done—
and hear the prayer but utter none
see—by the halfillumined walldw
his hood fly back his dark hair fall
that pale brow wildly wreathing round
as if the gorgon there had bound
the sablest of the serpentbraid
that oer her fearful forehead strayed
for he declines the convent oath
and leaves those locks unhallowed growth
but wears our garb in all beside
and not from piety but pride
gives wealth to walls that never heard
of his one holy vow nor word
lo—mark ye as the harmonydx
peals louder praises to the sky
that livid cheek that stony air
of mixed defiance and despair
saint francis keep him from the shrinedy
else may we dread the wrath divine
made manifest by awful sign
if ever evil angel bore
the form of mortal such he wore
by all my hope of sins forgiven
such looks are not of earth nor heaven
to love the softest hearts are prone
but such can neer be all his own
too timid in his woes to share
too meek to meet or brave despair
and sterner hearts alone may feel
the wound that time can never heal
the rugged metal of the mine
must burn before its surface shine
but plunged within the furnaceflame
it bends and melts—though still the same
then tempered to thy want or will
twill serve thee to defend or kill—
a breastplate for thine hour of need
or blade to bid thy foeman bleed
but if a daggers form it bear
let those who shape its edge beware
thus passions fire and womans art
can turn and tame the sterner heart
from these its form and tone are taen
and what they make it must remain
but break—before it bend again

if solitude succeed to grief
release from pain is slight relief
the vacant bosoms wilderness
might thank the pang that made it less
we loathe what none are left to share
even bliss—twere woe alone to bear
the heart once left thus desolate
must fly at last for ease—to hate
it is as if the dead could feel
the icy worm around them steal
and shudder as the reptiles creep
to revel oer their rotting sleep
without the power to scare away
the cold consumers of their clay
it is as if the desert bird
whose beak unlocks her bosoms stream
to still her famished nestlings scream
nor mourns a life to them transferred
should rend her rash devoted breast
and find them flown her empty nest
the keenest pangs the wretched find
are rapture to the dreary void
the leafless desert of the mind
the waste of feelings unemployed
who would be doomed to gaze upon
a sky without a cloud or sun
less hideous far the tempests roar
than neer to brave the billows more—
thrown when the war of winds is oer
a lonely wreck on fortunes shore
mid sullen calm and silent bay
unseen to drop by dull decay—
better to sink beneath the shock
than moulder piecemeal on the rock

father thy days have passed in peace
mid counted beads and countless prayer
to bid the sins of others cease
thyself without a crime or care
save transient ills that all must bear
has been thy lot from youth to age
and thou wilt bless thee from the rage
of passions fierce and uncontrolled
such as thy penitents unfold
whose secret sins and sorrows rest
within thy pure and pitying breast
my days though few have passed below
in much of joy but more of woe
yet still in hours of love or strife
ive scaped the weariness of life
now leagued with friends now girt by foes
i loathed the languor of repose
now nothing left to love or hate
no more with hope or pride elate
id rather be the thing that crawls
most noxious oer a dungeons walls
than pass my dull unvarying days
condemned to meditate and gaze
yet lurks a wish within my breast
for rest—but not to feel tis rest
soon shall my fate that wish fulfil
and i shall sleep without the dream
of what i was and would be still
dark as to thee my deeds may seem
my memory now is but the tomb
of joys long dead my hope their doom
though better to have died with those
than bear a life of lingering woes
my spirit shrunk not to sustain
the searching throes of ceaseless pain
nor sought the selfaccorded grave
of ancient fool and modern knave
yet death i have not feared to meet
and in the field it had been sweet
had danger wooed me on to move
the slave of glory not of love
ive braved it—not for honours boast
i smile at laurels won or lost
to such let others carve their way
for high renown or hireling pay
but place again before my eyes
aught that i deem a worthy prize—
the maid i love the man i hate—
and i will hunt the steps of fate
to save or slay as these require
through rending steel and rolling fire
nor needst thou doubt this speech from one
who would but do—what he hath done
death is but what the haughty brave
the weak must bear the wretch must crave
then let life go to him who gave
i have not quailed to dangers brow
when high and happy—need i now

i loved her friar nay adored—
but these are words that all can use—
i proved it more in deed than word
theres blood upon that dinted sword
a stain its steel can never lose
twas shed for her who died for me
it warmed the heart of one abhorred
nay start not—no—nor bend thy knee
nor midst my sin such act record
thou wilt absolve me from the deed
for he was hostile to thy creed
the very name of nazarene
was wormwood to his paynim spleen
ungrateful fool since but for brands
well wielded in some hardy hands
and wounds by galileans given—
the surest pass to turkish heaven—
for him his houris still might wait
impatient at the prophets gate
i loved her—love will find its way
through paths where wolves would fear to prey
and if it dares enoughtwere hard
if passion met not some reward—
no matter how or where or why
i did not vainly seek nor sigh
yet sometimes with remorse in vain
i wish she had not loved again
she died—i dare not tell thee how
but look—tis written on my brow
there read of cain the curse and crime
in characters unworn by time
still ere thou dost condemn me pause
not mine the act though i the cause
yet did he but what i had done
had she been false to more than one
faithless to him—he gave the blow
but true to me—i laid him low
howeer deserved her doom might be
her treachery was truth to me
to me she gave her heart that all
which tyranny can neer enthrall
and i alas too late to save
yet all i then could give i gave—
twas some relief—our foe a graveed
his death sits lightly but her fate
has made me—what thou well mayst hate
his doom was sealed—he knew it well
warned by the voice of stern taheer
deep in whose darkly boding ear
the deathshot pealed of murder near
as filed the troop to where they fell
he died too in the battle broil
a time that heeds nor pain nor toil
one cry to mahomet for aid
one prayer to alla all he made
he knew and crossed me in the fray—
i gazed upon him where he lay
and watched his spirit ebb away
though pierced like pard by hunters steel
he felt not half that now i feel
i searched but vainly searched to find
the workings of a wounded mind
each feature of that sullen corse
betrayed his rage but no remorse
oh what had vengeance given to trace
despair upon his dying face
the late repentance of that hour
when penitence hath lost her power
to tear one terror from the grave
and will not soothe and cannot save

the cold in clime are cold in blood
their love can scarce deserve the name
but mine was like the lava flood
that boils in ætnas breast of flame
i cannot prate in puling strain
of ladyelove and beautys chain
if changing cheek and scorching vein
lips taught to writhe but not complain
if bursting heart and maddening brain
and daring deed and vengeful steel
and all that i have felt and feel
betoken love—that love was mine
and shown by many a bitter sign
tis true i could not whine nor sigh
i knew but to obtain or die
i die—but first i have possessed
and come what may i have been blessed
shall i the doom i sought upbraid
no—reft of all yet undismayedeg
but for the thought of leila slain
give me the pleasure with the pain
so would i live and love again1120
i grieve but not my holy guide
for him who dies but her who died
she sleeps beneath the wandering wave—
ah had she but an earthly grave
this breaking heart and throbbing head
should seek and share her narrow bed
she was a form of life and light119
that seen became a part of sight
and rose whereer i turned mine eye
the morningstar of memory1130
yes love indeed is light from heaveneh120
a spark of that immortal fire
with angels shared by alia given
to lift from earth our low desire
devotion wafts the mind above
but heaven itself descends in love
a feeling from the godhead caught
to wean from self each sordid thought
a ray of him who formed the whole
a glory circling round the soul
i grant my love imperfect all
that mortals by the name miscall
then deem it evil what thou wilt
but say oh say hers was not guilt
she was my lifes unerring light
that quenched—what beam shall break my nightei
oh would it shone to lead me still
although to death or deadliest ill
why marvel ye if they who lose
this present joy this future hope
no more with sorrow meekly cope
in phrensy then their fate accuse
in madness do those fearful deeds
that seem to add but guilt to woe
alas the breast that inly bleeds
hath nought to dread from outward blow
who falls from all he knows of bliss
cares little into what abyssej
fierce as the gloomy vultures now
to thee old man my deeds appear
i read abhorrence on thy brow
and this too was i born to bear
tis true that like that bird of prey
with havock have i marked my way
but this was taught me by the dove
to die—and know no second love
this lesson yet hath man to learn
taught by the thing he dares to spurn
the bird that sings within the brake
the swan that swims upon the lake
one mate and one alone will take139
and let the fool still prone to rangeek
and sneer on all who cannot change
partake his jest with boasting boys
i envy not his varied joys
but deem such feeble heartless man
less than yon solitary swan
far far beneath the shallow maidel
he left believing and betrayed
such shame at least was never mine—
leila each thought was only thine
my good my guilt my weal my woe
my hope on high—my all below
each holds no other like to thee
or if it doth in vain for me
for worlds i dare not view the dame
resembling thee yet not the same
the very crimes that mar my youth
this bed of death—attest my truth
tis all too late—thou wert thou art
the cherished madness of my heartem
and she was lost—and yet i breathed
but not the breath of human life
a serpent round my heart was wreathed
and stung my every thought to strife
alike all time abhorred all placeen
shuddering i shrank from natures face
where every hue that charmed before
the blackness of my bosom wore
the rest thou dost already know
and all my sins and half my woe
but talk no more of penitence
thou seest i soon shall part from hence
and if thy holy tale were true
the deed thats done canst thou undo
think me not thankless—but this grief
looks not to priesthood for reliefeo121
my souls estate in secret guess
but wouldst thou pity more say less
when thou canst bid my leila live
then will i sue thee to forgive
then plead my cause in that high place
where purchased masses proffer graceep
go when the hunters hand hath wrung
from forestcave her shrieking young
and calm the lonely lioness
but soothe not—mock not my distress
in earlier days and calmer hours
when heart with heart delights to blend
where bloom my native valleys bowerseq
i had—ah have i now—a friender
to him this pledge i charge thee sendes
memorial of a youthful vow
i would remind him of my end
though souls absorbed like mine allow
brief thought to distant friendships claim
yet dear to him my blighted name
tis strange—he prophesied my doom
and i have smiled—i then could smile—
when prudence would his voice assume
and warn—i recked not what—the while
but now remembrance whispers oeret
those accents scarcely marked before
say—that his bodings came to pass
and he will start to hear their truth
and wish his words had not been sooth
tell him—unheeding as i was
through many a busy bitter scene
of all our golden youth had been
in pain my faltering tongue had tried
to bless his memory—ere i died
but heaven in wrath would turn away
if guilt should for the guiltless pray
i do not ask him not to blame
too gentle he to wound my name
and what have i to do with fame
i do not ask him not to mourn
such cold request might sound like scorn
and what than friendships manly tear
may better grace a brothers bier
but bear this ring his own of old
and tell him—what thou dost behold
the withered frame the ruined mind
the wrack by passion left behind
a shrivelled scroll a scattered leaf
seared by the autumn blast of grief

tell me no more of fancys gleam
no father notwas not a dream
alas the dreamer first must sleep
i only watched and wished to weep
but could not for my burning brow
throbbed to the very brain as now
i wished but for a single tear
as something welcome new and dear
i wished it then i wish it still
despair is stronger than my will
waste not thine orison despaireu
is mightier than thy pious prayer
i would not if i might be blest
i want no paradise but rest
twas then—i tell thee—father then
i saw her yes she lived again
and shining in her white symar122
as through yon pale gray cloud the star
which now i gaze on as on her
who looked and looks far lovelier
dimly i view its trembling sparkev
tomorrows night shall be more dark
and i before its rays appear
that lifeless thing the living fear
i wander—father for my soul
is fleeting towards the final goal
i saw her—friar and i rose
forgetful of our former woes
and rushing from my couch i dart
and clasp her to my desperate heart
i clasp—what is it that i clasp
no breathing form within my grasp
no heart that beats reply to mine—
yet leila yet the form is thine
and art thou dearest changed so much
as meet my eye yet mock my touch
ah were thy beauties eer so cold
i care not—so my arms enfold
the all they ever wished to hold
alas around a shadow prest
they shrink upon my lonely breast
yet still tis there in silence stands
and beckons with beseeching hands
with braided hair and brightblack eye—
i knew twas false—she could not die
but he is dead within the dell
i saw him buried where he fell
he comes not—for he cannot break
from earth—why then art thou awake
they told me wild waves rolled above
the face i view—the form i love
they told me—twas a hideous tale—
id tell it but my tongue would fail
if true and from thine oceancave
thou comst to claim a calmer grave
oh pass thy dewy fingers oer
this brow that then will burn no more
or place them on my hopeless heart
but shape or shade whateer thou art
in mercy neer again depart
or farther with thee bear my soul
than winds can waft or waters roll
such is my name and such my tale
confessor to thy secret ear
i breathe the sorrows i bewail
and thank thee for the generous tear
this glazing eye could never shed
then lay me with the humblest deadew
and save the cross above my head
be neither name nor emblem spread
by prying stranger to be read
or stay the passing pilgrims tread123
he passed—nor of his name and race
he left a token or a trace
save what the father must not say
who shrived him on his dying day
this broken tale was all we knewex
of her he loved or him he slew

55 85 a tomb above the rocks on the promontory by some supposed the sepulchre of themistocles

there are says cumberland in his observer a few lines by plato upon the tomb of themistocles which have a turn of elegant and pathetic simplicity in them that deserves a better translation than i can give—

by the seas margin on the watery strand
thy monument themistocles shall stand
by this directed to thy native shore
the merchant shall convey his freighted store
and when our fleets are summoned to the fight
athens shall conquer with thy tomb in sight
note to edition 1832

56 the attachment of the nightingale to the rose is a wellknown persian fable if i mistake not the bulbul of a thousand tales is one of his appellations

come charming maid and hear thy poet sing
thyself the rose and he the bird of spring
love bids him sing and love will be obeyd
be gay too soon the flowers of spring will fade

ch 88 should wanton in a wilderness—ms

ci the first draft of this celebrated passage differs in many particulars from the fair copy which with the exception of the passages marked as vars i p 89 and i p 90 is the same as the text it ran as follows—
he who hath bent him oer the dead
ere the first day of death is fled—
the first dark day of nothingness
the last of doom and of distress—
before corruptions cankering fingers
hath tinged the hue where beauty lingers
and marked the soft and settled air
that dwells with all but spirit there
the fixed yet tender lines that speak
of peace along the placid cheek
and—but for that sad shrouded eye
that fires not—pleads not—weeps not—now—
and but for that pale chilling brow
whose touch tells of mortality
and curdles to the gazers heart
as if to him it could impart
the doom he only looks upon—
yes but for these and these alone
a moment—yet—a little hour
we still might doubt the tyrants power
the eleven lines following 8898 were not emended in the fair copy and are included in the text the fair copy is the sole ms authority for the four concluding lines of the paragraph

60 i trust that few of my readers have ever had an opportunity of witnessing what is here attempted in description but those who have will probably retain a painful remembrance of that singular beauty which pervades with few exceptions the features of the dead a few hours and but for a few hours after the spirit is not there it is to be remarked in cases of violent death by gunshot wounds the expression is always that of languor whatever the natural energy of the sufferers character but in death from a stab the countenance preserves its traits of feeling or ferocity and the mind its bias to the last according to medwin 1824 4to p 223 an absurd charge based on the details of this note was brought against byron that he had been guilty of murder and spoke from experience

83 107 alluding to the dubious suicide of the scorpion so placed for experiment by gentle philosophers some maintain that the position of the sting when turned towards the head is merely a convulsive movement but others have actually brought in the verdict felo de se the scorpions are surely interested in a speedy decision of the question as if once fairly established as insect catos they will probably be allowed to live as long as they think proper without being martyred for the sake of an hypothesis
byron assured dallas that the simile of the scorpion was imagined in his sleep—recollections of the life of lord byron by r c dallas p 264
probably in some instances the poor scorpion has been burnt to death and the wellknown habit of these creatures to raise the tail over the back and recurve it so that the extremity touches the fore part of the cephalothorax has led to the idea that it was stinging itself—encycl brit art arachnida by rev o p cambridge ii 281

87 109 alsirat the bridge of breadth narrower than the thread of a famished spider and sharper than the edge of a sword over which the mussulmans must skate into paradise to which it is the only entrance but this is not the worst the river beneath being hell itself into which as may be expected the unskilful and tender of foot contrive to tumble with a facilis descensus averni not very pleasing in prospect to the next passenger there is a shorter cut downwards for the jews and christians
byron is again indebted to vathek and s henley on vathek p 237 for his information the authority for the legend of the bridge of paradise is not the koran but the book of mawakef quoted by edward pococke in his commentary notæ miscellaneæ on the porta mosis of moses maimonides oxford 1654 p 288—
stretched across the back of hell it is narrower than a javelin sharper than the edge of a sword but all must essay the passage believers as well as infidels and it baffles the understanding to imagine in what manner they keep their foothold
the legend or rather allegory to which there would seem to be some allusion in the words of scripture strait is the gate etc is of zoroastrian origin compare the zendavesta yasna xix 6 sacred books of the east edited by f max muller 1887 xxxi 261 with even threefold safety and with speed i will bring his soul over the bridge of kinvat etc

88 110 a vulgar error the koran allots at least a third of paradise to wellbehaved women but by far the greater number of mussulmans interpret the text their own way and exclude their moieties from heaven being enemies to platonics they cannot discern any fitness of things in the souls of the other sex conceiving them to be superseded by the houris
sale in his preliminary discourse chandos classics p 80 in dealing with this question notes that there are several passages in the koran which affirm that women in the next life will not only be punished for their evil actions but will also receive the rewards of their good deeds as well as the men and that in this case god will make no distinction of sexes a single quotation will suffice god has promised to believers men and women gardens beneath which rivers flow to dwell therein for aye and goodly places in the garden of eden—the qurân translated by e h palmer 1880 vi 183
