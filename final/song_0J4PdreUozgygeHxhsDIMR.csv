i see chemtrails in the sky but i dont see the plane
what the hell is my problem with taking the blame
cause i play with my food and then someone else takes it away
its so hard to believe but im trying to change

verse 2
i see lines in the sand but i dont see who made them
i still listen to that band that you showed me last april
i still play with my food im a child at the grownups table
its so hard to believe but right now i feel stable

chorus
i moved away and i grew a few inches
what a shame i had a chance and i missed it
and there are some days when i hear that song
and i hate to admit  it
but i miss it i do
oh i miss it i miss you

postchorus
oh i miss it i miss it i miss you
oh oh
oh i miss it i miss it i miss you

verse 3
i see chemtrails in the sky but i dont see the plane
i know that i feel it but i dont know the name
i play with my food and then i throw it away
so hard to believe i have to grow up this way
you might also likechorus
i moved out and i made some new friends
sometimes when i shout it feels like no one hears it
and there are some days when i think that somewhere youre watching
as i grow up without you
i miss it i miss you
here is elizabeth eating a big snack after being in the shower for fifteen minutes
i miss it i miss you shes famished you can tell
say goodnight
