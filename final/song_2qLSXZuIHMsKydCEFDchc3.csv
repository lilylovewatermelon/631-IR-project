teacher says that ive been naughty
i must learn to concentrate
but the girls they pull my hair
and with the boys i cant relate
daddy says im good for nothing
mama says that its from him
manic sister thinks im cracking
brother says its in my genes

chorus
dont you want to
dont you want to be the one
dont you want to
bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
dont you want to
dont you want to hold the gun
dont you want to
bang bang bang bang bang bang bang

verse 1
so we put on our eyeliner
and a bit of glitter dust
life at night is always finer
neon streets are full of lust
teenage kids and soho dolls
they make you want to cry
like my superstar they fall
some will be alright

dont you want to
dont you want to be the one
dont you want to
bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
dont you want to
dont you want to hold the gun
dont you want to
bang bang bang bang bang bang bang

verse 2
sunlight falls onto his eyes
but he dont stir or turn
messages on the answerphone
but none will be returned
monday morning lousy morning
what a day to see
in the evening i will hear it
on the bbc

chorus
dont you want to
dont you want to be the one

bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
dont you want to
dont you want to hold the gun
dont you want to
bang bang bang bang bang bang bang
