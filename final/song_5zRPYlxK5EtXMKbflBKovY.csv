these niggas hatin know they just wanna see my career fallin wan see me fall

prechorus
he dont wanna see you with more money than him that aint your man
i take these percs and pop that x to hide the pain
the way they crossed us i swear it drive me insane
they drained my bank they thought they took me out the game
i came back runnin with some

chorus
top shottas i paid em top dollars
livin like a ruff rider they locked him up for violence
he came back like a survivor yeah
he came back like a survivor yeah
he fell out of love now he can never trust
they told him lies he was depressed they thought he gave it up
he came back like a survivor yeah
he came back like a survivor yeah

verse
pulled off in a maybach cmon
i came back whippin the rolls in a rolls
i been betrayed by these niggas and hoes
but this is the life that i chose yeah
out the top of the roof in the middle the road yeah
forever slidin bout my bros yeah
screamin out right or wrong yeah
we gon bust a nigga dome yeah
bullets flyin like an army
convicted felon bear arms and
shoot the burner hold it steady
hit a nigga in the arm and leg
hunger games armageddon
you broke your promise you was wrong for that
went to jail all behind your love
laid down and i came back
steady scopin scopin
wipe a niggas nose i say slatt
im steady workin since i made it out that north i aint look back
jail time and the prayers on lockdown writing songs on the rec
now im boardin on the jet with a glock9 and a bag full of racks
talkin down used to drive me insane
when i know i stayed true to this game
bitches playin steady sayin my name
niggas playin we be slangin that thing
im growin up tryna grow as man
maintaining elevating my brain
i know that im great so im never gon settle
wont value the money wont value no change
steady scopin scopin
wipe a niggas nose i say slatt
