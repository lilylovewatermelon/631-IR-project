i dont know just how it happened
i let down my guard
swore id never fall in love again
but i fell hard
guess i should have seen it comin ah
caught me by surprise ah
wasnt lookin where i was goin
i fell into your eyes

prechorus audra mae
you came into my crazy world
like a cool and cleansing rain
before i i knew what hit me baby
you were flowin through my veins

chorus audra mae
im addicted to you hooked on your love
like a powerful drug i cant get enough of
lost in your eyes drownin in blue
out of control what can i do
im addicted to you

verse 2 audra mae
midnight blows in through the window ah
dances round the room ah
got me hypnotised
im gettin high on the perfume

i couldnt live without you now
oh i know id go insane
i wouldnt last one night alone baby
i couldnt stand the pain

chorus audra mae
im addicted to you hooked on your love
like a powerful drug i cant get enough of
lost in your eyes drownin in blue
out of control what can i do
