mm

verse 1
you said you only had time for one drink
but that dress that youre wearing says a whole nother thing
you laugh and you smile and you wink
got my head spinning round like a roller rink
its going places weve never been
and its getting better with every tonic and gin
got a hollywood glow on your skin
wearin that i will if you will grin

chorus
how are we not supposed to crawl to the next bar
make out on the dancefloor take it too far out the back door
leave an open tab when you look like that
and tell me how am i supposed to keep my hands to myself
when youre making my mind wander somewhere else
its on a oneway track when you look like that

verse 2
how am i supposed to play it cool
with that sexy adorable way you move
i love watching you break your own rules
come on let me help you break a few

its on a oneway track when you look like that
