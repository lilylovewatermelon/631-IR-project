when you lose someone close to you
the pain is heavy
there are no words in these languages we share
to make the pain any easier to bare

prechorus
youll just have tears tears
when words all wash away
youll just have tears tears
and thats okay

chorus
sometimes theres sorrow for tomorrow
mourning til morning
sorrow for tomorrow
mourning til morning
sorrow for tomorrow
mourning til morning
sorrow for tomorrow

prechorus
and youll have tears tears
and in my tears  words will wash away
youll just have tears tears
and thats okay

so let the floodgates open and let the healin begin
mourning til morning
mourning til morning
mourning til morning
mourning til morning
mourning til morning mourning til morning
mourning til morning
mourning til morningembed"
