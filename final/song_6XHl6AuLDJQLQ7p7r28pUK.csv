ladies and gentleman miss velma kelly in an act of desperation

velma
my sister and i had an act that couldnt flop
my sister and i were headed straight for the top
my sister and i earned a thou a week at least oh yeah
but my sister is now unfortunately deceased
i know its sad of course but a fact is still a fact
and now all that remains is the remains of a perfect double act

spoken
watch this now you have to imagine it with two people its swell with two people

sung
first id
then shed
then wed
but i cant do it alone
then shed
then id
then wed
but i cant do it alone

shed say whats your sister like
id say men
shed say youre the cats meow
then wed wow the crowd again
you might also likewhen shed go
id go
wed go
then those dingdong daddies started to roar
whistled stomped stamped on the floor
yelling screamin beggin for more

spoken
and wed say ok fellas keep your socks up cause you aint seen nothin yet

sung
but i simply cannot do it alone

spoken
so whatd you think huh come on you can say
roxie makes a sound indicating she thinks its bad

i know youre right the first parts shit but the second part—the second part is really nifty ok

sung
shed go
id go
wed go
and then those twobit johnnys did it up brown
to cheer the best attraction in town
they nearly tore the balcony down
spoken
and wed say ok boys were goin home but before we go heres a few more partin shots and this—this we did in perfect unison

sung
now you see me going through it
you may think theres nothing to it
but i simply cannot do it
