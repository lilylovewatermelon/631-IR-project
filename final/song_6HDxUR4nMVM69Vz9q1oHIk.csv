a dustland fairytale beginning with just another white trash county kiss
in 61 long brown hair and foolish eyes
he looked just like youd want him to some kind of slick chrome american prince
a blue jean serenade

prechorus
moon river whatd you do to me
i dont believe you

chorus
saw cinderella in a party dress but
she was lookin for a night gown
i saw the devil wrappin up his hands
hes gettin ready for the showdown
i saw the minute that i turned away
i got my money on a pawn tonight

verse 2
a change came in disguise of revelation set his soul on fire
she said she always knew hed come around
and the decades disappear like sinkin ships but we persevere
god gives us hope but we still fear what we dont know the mind is poison

prechorus
castles in the sky sit stranded vandalized
were drawbridges closin
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likechrous
saw cinderella in a party dress
but she was lookin for a nightgown
i saw the devil wrappin up his hands
hes gettin ready for the showdown
i saw the ending when they turned the page
i threw my money and i ran away
straight to the valley of the great divide
out where the dreams all hide

bridge
out where the wind dont blow
out here the good girls die
and the sky wont snow
out here the bird dont sing
out here the field dont grow
out here the bell dont ring
out here the bell dont ring
out here the good girls die

outro
now cinderella dont you go to sleep
its such a bitter form of refuge
oh dont you know the kingdoms under siege
and everybody needs you
is there still magic in the midnight sun
or did you leave it back in sixtyone
in the cadence of a young mans eyes
out where the dreams all hide8embed"
