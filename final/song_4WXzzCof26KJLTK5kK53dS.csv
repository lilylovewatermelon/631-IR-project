mmmmm mmmm
mmmmm mmmm
mmmmm mmmm yeah

verse 1
hey stephen i know looks can be deceiving
but i know i saw a light in you
and as we walked we were talking
i didnt say half the things i wanted to
of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
ill be the one waiting there even when its cold
hey stephen boy you might have me believing
i dont always have to be alone

chorus
cause i cant help it if you look like an angel
cant help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain so
come feel this magic ive been feeling since i met you
cant help it if theres no one else
mmm i cant help myself

verse 2
hey stephen ive been holding back this feeling
so i got some things to say to you ha
ive seen it all so i thought
but i never seen nobody shine the way you do
the way you walk way you talk way you say my name
its beautiful wonderful dont you ever change
hey stephen why are people always leaving
i think you and i should stay the same
