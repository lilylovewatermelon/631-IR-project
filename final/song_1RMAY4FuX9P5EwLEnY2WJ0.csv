blessed assurance jesus is mine
o what a foretaste of glory divine
heir of salvation purchase of god
born of his spirit washed in his blood

chorus
this is my story this is my song
praising my savior all the day long
this is my story this is my song
praising my savior all the day long

verse 2
perfect submission perfect delight
visions of rapture now burst on my sight
angels descending bring from above
echoes of mercy whispers of love
