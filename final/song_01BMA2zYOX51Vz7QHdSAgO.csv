misery fell on the town when they lost all their looks
spent all those years with their jobs and their scholarly books
with no one to share all their thoughts and their worldlytobes oh no
they got down and prayed a little more for a life that was free

verse 2
wanting a change they assessed how reform comes around
a wise man suggested they work in their smiles not their frowns
and all of a sudden it sounds like the town was to be oh yes
a happier place where they live out their personal dreams

prechorus
la lala lala
la lala lala lala
la lala lala lala
la lala lala lala

chorus
why oh why this
town without love too much faith in above
can you feel the
force that it brings not to worry bout things
just the stars in the sky all enjoying their time
with a hope for peace

helping themselves figure out theres so much they can gain
the bad guys surrender their chemistry books at the fair oh well
then frolic and take in the love that persists everywhere

why oh why this
town without love too much faith in above
can you feel the

just the stars in the sky all enjoying their time
all the people that kiss all the children that wish
all the fresh living flowers that spend all their hours
outside in the rain just so happy you came
from so far for so long with a welcoming song
