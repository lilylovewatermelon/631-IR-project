watching that clock
ticktocking on by
had to talk myself
out of up and quitting outright
but i heard that we were working late
i called my baby on my next break
she was a hot mess
she had a bad day
she took a deep breath
next thing she had to say
was honey i want you

chorus
babys blue
yeah she needs me by her side
so blue
i can hear the tears in her eyes
lord knows i need this job
theres bills to pay
but id walk away if i had to
mm babys blue

verse 2
finally off work
crank up my pickup
drive off like a madman
cause she needs my love
like a songbird needs a tune
ill tell you just what im gonna do
im gonna
wrap her up tight
kiss the tears out of her eyes
man i swear
if i hit another red light
im gonna drive on through
im gonna drive on through cause

outro
oh the kind of fire my babys got
always passed the point of red hot
its blue
cause she needs me by her side
so blue
i can hear the tears in her eyes
lord knows i need that job
cause theres bills to pay
but id walk away if i had to
mm babys blue
