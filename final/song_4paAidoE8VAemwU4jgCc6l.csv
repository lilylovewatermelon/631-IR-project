chorus post malone
i lost all my friends countin bands in the bentley coupe
diamonds on me doin handstands rosé on my tooth
if she wanna dance let her dance for the money ooh
i dont need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
i lost all my friends countin bands in the bentley coupe
diamonds on me doin handstands rosé on my tooth
if she wanna dance let her dance for the money ooh
i dont need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

verse 1 21 savage
lost a few friends chasin hand money on god
had the same friends when i was bummy straight up
they shouldve went and did standup
cause when the money come niggas act funny true
crocodile wristband 21 dundee
yo bitch skate so fast to the dick
that shed even go and get a job at sonic on god
made it from the bottom im a star 21
playin with the stick like a guitar 21
why you got a 12 car garage why
cause i bought six new cars no lie
i remember times was dark i do
now im backstage with a bar big dog
couldnt pay the light bill it was dark yeah
now i can shine in the dark on god
lost a couple friends i aint even really mad though on god
i aint even really mad though 21
hard to tell the real from fake
cause nowadays they got masks on
who gon be around when the fame and the cash gone
i lost all my friends countin bands in a lambo truck
vvss on me fightin icy like a hockey puck
if she wanna dance let her dance watch her pick it up
i dont need no friends whats a friend if it aint no trust

verse 2 post malone
i lost all my friends countin bands and i copped a benz
pulled up with no army just the guap and im spendin it
no no never lendin it thats all for me
i stay greedy with the dollar givin no pologies
all these mans with they fuckin hands out tryna spare some
i dont never stress no i got plenty peso
i been all alone on my own in my new mansion
everybody says i went ghost jump in my phantom
paparazzi always tryna press up on me
ever since i blew up i dont know nobody know nobody
yeah i blew 80 bands only for you to leave
hey i know somewhere that my mama prayin for me for me
