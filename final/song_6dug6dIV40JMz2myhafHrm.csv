verse 1 lil baby
she sent a sad emoji when i fuck and leave she say i treat her like a slut
bae i cant come to your condo can’t fit in no parking garage in this big ass truck too big bro damn
if it was once then it mightve been luck if i did it two times then it stand for something
all my niggas say im fuckin’ the game up with all of these bitches im payin too much
im gettin a lot of money i aint trippin
if i aint popped the seal i ain’t sippin’
i paint my wagen blue im still crippin’
hope you know i remember i aint forgetful
give her the world and she gon still come to me
oh you aint heard i’m unfuckinwitable
but boy you a wankster you aint even lit enough
i dont got no involvement but they hit em up
three mill a year what my artists make minimum
look at me i done built me a business up
baby jayz i run me a billy up
gave her seventyfive hundred her titties up
its like ten of us with a richard millie
we be turning shit up you should fuck with us
you cant name a young crew that can fuck with us
any category well fuck em up
from the cars to jewels to titles to deeds to streets to beef
whatever they know its us
im 4 pockets i pop out with otf
we gon be at the top you can meet us there
im tryna motivate the hood to do better
i lost my coat and i had to wear two sweaters
i aint been rich all my life dont be fooled
i sold them nicks and them dimes at the school
been a lil player knew i was gon be the one im buyin all the pretty girls lunch
my mama been knew i was gon be a problem when in fifth grade i got kicked out for hunchin
we follow all of the opps on our finsta
soon as they post a location we flip em
my niggas takers i aint talkin pictures
they be on bullshit i cant take em with me
shit aint all bread and butter i come from the gutter
sat in prison a couple of years
i got my shit together some investment partners
now i own me a couple of million
