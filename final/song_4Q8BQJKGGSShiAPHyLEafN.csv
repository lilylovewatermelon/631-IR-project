i was waiting for a baggie
a powder bunny
i have a buddy i grew up with
he hooked it up for me
im helpin it my own way
when im stuck in bed
a little more than a memory
sticks in my head
i really like the game we played
you left the cd here
a lot of positive messages
and something left unclear

outro marie barone  brad garrett
oh i know its all in the bible
you ever think about space what is it
is it really endless
i mean if you had a spaceship could you go flyin and flyin through space foreveryou might also likeembed"
