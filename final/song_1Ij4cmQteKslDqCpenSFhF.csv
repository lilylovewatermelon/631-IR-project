drink slow to feed the nose you know he likes to get blown
has he got enough money to spend
leave no hes to and fro he doesnt like it when the girls go
has he got enough money to spend

verse 1
its going off cause theyre not gonna let him in
two and a half the boy is rushing out his skin
hes got his charm with the girls that are smoking
he takes her arm jumps the bar and now hes in
chorus
drink slow to feed the nose you know he likes to get blown
has he got enough money to spend
leave no hes to and fro he doesnt like it when the girls go
has he got enough money to spend

verse 2
a broken half a glass has opened up his chin
he thinks hes hard a powdered mouth that tastes of gin
hes just been barred for that blues he was smoking
and then he barks its my car im sleeping in

bridge
tabs with unlimited os
new clothes bloody nose
powders and walking back home
has he got enough weed no
broken phone retching on the floor alone
and i cant believe that were talking bout him
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likeverse 3
im searching you mate your jaws all over the place
cant talk quick slap in the face
yes i threw a nut but your friends a case
why you singling him out is it because of his race
look the dog wont bark if you dont lark about
