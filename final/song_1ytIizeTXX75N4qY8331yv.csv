chorus

verse 1
i was afraid i kept my feelings inside
we shared our love and the thing
but in the end you took a ride
you didnt come back to me i shut my tears along
it crushed my heart cause you are never coming home
emotions swept away to nothing at all
those were the days that i was losing control
you got me burning it will never get the same
you just let me standing in the rain

chorus
ive got to get away
ive got to move away
ive got to get away

ive got to get away
ive got to move away
ive got to get away
ive got to move away
