the samples wont delay
but the cable—
theres another way
say something
anything
test— one two three—
anything but that
this is weird
its weird
very weird
fucking weird
im so mad that i dont know what to do
fighting with microphones
freezing down to my bones
and to top it all off im with you
feel like going insane
got a fire in your brain
and youre thinking of drinking gasoline
as a matter of fact—

mark
honey i know this act
its called the tango maureen
the tango maureen
its a dark dizzy merrygoround
as she keeps you dangling
you might also likejoanne  mark
youre wrong
your heart she is mangling
its different with me
and you toss and you turn
cause her cold eyes can burn
yet you yearn and you churn and rebound
i think i know what you mean

joanne  mark
the tango maureen

joanne  mark
has she ever pouted her lips
and called you pookie
never
have you ever doubted a kiss or two
this is spooky
did you swoon when she walked through the door
every time— so be cautious
did she moon over other boys— 
more than moon—
im getting nauseous

joanne spoken  mark spoken
whered you learn to tango
with the french ambassadors daughter in her dorm room at miss porters and you
with nanette himmelfarb the rabbis daughter at the scarsdale jewish community center
its hard to do this backwards
you should try it in heels
joanne  mark
she cheated
she cheated
maureen cheated
fucking cheated
im defeated
i should give up right now
gotta look on the bright side
with all of your might
id fall for her still anyhow

joanne  mark
when youre dancing her dance
you dont stand a chance
her grip of romance
makes you fall

joanne  mark
so you think might as well
dance a tango to hell

mark  joanne
at least ill have tangoed at all
the tango maureen
gotta dance till your diva is through
you pretend to believe her
cause in the end you cant leave her
but the end it will come
still you have to play dumb
till youre glum and you bum
and turn blue
joanne  mark both
why do we love when shes mean
and she can be so obscene
my maureen een een een
