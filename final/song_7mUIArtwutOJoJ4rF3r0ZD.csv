i wont cut my beard and i wont change my hair
it grows like fancy flowers but it grows nowhere
my hair my hair
if i could build my house just like the trojan horse
id put a statue of myself upon the shelf
of course of course of course

verse 1
shes the smoke shes dancing fancy pirouettes
swan diving off of the deep end of my tragic cigarette
shes steam laughing on the windowpanes
the neverending swaying haze
oh that ever smiling maze
oh that ever smiling maze
a ballet

verse 2
everythings gone missing ive lost more songs to floods
i cant prove this makes any sense but i sure hope that it does
perhaps i was born with curiosity the likes of those of old crows
the likes of those of old crows and oh how the piano knows
the piano knows something i dont know

outro
i wont cut my beard and i wont change my hair
it grows like fancy flowers but it grows nowhere
my hair my hair
if i could build my house just like the trojan horse
id put a statue of myself upon the shelf
