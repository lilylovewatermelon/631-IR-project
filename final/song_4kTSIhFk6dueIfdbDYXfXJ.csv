he said ill love you til i die
she told him youll forget in time
as the years went slowly by
she still prayed upon his mind
he kept her picture on the wall
went half crazy now and then
he still loved her through it all
hoping shed come back again

verse 2
kept some letters by his bed
dated 1962
he had underlined in red
every single i love you
i went to see him just today
ah but i didnt see no tears
all dressed up to go away
first time id seen him smile in years

chorus
he stopped loving her today
they placed a wreath upon his door
and soon theyll carry him away
he stopped loving her today

you know she came to see him one last time
ah and we all wondered if she would
and it kept runnin through my mind
this time hes over her for good

chorus
he stopped loving her today
they placed a wreath upon his door
soon theyll carry him away
he stopped loving her todayembed"
