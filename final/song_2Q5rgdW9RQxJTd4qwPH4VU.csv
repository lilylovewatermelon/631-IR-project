verse 1 french montana
ay two mansions in the hamptons
money longer than the ave
30 cars on the avenue
30 mills in the valley
came from the bottom watch what i do
you bunch of internet thugs yahoo
you got a buzz im the whole field
ask your bitch im a dope deal
try to book me for my watch
ill book em for a show let his mama watch
call the coroner and call the pastor
and grab a casket my chest christens in the laughter
talk about new york big estate
got the bank and i aint fit thats a stash
bet a mill and i aint riggin
on the large get a minaj aint nicki
