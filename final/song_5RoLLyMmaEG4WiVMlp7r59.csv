the looking glass so shiny and new
how quickly the glamour fades
i start spinning slipping out of time
was that the wrong pill to take raise it up

you made a deal and now it seems you have to offer up
but will it ever be enough raise it up raise it up
its not enough raise it up raise it up

here i am a rabbithearted girl
frozen in the headlights
it seems ive made the final sacrifice

prechorus
we raise it up this offering
we raise it up

chorus
this is a gift it comes with a price
who is the lamb and who is the knife
midas is king and he holds me so tight
and turns me to gold in the sunlight

verse 2
i look around but i cant find you raise it up
if only i could see your face raise it up
i start rushing towards the skyline raise it up
i wish that i could just be brave
you might also likei must become a lionhearted girl
ready for a fight
before i make the final sacrifice

prechorus
we raise it up this offering
we raise it up

chorus
this is a gift it comes with a price
who is the lamb and who is the knife
midas is king and he holds me so tight
and turns me to gold in the sunlight

bridge
raise it up raise it up
raise it up raise it up
and in the spring i shed my skin
and it blows away with the changing wind
the waters turn from blue to red
as towards the sky i offer it

chorus
this is a gift it comes with a price
who is the lamb and who is the knife
midas is king and he holds me so tight
and turns me to gold in the sunlight
chorus
this is a gift it comes with a price
who is the lamb and who is the knife
midas is king and he holds me so tight
and turns me to gold in the sunlight

chorus
this is a gift it comes with a price
who is the lamb and who is the knife
midas is king and he holds me so tight
and turns me to gold in the sunlight
