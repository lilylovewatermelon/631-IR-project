why do i stay why do i stay in love
why do i stay why do i stay in love
oh baby
baby i stay in love with you

verse 1
dying inside cause i cant stand it
make up break up cant take this madness
we dont even really know why all i know is baby i
try and try so hard to keep our love alive
if you dont know me at this point
then i highly doubt you ever will
i really need you to give me that unconditional love i used to feel
its a mistake if we just erase it hey hey
from our hearts and minds i know

chorus
we said let go but i kept on hangin on
inside i know its over youre really gone
its killing me cause there aint nothing that i can do
baby i stay in love with you
and i keep on telling myself that youll come back around
and i try to front like “oh well”
each time you let me down front like oh well
see i cant get over you now no matter what i do
baby baby i stay in love with you

why do i stay why do i stay in love

verse 2
it cuts so deep it hurts down to my soul
my friends tell me i aint the same no more
we still need each other when we stumble and fall how
we gon act like what we had aint nothing at all now
hey what i wanna do is ride shotgun next to you
with the top down like we used to
hit the block proud in the su
we both know our heart is breakin
can we learn from our mistakes
i cant last one moment alone although i know

chorus
we said let go but i kept on hangin on
inside i know its over youre really gone
its killing me cause there aint nothing that i can do
baby i stay in love with you
and i keep on telling myself that youll come back around
and i try to front like “oh well”
each time you let me down front like oh well
see i cant get over you now no matter what i do
baby baby i stay in love with you
we said let go but i kept on hangin on
inside i know its over youre really gone
its killing me cause there aint nothing that i can do
baby i stay in love with you
and i keep on telling myself that youll come back around
and i try and front like oh well
each time you let me down front like oh well
see i cant get over you now no matter what i do
but baby baby baby i stay in love with you
chorus
i stay in love
oh love
