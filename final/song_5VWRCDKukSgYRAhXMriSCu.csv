so i wait my turn im a modern man
and the people behind me they cant understand
makes me feel like
makes me feel like
so i wait in line im a modern man
and the people behind me they cant understand
makes me feel like
something dont feel right

verse 2
like a record thats skipping im a modern man
and the clock keeps ticking im a modern man
makes me feel like
makes me feel like

chorus
in my dream i was almost there
then they pulled me aside and said youre going nowhere
they say we are the chosen few but we waste it
and thats why were still waiting

verse 3
on a number from the modern man
maybe when youre older you will understand
why you dont feel right
why you cant sleep at night now

in line for a number but you dont understand

in line for a number but you dont understand
like a modern man

verse 4
oh i had a dream i was dreaming
and i feel im losing the feeling
makes me feel like
like something dont feel right
i erase the number of the modern man
wanna break the mirror of the modern man
makes me feel like
makes me feel like

chorus
in my dream i was almost there
then they pulled me aside and said youre going nowhere
i know we are the chosen few but we waste it
and thats why were still waiting

in line for a number but you dont understand
like a modern man
in line for a number but you dont understand
like a modern man

then how come you cant sleep at night
in line for a number but you dont understand
like a modern man
