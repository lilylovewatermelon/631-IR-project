out of the tree of life i just picked me a plum
you came along and everything started to hum
still its a real good bet
the best is yet to come

chorus 1
the best is yet to come
and wont that be fine
you think youve seen the sun
but you aint seen it shine

verse 2
wait till the warmup is underway
wait till our lips have met
wait till you see that sunshine day
you aint seen nothin yet

chorus 2
the best is yet to come
and wont that be fine
the best is yet to come
come the day youre mine

verse 3
come the day that youre mine
im gonna teach you to fly
weve only tasted the wine
were gonna drain that cup dry
you might also likeverse 4
wait till your charms are right
for the arms to surround
you think youve flown before
but you aint left the ground

bridge
wait till youre locked in my embrace
wait till i hold you near
wait till you see that sunshine place
there aint nothin like it here

chorus 2
the best is yet to come
and wont that be fine
the best is yet to come
come the day that youre mineembed"
