verse 1 lloyd banks
its not of my nature to make a commitment so let me breathe
what she doesnt understand catch attitudes when i leave her
prior relations just make it harder for me to accept her as my own
she tries to tie up my phone
if im not at home shes thinking im not alone
probably out trying to bone anything in the street
i let her know she can leave i aint trying to tie her up
but see its hard to fuck with somebody after she touches me
mami im not your regular nigga i know the game
but i dont play by the rules im focusing on my moves
that way i will never lose
see i can tell by your shoes if you attracted to benzes with 22s
you say i confuse you play little tricks with your head
been catching feelings ever since the first time i slept in your bed
hun im not here to tease you mislead you or sell you dreams
i cant say i love you i dont know what that means

verse 2 tony yayo
when i first met her i did anything to get her
paid all her bills and filled her frigerator
reminiscing on late nights when i tried to lay up
but couldnt get off cause your baby would stay up
she even crashed the whip trying to switch in the third lane
thats when i realized this bitch was a bird brain
a pigeon writing her baby pops in the box in the prison
singsing is where he been
she in the gucci tights and fendi high heels
baby wipes and cans of enfamil
motorbikes and grams of fishscale
so 9to5 niggas was no frills
turning young niggas with principles to old men with debts
and all the prank calls was death threats
that bitch got the best sex  all across the globe
and the bitch head game was out of control
