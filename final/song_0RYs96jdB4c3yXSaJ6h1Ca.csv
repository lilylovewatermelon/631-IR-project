she rolls the window down
and she talks over the sound
of the cars that pass us by
and i dont know why
but shes changed my mind

chorus
would you look at her as she looks at me
shes got me thinkin about her constantly
but she dont know how i feel
and as she carries on without a doubt
i wonder if shes figured out
im crazy for this girl
yeah im crazy for this girl

verse 2
she was the one to hold me
the night the sky fell down
and what was i thinkin when
the world didnt end
why didnt i know what i know now

would you look at her as she looks at me
shes got me thinkin about her constantly
but she dont know how i feel
and as she carries on without a doubt
i wonder if shell figure out
im crazy for this girl
