then follow it with hesitation
but there are just so many of
you out there for rent
a stronger girl would shake this off in flight
and never give it more than a frowning hour
but you have let your heart decide
loss has conquered you

youve won one too many fights
wearing many hats every time
but you wont win here tonight

youve made it through the direst of straits alright
can you help it if plain love now seems less interesting
you havent changed an ounce in my eyes
and i cannot lecture you
and does anything i say seem relevant at all
youve been at the helm since you were just five
while i cannot claim to be more than a passenger
but youve won one too many fights
wearing all of your clothes at the same time
let the good times end tonight
oh girl sail her dont sink her
this time
you might also likejust a moment or two from now
not a mind will retain even a trace
of the thoughts that i struggled to tell
and how our stack of cards just fell
so settle this once and for all
the light no longer shows the cracks around my door
and i have no lantern to light your way home tonight
you are not some saint whos above
giving someone a stroll through the flowers
youve got so much more to dream of
oh girl sail her dont sink her
this time
this time
