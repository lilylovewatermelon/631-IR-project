verse 1
yeah yo this industry is so confusin
hard to tell whos really with me or whos tryna use me
if i told you i respect you i aint say it loosely
i dont throw those words around its just not how i do things ayy
yeah i know i can be a nuisance
aint afraid to admit it if i think the shoe fits
people ask me where ive been ive been writin new hits
had to make my own plans i dont need your two cents ayy
yeah i dont wanna hear excuses
i just like to make moves and make improvements
i just like to break rules maybe start some new trends
live the life that i choose cuttin off the loose ends ah

yeah heres a couple things that im confused with
i just did a interview the guy was pretty clueless
you dont have to know the album names or all my music
but at least try to find out who you in the room with
ayy i like facts i dont like assumin
take a shot behind my back ima catch the bullets
why the game lookin at me like im just a tourist
they should know im here to stay this verse is gettin borin
twisted mind of a lyricist listen while i experiment
visualize its imperative big surprises and scary tricks
it is time yes were here again sit in silence dont care for it
criticizin my character isnt wise so beware of it
forget what youre tellin me do what i gotta man
i got the remedy one of kind but they never selected me
i dont fit in with the room of celebrities
i wanna know when they bring up my legacy
there was  nobody that ever could mention me
sayin that i wasnt makin the rap
and then doin it cleverly did what i had to
and gave it my everything

chorus
yeah yeah they asked me where i learned to do this
selftaught checkin things off my todo list
treat my temper like my family i aint tryna lose it
say a little do a lot woo no excuses
yeah yo they asked me where i learned to do this
selftaught checkin things off my todo list
