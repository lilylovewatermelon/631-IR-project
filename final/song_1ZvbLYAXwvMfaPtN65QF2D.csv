itll be a wednesday
and ill be goin to this coffee shop
hear the barista call an oat milk latte and your name
and i look up from my phone
and think theres no chance its you but it is
youll say hi ill say hi how are you
youll say hows your family hows your sister
ill say shannons bein shannon
after a minute of nonsensical chatter youll say
well this was really nice maybe we should do this on purpose sometime
and itll have been long enough that we wont harp on hmm

prechorus
arguments in your garage
all the ways we sabotaged it mmm
what it was and what it wasnt

chorus
weve been swimmin on the edge of a cliff
im resistant but goin down with the ship
itd bе so nice right right
if we could take it all off and just еxist
and skinny dip in water under the bridge

verse 2
youll suggest a restaurant we used to go to
and ill say wont that be too nostalgic
and youll say maybe but lets do it anyway
we wont sit at our same old table i promise
and we wont bring up the past well keep it bureaucratic
and we wont say it but both of us well be thinkin about
how different we are from those scared little kids that had those hmm
