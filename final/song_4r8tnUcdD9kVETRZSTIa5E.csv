i appreciate yall yeah i really do
brought all these flowers
in your black dresses and suits
but yall know me and you know the truth
that aint me in that box there in front of you
can i just get an amen and yall just get outta here
i got the best view ever now that im way up here
joking round with jesus catching up with grandpa
hurry up preacher im telling yall

chorus
you should be fishing
with a cold beer in your hand
instead of missing me here
yall should be missing me there high up in your deer stand
save my truck and save my guns
and when thеyre old enough give еm to my sons
dont let this stained glass shine on yall too long today
and save the roses save the roses
dont waste them on me

verse 2
tell who you love how much you love em
dont just say it no you gotta show em
every chance you get to get to know her better
remember forever dont last forever
take it from me and my brand new point of view
the biggest regret of your life
wont be what you did
itll be what you didnt do

chorus

yall should be missing me there high up in your deer stand
save my truck and save my guns
and when theyre old enough give em to my sons
dont let this stained glass shine on yall too long today
and save the roses save the roses
save the roses
dont waste them on me
