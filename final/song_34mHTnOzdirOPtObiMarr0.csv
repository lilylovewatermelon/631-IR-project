verse 1 lil cig
i keep on strolling with no control of my thoughts or life yeah
seems like my home has become something i cant recognize ayy
doubters turn to believers but fuck im not surprised yeah
i miss my cousin so much yet hes still by my side what
crazy how friends switch it askin how they can get a picture
what happened to whats up homie—how ya doing goddamn i miss ya
dont wanna be nowhere else so im making myself create this hell
in the place i dwell stuck in an open cell
take me back fore the levees fell

verse 2 7th ward lord
yeah i be that 7th ward lord with them devil horns
born and raised in the waves of the storm
the flood has left me wet and torn
the garden of eden destroyed by babylon demons
they poured the chlorine with no warning
petals on the floor freezing
a world once unexplored i think im marco polo covered in thorns
set my compass to avoid tethered forms
new orleans is wartorn i aint bettin scores
and all of my friends are now whores
and im bored of the replication of the life
i once lived in the city i once adoredsee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like34embed"
