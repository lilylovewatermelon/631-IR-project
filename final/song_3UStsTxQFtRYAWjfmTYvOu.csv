oh my otis wont you come back down
im on my way but i need a little time
shook my soul and you saved my life
im on my way but i need a little time

verse 1
i need some love from a georgia man
bang it out in dawson
i get him then i lost him
part time preacher in the traveling band
that sugar on his shoulder

chorus
oh my otis wont you come back down
im on my way but i need a little time
shook my soul and you saved my life
im on my way but i need a little time

verse 2
sing me up then break my heart
those cigarettes and coffee
look at the man hes got me
big ol ranch keeps us apart
and that tramp from california

oh my otis wont you come back down
im on my way but i need a little time
shook my soul and you saved my life
im on my way but i need a little time

sugar in the morning you gotta get on up
listen to the sound and you gotta get on up

chorus
oh my otis wont you come back down
im on my way but i need a little time
shook my soul and you saved my life
im on my way but i need a little time

oh my otis wont you come back downembed"
