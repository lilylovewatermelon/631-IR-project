along the way sometimes strangers make your friends
well im gettin old and my friends dont come around like they used to
weve stopped actin like weve got somethin to prove

my old friend jake yeah man we made some noise in those barrooms
whod have thought hed be the first one with a son
and i like to think that guy we all call mckinney
he was there at my worst and lord knows hes helped me on
its been a few years since i seen that matthews boy
hes still livin down in houston still never call him back when i phone
every now and then ill stop and ill have a few with vinny
you know we laugh about the old times at least those we recall

its always cest la vi try not to miss the forest for the trees and now were what we did not think wed be
a little bit older a little less wise
you get a little older and a lot less wise

time is gold and it only goes by in waves of strangers
