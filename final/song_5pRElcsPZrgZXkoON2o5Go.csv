i hate feeling like this
im so tired of trying to fight this
im asleep and all i dream of is waking to you
tell me that you will listen
your touch is what im missing
and the more i hide i realize im slowly losing you

prechorus
comatose
ill never wake up without an overdose of you

chorus
i dont want to live
i dont want to breathe
less i feel you next to me
you take the pain i feel
waking up to you never felt so real
i dont want to sleep
i dont want to dream
cause my dreams dont comfort me
the way you make me feel
waking up to you never felt so real

verse 2
i hate living without you
dead wrong to ever doubt you
but my demons lay in waiting
tempting me away
oh how i adore you
oh how i thirst for you
oh how i need you

waking up to you never felt so real
