verse 1
i can hear you but i wont
some look for trouble
while others dont
theres a thousand reasons
i should go about my day
and ignore your whispers
which i wish would go away ohohoh
whoaoh

verse 2
youre not a voice
youre just a ringing in my ear
and if i heard you which i dont
im spoken for i fear
everyone ive ever loved is here within these walls
im sorry secret siren but im blocking out your calls
ive had my adventure i dont need something new
im afraid of what im risking if i follow you

verse 3
what do you want cause youve been keeping me awake
are you here to distract me so i make a big mistake
or are you someone out there whos a little bit like me
who knows deep down im not where im meant to be
every days a little harder as i feel your power grow
dont you know theres part of me that longs to go
