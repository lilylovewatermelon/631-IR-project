5nf5l2Ui9p8u6TWHtLYcjI,If You Ain't Lovin' (You Ain't Livin'),George Strait,2CIOi72adKDDQpj9x69qpW,"10 contributorsif you ain’t lovin’ you ain’t livin’ lyricsverse 1
if you got a cadillac boy
and a forty room shack boy
a bucket full of money and a tree full of honey

but if youre getting no hugging
no smooching
or a mugging
if you aint loving then you aint living

verse 2
if youre riding on a gravy train
instead of walking down lovers lane
you cant make hay boy
cause youre going the wrong way boy

you gotta get a little honey
its better than money
if you aint loving then you aint living

verse 3
if they call you a big man
cause you gotta lotta bottom land
if youre kin to the president
and you help run the government
see george strait liveget tickets as low as 104you might also likebut if youre getting no attention
youre better off on a pension
if you aint loving then you aint living

verse 4
if you got a string of long cars
and youre smoking them fourbit cigars
you aint no well to do unless you get a little kochiko

it takes a little bit of smacking
all your lifes alacking
if you aint loving then you aint livingembed"
