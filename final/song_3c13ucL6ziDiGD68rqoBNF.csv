breathe and ill carry you away into the velvet sky
and well stir the stars around
and watch them fall away into the hudson bay
and plummet out of sight and sound
the open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
where i live in the alpine heights
below the northern lights i spend my coldest nights
alone awake and thinking of
the weekend we were in love
the weekend we were in love

verse 2
home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull
a thousand miles from the tide
but photos on the walls of new york shopping malls
distract me so i stay inside
i wish the rockets stayed over the promenade
cause i would make a hook and eye
and fish them from the sky my darling she and i
were hanging on so take us high
to sing the world goodbye

chorus
i am floating away
lost in a silent ballet
im dreaming youre out in the blue and i am right beside you
awake to take in the view
late nights and early parades
still photos and noisy arcades
my darling were both on the wing
look down and keep on singing
and we can go anywhere

are you there are you there are you there are you there
are you there are you there are you there are you there
or are you just a decoy dream in my head are you there are you there
am i home or am i simply tumbling all alone

chorus
i am floating away floating away
lost in a silent ballet a silent ballet
im dreaming youre out in the blue and i am right beside you
awake to take in the view
late nights and early parades early parades
still photos and noisy arcades noisy arcades
my darling were both on the wing
look down and keep on singing
and we can go anywhere

outro
are you there are you there are you there are you there
are you there are you there are you there are you there7embed"
