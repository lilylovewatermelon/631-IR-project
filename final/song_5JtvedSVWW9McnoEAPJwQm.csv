verse 1
the way you kiss me when im strokin deep inside of it
i swear you ride it so good so good
that pussy blow me away
and i been thinkin bout your smile
all mornin for a while
bout the way you twist your face while im strokin in and out
girl you shocked me im so wowed
got me slippin im like how
first i met you on the gram i picked you up and took you out
let me show you what im bout
let them haters run they mouth
you should know you somethin different cause i brought you to my house
serve you breakfast on my couch
anything you ever need you know ill be there with no doubt
i need you by my side i hope youre here to ride
i hate to see you hurtin my lil baby wipe your eyes

chorus

kiss you from your neck down neck down

kiss you from your neck down
