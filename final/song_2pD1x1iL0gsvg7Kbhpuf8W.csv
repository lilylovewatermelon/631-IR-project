tonight we run
we run into the sun
we run into the corners of
the love we choose to make

verse 2
tonight we show
we show where we belong
the places i have never been
the places we are strong

verse 3
tonight were golden
we fall towards each other
we fall to the edges of the earth
we burn tonight as one

verse 4
tonight we run
through love we never knew
our love to everyone
we love tonight for love

were golden
were golden
were golden
were goldensee odesza liveget tickets as low as 60you might also like2embed"
