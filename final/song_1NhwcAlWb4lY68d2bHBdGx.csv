will i stop crying for once
its hurtin my eyes
theres a difference between lonely and lonesome
but im both all the time
yeah im both all the time

verse 2
i dont let myself out
but i like it like that
i dont get the point of leaving my house
cause i always come back
yeah‚ always come back

verse 3
and im too scared to look
i never know what happens
so i keep rereading the same book
cause i know how it ends
yeah‚ i know how it ends

verse 4
and im loneliest at night
after my shower beer
and ill go to sleep without turning out the lights
