cottonwood fallin like snow in july
sunset riverside four wheel drivesiin a tail light circle
roll down the windows turn it on up
pour a little crown in a dixie cup
get the party started

chorus
girl you make my speakers go boom boom
dancin on the tailgate in a full moon
that kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
youre lookin so good in whats left of those blue jeans
drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
the best buzz im ever gonna find
hey im a little drunk on you
and high on summertime

verse 2
if you aint a 10 youre a 99
tippin n spillin that homemade wine
on your tied up tshirt
every little kiss is drivin me wild
throwin little cherry bombs into my fire
good god almighty

chorus
girl you make my speakers go boom boom
dancin on the tailgate in a full moon
that kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
youre lookin so good in whats left of those blue jeans
drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
the best buzz im ever gonna find
hey im a little drunk on you
and high on summertime

lets slip on out where its a little bit darker
and when it gets a little bit hotter
well take it off on out in the water

chorus
girl you make my speakers go boom boom
dancin on the tailgate in a full moon
that kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm
youre lookin so good in whats left of those blue jeans
drip of honey on the money maker gotta be
the best buzz im ever gonna find
hey im a little drunk on you
and high on summertime
