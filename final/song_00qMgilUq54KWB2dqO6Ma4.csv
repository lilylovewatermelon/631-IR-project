every time that someone walks in
she turns around to see if its him
she checks her watch by the clock
i cant count the times hes stood her up
and ones too much

chorus
how could anybody break a heart like hers
i cant stand to watch her hurt
i would gladly take her place
if shed just love me the way
he must not know what its worth
i dont understand how anyone
could break a heart like hers

verse 2
she keep saying hell change someday
he wasnt always this way
she thinks he hung the moon and stars
but all hes done is string her along like this
it dont make sense

chorus
how could anybody break a heart like hers
i cant stand to watch her hurt
i would gladly take her place
if shed just love me the way
he must not know what its worth
i dont understand how anyone
could break a heart like hers
