only you you you
only you you you

verse 1
i remember in the schoolyard
the children didnt understand
so they bullied me with silence
just for being who i am
so i got good at keeping secrets
i used to blend in with the crowds
on the inside i was screaming
with you i didnt have to hide

chorus
only you could see that i was hurting
only you ever cared to understand
always know that id do the same
id do anything for you my friend
its true

verse 2
i used to stare up at the ceiling
wide awake all through the night
while the world was busy sleeping
i was so caught up in my mind

only you ever cared to understand
always know that id do the same
id do anything for you my friend
its true so true

oh when im all alone
a million miles away from home

my rock and shoulder to lean on
when every hope i have is gone
ill turn to you you know its true

chorus
only you could see that i was hurting
only you ever cared to understand
always know that id do the same
id do anything for you my friend
its true so true

outro

ill be proud to call you my best friend
