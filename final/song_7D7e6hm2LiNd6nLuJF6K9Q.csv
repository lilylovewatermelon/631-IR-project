east and the west im rackin up all my bread uh
power on me im feelin just like a tesla
too much tree the smoke is makin my chest hurt
girl on me im thinking i should arrest her
ayy im thinking i should arrest
all night long she puttin me to the test
got a lot on im tryna take off the rest
cleaning up my lines i say nothin but the best

verse 2
hey girl youre the cutest that i see
so bright im not using my visine
gotta get it likely or im ending my life see
so beautiful like outta my dreams
hey boo im hollering at you
not rude im just tryna be yo dude
so what i gotta do just to see how that ass move
so beautiful sorry to be crude

verse 3
yo b im makin the next move
you know me im nothing but just smooth
low seats im settin the right mood
all these other rappers they talking they just food
ayy im talking to just you
you talking to one dude
