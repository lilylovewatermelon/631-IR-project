this will be my last tattoo
to cover the memory of someone i thought id always need
cover her name with a smoking gun
make it hurt as much as possible and make it bleed

just cant take it no more feelin numb
woke up face on the floor i was dumb
cut me all the way to the core morning comes
time to get busy forgetting again
tired of going out my mind
looking for something i wont find
how could i have been so blind
this is a load of crap
it figures she would win
but ill learn to feel again
bear down hard when you fill it in
give me the pain ill grit my teeth in

hook
this will be my last tattoo
to cover the memory of someone i thought id always need
cover her name with a smoking gun
make it hurt as much as possible and make it bleed

you know when i woke up this morning she was long and gone
i thought she heard me say she was my vertebrae my back bone ba bone
the dome feels wrong the night aint right
the phone aint on and she broke out last night
left a note sayin she wont hang on she just cant fight
i know shes with brock scott that jock with blonde locks
that blocks shots guess im just not that hot
mailbox for cocks
let him bust your rear cuz you dont trust my rap career
but need i point out our bank account with a large amount
you left in the bank you skank what you think
im a take this loot and buy some ink
you can take that shit you talkin with you walkin hooker
see rehab liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likehook
this will be my last tattoo
to cover the memory of someone i thought id always need
cover her name with a smoking gun
make it hurt as much as possible and make it bleed

her face is still in my brain kill her name
im still dealing with pain what a shame
heart still wearing a stain im to blame
little bitty guiltys crawling all over my soul
i cant believe this shit
said i caused the things she did
bear down hard when you fill it in
give me the pain ill grit my teeth in

hook
this will be my last tattoo
to cover the memory of someone i thought id always need
cover her name with a smoking gun
make it hurt as much as possible and make it bleedembed"
