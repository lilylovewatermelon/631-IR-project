the elvis presley phenomenon
elvis presley was rock and roll’s first big star and his rise to fame marked a major change in american culture he was a white man who sang country blues rb and rockabilly all of it laced with a gospel sound perhaps even more than james dean he exuded a natural sexuality that shaped the thinking of american youth about what was cool he was vilified by the older generation as vulgar and a bad influence on their children but he was the beginning of a movement that changed our culturehearing him for the first time was like busting out of jail   bob dylanborn on 8 january 1935 in east tupelo mississippi presley was the son of gladys and vernon presley a seamstress and a truck driver elvis’ twin brother jesse garon was stillborn and elvis grew up an only child when he was three his father served an eightmonth prison term for writing bad checks and afterward vernon presley’s employment was erratic keeping the family just above homelessness

in 1945 presley won second prize at the mississippialabama fair and diary show for his rendition of red foley’s “old shep”  in 1948 the family moved to memphis and while attending lc humes high school there presley spent much of his time in the black section of town and especially on beale street watching and listening to bluesmen like furry lewis and bb king

after high school graduation in 1953 he thought hed become a truck driver like his father but he couldnt let go of his love of music he recorded several songs at the memphis recording service a sideline business sam phillips set up in his sun records studio that allowed anyone to record a 10inch acetate for four dollars
the sun sessions
sam phillips noticed presley and called him in the  spring of 1954 to record a song for sun records although that session didnt go well phillips thought hed found something in presley “a white man with the negro sound and the negro feel phillips worked with presley to develop that style and brought guitarist scotty moore and bassist bill black into the studio to rehearse with him for several months  on the 5th of july 1954 they recorded “blue moon of kentucky” and “that’s all right mama the memphis response was huge and it became his first local hit presley even made an appearance at the grand ole opry in nashville on september 25thleft to right jerry lee lewis carl perkins johnny cash and seated elvis presley 1955  they all recorded for sun records at the same time

by october 1954 presley had debuted on the louisiana hayride a popular radio program he made his television debut on the television version of hayride in march 1955 meanwhile “good rockin’ tonight” became a hit in memphis
colonel tom parker entered presley’s life in 1955 helping presley make some tour arrangements presley trusted parker because parker managed hank snow and presleys mother had great respect for snow  on may 13th his song “baby let’s play house” was released and climbed to no 10 on the country and western charts
elvis hits the big time
in september 1955 presley had his first no 1 country hit a version of junior parker’s “mystery train” by early 1956 he was becoming a national star he and parker went to nashville and recorded his first songs for rca including “i got a woman” and “heartbreak hotel” in january 1956 presley made his national television debut with six consecutive appearances on the dorsey brothers’ stage show in march presley signed a management agreement with parker giving parker 25 of presley’s gross earnings a deal that got even sweeter for parker over time

things started to snowball in 1956 when parker got presley appearances on the milton berle steve allen and ed sullivan tv shows by august he began filming his first movie love me tender was a hit and that sparked a series of hit singles “blue suede shoes” “don’t be cruel” with “hound dog” on the bside and “love me tender”

in march 1957 presley purchased graceland a former church that had been converted into a 23room mansion the next month “all shook up” began an eightweek run at no 1  he continued to make movies too and they helped sell records like “let me be your teddy bear” and “jailhouse rock”

in december 1957 presley received his draft notice and entered the us army in march 1958 he took leave just a few months later to be with his mother who died the day after he  arrived home in memphis presley served the remainder of his two year obligation to the army and was discharged in march 1960

during the christmas holiday of 1960 priscilla beaulie visited presley at graceland and moved in soon after  she was 14 at the time they were married in may 1967 after priscilla turned 21  they had their first and only child nine months laternothing really affected me until i heard elvis if there hadnt been an elvis there wouldnt have been a beatles  john lennonthe big comeback
music was changing fast by the mid 60s and presley started fading from the scene because of the british invasion and the focus on live concerts by acts like the beatles the rolling stones the who and others although he continued to make movies they were received with less and less interest presley was becoming uncool and was in danger of becoming irrelevant
the solution was a tv special and it became his big comeback vehicle it took the form of what later became the mtv unplugged series the idea started as a christmas special but people close to presley argued against that wanting something more engaging and personal director and producer steve binder noticed that presley and his band members would blowoff steam during rehearsals by improvising blues and rb throw aways and thats when i really got the idea wouldnt it be great if i had a camera in here and they didnt know i was herepresley was concerned about doing a live performance but binder built his confidence by doing several live audience rehearsals and using scotty moore and dj fontana he also put priscilla and several of presleys friends in the audience on 27 june 1968 presley took the stage for his first live performance in seven years the result was four onehour live shows taped at nbcs burbank studios presley sat and jammed with band mates for two shows and the second two were done two nights later as small room standups those sessions are often referred to as the burbank sessions

but by the early 70s presley’s personal life had become fodder for tabloid headlines priscilla left elvis in february 1972 and on his birthday in 1973 he filed for divorce professionally he reached his peak after the 1968 comeback although new hits were few suspicious minds in the ghetto and promised land are three of only a handful he was more popular than ever and his fan worship was turning into a personality cult  but he was plagued by selfdoubt and poor management  starting in 1974 he repeatedly threatened to quit show business he turned to drugs and became a virtual recluse his abuse of prescription drugs increased during the last years of his life ironically he remained devoutly spiritual never drank alcohol and publicly denounced drug use he even  visited richard nixon at the white house to receive an honorary dea badgetowards the end he gained weight slept poorly and his onstage performances felloff dramatically presley’s last live performance was on 25 june 1977 in indianapolis at the time he was preoccupied by the impending publication of one of the tellall books that would make public his drug abuse and obsession with firearms the book came out on august 12th and on 16 august 1977 presley was discovered dead in the bathroom of his home by girlfriend ginger alden he was just 42 at the time his death was blamed on congestive heart failure but later investigation revealed that drug abuse was at least part of the cause of his deathrockabilly musicrockabilly blends country and bluegrass with western swing boogiewoogie and jump blues to deliver a harddriving rhythm thats meant for dancing  rockabilly may have peaked in the mid 1950s but it never really died  there are many artists who continue the tradition today like imelda may brian setzer and the reverend horton heat

after ww2 memphis became a hot spot for blues and soul recording with artists like rufus thomas junior parker bb king and elvis presley  the mix of rural and urban musical traditions led to the creation of new blues styles including the revolutionary new sounds of rhythm and blues and rock and roll riley king arrived from indianola and soon became known as the “beale street blues boy” a name he later shortened to bb king rufus thomas helped king come into his own by featuring him in his shows  thomas and king were among the many mississippiborn artists who recorded at sam phillips sun records

the memphis music scene went through some tough times in the late 1960s and 70s the place became a virtual ghost town  but in 1966 beale street was placed on the national register of historic places  in the late 70s the city of memphis bought nearly every property on a three block stretch of what had been the heart of the historic beale street blues district in 1977 an act of the us congress declared beale street as the home of the blues  the beale street management corporation rebuilt the entertainment district and by the early 80s a complete renovation was underway  new clubs restaurants and shops opened throughout the 80s and 90s and by the turn of the century beale streets comeback was complete

today beale street is bigger and better than ever  the  blues traditions are promoted today by thecenter for southern folklore the memphis blues society and the memphisbased blues foundation and their annual international blues competition and blues music awards

soul music originated in memphis the roots of both blues and soul can be traced to the slave music of the 19th century and both started a transformation with american urbanization after ww2 soul became a  separate genre by 1960 and was brought to mainstream radio largely by the records made at stax records hi records and goldwax records  stax records was the most famous of the soul studios because of artists like booker t and the mg’s sam and dave isaac hayes and otis redding  the soul genre declined in popularity during the disco era of the late 70s but your can still hear its influence in other genres like motown rb hiphop and even country
