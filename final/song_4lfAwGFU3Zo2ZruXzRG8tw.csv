temporary euphoria or a release
hm yeah especially if you constantly gotta work
and do things that you might not wanna do mhm
thats like temporary happiness real quick its an escape
and i make music about that because i feel it gets to a point
where you live so much of your life in that state because you work so damn much ah
its been years and i been doin the same shit
motherfuckers like to use that word toxic
but thats the internet word that people like to attach to shit
i dont think thats an internet word
i think thats a real word that really mеans something
temporary euphoria mothеrfuckers like this the new shit though
motherfuckers like you never heard
toxics been around for like centuries
its like im out this muhfucka for a lil bit while you bullshittin
its an escape thats how i feel about it hm
shakespeare used it thats a twitter word
the taming of the shrew anything that doesnt apply to you feel me
yeah its like you feel me rainbows and butterflies
i fuck around drink and bullshit they gon be like it was toxic
bustin random chicks and pop some e and bullshit
but if you sing that the people want you to make some shit thats romantic or sweet
its like fuck it like its an escape
so if you sing some real shit like whats toxic whats real
honestly truthfully okay i get that
i feel like i know i gotta wake up in the morning and go to work i feel like there can be auh maybe
so lemme bullshit for the night theres like a thin line
this right here euphoria the thing that come with this shit or a release
this is uhuh its like reality times ten
every year before like ten years
as far as the people that you meet
the places that you go
temporary euphoria or a release
so its because of that naturally im gonna approach shit
a little more in retrospect and it might come out harsh
but i think its just more honest
lets just keep that shit honest fuck it
what purpose do your vices serve in your lifeyou might also likeembed"
