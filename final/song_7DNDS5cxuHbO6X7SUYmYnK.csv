i know its gon hurt yeah i aint gon lie
truth is im liable to cry
one foot in one out the door
aint no use goin back and forth
but if you gotta do what you gotta do
just make sure youve thought it through
cause ima be a heart broke down and out
if you leave me girl dont leave me now

chorus
come on baby let it down let it down
let it down on down the line
show me a little mercy fore you break this heart of mine
let it down let it down
let it down on down the line
if you give me til tomorrow ill be fine
oh let it down

verse 2
oh i know your minds made up youre good as gone
but hold your horses hold the phone
ima need a quick second to breathe
fore you pack your bags just up and leave
so give me your word you aint gon go
before the sun rise and the rooster crow
i know its too late cant make it right
whats it gonna hurt just one more night
