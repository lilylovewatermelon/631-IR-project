when the roll is called up yonder
i hope you see me there

chorus
its in the water
its where you came from
its in the water
its where you came from

verse 2
when the crowd begins to wonder
and they cry to see your face

chorus
its in the water its in the story
where you came from
the sons and daughters in all their glory
its gonna shape em
and when they clash and come together
and start rising
just drink the water where you came from
where you came from

its in the water its in the story
where you came from
your sons and daughters in all their glory
its gonna shape em
and when they clash and come together
and start rising
just drink the water where you came from
where you came from
its in the water
its where you came from where you came from
its in the water
its where you came from where you came from
and when they clash and come together
and start rising
just drink the water where you came from
where you came from7embed"
