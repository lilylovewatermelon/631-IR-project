that i never really meant to stay
i left you right where i want you
now theres nothin left
and not a reason
theres nothin left to believe in
when just one remains
ive sailed away

such a foolish game
that we have been playin
now you got me right where you want me
i left you in the right
but you wouldnt let me take the fall
now youve got me right where you want me

now theres nothin left
and thats the reason
theres not much left to believe in
if its all just the same
ill sail away
you pushed so hard
you have to know that
you might just get what you wanted
and when just one remains
ive sailed away
you might also likei found out on my own
everything that ive been missin
now ive got you right where i want you
now that were apart
i see just who you are
youre always gonna be
the one to keep hatin
now ive got you right where i want you

now theres nothin left
and thats the reason
theres not much left to believe in
if its all just the same
ill sail away
you pushed so hard
you have to know that
you might just get what you wanted
and when just one remains
ive sailed away

im not one to hide my face behind the pain
its not like me to beg you to stay
ill just sail away

now theres nothin left
and thats the reason
theres not much left to believe in
if its all the same
ill sail away
you pushed so hard
you have to know that
you might just get what you wanted
and when just one remains
you know ive sailed away
and when just one remains
you know ive sailed away

does it hurt to hear me say
that i never really meant to stayembed"
