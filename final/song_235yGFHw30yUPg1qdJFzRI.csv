shes a little red wine hes a little bit whiskey smoke
hes a ragged on the edge shes keeping him holding out hope
shes a front pew hallelujah drop another 20 in the plate
hes on the back row a little hung over bout 20 minutes late

chorus
shes a good girl sky blue turquoise
fallin for a bad boy drivin that detroit
big block cruisin up the black top
turnin up a corn row scare crow farm house gravel road
comin for a good girl countin down the sun set
never been broke heart racin like a corvette
got a little wildfire burnin in her angel eyes
probably aint never been lost after midnight
tryin to be a good girl but fallin for a bad boy
tryin to be a good girl but fallin for a bad boy

verse 2
well shes sundress cotton hes grease on a carhartt shirt
and shes a candle in the wind hes a light it up and let it burn
and every time shes with him all she wants to do is kiss him
starts thinking maybe she can fix him
hes thinkin hed love to let her try

chorus
shes a good girl sky blue turquoise
fallin for a bad boy drivin that detroit
big block cruisin up the black top
turnin up a corn row scare crow farm house gravel road
comin for a good girl countin down the sun set
never been broke heart racin like a corvette
got a little wildfire burnin in her angel eyes
probably aint never been lost after midnight
tryin to be a good girl but fallin for a bad boy
tryin to be a good girl but fallin for a bad boy

and every time shes with him
she knows she prolly oughta quit him
but he dont wanna let her get away

chorus
shes a good girl sky blue turquoise
fallin for a bad boy drivin that detroit
big block cruisin up the black top
turnin up a corn row scare crow farm house gravel road
comin for a good girl countin down the sun set
never been broke heart racin like a corvette
got a little wildfire burnin in her angel eyes
probably aint never been lost after midnight
tryin to be a good girl but fallin for a bad boy
tryin to be a good girl but fallin for a bad boy
