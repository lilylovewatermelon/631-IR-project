do my thing tae
true story
ayy ayy

verse 1
lost in my thoughts guess thats what i get for thinking
lost in a cough this year i almost quit drinking
took some time off just to find myself sinking
then they said i fell off thats what i need
he made me flash out look how i turned into a cash cow
broker than a joke who get the laugh now
rod got them racks now always knew that i would cash out
just had to keep going when i was assed out
told em fuck punchin the clock ill break in houses with kareem
and fuck your favorite rapper he aint gangster as he seem
i done met a lot of rappers they dont live the life they say they live
they dont do the things they say they did
jeezy told us trap or die but told his son to go to college
im a bottom boy survivor i made it out my apartments
last year i was thinkin about robbin
the same rap niggas for some robins
but life go up and down like elevators
who wouldve knew that wed count hella paper
or that this cash came with hella haters
we movin fast like the talladaga
them niggas mad but it get greater later
i got a tip for ya save your
energy cause you gon need it
we finna ball you got a long season of hatin for no reason
i run the game these niggas nose bleeding
them shows piling and them phones ringing
i took advantage of tawanas child
lord knows that im still thankful for her
cause losing her gave me some law and order
they told me karmas coming back around
i just pray it aint deboras daughter
im grown now learning more and more im
finally becoming a man
tried to get you to understand life had grown out of hand
until you walk a mile you would never know it
they told me people grow apart its all a part of growing

verse 2
ima rip my heart out my chest put it in this envelope
but if you dont feel my pain you would never know
they say when its raining its pouring its thundering its lightning
but if its meant to be aint no way you can fight it
