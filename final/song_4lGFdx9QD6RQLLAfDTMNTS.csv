well dj clay came with a dope track to roll with
underground like anna nicole smith
big j duke of the darkness
turn the best rapper alive into a carcass
a mic in my hand is like a pipe bomb
sweeter than coconut pie right mom
ju double ga to the lo
let your nuts hang straight to the floor
yes i like fat on my chicks ass
poundage that make my dick splash
seventeen or seventyone
i got dick for everyone
fuck fear suck right here
dick in your nose hole nuts in your ear
rape yo face like a warlock wylin
wear your panties to yo funeral smilin
sick seriously furious
homeless and alone luxurious
lampin back alley way campin
raggin gang taggin stampin
im the joker neden hole poker
blunt toker punk smoker
throat choker life croaker
grape faygo soda bath soaker
squeeze my nosee and your head explodes
with bionic elbows like dusty rhodes
i fuck old fat hoes in they crusty folds
and peel homeless hoes out they musty clothes
im a damn fool no rules
too cool for school lick my family jewels
im hungry bitch starvin i need this
nine whoppers and a shake couldnt feed this
clones with been there and done that rhymes
yall already said that how many times
its groundhog day for groundhog years
two sticks of dynamite fuckin my ears
dayton family boondox abk
somebody take me away
clay twiztid hutch blaze
the hatchet is the place to be
you might also likeverse 2 jamie madrox
never faded appreciate every time
i look in the crowd and theyre recitin all of our rhymes
that we kick call it holiday more free shit from twiztid
blastin the microphone with free spit
the style is linguistic verbal and sadistic
where bitch motherfuckers need purses and lipstick
we sick to the finish and bring ya everything you need
we the best these bitches aint even in our fuckin league
im an mvp when it comes to flows
hope you brought your umbrella im finna rain on you hoes
not bent like an elbow or folded like a crease
im drunk off the grey goose and pineapple peace
to the ones that rock and stay down with what we do
to the rest im like a bus driver takin em back to school
pack a lunch all you punks im out the trunk like speakers
and they ears are hot to death and my words are heat seekers

verse 3 cold 187um
this is a psychopathic public service announcement
i eat up suckers down to the last ounce and
when it comes to lyrical murderin thats me
believe you in the presence of a true rider rest in peace
yeah i think for one theres too many gangstas in the streets
theres too much hate frustration and bitches in heat
beef i get it every motherfuckin day of the week
and if i have to pull the heat i hope god rest your soul
psychopathic assassins smashin on all you non believers
group pleasin dick teasers
i dont ever pause for a second i stay heavy
im from the west where they dip chevys and stay ready biatch
verse 4 blaze ya dead homie
you know im low down and dirty and married to the game
i was raised on the streets of drivebys and car jackins
you packin better be covered in kevlar
you dont have a clue about the arsenal i sit on
mossburg spittin twelve gauge sittin
in my left hand blink and you sinkin like quick sand
blaze is the name aint a damn thing change
but the the time on the watch 2012 they say it stops
and im only getting started no room for half hearted on my team
cavities i clear em out like listerine
your lips blistering how they react to the slap
swollen up like collagen too much with carmex
im an old school fool with a new school style
tried and true and guaranteed to make ya go wild
rick grimes end times unload the nine
the world dies like gloria gaynor but i survive

verse 5 anybody killa
im just a killa from east baby check my stats
the only native representin with these warrior raps
got a heart that bleeds courage and i cant be stopped
yes im the cream of the crop somebody gimme my props
this is murder mitten music so im killin them fools
breakin all of they rules its time to send em to school
im just a painted up freak and im not alone
the scent of the underground be my hatchet cologne
when you see us bet ya wanna be us
if you aint representin psychopathic then you might as well just be dust
ashes to ashes and laid to rest
to all them artists out there who aint showin respect
motherfucker if you willing try and stop our shine
guarantee you at the end youll be fallin behind
here go a hot sixteen of straight tellin the truth
now rewrite your rap book and lock yourself in the booth bitch
verse 6 monoxide
im a bad dreams nightmare
and im everywhere like the internet homie and you just aggravatin like spyware
i put i knife through eye ware
and thatll leave ya blind but still alive so you always know that im out there
you aint a monster or a beast
youre just another neck that i choke with a  leash
and ima keep growin like disease in the streets
and run rampant with a passion thatll bring you fuckin leaches to your knees
bitch please i dont apologize to none talk shit and dealt with
ill bring the fuckin sun up out the sky just to light weed and melt shit
from a whole different dimension an no intervention can help this
we aint the ones that you mess with
cause we can flip it up like a coin and youre headless
tail between your legs like a bitch as she pregnant
just psychopathic fam in this bitch on some neck slit next shit

verse 7 shaggy 2 dope
some folks call me joey but most call me shaggs
fuck skinny jeans its 42s in my shoppin bags
and my waist and nothing but a 32
which leaves plenty of room for my 20 deuce
plus rockin plain 3x tall ts
and thats weighin in soakin wet a buck 70
not to mention the rocks stuffed in my shoe soles
but not for skippin for flippin to them fiendin hoes
fuck the adams my family be juggalos
and if we was a movie the thingll be my roll
cause my hands be doin things my brains take control
like choking on necks and bangin random neden holes
my psychopathic homies we like stealth bombers
doin damage across the countries undetected by your radars
then one by one boom hit ya with nuke
get the underground rowdy make the surface dwellers puke
suits on the outside but mad tatted skin
are nothing but joker cards bitch thats our kin
infiltrate from the outside workin ways in
happy smiley faces opposite of terrorism
they gave us one thousand ways to die we chose one
we got a thousand ways to get funds
see it our way or you best fuckin run
bet a thousand fbi agents got juggalo sons
bout to follow in they foot steps and be cops
so we takin over like it or not
two fullon generations workin on three
indestructible trunk on this evergrowin family tree
barely makin loot on the shit you hear and see
still breakin new grounds and we twenty years deep
yet we still getting younger aint that somethin
the clowns ripped up a benjamin buttonembed"
