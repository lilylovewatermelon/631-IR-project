travel through the light
holy holy
take me to the highest mountain
and the lowest seas
glory of your light
break through

verse 2
i want to experience all the light has to offer me
bathing in your glow
patterns in the light
pressing new frontiers
totally reborn
dont be afraid of death
well be gone in the twinkling of an eye
