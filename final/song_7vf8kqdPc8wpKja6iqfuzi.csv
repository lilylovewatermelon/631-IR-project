lord i just could not wait to find out for myself
well dont knock it till youve tried it
and ive tried it my friend
ill never smoke weed with willie again

now we learned a hard lesson in a small texas town
he fired up a fat boy and he passed it around
the last words i spoke before they tucked me in
i may discount bungee jump but
ill never smoke weed with willie again

ill never smoke weed with willie again
my partys all over before it begins
you can pour me some more whiskey river my friend
but ill never smoke weed with willie again

we hopped on his old bus the honeysuckle rose
the party was huntsville it was after the show
alone in the front lounge just me and him
i took one friendly puff and the grim creeper set in

ill never smoke weed with willie again
my partys all over before it begins
you can pour me some more whiskey river my friend
but ill never smoke weed with willie again
you might also likenow were passin the guitar were tellin good jokes
i can tell ones a comin cause im smellin smoke
but i do not partake i just let it pass by
with a grin on my face and a great contact high

ill never smoke weed with willie again
my partys all over before it begins
you can pour me some more whiskey river my friend
but ill never smoke weed with willie again

in the fetal position with drool on our chin
we broke down and smoked weed with willie againembed"
