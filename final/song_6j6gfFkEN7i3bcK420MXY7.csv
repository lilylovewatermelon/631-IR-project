i walk on decrepit bricks and kick sticks and rusty soda cans
simply for lack of better stimulation
motivation comes and goes like gas station patrons
so sedation compensates for unexpected vacations thank you
thats my pregratitude
postplease leave me alone thats just my rude attitude
no dysfunction flipside im just your ordinary citizen
theyre waiting patiently for me to sin again but then again shit
im really mommys little angel
but that angel on my shoulder got strangled
for trying to tangle with his nemesis he caught him on the wrong day
and got cut like djs spinning doubles let the fucking song play
im on my way to the store ignoring the city
to purchase a pack of marb reds with a stack of rolled pennies
i could go for dennys and my stomach holds plenty
but my pockets got holes i guess the goal is to stay empty
quite simply put me and my pockets share interest
ill never fall in love with that pretty greeneyed temptress twice yeah right
i learned my lesson the first time
i just couldnt keep up with that everchanging jordan line of foot apparel
parallel to many clones my eyes vision monochromes
with seven shades and twenty tones
plus i breath artistic they eating everything im feeding them
put myself in every painting and use my spit as mat medium
and results of my children we share the same genes
cast the same reflection and interpret the same dreams
like whoa like whoa like whoa like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

and at night i roam these streets with absolutely no purpose absolutely no purpose
feeling like im worthless feeling like im worthless
but contrary to my last statement i feel fine
content with the fact that i know this citys mine
and at night i roam these streets with absolutely no purpose absolutely no purpose
feeling like im worthless feeling like im worthless
but contrary to my last statement i feel fine
content with the fact that i know this citys mine

verse 2
i walk down dead end streets like i didnt see the sign
just to turn around and walk back
thats fine and dandy but whats whack is the fact im still walking
like thank god for walkmans
im only yawning cause these simply minded mortals make me sleepy
so what do i do i resort to tv
in the seemingly lousy attempt to numb myself with lackluster images
and insignificant information like willis was really ty bridges
just to have the upper hand in monotonous conversations
and for lack of better stimulation
im painting portraits of dysfunctional families with gloomy faces
rockin dont worry be happy tshirts and youre assuming im tasteless
you misconstrue it but your babies will embrace it
the basic essentials of a very bitter young man
that kicks rusty soda cans and walks on decrepit bricks
with a permanent pair of headphones trying to make these lectures stick
ill let the protestors picket like they are gonna make a difference
and watch them die before they realize that their cause was nonexistent
like their cause was nonexistent
chorus
and at night i roam these streets with absolutely no purpose absolutely no purpose
feeling like im worthless feeling like im worthless
but contrary to my last statement i feel fine
content with the fact that i know this citys mine
and at night i roam these streets with absolutely no purpose absolutely no purpose
feeling like im worthless feeling like im worthless
but contrary to my last statement i feel fine
content with the fact that i know this citys mine

verse 3
i walk on shitty city sidewalks stepping on every single crack
reminiscent of that joke we used to say when we were snotty nose
my purpose got defeated when my mind turned paraplegic
plus i failed my civil service exam they said i cheated
not to mention tainted urine samples and the attention span of a secondgrader
more fascinated with building blocks than wasting time stressing his daily lesson
hence the ridilin ive been gone with the wind like lucky lottery tickets since day one one
i stepped on the left cause rights wrong wrong
so what do i do i resort to friendly games of ping pong and sing a song in sixpence
im none the richer i just kiss her on the lips and keep trucking

chorus
and at night i roam these streets with absolutely no purpose absolutely no purpose
feeling like im worthless feeling like im worthless
but contrary to my last statement i feel fine
content with the fact that i know this citys mine
and at night i roam these streets with absolutely no purpose absolutely no purpose
feeling like im worthless feeling like im worthless
but contrary to my last statement i feel fine
content with the fact that i know this citys mineembed"
