verse 1 slim jxmmi
ive done it before ive seen it before
tears splashin the floor when i open the door for her
she actin like a whore and ima let her
learned from project patta pimpin got a masters
girl improvise look me in my eyes and lie to me
lie to me act like ill believe anything
sex on the beach and in the backseat
this could be us but fuck it

chorus swae lee  jace
so back to what i was saying
money make the world go round
this could be us but youre playing
money make your girl go down
this could be us but youre playing
money make the world go round
im high hope i dont sound crazy
