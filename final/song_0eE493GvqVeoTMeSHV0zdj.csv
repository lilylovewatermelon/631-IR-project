verse 2 camron
i never had fights in rings i just had fight for rings
ice and bling i done spent nights in bings
now i realized christ the king
aint no righteous thing but how i get the right to sing
and the streets be talking like donahue
clowns they belong on comic view thats why the feds onto you
when they form they assemblys
you stuck on the block like the ave got parentheses
cause everybody got a war story shit
i swear to god i hear more and more stories damn
im in jersey the crib four stories
add a fifth one in case the fourth one bore me killa
i done ran through the nbcs

baguettes princess cuts diamond layers
and i never said im a player
but i been down with messy action
similar to jessie jackson regret what happen
ma kept resisting resisting
i had to bounce with my shipment im scared of commitment
im a hustler work in the closet
work in the kitchen outside working them pigeons
work on the block even put in work with the glock
work on the toilet ima workaholic
