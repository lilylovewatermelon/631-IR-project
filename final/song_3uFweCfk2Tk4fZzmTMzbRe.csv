cole you stupid

verse 1 jid
look you told me never let this get a hold of me
you hate to see me hurt you wanna hurt someone for me
way too down to earth dont do no dirt for me please
i dont need nobody else takin a deal or a plea
god knowin what im doin he gon deal with me
niggas aint cut like that shell kill for me
and i dont care if we dont speak for like a million weeks
you right there when i need you but i know these aint your kind of people
i finally bought a home to raise my family
im done with all the hoes and they anatomiеs
i tried to call your phone again you said it wasnt on
and by the timе you got my letter i was long gone

prechorus jid
back on the road gone with the wind blows
packin the shows hoes and the nymphos platinum and gold
you know how this shit go when familys gone
you dont know what you here for uh

chorus james blake  yuli
just remember remember who i am
mommies daughters models callers
ballers fathers all have fallen
mommies daughters models callers
ballers fathers all have fallen

look you said i shouldnt worry bout the fame
you seem to be concerned of what you heard about the game
cause soon as niggas get a little change niggas change
and playin with the lords name sayin it in vain
you heard this song and said i did the same thing
you seein somethin different in my eyes and she emphasized
and i aint get it at the time i couldnt listen
had to call her back line packed sold out tickets
im on the wrong track road back fuck it im hittin it
on the road ima bulldoze the globe for the dough
she know she happy that we doin better than before
as long as im sellin shows you aint sellin for your soul
i felt like she was yellin like azealia in that megaphone
said ima hit you in the mornin keep your message on
i did my set then sat alone for a second by myself
asked questions choices destination courses
highways routes royces rollin voices
goin on and on and on its noisy
im not the only one affected by the poison in the mind
and the lifestyle that shine from the icedout diamonds
that combine with misogynistic mindsets
dialect from slave diatribe they tryna dissect to redigest
i tossed that mindset overboard like an object
im tryna find a letter to the lord from the projects
cause when i was a boy i didnt know that we was poor
and now im on tour i got a moment to explore
and show my niggas somethin we aint never seen before
open doors so you know im goin
prechorus jid
back on the road gone with the wind blows
packin the shows hoes and the nymphos platinum and gold
you know how this shit go when familys gone
you dont know what you here for uh

chorus james blake  yuli
just remember remember who i am
mommies daughters models callers
ballers fathers all have fallen
mommies daughters models callers
ballers fathers all have fallen

bridge yuli
why do i get so damn high that i cant feel my face
try and try to free my mind but i cant find a way
why do i get so damn high that i cant feel my face
try and try to free my mind but i cant find a way

verse 3 jid
look i never gave that much a fuck about this shit
to let it challenge my integrity
but you questionin me got me thinkin you thinkin less of me
the lesson in this shit is we should talk face to face fuck the messagin
meet me in the flesh and you can see that im still lil destin
lil brubbie lil bb bald head as a baby in the huggies
stunt like my dad im a druggie
money in my hands but its bloody
try to understand if you love me ayy
make plans we can roll like the old days
facetime call came with a stonecold face
we dont talk often when we do its an are you okay
somebody fuckin with you im on the way
its on the waist i can tell the way you look that aint the case
figured you was mad at me when you said you need a break from the family
and you not participatin in no pagan holiday gatherings
and ever since i start rappin i aint never in atlanta too long
and i hate havin to only see the family when somethin bad happen
like when granny passed i aint wanna answer the phone
writin in my pad hope i dont remember this wrong
last time i seen you we was sendin her home
october november december was gone
but on the 25th we gotta be there for mom
im talkin to you now but can i see you tomorrow
i could be on the way soon as i finish this song
so you can see im still true in everything that i been doin
and i dont fuck with the devil but i know he pursuin
and i know that jesus died thirtythree like ewing
and he prolly did the same shit that we like doin
i know you got to feel the animosity brewin
its gettin bad and im sad our relationship ruined over some trash but its past that
send me all the money that i gave you over cashapp back since you actin as if you—
outro
were sorry you have reached a number that is— aw
thats fucked up thats fucked thats fucked man thats right5embed"
