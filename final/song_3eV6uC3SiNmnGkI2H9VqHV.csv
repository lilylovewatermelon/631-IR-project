you go for a walk in the park cause you dont need anything
the hand that you sometimes hold doesnt do anything
the face that you see in the door isnt standing there anymore

chorus
in a matter of time it would slip from my mind
in and out of my life you would slip from my mind
in a matter of time

verse 2
the face that you saw in the door isnt looking at you anymore
the name that you call in its place isnt waiting for your embrace
the world that you love to behold cannot hold you anymore

chorus
in a matter of time it will slip from my mind
in and out of my life you would slip from my mind
in a matter of time
outro
more you want more
more you want more
more you want more you tell me
more only time can run me
more you want more you tell me
more only time can run me
more you want more you tell me
more only time can run me
more you want more you tell me
more only time can run me
more you want more you tell me
more only time can run me
more you want more you tell me
more only time can run meyou might also like11embed"
