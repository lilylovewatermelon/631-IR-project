two young people without a thing
say some vows and spread their wings
and settle down with just what they need
livin on love
she dont care bout whats in style
she just likes the way he smiles
it takes more than marble and tile
livin on love

chorus
livin on love buyin on time
without somebody nothing aint worth a dime
just like an old fashion story book rhyme
livin on love
it sounds simple thats what youre thinkin
but love can walk through fire without blinkin
it doesnt take much when you get enough
livin on love

verse 2
two old people without a thing
children gone but still they sing
side by side in that front porch swing
livin on love
he cant see anymore
she can barely sweep the floor
hand in hand theyll walk through that door
just livin on love

livin on love buyin on time
without somebody nothing aint worth a dime
just like an old fashion story book rhyme
livin on love
it sounds simple thats what youre thinkin
but love can walk through fire without blinkin
it doesnt take much when you get enough
livin on love

chorus
livin on love buyin on time
without somebody nothing aint worth a dime
just like an old fashion story book rhyme
livin on love
but it sounds simple thats what youre thinkin
but love can walk through fire without blinkin
it doesnt take much when you get enough
livin on love
