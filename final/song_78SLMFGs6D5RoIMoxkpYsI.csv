verse 1 yung carecrow
grew up with them robbers them shottas
them hot boys on the block
i pop up with that ninemillimeter the heater
or the ether for any fuckboy who want it
night or the morning at any moment im known to flash out with the eyes of lucifer
im judas
plot with the red dot hot with the six shot
rot in the same pot opps gonna get dropped
docked in the same block rocks all in my sock
stocked with the same glock
mask on pop pop
and the devil all up in me when i murder with the semi
pull the trigger till its empty fuckboy dont tempt me
fuckboys all envy 59

verse 2 lil uzi
pull up with the glock cocked aim it at my head
shot popped now im dead with a hole full of lead
yung now got yo ho on a sled getting head in slomo
siren sounds here come the popo
oh no heard i got that work for the lowlow
dont tell em shit thats a nono
three little pigs im the big bad wolf
blood stained teeth and im covered in wool
huff and i puff on a blunt packed full
bricks aint shit
hit a lick on a bitch
hold em up with the dick
one shot in the mouth now she starting to drool
she blew me away now my blood starts to pool
grade a death like a shooting at a school
lay me to rest im okay with no breath
aint a fool i aint like the rest bitch i be hanging with ghouls

verse 3 pouya
yuh uh everybody wanna be ya homie
when you got your life intact
as i look around i realize that all of my opinions turn to facts
im burning bridges cause i wont communicate with a label that cant relate to me
myself and i you gotta tell i can tell that you lie
i need more bread—im not satisfied
satellite television is not enough
i pack out these shows
got hoes waiting right by the bus
just to get a chance to lick my nuts
outh ide uicide do or die who am i
got that 45 in my levis
i know this bitch wanna be mine
treat this bitch like a feline yuh ayy
outro evil pimp
