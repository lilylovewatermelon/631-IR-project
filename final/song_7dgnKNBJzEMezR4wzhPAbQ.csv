happy came to visit me he bought cookies on the way
i poured him tea and he told me itll all be okay
well i told him id do anything to have him stay with me
so he laid me down and i felt happy come inside of me
he laid me down and i felt happy

chorus
oh if youre going take the train
so i can hear it rumble one last rumble
and when you go take this heart
ill make no more use of it when theres no more you

verse 2
i was in the bathroom i didnt hear him leave
i locked the door behind him and i turned around to see
ooh all the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
well i sighed and mumbled to myself again i have to clean
i sighed and mumbled to myself

chorus
if youre going take the train
so i can hear it rumble one last rumble
and when you go take this heart
ill make no more use of it when theres no more you
and if youre going take the moon
then maybe i will see you in the night ill see you
and when you go take this heart
ill make no more use of it when theres no more you oohsee mitski liveget tickets as low as 39you might also like22embed"
