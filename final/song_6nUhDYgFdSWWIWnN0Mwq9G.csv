todays a day like any other
but im changed i am a mother
oh in an instant
and who i was has disappeared
it doesnt matter now youre here
so innocent

i was lost
for you to find
and now im yours and you are mine

two tiny hands a pair of eyes
an unsung melody is mine for safekeeping
and i will guard it with my life
id hang the moon for it to shine on her sleeping
starting here and starting now
i can feel the heart of how

jenna becky  dawn
everything changes

jenna
i didnt know but now i see
sometimes what is is meant to be
you saved me
my blurry lines my messy life
come into focus and in time maybe
you might also likei can heal and i can breathe
cause i can feel myself believe

all
everything changes

jenna  all
oh my hearts at the wheel now

jenna
and all my mistakes
they make sense when i turn them around
everything changes
what i thought was so permanent fades
in the blink of an eye theres a new life in front in my face
and i know in due time every right thing will find its right place
so i swear ill remember to say
we were both born today
cause everything changed
everything changesembed"
