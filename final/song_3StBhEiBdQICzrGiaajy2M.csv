verse 1
sittin up inside of the court hopin not to be judged by half of the choices i made
ridin in a doubler drank in my cup intentions aimed to kill all my pain
im runnin with killers im with em you diss еm then know to reclaim
came from thе bottom ran it up and i aint changed
go tell them niggas i dont owe them shit
ran off like assassin
got a hundred different ways for a nigga get rich
tryna stay on that my mind bent
did a jail bid where my time went
did a jail bid where my time went
got a brand new piece that shyne sent
got a brand new piece that shyne sent
hundred thou inside of my amiris
dirty money spent on prada i aint proud of
clean lean make a dirty bottle
solitaires lay around the collar
in the streets you just another body
casket real bright but its dark in it
future real bright but its war in it
real born killers that was taught in it
thinkin bout givin my maybach up startin to feel too regular
young nigga walkin with that fentanyl
get out of line we stretchin you
hatinass niggas aint keepin up
i aint spendin nothin still flexin
still ridin round in a foreign car
plenty of hoes big mansion

please dont get amazed by all these diamonds get you a plain jane
baby your love like cocaine tell em i want the whole thing
offwhite on my offseasons cant take no break we gon run this game
i hope that you been holdin me down that money came

verse 2
say you wan chill so i let you come kick it
blood everywhere cause this realdeal business
guns everywhere and im realdeal billin
tenthousand dollar fit ridin in a honda civic
she aint know what to do she had asked me to pick it
bought her everything it was nothin pecific
if you get distracted if you lack on a mission
wont ever do that im on top of my pivot
ima show you the value of love
but on top of that that patek gold value is plain
i feel like this metal protecting my life
its gon block that static thats all in the rain
hope money aint got you playin games
whats real aint gon never change

chorus
please dont get amazed by all these diamonds get you a plain jane
baby your love like cocaine tell em i want the whole thing
offwhite on my offseasons cant take no break we gon run this game
i hope that you been holdin me down that money came4embed"
