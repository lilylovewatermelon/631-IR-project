1Do9LBtcHSIqhnI5tA36yl,Every Wonder Why,Ryan Bingham,3R4SU0GLULP0QxIal7Fcr1,"2 contributorsevery wonder why lyricsif you ever see me walking down the side of the road
would you ever stop and wonder why
would you think its lost that i paid the cost
stop and give a poor boy a ride
and forget my past

cause if i ever get home im never gonna worry bout the things that i couldve done
cause ive done a lot of things i couldve done better
but now it dont matter none

ive raised my glass

cause i fell in love and then lost touch
i dropped it and broke her heart
i drove off a cliff
and i barely missed
walkin with her in the park

just a selfish boy

but i have not forgot that the food in the pot aint cookin for a boy like me
i been fightin all night with the dogs in the alley looking for a bone to eat
starving to death

everybodys troubled with your hustle and your bustle
the payment on the house is late
if i ever have a problem like that
i guess ill be in pretty good shape
see ryan bingham liveget tickets as low as 142you might also likeyou can kiss my ass goodbye

when i feel the wind blow
see a ghost in the road
and headlights are a beautiful sight

and out in the desert
i can sit under them heavens
and watch the sun keep settin for miles

and here comes another song

then i take a pen and a little piece of paper
i scribble on down the lines
and what youre hearing now
is something i found
hidin way down inside

the cellar of my heart

and i hope everybody had a real good time
i hope i didnt bring you down
these aint sad songs
so dont take em wrong
i havent been home in a while
well ill see you all aroundembed"
