i just made a project ho feel like she out of reach

mama super proud but she be scared i hear her voice
shit be hittin different when we count up had a choice
shit be lame but i aint tripping money built for— uh
said she want chanel that you cant see up in the stores
my baby sister older now she wanna be like her
shit be hittin different when your time to batter up
