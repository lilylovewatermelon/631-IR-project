i have seen peace
i have seen pain
resting on the shoulders of your name
do you see the truth through all their lies
do you see the world through troubled eyes

chorus
and if you want to talk about it anymore
lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder
im a friend

verse 2
i have seen birth
i have seen death
lived to see a lovers final breath
do you see my guilt
should i feel a fright
is the fire of hesitation burning bright

chorus
and if you want to talk about it once again
on you i depend
ill cry on your shoulder
youre a friend
see james blunt liveget tickets as low as 17you might also likebridge
you and i have lived through many things
ill hold on to your heart
i wouldnt cry for anything
but dont go tearing your life apart

verse 3
i have seen fear
i have seen faith
seen the look of anger on your face
and if you want to talk about what will be
come and sit with me and cry on my shoulder
im a friend

chorus
and if you want to talk about it anymore
lie here on the floor and cry on my shoulder
once again
cry on my shoulder
im a friend1embed"
