met you in a café
at a table meant for two
you were sitting by your lonesome
when i sat down with you
tried hard not to show it
but i couldn’t help but see
that you wore your broken heart out on your sleeve
and your loneliness could not disguise
the beauty and the charm
thought if i ever get you shattered lady in my arms

chorus
i’m going to rock you baby to sleep
i’m going to make you crazy over me
i’m going to hold you like you’ve never been held before
and love you till you tell me you can’t love anymore
i’m going to shake your emotion right down to your soul
and then i’m going to love you all over in and out of control
if this is how love is supposed to feel
baby i know i’ve fallen head over heels
i’m going to rock you baby

verse 2
over open conversation and a bottle of red wine
you said this world is full of users and i know that i’ve had mine
we danced a little slow dance until they closed that café down
you said ‘what would be the chances that tonight i finally found
someone who makes me feel like my life is just begun’
i said ‘girl believe in me and i’ll show you how it’s done’

and love you till you tell me you can’t love anymore
i’m going to shake your emotion right down to your soul
and then i’m going to love you all over in and out of control
if this is how love is supposed to feel
baby i know i’ve fallen head over heels
i’m going to rock you babyembed"
