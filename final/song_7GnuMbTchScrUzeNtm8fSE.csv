he pours the wine into his coffee cup
this jazz has dropped its time to pick it up
230 he rolls out of this brass at last
terence love is barking something crass

verse 2
each night a thousand stairs go up both ways
soul and color peeking through his sleeves
ms down at the coast its too late for buses run
slides into his headphones sleeps to solo monk

verse 3
success success his smile is saccharine
glamorous hes pouring panchos gin
lives his life a painful and lovely day
in the history of a great pregnancy

verse 4
squat public library checking out the trial
strolling to the pier to gather his thoughts
squat public library checking out the trial
hes talking to himself about it

outro
he dont get upset get upset
he cant sleep
hell have another cigarette and dont get upset
he dont get upset get upsetsee cold war kids liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likeembed"
