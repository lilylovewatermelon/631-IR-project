ive always said i could never fall

because i love em all

like wwwhat can i do because i cant control it
she got me hovering
above the ground and i dont know what to do

chorus tony oller

i could explode if i cant breathe you
im on the ropes 5432
cause youre the one i guess im done
thats how it goes
where will i be without you
yeah god only knows
