brown eyes and lungs are filled up with smoke
fast lives were stuck in the undertow
but you know the places i wanna go
cause oh oh oh
ive got a sickness youve got the cure
youve got the spark ive been lookin for
and ive got a plan we walk out the door

prechorus
you know you wanna
just let go
its time to roll down the windows
sing it oh oh
we got all we need so here we go

chorus
turn it up
its five minutes to midnight
youre coming home with me tonight
i cant get enough shakin me up turn it up
alright at five minutes to midnight
well see our name in city lights
well make the clock stop make your heart drop and come alive

verse 2
we could
pack up and leave all our things behind
no fact or fiction or storyline
cause i need you more than just for tonight
youre oh oh
like air i cant stop my breathing in
im weak and you were my medicine
i wont stop till i am under your skin
see boys like girls liveget tickets as low as 77you might also likeprechorus
you know you wanna
just let go
its time to roll down the windows
sing it oh oh

alright at five minutes to midnight
well see our name in city lights
well make the clock stop make your heart drop and come alive

bridge
and when the clock strikes twelve
will you find another boy to go and kiss and tell
cause you know i never will
i think we should strike a match
and well hold it to the wind to see how long it lasts
we could make the time stand still

chorus
turn it up
its five minutes to midnight
youre coming home with me tonight
i cant get enough shakin me up turn it up
alright at five minutes to midnight
