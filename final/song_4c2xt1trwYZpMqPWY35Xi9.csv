verse 2 drake  ty dolla ign
ayy told me about all your insecurities for what
dragged me like two hours to your familys house for what
said you need some time but i should stick around for what
always felt like stickin rounds the same as being stuck
and like guns with the ink in youre gettin under my skin
pretty little young thing young thing
had a nigga convinced got me too excited
yeah you played me you played me you played me
lowdown dirty shameful crazy
i need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
i do for a living but is way less wavy
how you even managin to keep straight faces
in all the pictures that i seen lately
lord knows you still look amazin
thats besides the point im makin
youre way too opinionated i have to force it to have to fake it
you had potential i coulda shaped it
you went and caved in ooh yeah
we coulda waited i wasnt rushin difference in ages
youre old enough but youre still a baby
youve shared stories where you did amazin
things to be loyal things to be patient
that was before me i musta changed it
shifted your focus lens lookin jaded jaded
