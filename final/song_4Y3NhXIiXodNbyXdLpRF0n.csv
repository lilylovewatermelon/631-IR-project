shshshakedown
its the start of something great now
here comes the shakedown

verse 1
ive had this image in my head
since i was just a little kid lost in daydreams
rusting out from all the sweat
but i can see myself for the first time so clearly

prechorus
oh i feel it
oh break through the ceiling
oh i need it
i wont stop cause i remember that feeling

chorus
all those nights alone
i faced my fears in the mirror
i found my way to show
who i am wont disappear
the scars from the fights that came through the years
are constant reminders of what got me here
all those nights alone
they were the start of something great now
here comes the shakedown

verse 2
its hard to count the times i bled
i never told myself that greatness comes easy
others break but i wont bend
it took the pain i see for the first time so clearly

prechorus
oh i feel it
oh break through the ceiling
oh i need it
i wont stop cause i remember that feeling

chorus
all those nights alone
i faced my fears in the mirror
i found my way to show
who i am wont disappear
the scars from the fights that came through the years
are constant reminders of what got me here
all those nights alone
they were the start of something great now
here comes the shakedown

sometimes we fall sometimes we break
sometimes were lost in all our mistakes

chorus
all those nights alone
i faced my fears in the mirror

who i am wont disappear
the scars from the fights that came through the years
are constant reminders of what got me here
