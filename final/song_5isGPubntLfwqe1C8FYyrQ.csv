i see through you i know what you are
ive seen the devil more than ive seen god
i see through you i know what you are
ive seen the devil more than ive seen god

verse 1
cover your ears and shut your eyes
cause what im about to say is gonna ruin your night
this is a callout and im not scared to drop some names
youve dug your grave and you have no one but yourself to blame
i see the world in black and white
because true color always fades under the right lights

chorus
i see through you i know what you are
ive seen the devil more than ive seen god
and when he has you by your neck
i hope you choke on every fucking word you said

verse 2
youve run out of luck and im calling your bluff
you stabbed me in the back but not deep enough
but not deep enough
i see through you
see bad omens liveget tickets as low as 48you might also likechorus
i see through you i know what you are
ive seen the devil more than ive seen god
and when he has you by your neck
i hope you choke on every fucking word you said
i see through you i know what you are
ive seen the devil more than ive seen god
and when he has you by your neck
i hope you choke on every fucking word you said

bridge
you said id never make it you said id fall on my face
but now im right where i belong and i put you in your place
you said id never make it you said id make a mistake
but now im right where i belong and youve got nothing to say

chorus
i see through you i know what you are
ive seen the devil more than ive seen god
and when he has you by your neck
i hope you choke on every fucking word you said
i see through you i know what you are
ive seen the devil more than ive seen god
and when he has you by your neck
i hope you choke on every fucking word you said
