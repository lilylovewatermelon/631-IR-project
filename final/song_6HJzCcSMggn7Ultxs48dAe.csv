drink down that gin and kerosene
come spit on bridges with me
just to keep us warm
light a match to leave me be

cause its all mine
and if you say this makes you happy then im not the only one

can i lay in your bed all day
ill be your bestkept secret and your biggest mistake
hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday

prechorus
i keep my jealousy close
cause its all mine
and if you say this makes you happy then im not the only one
