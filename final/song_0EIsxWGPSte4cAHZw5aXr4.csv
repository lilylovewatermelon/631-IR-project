and i hate it i thought we could make it

im so foolish play me like im stupid

visions in my mind of the day that we met
you showed me things that ill never forget
took me swimmin in the ocean
you had my head up in the clouds

nobody else can do it quite like i do
all my kisses kisses and my lovin and my lovin
but aint nobody better than us yeah yeah

i wish that you could hold me when im lonely
when i need someone to talk to you would phone me
just like everything you told me
