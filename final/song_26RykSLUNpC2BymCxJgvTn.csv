if i threw my body out the window
brain all splattered guts all steaming in the snow
i wouldnt have to finish shooting films
that no one wants to show
rent

roger
if i studied something that paid a salary
wouldnt have to do the shit i do for cash
my guts all steaming fuck this dreaming
speed metal rocks songs for the trash

mark
the wheels arent turning

roger
its worthy of burning

mark  roger
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
last months rent

roger
if i took a hammer tapped my forehead
wouldnt have to wake and stagger through the week
or hear a boring grinning whoring brainless dull producer speak
rent
you might also likemark

if i slid the bars back
hurled my body through the cracked glass
on some crackheads cardboard bed
maureen could kick my frozen frame
shout my name and then drop dead

roger
shes got a new man
whats his name

mark
joanne

mark  roger
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
how we gonna pay
last months rentembed"
