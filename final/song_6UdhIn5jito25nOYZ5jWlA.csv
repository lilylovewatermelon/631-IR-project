wake up everyone
how can you sleep at a time like this
unless the dreamer is the real you
listen to your voice
the one that tells you to taste past the tip of your tongue
leap and the net will appear

the dream is over
im gonna make it mine
yes i ill know it
im gonna make it mine

i keep my life on a heavy rotation
requesting that its lifting you up
up up and away
and over to a table at the gratitude café

and all the angels theyll be singing
