uhh come on

verse 1
got on my smell good got a bottle of feel good
shinin my wheels good youre lookin real good
take a stack of cash out im bout to blast out
til i run the gas out im goin all out
all i want to see is you have a good time
no i dont care if it takes me all night

chorus
ill give anything to see you look that way
give me that little love on your pretty face
all im waitin is for is for you to just
lay your pretty head on my shoulder
for a while and find your jam on my radio dial
girl all i want is just to see you smile
that pretty little smile

verse 2
ill take you out there in the middle of nowhere
let down your blonde hair breathe in that midnight air
girl we can take a trip to the river and take a sip
do a little back flip and kiss kiss kiss your lips
