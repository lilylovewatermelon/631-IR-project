i never believed in dreamin
it never got me very far
i never believed that love could find me
like an arrow through the heart
i never believed in miracles
or building castles in the air
not until that day i found you
turned around and you were there

from the day you came
you gave me a whole new point of view
ive been touched by an angel
its impossible but true

verse 2 justin timberlake with chris kirkpatrick
i never believed in fairytales
though sometimes i wish i could
i never believed that golden slippers
could ever find the perfect foot
i never believed in magic
or that wishes could true
but your very first kiss changed all this
something only you could do
