baby when you fought me at the door
kinda hard to force whats natural
maybe you dont want what you need most
is it crazy im not scared to be alone

postchorus
now i barely need ya
do what you do best and be alone
gotta tell him rest in peace
bet you thought id die alone
it dont make sense to me
but i keep my head up high alone
you aint even there for me
but now youre scared to be alone

verse 1
too many drinks to think about you
i had too many thoughts to let you wander
now youre an afterthought i lost ya
and now you want me babe
you want me but its bye
givin mе reasons to fly
pack up my shit and be wise
jump in thе ride
hit up my dude on the side
like look what you threw to the side
you get the vibe
either we fuck or we fight
but i got the feelin youre right
im out my mind
doesnt make sense when i cry
if we cant make up least we try

baby when you fought me at the door fought me at the door
kinda hard to force whats natural oh oh oh
maybe you dont want what you need most oh oh oh
is it crazy im not scared to be alone yeah

verse 2
i aint wanna share my dreams when it involves you
not the man i need yeah
started feelin like i failed my team
missin gigs for you bet you never felt like me
different levels to the game thats fast
spendin bands last week while your ass act cheap yeah
lonely at the top while your ass miles deep
got me thinkin that you scared of yourself not me
impossible from a prius to gold carriages
middle finger to you so you see what a whole karat is
i need a answer a reader of more tarots
you couldnt tell that the both of us needed a whole therapist
i made you fam when i greeted your whole parents
but later i realized they aint teach you what no sharin is
i know you hearin this i know you scared of it
but bein lonely better than needs control cherish it

chorus
baby when you fought me at the door fought me at the door
kinda hard to force whats natural oh oh oh
maybe you dont want what you need most oh oh oh

but now youre scared to be alone
alone
now you scared to be alone30embed"
