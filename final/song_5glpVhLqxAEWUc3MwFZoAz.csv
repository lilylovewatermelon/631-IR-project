oh my friend dont get caught in yesterday
all the things weve heard have left and made their way
lower your guns even if love has turned to spite
we may find the enemy waiting inside
light the candle to see what may unfold
if you listen to the sound within your mind
you may find your answer flowing in the tide

chorus
say goodbye to your sorrow and hello to tomorrow
well i hear the fiddlers call say that love is here for all
so i wrote her a letter and i tried to forget her
well i dont know if ill go can you hear the river flow
say goodbye to your sorrow and hello to tomorrow
well i hear the fiddlers call so say that love is here for all

verse 2
lower your guns even if love turns to spite
we may find the enemy waiting inside
light the candle to see what may unfold
oh my friend i hope youre done with yesterday
all the things weve heard have left and made their way

chorus
say goodbye to your sorrow and hello to tomorrow
well i hear the fiddlers call say that love is here for all
so i wrote her a letter and i tried to forget her
well i dont know if ill go can you hear the river flow
say goodbye to your sorrow and hello to tomorrow
well i hear the fiddlers call say that love is here for all
say that love is here for all say that love is here for all
say that love is here for all say that love is here for all
