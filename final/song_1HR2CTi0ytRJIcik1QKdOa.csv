lately ive been hard to reach
ive been too long on my own
everybody has a private world where they can be alone
are you calling me
are you tryin to get through
are you reaching out for me
im reaching out for you

verse 1 eminem
im just so fucking depressed
i just cant seem to get out this slump
if i could just get over this hump
but i need something to pull me out this dump
i took my bruises took my lumps
fell down then i got right back up
but i need that spark to get psyched back up
in order for me to pick the mic back up
i dont know how or why or when
i ended up in this position im in
im starting to feel distant again
so i decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt
to vent but i just cant admit
or come to grips with the fact that
i may be done with rap i need a new outlet
and i know some shits so hard to swallow
but i just cant sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow but i know one fact
ill be one tough act to follow
one tough act to follow
ill be one tough act to follow
here today gone tomorrow
but youd have to walk a thousand miles—

in my shoes just to see
what its like to be me
ill be you lets trade shoes
just to see what itd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine
go inside each others minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each others eyes

chorus eminem
but dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you so
dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you so

verse 2 eminem
i think im startin to lose my sense of humor
everythings so tense and gloom
i almost feel like i gotta check the temperature
of the room just as soon as
i walk in its like all eyes on me
so i try to avoid any eye contact
cause if i do that then it opens a door
for conversation like i want that
im not lookin for extra attention
i just wanna be just like you
blend in with the rest of the room
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
i dont need no fuckin man servant
tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
laugh at every single joke i crack
and half of em aint even funny like ha
marshall youre so funny man
you should be a comedian goddamn
unfortunately i am
i just hide behind the tears of a clown
so why dont you all sit down
listen to the tale im about to tell
hell we dont gotta trade our shoes
and you aint gotta walk no thousand miles—
prechorus eminem
in my shoes just to see
what its like to be me
ill be you lets trade shoes
just to see what itd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine
go inside each others minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each others eyes

chorus eminem
but dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you so
dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you so
verse 3 eminem
nobody asked for life to deal us
with these bullshit hands were dealt
we gotta take these cards ourselves
and flip em dont expect no help
now i couldve either just sat
on my ass and pissed and moaned
or take this situation in which im placed in
and get up and get my own
i was never the type of kid
to wait by the door and pack his bags
and sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
for a dad to show up who never did
i just wanted to fit in
in every single place every school i went
i dreamed of being that cool kid
even if it meant actin stupid
aunt edna always told me
keep making that face itll get stuck like that
meanwhile im just standin there
holdin my tongue tryin to talk like this
til i stuck my tongue on that frozen
stop sign pole at eightyearsold
i learned my lesson then cause i wasnt
tryin to impress my friends no mo
but i already told you my whole life story
not just based on my description
cause where you see it from where youre sittin
its probably a 110 different
i guess we would have to walk a
mile in each others shoes at least
what size you wear i wear 10s
lets see if you can fit your feet—
prechorus eminem
in my shoes just to see
what its like to be me
ill be you lets trade shoes
just to see what itd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine
go inside each others minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each others eyes

chorus eminem
but dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you so
dont let em say you aint beautiful oh
they can all get fucked just stay true to you so

bridge paul rodgers eminem
