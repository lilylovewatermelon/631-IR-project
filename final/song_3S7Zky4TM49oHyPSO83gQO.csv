not feeling not nothing good intentions but jealousy takes over
all excuses abuses this time i know its not over
so i take all my pride and i shove it back down inside
this time harassments gone too far

chorus
get away from me
stay the fuck away from me
get away from me
stay the fuck away from me
get away from me
stay the fuck away from me
get away from me
stay the fuck away from me

you ruined my life
kill me now and burn my soul

chorus
get away from me
stay the fuck away from me
get away from me
stay the fuck away from me
get away from me
stay the fuck away from me
get away from me
stay the fuck away from me
