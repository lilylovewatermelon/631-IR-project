heavens sake everyone
for standing in my way
ruining all my fun
you say youre doing it for my sake
i thought i did my best
it was nearly good enough
but all that effort i guess
it didnt add up to very much

prechorus
it hurts me when you call
i hear the way youre thinking
i couldve so easily had it all

chorus
i couldve have had everything
i couldve have had everything
this perfect life im in
screwing myself over
i couldve had everything
i shouldve had everything
you almost got me thinking
im screwing myself over
screwing myself over

they say that madness is doin a thing the same way
you hope its gonna turn out different
but youre doing it anyway
i guess its what i did with you
but at least i have a reason
so my apologies
wont go to anyone

prechorus
it hurts me when you say
that all my close friends hate me
i really thought i had it all

chorus
i couldve had everything
i couldve had everything
its the perfect life im in
screwing myself over
i couldve have had everything
i shouldve had everything
you almost got me thinking
im screwing myself over

bridge
i coulda i coulda i coulda i coulda i coulda had everything
i coulda i coulda i coulda i coulda i coulda had everything
i came so near to thinking i had something
to learn
chorus
i couldve had everything
i couldve had everything
its the perfect life im in
screwing myself over
couldve had everything
i shouldve had everything
you almost got me thinking
im screwing myself over
couldve had everything
i shouldve had everything
its the perfect life im in
screwing myself over
i couldve had everything
i shouldve had everything
you almost got me thinking
im screwing myself over
im screwing myself overembed"
