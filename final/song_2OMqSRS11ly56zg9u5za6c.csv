so am i still waiting
for this world to stop hating
cant find a good reason
cant find hope to believe in

verse 1
drop dead
a bullet to my head
your words are like a gun in hand
you cant change the state of the nation
we just need some motivation
these eyes
have seen no conviction
just lies and more contradiction
so tell me what would you say
id say its up to me

chorus
so am i still waiting
for this world to stop hating
cant find a good reason
cant find hope to believe in

verse 2
ignorance
and understanding
were the first ones to jump in line
out of step for what we believe in
but whos left to stop the bleeding
how far
will we take this
its not hard to see through the fakeness
so tell me what would you say
id say its up to me

so am i still waiting
for this world to stop hating
cant find a good reason
cant find hope to believe

bridge
this cant last forever
time wont make things better
i feel so alone
cant help myself
and no one knows
if this
is worthless
tell me tell me tell me
so
what have we done
with a war that cant be won
this cant be real
cause i dont know what to feel no

chorus
so am i still waiting
for this world to stop hating
cant find a good reason
cant find hope to believe
so am i still waiting
for this world to stop hating
cant find a good reason
for this world to believe15embed"
