and i say thank you mr ceo

chorus 1
i filled my pockets now i might as well die
cause i found the backdoor out of teenage hell all right
filed my account cause i might in fact die
but i rely on science yeah to bring me back all right
im gonna die
heavy morals seem so light
but when it comes to cash im gonna die all right

verse 3

too messed up to even mess around
