hoverin by my suitcase
tryin to find a warm place to spend the night
a heavy rain is fallin
seems i hear your voice callin its all right

chorus
rainy night in georgia
rainy night in georgia
i believe its rainin all over the world
i believe its rainin all over the world

verse 2
neon signs flashin
taxi cabs and buses passin through the night
the distant moanin of a train
seems to play a sad refrain to the night

chorus
rainy night in georgia
rainy night in georgia
i believe its rainin all over the world
seems like its rainin all over the world

verse 3
how many times ive wondered
and it still comes out the same
no matter how you look at it or think of it
its life and you just gotta play the game
see chris young liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likeverse 4
i find me a place in a box car
so i take out this old guitar to pass some time
late at night when its hard to rest
i hold your picture to my chest and im alright

chorus
rainy night in georgia
rainy night in georgia
i believe its rainin all over the world
yeah i believe its rainin all over the worldembed"
