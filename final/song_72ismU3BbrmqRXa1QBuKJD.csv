i have wandered far and wide
for something real some thing to die for
but i have found you and you do not see
all that is me all that is true

chorus
i am more than you will see
i am more than you will need
i am more than you will see
more than wanted

verse 2
as you float the flimsy surface
you should know life lies beneath it
and dont pretend you feel what i feel
you live illusion and im real

chorus
i am more than you will see
i am more than you will need
i am more than you will see
more than wanted

verse 3
i know i know
you like the way you feel
when i play
i know i know
you dont really hear
what i say
i know i know
you are waiting
for something to raid
i know i know
you wish you could be
more than you say
i have wandered far and wide
for something real some thing to die for
but i have found you and you do not see
all that is me all that is true

more than wanted
i am more than you will see
i am more than you will need
i am more than you will see

more than youll love
more than youll hate
more than youll hold
more than wanted
more than youll crave
more than youll cherish
more than youll have
