i couldnt help but notice you were sitting by yourself
dropping limes in a corona like youre trying to get over somebody else
its funny how your story sounds a little like mine
oh cause ive been at a table with a bottle peeling labels to pass the time

prechorus
we can be blue as a neon light
singing them sad love songs all night
we can say goodbye just head home
but if were gonna be alone

chorus
we should be alone together
kissing over there in the corner
where nobody else can see
keeping each other company
we should be alone together
leaning up against my car door
parked outside on the street
where its just you and me
we should be alone together

verse 2
i couldnt help but notice
you could use another drink
yeah i dont wanna leave ya
and its two for one tequila so what you think
see dan  shay liveget tickets as low as 12you might also likeprechorus
we can be blue as a neon light
singing them sad love songs all night
we can say goodbye just head home
but if were gonna be alone

chorus
we should be alone together
kissing over there in the corner
where nobody else can see
keeping each other company
we should be alone together
leaning up against my car door
parked outside on the street
where its just you and me
we should be alone together
we should be alone together
we should be alone together oh yeah

bridge
we should be alone together
over there in the corner where nobody else can see

chorus
we should be alone together
kissing over there in the corner
where nobody else can see
keeping each other company
we should be alone together
leaning up against my car door
parked outside on the street
where its just you and me
we should be alone together
we should be alone together
we should be alone together oh yeah
we should be alone together1embed"
