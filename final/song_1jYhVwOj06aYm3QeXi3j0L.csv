set me off like dynamite strapped tight around my waist
we are the ones in competition but claim this aint no race
lets go
take a breath and explode like bullets tearing through the wind
cut me up with a razor blade that tries to separate the skin
now in the
white flames of burning flags we
found a world worth dying for yeah
weve been battered so hard that we dont feel anymore

chorus
take me
from this world
save me
what if we all die young
so take me
from this world
save me
what if we all die young

verse 2
send me off on the morning breeze so far away from here
feel me rise in the strength ive found inside the warm embracing air
im moving slow
like a glacier melting watch me dissipate
i searched for love in an empty world but all i found was hate
now in the
white flames of burning flags we
found a world worth dying for yeah
weve been battered so hard that we dont feel anymore

verse 3
dont ask me why
cause i dont know
dont ask me how
im gonna solve this on my own
dont ask me why
cause i dont know
these things ive never faced
scratch out but wont erase
in the wreckage of a job well done
i saw a place id never seen before yeah
and that moment i refused to close my eyes anymore

chorus
so take me
from this world
save me
what if we all die young
so take me
from this world
save me
what if we all die young
