give me thorns with my rose
i want everything
when you laugh when you cry
if youre sober or high
i want everything

give me love or hate
you can bend me til i break
give me fire give me rain
i want joy with my pain
i want your fears your hopes
the whole kaleidoscope

with you with you
our colours come alive when i collide
with you with you
our colours come alive when i collide
with you oh oh ooh yeah

give me nothing give me faith
i want give with my take
i want everything
give me life give me death
or your biggest regrets
i want everything

ill take whatevers left of your heart
give me heaven give me hell
all the dreams you try to sell
i want your fears your hopes
the whole kaleidoscope

with you with you
our colours come alive when i collide
with you with you
our colours come alive when i collide
with you oh oh ooh yeah

without you its shadows the nights black pitch
when theres a hundred thousand light bulbs but there aint no switch
living in darkness fearin the night
oh what a feeling when i see that light

with you with you
our colours come alive when i collide
with you with you
our colours come alive when i collide
with you oh oh ooh yeahembed"
