time on your side that will never end
the most beautiful thing you can ever spend
but you work in a shirt with your nametag on it
drifting apart like a plate tectonic

refrain

was a million miles from here
somewhere more familiar

settling down in your early twenties

refrain
it dont matter to me
cause all i wanted to be

somewhere more familiar

and oh my god i cant believe it
ive never been this far away from home
and oh my god i cant believe it
ive never been this far away from home
