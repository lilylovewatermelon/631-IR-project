shes always living like shes running out of time
too much just aint enough to keep her satisfied
her plastic card is filled with nothing comes to mind
its now her occupation and shes overqualified

prechorus
the looks are always so deceiving
the truth is always misconstrued to you

chorus
too much too soon
too little and now youre coming unglued
too much too soon
too late and now it sucks to be you
too much too soon
too late and now it sucks to be you too

verse 2
hes talking shit about how it was better way back when
he lives every waking moment as a means to an end
we are we are but im not i never used to be
so god bless your fucking past and to hell with your glory

prechorus
the looks are always so deceiving
the truth is always misconstrued to you

too much too soon
too little and now youre coming unglued
too much too soon
too late and now it sucks to be you
too much too soon
too late and now it sucks to be you too

she packs her bags this is goodbye so bon voyage
farewell see you in hell i hope you rest in pieces

prechorus
the looks are always so deceiving
the truth is always misconstrued to you

chorus

too little and now youre coming unglued

too late and now it sucks to be you too6embed"
