chorus gunna
jumped in that benz then i peeled off
brought out a ten ima spend it all
i need some pills and some seals dawg
fuck the cops we got our own laws
need to free my dawg hes locked behind the walls
numb to the pain i cant feel shit at all

verse 1 gunna
blew a ten
on a wednesday stack these bands
heard you rent wasnt paid need a lend
just like fritolay ima feed my friends
got white like nicky barnes cop these two door foreigns
my bitch cant be borin nah ice on both my arms
dont approach im armed flawless diamond charm
all my spots alarmed big house feel like a dorm
its on the north young gunna dont love no whore
i came with the wave no shore my voice a little hoarse
im whippin around in a porsche im ballin outside of the court
never knew i could make it in sports

verse 2 lil baby  gunna
jumped in and i went far my new girl super large
paid cash for all my cars protected but im raw
addicted to the awe me and gunna double r
rich rollin im a star dont take shots from the bar
but im ballin like lavar
i put drip all in my lingo i went crazy
louis supreme jean jacket for my baby
my kid a walking lick i put vvs on his neck
fucked my sidepiece some new breasts
fresh off of high speed in that vette
i cant stop cant miss this shit you know im never late
bought a penthouse at the top so i can meditate
on top now cause im up i gotta elevate
worth a million five for real so i accept the hate

chorus gunna  lil baby
jumped in that benz then i peeled off
brought out a ten ima spend it all
i need some pills and some seals dawg
fuck the cops we got our own laws
need to free my dawg hes locked behind the walls
numb to the pain i cant feel shit at all
im on these percs i cant feel shit at all3embed"
