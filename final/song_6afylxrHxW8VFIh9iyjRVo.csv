you tellin me you sprung well im sprung too
only think bad about it is im sprung for you
i aint throwin in your face what ive done for you
but i have visions to see us on a honeymoon
damn right im on my way to the crib
i have no means to tellin you how i feel cuz its all done now
all your clothes and your shoes bout to get thrown out
all your tires bout to get blown out
i feel bad cuz you think its easy
you told me a year and 2 months ago you would never leave me
but now its like you hate to see me
i remember the first day you couldnt wait to see me
but now you wanna take everything and leave
but what happened to the love that you had for me
you said you would marry me
its too bad cuz im sprung

out to get me
