verse 1
come on down and see the idiot right here
too fucked to beg and not afraid to care
whats the matter with calamity anyway
right get the fuck outta my face
understand i cant feel anything
it isnt like i wanna sift through the decay
i feel like a wound like i got a fuckin gun against my head
you live when im dead

refrain

verse 2
everybody hates me now so fuck it
bloods on my face and my hands
and i dont know why im not afraid to cry
but thats none of your business
whose life is it get it see it feel it eat it
spin it around so i can spit in its face
i wanna leave without a trace
