verse 3 twista
first i tell her that like im a veteran when she sleeping with me
then ima tell her that i get it wet if i let her get freaky with me
you could be telling whatever you want verbally or with your body
either which way i want to get with you so come creeping with me
through the corridors of the hotel on the way to the suite
look at your physique go head start it off
room or kitchen cause it aint that far to walk
dont be tripping take that ferrogamo off
look at you naked just for a second then take off my clothes
then go to the bed then lay on my back
cause i heard you be the shit so come show me what you can do
with the dick i lick on that pussy all up in the crack
how we be on each other we got an energy ugh
the way we freak on each other we got a chemistry what
i have you kiss on my body and have you licking me oh
