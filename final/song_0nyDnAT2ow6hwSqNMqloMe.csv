every time i end up breaking you
you change into something worth keeping
every time im close to saving you
you grow into a sin worth believing
youre everything i ever wanted but
its never enough youre never enough

prechorus
ill take
whatever i can take
whenever i can take it
if it ever comes

chorus
i hate you when youre gone
i hate you turn me on
i hate the way i need you when i dont know where you are
i love it even more when i find you on the floor
i know you think you hate me
but i will always hate you more

verse 2
i never knew until i got a taste
what a waste for what i have been through
cause nothing ever really makes that change
im so ashamed of what i did to you
i had to let you in to feel that rush
you were too much way too much

ill take
whatever i can take
whenever i can take it
if it ever comes
i hate you when youre gone
i hate you turn me on
i hate the way i need you when i dont know where you are
i love it even more when i find you on the floor
i know you think you hate me
but i will always hate you more

bridge
i never knew until i got a taste
im so ashamed of what i did to you

chorus
i hate you when youre gone
i hate you turn me on
i hate the way i need you when i dont know where you are
i love it even more when i find you on the floor
i know you think you hate me
but i will always
i hate you when youre gone
i hate you turn me on
i hate the way i need you when i dont know where you are
i love it even more when i find you on the floor
i know you think you hate me
but i will always hate you moreembed"
