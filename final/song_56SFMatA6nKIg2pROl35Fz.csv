you plowed over me like a tractor
you used me up and put me out to pasture
im left to eat your dust
guess youre thinking that we must be done
you said you got my back every minute
well you do
youve got it there to put your dagger in it
and knowing what i need
still you stood and watched me bleed

chorus
wounded im wounded
im battered and broken and bruised
wounded im wounded
all tore up inside over you
wondering why you do me like you do

verse 2
i feel betrayed and so manipulated
i call a spade a spade you call me jaded
well what do you expect
you give me no respect

chorus
wounded im wounded
im battered and broken and bruised
wounded im wounded
all tore up inside over you
wondering why you do me like you do
you might also likebridge
and this monkey on my back
has stopped me in my tracks

chorus
wounded im wounded
im battered and broken and bruised
wounded im wounded
all tore up inside over you
wondering why you do me like you doembed"
