got a pit in my stomach so tight
wish i never had a blast that night
i can hear em through the walls for me
try to run but they always find me
all in all this is all i can take
when i fell it was my first mistake but
brokenhearted mustve wilted
cause everythings all tilted

chorus
i keep a little place in the back of my mind
i take a little trip when they use up my line
but as soon as i can ill find another reason again

verse 2
hang around like a head on a leash
keep it all just a little out of arms reach
i can hear em through the walls for me
try to run but they always find me
now i know why i cant go in
all the blurs have a different set of keys again but
brokenhearted mustve wilted
cause everythings all tilted

chorus 1
i keep a little place in the back of my mind
i take a little trip when they use up my line
but as soon as i can ill find another reason again
i keep a little place in the back of my mind
i take a little trip when they use up my line
but as soon as i can ill find another reason again

oh you dont wanna hurt me
you dont wanna hurt me
you dont wanna hurt me anymore
bring it on one time

verse 3
im the one with the skeleton face
im the one with the full nine disgrace
and i can hear em through the walls for me
try to run but they always find me
i never wanted it to end this way
i wish i had a little more to say but
brokenhearted mustve wilted
cause everythings all tilted

chorus 1
i keep a little place in the back of my mind
i take a little trip when they use up my line
but as soon as i can ill find another reason again
i keep a little place in the back of my mind
i take a little trip when they use up my line
but as soon as i can ill find another reason again

chorus 2
oh you dont wanna hurt me
you dont wanna hurt me
you dont wanna hurt me anymore
bring it on one time
outro
take it away
oh take it away
again again again1embed"
