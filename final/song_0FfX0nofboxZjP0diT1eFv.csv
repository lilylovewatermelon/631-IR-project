took your heart took your hand
promise you all that i had
hopin that you understand
far from a perfect man

refrain
cause honey its been a hard year
it seem like were goin nowhere
cryin inside your bedroom
baby i know its not fair

interlude
lay with me for one more night
i promise you ill make it right

chorus
ill make it up to you you you
every night ill make it up to you you you
every night ill make it up to you

verse 2
i know you dont understand
the vices that follow a man
and in your eyes i can see
the places that youd rather be
see imagine dragons liveget tickets as low as 120you might also likerefrain
cause honey its been a hard year
it seem like were goin nowhere
youre cryin inside your bedroom
baby i know its not fair

chorus
ill make it up to you you you
every night ill make it up to you you you

bridge
in our darkest hour
in the dead of the night
ill make it up to you
your hands are mine
ill make it up to you
promises are nothing more
than fleetin thoughts
but you you are my lifeblood

chorus
ill make it up to you
every night ill make it up to you
every night ill make it up to you you you
every night ill make it up to you you you
every night ill make it up to you you you
every night ill make it up to you14embed"
