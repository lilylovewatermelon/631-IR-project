i left montgomery on north 65
i was restless and ready to give nashville a try
i rolled into town with a sound of my own
somewhere between jennings and jones

verse 2
well the day job i landed felt just like a jail
i couldnt seem to break out with that hammer and nails
and i spent all my nights in some old honky tonk
somewhere between jennings and jones

chorus
hangin out in the bars with the drunks and the stars
i found a few good ol boys just like me
started burnin our candles both ends and the middle
a bunch of roarin outlaws at high speed

postchorus
and they said that the end of that road i was on
was somewhere between jennings and jones

verse 3
well some record executives found me one night
i was singin halflit they said it sounded just right right
put my name on an album but they shelved all my songs
said i was somewhere between jennings and jones

was somewhere between jennings and jones

outro
now to find me in a record store wont take you long
im right there between jennings and jonesembed"
