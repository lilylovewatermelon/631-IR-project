when you left the other night i didnt think id see you again
it was a hell of a fight it felt like it was the end
you broke down we broke up and we were sayin it was over
but here i am now with your head on my shoulder

chorus
if tellin each other goodbye is gonna lead to a long slow kiss
and if you tearin out my drive is gonna get us makin love like this
cause its crazy to think that yesterday we werent even talkin
if this is how its gonna be
then baby maybe we should break up more often

verse 2
you left the charger by the bed
and that jacket that you always wore
so i shot you that text said theyre sittin outside on the porch
but last night you showed up i saw you standin there at my door
now that dress you had on is layin on my floor

chorus
if tellin each other goodbye is gonna lead to a long slow kiss
and if you tearin out my drive is gonna get us makin love like this
cause its crazy to think that yesterday we werent even talkin
if this is how its gonna be
then baby maybe we should break up more often
see riley green liveget tickets as low as 7you might also likebridge
and i dont even know what the fight was even over
but look us now girl weve never been closer

chorus
if tellin each other goodbye is gonna lead to a long slow kiss
if you tearin out my drive is gonna get us makin love like this
cause its crazy to think that yesterday we werent even talkin
if this is how its gonna be
then baby maybe we should break up more often
lets break up more oftenembed"
