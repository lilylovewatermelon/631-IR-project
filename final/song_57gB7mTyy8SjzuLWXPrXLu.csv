long stem things of beauty
created by the good lord
cut down in the prime of their lives
boxed up wrapped in paper
delivered to your front door
just to wind up in your garbage can outside

chorus
tell me how many flowers have to die
before you give this love another try
ive asked you to forgive me at least 9 dozen times
tell me how many flowers have to die

verse 2
im crazy and im desperate
i had you and i blew it
and right now ive got nothing left to lose
ive got a visa in my wallet
and im not afraid to use it
how long the needless violence lasts
is really up to you

chorus

verse 3
stop the senseless killing
cant you hear the roses cry
baby how many flowers have to die
tell me how many flowers have to diesee brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeembed"
