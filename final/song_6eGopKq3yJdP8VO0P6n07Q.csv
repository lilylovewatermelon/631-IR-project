seventeen seconds and im over it
ready for the disconnect
putting on a brave face trying not to listen
to the voices in the back of my head

prechorus
but its alright now its a distant memory baby
alright now you know you should just let it go
some feelings have a habit of persisting
even though you wouldnt let it show

chorus
wearing me out all this
hanging around it just starts
getting me down til im just
looking for an easy way out

verse 2
braindead from boredom im led to distractions
scratching the surface of life
nothing really happens but its easy to keep busy
when you tell yourself youre traveling right

prechorus
but its alright now was it really worth it baby
alright now is it just a waste of time
keep on second guessing
use my memory like a weapon on everything i try

wearing me out all this
hanging around it just starts
getting me down til im just
looking for an easy way out
wearing me out but its all right now
hanging around all right now
getting me down but its all right now
looking for an easy way out5embed"
