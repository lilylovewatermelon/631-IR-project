verse 1
when i was six years old i kinda wet the bed
my stepdad came in and nearly beat me to death
all bruised and broken i was lonely and scared
my mom she was working there was nobody there
my nana showed up she was super protective
had a tear in her eye she saw how i was neglected
the crazy part about it shes a straightup detective
but you never wouldve guessed it how shed cook you a breakfast
three weeks later she had him locked in a cell
now im seven years old with a story to tell
sing it

chorus
im gonna let it go learning learning
forgiveness is something we gotta know learning learning
cause if you hold on forever itll hurt your soul
thats why im learning how to let it go learning learning
thats why im learning how to let it go

verse 2
now middle schools here a new chapter in life

getting looked down on just because of your skin
its bad enough i cant afford them clothes
got high waters on with holes in my sole
