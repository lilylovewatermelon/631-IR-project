dive in take a breath
blow the smoke through the hole in my chest
still choking on the bed
found your waste while the ember red
keeps falling down and burning holes
until the pillow and the mattress glow
now i wanna be the tattoo ink
that swims down through the needle in your skin
and i wish i was poisonous
like a bottomless sound like a violent drug
do you remember the knife i kept
the sharper it got the more you wanted me to use it
i was lying to you oh but you were lying too
so whats left to do
whats left to say
stop making friends just us
ill decompose with you
so light the fuse inside your brain and we
we will detonate yeah

verse 2
you threw your drink at the wall
it started raining wine and glass so
stay and warm me with the gentlemen jack
gold locks on the cage turn your diamond keys
open the door youll see me digging out my getaway
away away away
hang the stars
who pulled the pin out of my heart
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likechorus
and just because youre screaming for my attention
does not mean i will waste my time
so hold your breath and swim under the ice

verse 3
and modern anxiety
that motherfucker never rests
our adrenaline is kickin in so play the beat faster
head for the streets were the puke and decay
were only dreaming whats your problem baby
dont mean to break your heart
im the new fragrance in fermented jars
in area code sixsixsix oh

chorus
and just because youre screaming for my attention
does not mean i will waste my time
so hold your breath and learn how to swim underneath the ice

bridge
theyre everywhere
nothing can stop them
nothing

breakdown
kill me if i end up like you
chorus
and just because youre screaming for my attention
does not mean i will waste my time
so hold your breath and swim under the ice
outro
i know that its not safe here
you did this to yourself but have no fear
just hold your breath and swim under14embed"
