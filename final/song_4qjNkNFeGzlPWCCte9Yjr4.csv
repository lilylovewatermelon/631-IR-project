and as i got off the train way down in new orleans
i grabbed my hat i put on my coat
reached for my spliff yeah
i had myself a little smoke yeah

chorus
i was sentenced living in detention
sentenced living in detention

verse 2
and now i’m locked up in jail
i spend my days in a cold dark prison cell
i rest alone i watch myself grow old
and i don’t deserve this i just want to go home

chorus

verse 3
i should have known when i shot the man dead
there would be a bounty a bounty for my head yeah
well i don’t care that that young mans dead
i’m just missing one thing a good spliff to my head

bridge
i’ve been talking in my sleep
i’ve been waking in my dreams
i’ve been living in the past
my good old faith is dead
