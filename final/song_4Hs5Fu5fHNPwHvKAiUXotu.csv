i tried to sneak myself through tried to get to the other side
i tried to sneak myself through tried to get to the other side
i had to patch up the cracks and the holes that i have to hide
for a little bit of time even made it work okay
just long enough to really make it hurt
when they figured me out and it all just rotted away

chorus
dont you fucking know what you are
dont you fucking know what you are
dont you fucking know what you are
go on get back to where you belong

verse 2
you better take a good look cause im full of shit shit shit shit
with every bit of my heart ive tried to believe in it
you can dress it all up you can try to pretend
you can try to pretend you can try to pretend
but you cant change anything
you cant change anything in the end

chorus
dont you fucking know what you are
dont you fucking know what you are
dont you fucking know what you are
go on get back to where you belong
dont you fucking know what you are
