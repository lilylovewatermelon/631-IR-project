wearing raspberry velvet and the rabbits in the hole
where the apple tree fell over two years ago
man you could never stop it was always gonna go
when youre hiding in the cotton get a tickle in your soul

prechorus
and i could really go for a little bit of rock n roll
yeah i could really go for a little bit of rock n roll

verse 2
lets go looking in the sugar cane
and wander round the country in the pouring rain
win a couple dollars lose a couple games
and walk tall laughin in the sugar cane

prechorus
and then take a trip on a golden airplane
yеah then take a trip on a golden airplanе

chorus
and youll tell me what your hearts been through
tell me where youre going too
tell me all things youd like to do but you cant
cause youre scared that youre going to hell
feels alright but you cant really tell
all of that cigarette ash is good and well
its good and well

theres a mother of pearl layin in the sand
a quarter of the size of the palm of your hand
hold it to the sun sure does look grand
hangin from your mirror on a rubber band

prechorus
your whole damn life you never even had a plan
its like your whole damn life you never even had a plan

chorus
to tell me what your hearts been through
tell me where youre going too
tell me all things youd like to do but you cant
cause youre scared that youre going to hell
feels alright but you cant really tell
all of that cigarette ash is good and well
its good and wellembed"
