i could cut my hands on your edges
but i wont pull away
you could shake your head back and forth
and still fall down in beautiful refrain

prechorus
i couldnt help but try to hold
the hands wrapped around my face
it isnt hard to see with eyes closed
the love we made

chorus
i spun around you like the world
you danced around me like heaven
i dont want to go home yet
and when you asked i got quiet
i know i shouldve just said it
please dont go home yet

verse 2
i stumbled up and down on my folly
but maybe i was just falling
drawing every detail of your face
calligraphy i could trace

so help me god ill try to hold
the hands wrapped around my face
it isnt hard to see with eyes closed
the love we made
ohohh

chorus
i spun around you like the world
you danced around me like heaven
i dont want to go home yet
and when you asked i got quiet
i know i shouldve just said it
please dont go home yet
please dont go home yet

instrumental break

outro
i spun around you like the world
you danced around me like heaven
i dont want to go home yet
and when you asked i got quiet
i know i shouldve just said it
please dont go homeembed"
