from the porch to the ceiling makes its way down to the floor
but i won’t worry you won’t see
i’m right by you and you by me
as we wake up the night as the thunder roars

the staircase could never teach me more
like life i climb i fall just to step once more
you tricked me fooled me i was yours
only to act out a game that i did not know

who am i who are you what are we anymore
just a darkness in my life or like a whole in the floor
won’t you take it all away and i’ll take mine to the lord
the angels may fall but never close enough to let me soar

eagles are flying and crows are dying i guess i’ll jump quick
just to see if i still have a chance to live
i played around and around i went but a circle grows old
i guess i’m just another square in this circled world that we call home

who am i who are you what are we anymore
just a darkness in my life or like a hole in the floor
won’t you take it all away and i’ll take mine to the lord
the angels may fall but never close enough to let me soarsee phillip phillips liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeembed"
