breathing you in when i want you out
finding our truth in a hope of doubt
lying inside our quiet drama
wearing your heart like a stolen dream
opening skies with your broken keys
no one can blind us any longer

chorus matthew koma
well run where lights wont chase us
hide where love can save us
i will never let you go
well run where lights wont chase us
hide where love can save us
i will never let you go
verse 2 matthew koma
breathing you in when i want you out
finding our truth in a hope of doubt
lying inside our quiet drama
breathing you in when i want you out
finding our truth in a hope of doubt
lying inside our quiet drama
wearing your heart like a stolen dream
opening skies with your broken keys
no one can blind us any longer
