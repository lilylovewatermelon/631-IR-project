and im worried that you might be stuck in your youth
still you wait for the man in the bathroom
so you can wash off your hands clean the blood off your boots
so you can wash off your hands clean the blood off your boots

and you came home from a long night of drinking
you drove the car straight into the ditch
oh but i pray that you find something that lights your fire
and you chase it til your legs give out oh
yeah cause theres more to this life than forgetting last night

and after all the time ive spent alone
and after all the years that pass by oh darling i
i know that youve grown
but i dont know
if ill have you around
so please slow down

now the candles you lit they just keep burning out
so your tears smear the page before you could rephrase it
you were writing to a loved one or maybe yourself
saying i hate my life i dont think ima make it

well youve lost a few friends along the way
based on the way that your emotions are portrayed
when youre wasted i dont blame you
oh but i understand that your heart was ripped out
of your chest and thrown right in the sand
and its easy just to drink away the pain
now its time to let em go so you can fly with the wind
you might also likenow youre wasting your years looking for someone
who really loves you who really needs you girl
though i swear that theyre out there you need to realize
that nobody can love you til you love yourself
so put all your worries on a shelf and just run for the hills

and after all the time ive spent alone
and after all the years that pass by oh darling i
i know that youve grown
but i dont know
if ill have you around
so please slow down wooooh
slow down

and after all the time ive spent alone
and after all the years that pass by oh darling i
i know that youve grown
but i dont know
if ill have you around
so please slow downembed"
