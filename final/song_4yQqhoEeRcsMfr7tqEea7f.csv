verse 1 drake
i dont know why they been lyin but your shit is not that inspirin
bank account statement just look like im ready for early retirement
fuck any nigga thats talking that shit just to get a reaction
fuck going platinum i look at my wrist and its already platinum
i am the kid with the motor mouth
i am the one you should worry bout
i dont know who youre referring to
who is this nigga you heard about
someone just talking that bullshit
man someone just gave you the runaround
niggas downplayin the money
but thats what you do when the money down
i dont waste time puttin money down
i just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
and you gotta fly in first class
this has been years in the makin
its all for the city they know i come right every summer
cash money records forever im always big timin
bitch i came up right under stunna you know it

jealousy in the air tonight i could tell
i will never understand that but oh well
been ready its real i dont know about you
she just want to smoke and fuck
i said girl thats all that we do
okay now youre talkin my language
now youre talkin my language
now youre talkin my language
now youre talkin my language
been ready its real i dont know about you
she just want to smoke and fuck
i said girl thats all that we do

verse 2 drake
im bout to roll one and light it
and fuck it man no ones invited
i got to kill off the weak shit thats got all you niggas excited
i cant even listen you wildin
id much rather sit here in silence
i send all my money to banks in the islands
and eat with italians i do
people are funny
you dont even know bout the shit that i been through
i just want some head in a comfortable bed
it could all be so simple
talkin that shit with your back to me
just know it always get back to me
come get your girl
she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
hate when they get too attached to me
i got to get on the bus and get back on the road
get what i can out the country
and then i just get on the jet and go back to the cold
cant even drive with the top off
been workin so hard on the album i missed the whole summer
i just might bring in some girls from miami to heat up the city
and thats word to stunna you know it
chorus drake
jealousy in the air tonight i could tell
i will never understand that but oh well
been ready its real i dont know about you
she just want to smoke and fuck
i said girl thats all that we do
okay now youre talkin my language
now youre talkin my language
now youre talkin my language
now youre talkin my language
been ready its real i dont know about you
she just want to smoke and fuck
i said girl thats all that we do

outro birdman  drake
