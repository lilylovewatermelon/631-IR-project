close up camera one
the hero sings in this scene
the boy that gets the girl gets to go home where they get married
but stop the tape
the sunset still looks fake to me
the hero looks like he cant breathe
the damsel just left everything

chorus
youre like a black cat
with a black backpack full of fireworks
and youre gonna burn the city down right now
whoa whoa
youre like a black cat
with a black backpack full of fireworks
and youre gonna burn the city down right now

verse 2
oh close up camera two
cause the hero dies in this scene
your inspiration is the loss of absolutely everything
and flashback on the girl
as we montage every memory
and we bleed out in the bathroom sink
and we fade out as the soundtrack sings

with a black backpack full of fireworks
