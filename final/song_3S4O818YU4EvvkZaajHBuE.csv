looking back in time like it was yesterday
my uncle travis was killed they took his breath away
my grandmother so strong they took her best away
to all my fallen soldiers you in a better place
im bout to roll one up and let the record play
we all like pac hoping for better days
the love for my family never fades
no matter how far gone we never stray
keep you head up high my nigga lets get paid
music with pain thats how the best get made
i know how it feels to live in section 8
praying to god that i can catch a break
bubba kush seem to help this depressing state
these politicians all jokes this recession aint
i wanna fly up high and leave this mess away
but right now im here to leave you with this message saying

hook
take me back in time when i fell in love with you
i will never forget how it felt when it all began
so just take me back in time when i was young again
there was no drama no stress no pain just me and my friends
take me back

verse 2 beyoung
yo i remember stuffing paper in the top of cassettes
to record them and then see who could rock it the best
turn the mic up loud to get my mamma upset
then get mad when she took it cause i bothered her rest
whether onyx or quest well endowed as a hip hop child
where the fuck you think i get my style
still remember how i used to ball at the park and rec
jump shot hit my arc its net
had the pat ewings suede black blue and
prime time deions with the straps to em
where act cool and saw my brothers strap moving
under the seat of his cutlass supreme
my other brother was mean he was rushing emcees
around the same time wutang was coming with cream
it was inspiration to discover my dream
how it feel to have pretty girls loving the team

verse 3 mibbs
dillas up in heaven smiling
pac is next to him wylin
god forbid when my time ends
ill find a spot right on martin and corettas island
no propaganda no paparazzi
not worried bout fame god got me
still hold the same values my pops taught me
and kept the same attitude my moms taught me
lets take it back to adolescence
when lyrics freed minds when rap had a message
see in these times we need leaders and more dreamers
no hate less police and more teachers
less violence more peace in more regions
more thoughts from great minds for more thinkers
just a tiny bit of love gets rid of the demons
i say a prayer for the future the world needs it
