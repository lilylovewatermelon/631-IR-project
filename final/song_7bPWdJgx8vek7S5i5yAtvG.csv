im on the run with you my sweet love
theres nothing wrong contemplating god
under the chemtrails over the country club
wearin our jewels in the swimming pool
me and my sister just playin it cool
under the chemtrails over the country club

verse 1
take out your turquoise and all of your jewels
go to the market the kids swimming pools
baby whats your sign
my moons in leo my cancer is sun
you wont play youre no fun
well i dont care what they think
drag racing my little red sports car
im not unhinged or unhappy im just wild

chorus
im on the run with you my sweet love
theres nothing wrong contemplating god
under the chemtrails over the country club
wearin our jewels in the swimming pool
me and my sister just playin it cool
under the chemtrails over the country club

meet you for coffee at the elementary schools
we laugh about nothing as the summer gets cool
its beautiful how this deep normality settles down over me
im not bored or unhappy im still so strange and wild

chorus
youre in the wind im in the water
nobodys son nobodys daughter
watching the chemtrails over the country club
suburbia the brentwood market
what to do next maybe well love it
white picket chemtrails over the country club

bridge
my love my love

chorus
washing my hair doing the laundry
late night tv i want you on me
like when we were kids under chemtrails and country clubs
its never too late baby so dont give up
its never too late baby so dont give up
under the chemtrails over the country club yeah youre born in december and im born in june
under the chemtrails over the country club yeah youre born in december and im born in june
