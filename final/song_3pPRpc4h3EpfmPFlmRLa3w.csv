i took cutie for a ride in my death cab
she tipped me with a kiss i dropped her off at the meth lab
before she left she made a dashboard confessional
then spilled her guts in cursive but whats worse
is i could still see her bright eyes like sunny day real estate
oh my and the funny way the ceiling tastes x
so high but no chance
my little chemical romance left a bad taste in my mouth
but i approached her like hey mercedes why the long face
why you cryin no need just put on this coheed and fall out
boy meets girl jimmy eat world
but schlep eats pills til hes all out
not once not twice she was thrice times a lady
actin all brand new but i had to
bounce to the postal services to
pick up these pills that take care of my nervousness
and on the way i saw planes and mistook em for stars
she played games but she took em too far
at the drivein watchin soft porn and you could tell
by the trail of the dead that there was something in the popcorn
hop in my cab destination midtown
just to get up with some kids that like to get down
i made my rounds and that was that
in between the frowns and scraps and heartattacks
and i remember
i seen her ass early november
on a thursday taking back sunday for a refund
she shot a wink like no hard feelings
then she jetted to brazil man them pills had me spun
see gym class heroes liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likeoutro
yeah this the story of the year right here
this is hot water music
cook your ramens to it
