some towns look better as you leave em
and right now this ones lookin fine
cause with every mile that rolls by
im a little closer to that sweet little gal of mine

chorus
shes right there past the high beams
and i need her beside me
foot heavy on the gas
no she dont mind me leavin her behind me
cause she knows i know my way back

verse 2
i know the porch lightll be burnin when i get there
cause ive been out here keepin it on
but the brightest light that shines
is that sweet little thing of mine
waitin inside my front door

chorus
that girl thats right there past them high beams
and i need her beside me
foot heavy on the gas
nah she dont mind me leavin her behind me
cause she knows i know my way back

she dont have to speak cause ive already heard
how bad shes been missin me too
just one touch of her hand
reminds this man
why i do everything that i do

chorus
its all for that girl right past them high beams
that i need beside me
foot heavy on the gas
now she dont mind me leavin her behind me
cause she knows i know my way back

chorus
back for them miles underneath them high beams
pretended shes beside me foot heavy on the gas
nah she dont mind me leavin her behind me
cause she knows i know my way back
oh she knows i know my way back
oh i always come backembed"
