check it word word
whats the word word
yeah
check

verse 1 joey bada
just got word
from my mans on the island he said he needed guidance
niggas on the streets is wylin he look to god but cant find him
so he demand silence from the glaring sirens
the sympathy symphony only thing playin is the banned violence
no lyin niggas just wont let go the iron
they wanna burn your molecules until you let go ions
treat beef like they let go lions so dont eye em
they get the wrong message wrong methods put you on that long stretcher
too much pressure god bless ya when the semi wet ya
they told me more dressup im giving too many lectures
and im puttin in too many effort in my nouns and verbs
like they gon catch up fuck what you must heard
but i done puffed enough herb
to be listening to young birds and dumb nerds
i got enough shit on my mind
so i dont need to be stressin and shine its fine

chorus joey bada cj fly
one day im tryna have a wife and kids
so i just cant live my life like this
and i aint tryna learn what lifeless is
so i just cant live my life like this
i want the gold chains and diamond rings
but i just cant live my life like this
and sometimes i just wanna light this spliff check
but i just cant live my life like this

got a collect call
from up top my cousin called me and whatnot
the motto never changed it’s still fuck cops
we went from having lunch in our lunchbox
our lungs was hot whenever wed puff pot
wed touch blocks and end up havin to duck shots
but fuck that ain’t tryin live that life no more
my mind corrupted but my heart is still pure gotta be brave can’t be afraid
braids and waves never matter when you catch the fade
trapped in a maze and your faith is your only escape
fuck a priest’s opinion knock the hinges off of heaven’s gates
tryna share my cells with my mate not share a cell with mates
wreckin shit with my recklessness
the l get lit that’s when i start secondguessin shit
thinkin bout ty and then i reminisce
what you thought you niggas could’ve fuck me over never nigga guess again
i’m street so cross me like pedestrians
and that’s gon be the end of it straight revokin your membership

chorus cj fly
one day im tryna have a wife and kids
so i just cant live my life like this
and i aint tryna know what lifeless is
so i just cant live my life like this
i want the gold chains and diamond rings
but i just cant live my life like this
and sometimes i just wanna light this spliff
but i just cant live my life like this
verse 3 joey bada
niggas wanna know
what i’m about i’m bout blowin loud
on the block sporty glock 40 in a politician mouth
i take the competition out commission with my composition
who the kid spittin behind the bars like a con position
gotta give ‘em time to listen they’ll soon bump to it
they’ll like me i kick it like nike they’ll soon adjust to it
but if you hate i know you must do it
i ain’t mad at you i keep my attitude on screw it a million bucks should do it
i’m out for presidents to represent me
yo chick keep messagin me who the bestest mc they be mentionin me
too hot i be molestin the beat
fuck math teachers should teach us to get smith  wesson’s off of the street
so firstclass be a lesson for me
fuck what you teachin for some regents im flyin over regions
reachin alltime highs where jesus can’t reach us
censor me and get the recipe to make you rest in peace
this is for my niggas killers hundred dollar billers
on the block in the rock spot glock cocked watchin out for cops
all about their cheddar young guns know nothing that’s better
like fuck a prison letter those beretta’s led us to the lettuce
relish fetishes menaces want the senator’s percentages
if you aint prejudice you still a nemesis
smokin on the clematis get open like a present is
now your presence is on the premises for them presidents
my city be the genesis for where they think the terror is
they linkin terrorists from the stuy to lincoln terraces
stay on that reckless shit they leave you left for the dead
kids don’t play they’ll erase your head in a race for the bread
children on the corners slingin some regs poppin some meds
jakes be so deep in cover they be chasing the feds
i be backstage grippin haze breakin my leg
my folks was makin the best when they was naked in bed motherfucker
chorus joey bada
one day im tryna have a wife and kids
so i just cant live my life like this
and i aint tryna learn what lifeless is
so i just cant live my life like this
i want the gold chains and diamond rings
but i just cant live my life like this
and sometimes i just wanna light this spliff
but i just cant live my life like this115embed"
