at birth given scars along tender heart liberties
injustice for awkward living situated casualties
they lay dead along your floor
careful not to wake them theyre sleeping
in the morrows good mourning
the dying will discard the wish to live

prechorus
let this colony know
in the name of the dead were coming

chorus
when i kill her ill have her
dance upon the graves of the dead upon your name
and die white girls die white girls
dance upon the graves of the dead upon the graves of the dead

verse 2
youll get nothing for something
arise the hidden war of a dead song unsung
the night of your childrens day
beneath the surface sealed by the floors boarded up
seal the lips of your voice with haste
and cowering at the sounds as they make their way
surprise speed and malice
the opposing break the surface hold ready

let this colony know
in the name of the dead were coming

chorus
when i kill her ill have her
dance upon the graves of the dead upon your name
and die white girls die white girls
dance upon the graves of the dead upon the graves of the dead

will the killing veil love
should the heroes play dumb dumb
but killings no fun
when the heroes are none none

prechorus
let this colony know
in the name of the dead were coming

chorus
bye bye world bye bye world
dance upon the graves of the dead upon your name
die white girls die white girls
dance upon the graves of the dead upon the graves of the dead
bye bye world bye bye world
dance upon the graves of the dead upon your name
die white girls bye bye world
dance upon the graves of the dead upon the graves of the dead
upon the graves of the dead upon the graves1embed"
