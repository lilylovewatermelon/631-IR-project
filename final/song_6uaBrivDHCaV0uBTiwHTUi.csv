this hurt that im holdings gettin heavy
but ima keep a smile on my shoulders til im sweaty
beggin on my knees
screamin someone come and help me
but by the time theyre there
ive already hid the body

verse 2
my breaths gettin short and im unsteady
wellin up in tears as i lay upon your belly
telling you im fine i dont really need nobody
but you say through a sigh
that i said that lie already

chorus
i just needed company now
yeah i just needed someone around
yeah i dont care what song that we play
or mess that we make
just company now

we rot thinkin lots about nothing
yeah i could spend a lifetime
sitting here talkin
and even if i cry all over your body
you dont really mind
say you like your shirt soggy

chorus
yeah i just needed company now
yeah i just needed someone around
yeah i dont care what song that we play
or mess that we make
just company now

postchorus
comfort crowd
comfort crowd

bridge
we mess around
and laugh too loud
and make the sounds
we try to hide when people are around
by blood were bound
through ups and downs
through smiles and pouts
comfort crowd
you can always count
outro
yeah i just needed company now
yeah i just needed someone around
yeah i dont care what song that we play
or mess that we make
just company now
