yeah look

verse 1
i mean this with love when i say it
i wanna answer the phone when you call me
the problem is its 10 am and youre already drinkin
youre probably already wasted
whats the point in having conversation with somebody that
wont remember we had conversations yeah we always talk about the same things we just say em different
try to fix it crazy isnt it
you say mom was always proud and played the videos of us as kids i get it
i think that both of us live in the past so we take for granted the present
maybe next time im in michigan ill come and visit
we aint got a lot in common but both of us miss her
we could sit inside your smokefilled livin room and tear up together thats real

chorus
i might do some things you dont like
we all make mistakes thats just life
they might say i changed thats alright
thats alright thats alright
thats just my life my life my life my life my life my life
thats just my life my life my life my life thats just my

you know my patience is very thin
wish i was there again
im not embarrassed to say that weve always had issues
im embarrassed to say that we never took care of em yeah
pain will always find its way to the surface
no matter how deep you bury him
growin up i felt like no one ever really got me eventually
i took that out on relationships woo
i put my arm around you and i mean it i love you to death
these are the moments i know ima always hold onto and cherish em yeah
lifes about taking chances making moves
not about what you did its what you do
build on what you got and learn from what you lose
and never let people distract you from being you

chorus
