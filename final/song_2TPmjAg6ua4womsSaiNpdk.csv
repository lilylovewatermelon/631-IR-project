i wanna kiss you girl i wanna kiss you
girl i wanna love you
oh am i moving too fast
fuck that well well well
your momma must have taught you well
cause you taste so purified
need to get it while its hot cause im cold at times
open up to me and drop your guard i need the proof
constantly need to know if you still have a heart
cause a nigga done fucked up i feel like i lucked up i know its hard
but hop in your car and bring it to me

promise to love you and obey
and hit it more than once a day
