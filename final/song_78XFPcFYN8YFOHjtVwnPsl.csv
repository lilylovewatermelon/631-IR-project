ill try
she said as she walked away
tried not to lose you
two vibrant hearts could change
nothing tears the being more than deception
unmasked fear
ill be here waiting tested and secure

prechorus
nothing hurts my world
just affects the ones around me
when sins deep in my blood
youll be the one to fall

chorus
i wish i could be the one
the one who wont care at all
but being the one on the stand
i know the way to go no ones guiding me
when time soaked with blood turns its back
i know its hard to fall
confided in me was your heart
i know its hurting you but its killing me

verse 2
nothing will last in this life
our time is spent constructing
now youre perfecting a world meant to sin
constrict your hands around me
squeeze till i cannot breathe
this air tastes dead inside me
contribute to our plague
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likebridge
break all your promises
tear down this steadfast wall
restraints are useless here
tasting salvations near
oh

prechorus
nothing hurts my world
just affects the ones around me
when sins deep in my blood
youll be the one to fall

chorus
i wish i could be the one
the one who wont care at all
but being the one on the stand
i know the way to go no ones guiding me
when time soaked with blood turns its back
i know its hard to fall
confided in me was your heart
i know its hurting you but its killing me14embed"
