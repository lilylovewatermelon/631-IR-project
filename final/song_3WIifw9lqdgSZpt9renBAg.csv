seasons may change
but we wont change
isnt it sweet how we know that already
winter to spring
spring back to fall
isnt it cool how nothing here changes at all

prechorus
you make me feel im invincible
just like i wanted
no more candle in the wind
its not like im invisible
not like before when i was burning at both ends

chorus
we did it for fun we did it for free
i did it for you you did it for me
we did it for the right reasons
we did it for the right reasons

verse 2
seasons may change
but we wont change
isnt it strange how different we are from all of our friends
seasons will turn
the world it will turn
the only thing well turn is the pages of all of the poems we burned
see lana del rey liveget tickets as low as 42you might also likeprechorus
honey you made me feel im invincible
its just like i wanted
no more candle in the wind
its not like im invisible
like i was before no more burning at both ends

chorus
now i do it for fun i do it for free
i do it for you you did it for me
we did it for the right reasons
we did it for the right reasons

bridge
i remember watching how green was my valley
then i was thinking
how deep was the canyon that you came from
television static was quite overwhelming
was it because of the cabin and the candles in the wind

chorus
weve done it for fun weve done it for free
i showed up for you you showed up for me
we did it for the right reasons
we did it for fun we did it for free
outro
when i was young til eternity
ill do it for the right reasons
withstanding all the time changes and seasons
right reasons33embed"
