if i had a weakness
you sure found it tonight
some hidden desperation
you saw floatin in my eyes
moments just like these baby
wrong can feel so right
and i dont wanna go home tonight
ive held it all together
as long as i can
theres pieces of me fallin
right into your hands
and dont the lies come easy baby
when the truth just aint worth the fight
no i i dont wanna go home tonight

chorus
so lay me down easy
and hold on tight
and tell me im the only one you see tonight
lonely woman lonely man
theres just some things only lonely understands

verse 2
i might be just a sinner
who wants to be a saint
one justifies the reason
oh one understands the pain
and i dont know whats wrong baby
and i sure dont know whats right
but i dont wanna go home tonight
