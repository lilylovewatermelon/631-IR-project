verse 1 big boi
sir lucious gots gator belts and patty melts and monte carlos
and el dorados so im waking up out of my slumber feeling like rollo
so follow its showtime at the apollo minus the kiki shepards
what about a ho in a leopardprint ah
teddy pendergrass cooler than freddie jackson
sipping a milkshake in a snowstorm
left her throat warm in the dorm room at the au
we blew hay too athletes might cake you
but you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make cause

verse 3 andré 3000
those huge baby eyes get to runnin off at they mouth
and tellin me everything thats on your nasty mind
they say youre malnutritioned in need of vitamin d
and invitin me to that tingle in your spine
i love who you are love who you aint — youre so anne frank
lets hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks

i do suck lips til hips jerk in double time
the boy next doors a freak haha
