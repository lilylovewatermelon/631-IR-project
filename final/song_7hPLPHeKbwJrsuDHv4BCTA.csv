when i was just a boy
well call it fifteen or so
i found myself annoyed
by a syndrome of sorts in my bones
that girl whos next to me
wait next to— like right next to— oh god
she found herself bored to tears
she realized if she wanted conversation
shes out of luck for three more years

verse 2
when i moved away from home
one hundred miles or so
i knew a change had grown
inside my awkwardly long limbs and bones
that girl whos next to me
shes friendly and thoughtful and quite awfully pretty
but all she has to say
is a meatheadthemed monologue on why brad ran away

bridge
she said all i can hope for is for me to get better
cause all i can take is no more
ill win him back again well be lovers best friends
he wont need no other woman
like he did way back when he was with me
he needed more than me
im friendly and thoughtful and quite awfully pretty
but he needed more than me

when i felt that i should leave
well call it midnight or so
i found myself annoyed
by a syndrome of sorts in her bones
that girl whos next to me
she dont know her worth in this town
cause her face starts to shine when that meathead behind me
is grinning as hes checking her out oh come on

refrain
i said all i can hope for is for you to get better
cause all i can take is no more
so ill hide where i can
away from you and your friends
leaking tears over beers once again
leaking tears over beers once again
youre leaking tears over beers once again11embed"
