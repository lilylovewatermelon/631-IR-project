verse 1
dont give yourself away dont live your life that way
of course hes gonna say anything you want
then leave quicker than he came now you got yourself to blame
dont put yourself back in the fire again

prechorus
its the same damn things youre so quick to believe
you do it over and over again
and its the same mistakes that im watching you make
you do it over and over again

chorus
so before they bring you down
youve gotta stand for something or youll fall for anything
no youll fall for anything no youll fall for
youve gotta stand for something or youll fall for anything
no youll fall for anything no youll fall for

love that bring you down down down
love that bring you down down down
love that bring you down down down
love that bring you down down down
