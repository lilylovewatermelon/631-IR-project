got a lot of time gonna kill us a little
gonna sink it down deep to the bottom of the creek
gonna shook off my shirt get some muddy on my feet

i got sunshine on the line
pretty little bitty country girl sittin by my side
i got sunshine on the line
try to talk around a kiss and it looks like she just might
be in a i dont give a damn if they dont bite state of mind
i got sunshine on the line

she said rub me all over to the blue hole baby
anchor up the boat jump in you better take me
in your arms cause im cold as the beer you been sippin
way back heres just fine for skinny dippin

got sunshine on the line
pretty little bitty country girl sittin by my side
i got sunshine on the line
try to talk around a kiss and it looks like she just might
be in a i dont give a damn if they dont bite state of mind
i got sunshine on the line

sometimes it dont matter if you dont catch nothin but a good time
catch a kiss catch a buzz catch a breeze a little bit of blue sky
see randy houser liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likei got sunshine on the line
pretty little bitty country girl sittin by my side
i got sunshine on the line
try to talk around a kiss and it looks like she just might
be in a i dont give a damn if they dont bite state of mind
im in a i dont give a damn if they dont bite state of mind
i got sunshine on the line
i got sunshine on the line
