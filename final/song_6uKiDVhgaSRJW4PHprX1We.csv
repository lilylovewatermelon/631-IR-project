you could call it a comeback
i lay back analyze the rhymes and realize
i own that crown for lyrical combat
spit more raps to count more stacks
kickin back in the coupe i got loose relax
im hotness monotonous fans is runnin bizzack
l please dont leave the game like thizzat
never in a million years
lll never let you down baby
i drop 50 im still gravy

hook repeat 2x ll
i look back on venus
i look i look back on mars
and and i burn with the fire
of ten of ten million stars guess whos back uh

verse 2
im more then a conqueror
double up your bets
come and rumble with the vets
i know you had that clown picked
mind blowin out cause l still sound sick
he dreamed he was me
i gleam lyrically
i love em for it its the highest form of flattery
doin a buck 10 chrome skating on the battery
my clutch burnin on top of the world turnin
rappers is just learnin bout stacks i been earnin
im the uncle l future of the funk
turn my joint up find out why im different from all these chumps
and tell your favorite rapper that im ready to thump
for real cat that represented rap from the jump

verse 3
six figure interest on the cheddar
from music fashion film and television
poppin amaretto so what you got a vendetta
i never felt better
now forever competition get severed by skills you cant measure
im a champ you a peon
kiss the ring be gone
known and respected on every block you be on
and be on stand there get your md on
i chuckle cause its nothin to waste energy on
there you have it
the uncut raw for rap addicts
waited three years to see if l still had it
ten million stars got beef to the death
end of my contract im the last one left

hook

background repeat 2x
l worth paper
ask def jam who put em up in that skyscraper
yeah i take them seriously baby
ask my dogs up in old five who made a major

i look back on mars
and i burn with the fire
of ten million starsembed"
