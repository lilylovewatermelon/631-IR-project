on tuesdays from seven to nine
yeah they talk all the time how just overnight

in just one or two words in dont take much
they can tell you aint from round here
yeah but if i know them son
it dont matter where youre from
if youre thirsty theyll buy you a beer

yeah the locals theyre the lifeblood here till the day they die
yeah the locals tell the stories keeping the heroes alive
they turn down town upside down they live to have the time of their lives
the night aint over yet and man i hope i get
to have a drink with the locals tonight
the locals tonight

yeah the locals know all the shortcuts around
the red light and busy streets
the best spots by far to go park your car
and crawl back in the backseat

there aint much to do there aint much to see
but they like just how it is
and any local i know will tell ya right where to go
