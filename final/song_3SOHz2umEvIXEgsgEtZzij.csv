ruby stay at home on a friday night
hoes blow up my phone tell em that im quite alright
i might forget that my pimp game is weak sometimes
and if you slip you fall in loveâ€”now she gone
now i gotta ball flex on adderall
sex on tramadol i guess ill try em all
as i recollect the records i collect
most of the artists wished for an early death
i will give it my all yes i will give it my best
anything to replace all the static in my chest

chorus lil lonely
but i know she wont be home i feel so fucking broke
im lethal i bleed foam and seep smoke

verse 2 anthony mars
tryna join the 27 club
so many times tried to get off the subs
yung inebriated lil half cut
both knees are shaking from the mass drugs
i put in my body every day daily
ex on my mind when i start masturbating
somebody save me cause i have no patience
when it comes to death im not tryna be waitin
not tryna be slaving for no vacation
not tryna be you or that bitch that youre datin save all the fakin
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeoutro anthony mars
im just rollin smokin with my two cups still losin
in between if ima fold or blow up uicide is what im choosin23embed"
