letting go of every single dream
i lay each one down at your feet
every moment of my wandering
never changes what you see

verse 2
i’ve tried to win this war i confess
my hands are weary i need your rest
mighty warrior king of the fight
no matter what i face you’re by my side

chorus
when you don’t move the mountains i’m needing you to move
when you don’t part the waters i wish i could walk through
when you don’t give the answers as i cry out to you
i will trust i will trust i will trust in you

verse 3
truth is you know what tomorrow brings tomorrow brings
there’s not a day ahead you have not seen you have not seen
so in all things be my life and breath
i want what you want lord and nothing less

chorus
when you don’t move the mountains i’m needing you to move
when you don’t part the waters i wish i could walk through
when you don’t give the answers as i cry out to you
i will trust i will trust i will trust in you
i will trust in you

you are my strength and comfort
you are my steady hand
you are my firm foundation the rock on which i stand
your ways are always higher
your plans are always good
there’s not a place where i’ll go you’ve not already stood

chorus
when you don’t move the mountains i’m needing you to move
when you don’t part the waters i wish i could walk through
when you don’t give the answers as i cry out to you
i will trust i will trust i will trust in you

outro
i will trust in you
i will trust in you
i will trust in you3embed"
