well you can call me when you wake up
your tears smeared from your makeup
and we are here in the wake of
a fire burning down our love
and i feel a filth now
i feel it deep within my bones
and i walk these city streets
drunk and stumbling all alone
and i want so bad
to be next to you
but theres only so much two hearts can suffer through
and i think apart
may do us better
im glad it happened at all
rather than never

chorus
but youre so coldblooded
oh my souls flooded
the water thats cold as ice
you be my muse and ill be your vice

verse 2
wouldnt it be something
if we could find the way
somewhere in some place and time
we could both be ok
i pray youre somewhere pretty
and that youre staying true
to that spitfire fireball drinking girl that i knew

but youre so coldblooded
oh my souls flooded
the water thats cold as ice
you be my muse and ill be your vice
