what did you do what did you say
did you walk or did you run away
where are you now where have you been
did you go alone or did you bring a friend

chorus ceelo green
i need to know this cause i noticed that youre smilin
out in the sun havin fun and feelin free
and i can tell you know how hard this life can be
but you keep on smilin for me

refrain menta malone  tomika walden
girl let me smile at you
girl let me smile at you

verse 2 ceelo green
what went right what went wrong
was it a story or was it a song
was it overnight or did it take you long
was knowing your weakness what made you strong

chorus ceelo green
or all the above oh how i love to see you smilin
and oh yeah take a little pain just in case take it just in case
you need something warm to embrace
to help you put on a smilin face
hey put on a smilin face
you might also likerefrain menta malone  tomika walden
girl let me smile at you
girl let me smile at you

bridge ceelo green  menta malone  tomika walden
dont you go off into the new day with any doubt
heres a summary of somethin that you could smile about
say for instance my girlfriend she bugs me all the time
but the irony of it all is that she loves me all the time ooh see

chorus ceelo green
i want to be you whenever i see you smilin
cause its easily one of the hardest things to do
your worries and fears become your friends
and they end up smilin at you
put on a smilin face2embed"
