there are places ill remember
all my life though some have changed
some forever not for better
some have gone and some remain
all these places have their moments
with lovers and friends i still can recall
some are dead and some are living
in my life ive loved them all
but of all these friends and lovers
there is no one compares with you
and these memories lose their meaning
when i think of love as something new

chorus
though i know ill never lose affection
for people and things that went before
i know ill often stop and think about them
in my life i love you more
though i know ill never lose affection
for people and things that went before
i know ill often stop and think about them
in my life i love you more
in my life i love you moreyou might also like3embed"
