intro justins mother
”hi justin this is your mother and its 233 on monday afternoon
i was just calling to see how you were doing
you sounded really uptight last night
it made me a little nervous and a l and well it made me nervous it sounded like you were nervous too
i just wanted to make sure you were really okay
and wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
you know i love you and
take care honey
i know youre under a lot of pressure
see ya bye bye”

verse 1 justin furstenfeld
i have to block out thoughts of you so i don’t lose my head
they crawl in like a cockroach leaving babies in my bed
dropping little reels of tape to remind me that i’m alone
playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
theres a burning in my pride a nervous bleeding in my brain
an ounce of peace is all i want for you will you never call again
and will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face
and will you never try to reach me
it is i that wanted space

hate me today
hate me tomorrow
hate me for all the things i didnt do for you
hate me in ways
yeah ways hard to swallow
hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

verse 2 justin furstenfeld
i’m sober now for 3 whole months
it’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
the one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing i won’t touch again
in a sick way i want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
while i was busy waging wars on myself you were trying to stop the fight
you never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicide and hate
you made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
so i’ll drive so fucking far away that i never cross your mind
and do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

chorus justin furstenfeld
hate me today
hate me tomorrow
hate me for all the things i didnt do for you
hate me in ways
yeah ways hard to swallow
hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
bridge justin furstenfeld
and with a sad heart i say bye to you and wave
kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that i had made
and like a baby boy i never was a man
until i saw your blue eyes cry and i held your face in my hand
and then i fell down yelling “make it go away”
just make her smile come back and shine just like it used to be
and then she whispered “how can you do this to me”

chorus justin furstenfeld
hate me today
hate me tomorrow
hate me for all the things i didnt do for you
hate me in ways
yeah ways hard to swallow
hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
for you
for you
for you

if youre sleeping are you dreaming
if youre dreaming are you dreaming of me
i cant believe you actually picked me
