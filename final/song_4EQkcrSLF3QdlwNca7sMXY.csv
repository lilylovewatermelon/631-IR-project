okay lets handle the small shit

verse 1 eminem  dr dre
i was born to brew up storms stir up shit
kick up dust cuss til i slur up spit
grew up too quick went through too much knew too much shit
corrupt and ima pour it on like syrup bitch
thick and rich sick and twisted mr buttersworth
dre told me to milk this shit for what its worth
til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth
and if i fumble a verse keep goin
first take i make mistakes just keep it
no punches pull no punches thats weak shit
fake shit if i ever take shit ill eat shit
wasnt for him wouldnt be shit
creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
been here longer than anyone in the game
and i aint got to lie about my age
but what about jermaine fuck jermaine
he dont belong speakin mine or timbalands name
and dont think i dont read your little interviews and see what youre sayin
im a giant and i aint gotta move til im provoked
when i see you ima step on you and not even know it
you midget minime with a bunch of little miniyous
runnin around your backyard swimming pools
over eighty million records sold
and i aint have to do it with ten or elevenyearolds

‘cause what you say is what you say

verse 2 eminem  dr dre
second verse it gets worse it gets no better than this
amateurs drink veteran piss
from a dixie cup if you ever mix me up
or confuse me with a canibus or dre with a dupri
well rub it in every club youre in well have you blackballed
and make sure you never rap afuckingain
dre aint havin it long as im here to play devils advocate
if there was some magic shit i could wave
over the industry that could save it when im gone
and buried to make sure the tradition carries on i would
if i could only use this power for good i wouldnt not even if i could
from the hood and im a hornet
and ima only sting when im cornered
and ima only sucker punch and swing without warning
and swing to knock somebodys fuckin head off
‘cause i know if they get up i wont get a chance to let off
another punch im punk rock no ones punk
dont give a fuck white pac so much spunk
when i was little i knew i would blow up and sell a mil
or grow up to be attila go nuts and be a killer
and im something of a phenom one puff of the chron
im unstoppable im alive and on top again
theres no obstacle that i cant conquer
so come along with us come on
chorus eminem

verse 3 eminem  dr dre
now anybody who knows dre knows im about
fast cars and alizé partyin all day
but i handled my business ‘cause its work before play
dont look for trouble but ill serve you gourmet
however you want it you can have it your way
you fuck my night up ima fuck up your day
bullet with your name sendin it your way
that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
‘cause this is my space you invade it
live to regret it and youll die tryna violate it
fuck around get annihilated
eyes dilated huh like my old lady
‘cause what you say is what you say sometimes what you mean
is two different things depending on your mood if it swings
think too many things little hit of dres weed i can do anything
catch a contact and im gone and im back
i speed write and my loose leafs my launchpad
and i can pull any string dont have to prove anything
catch a contract on your head you headed west
talk shit about dre you better get a vest and invest in something to protect your head and neck
and its back and forth all day like red and meth
i joke when i say im the best in the booth but a lot of truth is said in jest
and if i ever do live to be a legend ima die a sudden death
five mics in the source aint holdin my fuckin breath
but ill suffocate for the respect fore i breathe to collect a fuckin check
chorus eminem
‘cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
so who you playin with huh huh huh huh
‘cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
so who you playin with huh huh huh huh
