all you ever caused was pain
you can say youre sorry the evidence is on my
body but i never complain
i wear it as a lesson a curse and a blessing

prechorus
oh ohoh ohoh youre not a prophet
have you forgotten that youre godless
oh ohoh ohoh youre on your knees and
youre tryna speak beggin me please but

chorus
dont even say what youre gonna say
its too late too late baby
why did you wait to finally change
its too late too late to save me oh oh oh

postchorus
you watched me
burn burn burn
you watched me
burn burn burn
you watched me

verse 2
i dont even pity your pain
you can use it as a weapon but i wont ever let it
pull me back under again
i let you fool me once but now im dead and gone
