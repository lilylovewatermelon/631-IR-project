im the preacher
a done decision
another creature
whos lost its vision

prechorus
let it go
reel it in
for the creature
on television

chorus
theres no turning back
to nobody
theres no second chance
no third degree

verse 2
im a fixture
a split decision
a pretty picture
a superstition

prechorus
let it go
cash it in
for the creature
on television
