joanne
didnt give an inch when i gave a mile

mimi
i gave a mile

roger

mark  benny
c’mon guys chill

joanne  mimi
i’d be happy to die for a taste of what angel had
someone to live for
unafraid to say “i love you”

roger
all your words are nice mimi
but loves not a threeway street
you’ll never share real love until you love yourself
i should know

collins
you all said youd be cool today
so please for my sake
i cant believe hes gone
and i can’t believe youre going
i cant believe this family must die
angel helped us believe in love
i cant believe you disagree
all
i cant believe this is goodbye

mark
i hear there are great restaurants out west

roger
some of the best how could she

mark
how could you let her go

roger
you just dont know
how could we lose angel

mark
maybe youll see why
when you stop escaping your pain
at least now if you try
angels death wont be in vain

roger
his death is in vain

mark
are you insane
theres so much to care about
theres me theres mimi

roger
mimis got her baggage too

mark
so do you

roger
who are you to tell me what i know
what to do

mark
a friend

roger
but who mark are you
mark has got his work they say
mark lives for his work and
marks in love with his work
mark hides in his work

mark
from what

roger
from facing your failure
facing your loneliness
facing the fact you live a lie
yes you live a lie tell you why
youre always preaching not to be numb
when thats how you thrive
you pretend to create and observe
when you really detach from feeling alive

mark
perhaps its because im the one of us to survive

roger
poor baby

mark
mimi still loves you
are you really jealous
or afraid that mimis weak

roger
mimi did look pale

mark
mimis gotten thin
mimis running out of time
and youre running out the door

roger
no more ive gotta go

mark
hey for someone whos always been let down
whos heading out of town

roger
for someone who longs for a community of his own
whos with his camera alone
ill call
i hate the fall
you heard

mimi roger
every word
you dont want baggage
without lifetime guarantees
you dont want to watch me die
i just came to say goodbye love
goodbye love came to say goodbye love
goodbye
just came to say
goodbye love glory
goodbye love one blaze of glory
goodbye love goodbye i have to find
please dont touch me understand
im scared i need to go away
