why the hell would you run this game
both my hands are tied
afraid of thinking i dug my own grave
fuck around with this
strange and elusive too afraid to lose it
i dont mind this pain
most niggas want you for your candy
theyll never know just how long it takes
i wave my own pride
and put it all on the line

chorus anderson paak
there i go volunteering punishment
self inflicted pain sickness over used
way over used
here i stay hey time to time
it must be what you put me through ha
it must be what you put me through

verse 2 anderson paak
a little while longer
a bit more time
why would you run these thoughts across my mind
please relieve me
as cool as i remain
theres a point in which ill lose my self restraint
say love most niggas wouldve left you lonely
i fancy throwin it all away
i see it to my own demise
how much longer will i let it ride

there i go volunteering punishment
self inflicted pain sickness over used
will i let it ride here i stay
here i stay time to time
it must be what you put me through yeah time to time
it must be what you put me through

outro anderson paak
hey it must be here i stay time to time
it must be what you put me through
it must be what you put me through9embed"
