this could be the day that we push through
it could be the day that all our dreams come true
for me and you
till were at the end of just another day
are you too terrified to try your best
just to end up with an educated guess
like success
like those times you wake up mystified

prechorus
oh it feels so real in my sleep
never held something so close i couldnt keep
into the day the strangest feeling
do you really live without the fear that

chorus
everything is changing
and theres nothing i can do
my world is turning pages
while i am just sitting here

bridge
well am i getting closer
will i ever get there
does it even matter

do i really need it
push it out the window
on and on we all go
this could be the day that we push through
into another morning
doesnt even matter
it was only yesterday
it could be the day that all our dreams come true
didnt even know you
now im gonna miss you
oh it feels so real in my sleep
never held something so close i couldnt

chorus
nothing ever changes
no matter how long you do your hair
looks the same to everyone else
everything is changing
i guess i should warn my mum
but shell just be excited
