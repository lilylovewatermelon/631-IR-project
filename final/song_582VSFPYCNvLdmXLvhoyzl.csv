how stubborn are the scars when they wont fade away
or just a gentle reminder that now are better days
well be home soon so dry your eyes
youll be okay youll be okay

verse 2
oh my god the water is rising its rising
you just have to believe in me
sailing out ill ride this storm alone
we can still make it out fuck

prechorus
i can help you through this but you have to take my hand
i can take you home take my hand take my hand

chorus
i shouldve known the tides were getting higher
we can still survive
and i think were drowning but our heads are still
above the waves above the waves

postchorus
i shouldve known the tides were getting higher
we can still survive above the waves
i shouldve known the tides were getting higher
i shouldve known the tides were getting higher
we can still survive
