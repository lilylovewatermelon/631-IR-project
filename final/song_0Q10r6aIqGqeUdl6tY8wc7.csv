look like a girl but i think like a guy
not ladylike to behave like a slime
easy to be sleazy when youve got a filthy mind
you stick to your yogurts ill stick to my apple pie

prechorus
girls are not meant to fight dirty
never look a day past thirty
not gonna bend over and curtsy for you

chorus
is there any possibility
youll quit gossiping about me
to hide your insecurities
all you say is blah blah
girls they never befriend me
cause i fall asleep when they speak
of all the calories they eat
all they say is na na na na na
na na na na na

verse 2
girls oh girls wag your tails to the beat
of girls aloud oh the journos in heat
write such good stories oh their mothers must be proud
making money off your insecurity and doubt

cause i fall asleep when they speak

i feel ive been riding in a fast car
burning dirty gas wont get you that far
i feel ive been riding up the wrong path
but im gonna make sure i get the last laugh
