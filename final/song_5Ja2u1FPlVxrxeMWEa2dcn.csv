we made a pact youd take me back always again
im bleedin out i need you now cant let you win
i want it all i want it all i push so hard i break it
my only home went down in smoke
its bittersweet i taste it
so are you lonely cause im healin slowly
in a moment your memory is fading on me
got no expectations now that im forsaken
lets see what im made of find out if i can take it now

chorus
when im alone pretend im letting you go
just tell me who to blame for this
when wakin up feels like a punch in the gut
just tell me whos to blame for this

verse 2
all i wanted was a piece of decent on the side on the side
when we go to bed she be creepin on my side on my side
i was drinkin all day i let her spend the night
when i took her home she left somethin in my ride in my ride damn
then my baby found out
now im livin in a hotel livin in a hotel
aint that bad i got room service
livin in a hotel livin in a hotel
what your life like need a lifeline right now
ninetynine nights tryna get my mind right now
life is sour even when im in the limelight now
but i try somehow
