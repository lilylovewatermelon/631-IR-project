i got lost about an hour ago
i sailed past that fork in the road
and now here i stand
a stranger in a foreign land
an empty barn and a weather vane
a picket fence thats seen its day
oh i sit to stay
cause i dont got much to do today hey

verse 2
i go down to the local store
i caught a glance from the local whore
that she threw my way
and i still got nothing to do today
i carry on down the street
im looking for a place to eat
but my bellys so full
with all these things im hoping for for

chorus
and im wishing my legs away
oh im wishing my legs away oh
cause theyre taking me to nowhere safe
oh theyre taking me to nowhere safe oh nowhere safe
see mother mother liveget tickets as low as 27you might also likeverse 3
an old man in a pickup truck
he said son are you out of luck
and i nod my hard head
i say my day is spent and my spirits dead
he says come on now ill take you a ride
you sit yourself in the passenger side
and ill go your way
cause i dont got much to do today
hey

chorus
and im wishing my legs away
oh im wishing my legs away
cause theyre taking me to nowhere safe
oh theyre taking me to nowhere safe8embed"
