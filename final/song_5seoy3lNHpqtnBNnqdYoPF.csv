although wed often wondered
it was no thing of wonder
the shit that flew from our minds
while wearing stains of fresh fruit
and riding on shoes of horse glue
on this ridiculous climb
with great tunnel vision
wed built ourselves a mission
to ride on bullets inside
oh what a vain description
of what we have been missin
so why would anyone try

chorus isaac brock james mercer
whoaoh it was always worth it
ohwhoa thats the part i seem to hide
whoaoh and the busy ant empire
ohwhoa put up the closing sign

verse 2 isaac brock
i wasnt always cargo
i was once kind of my own
i guess ill pack up my mind
well it took so much effort
not to make an effort
oh what a flawless design

chorus isaac brock james mercer
whoaoh it was always worth it
ohwhoa thats the part i seem to hide
whoaoh and the busy ant empire
ohwhoa has all deserted hive
whoaoh it was always worth it

refrain isaac brock
even as i had left florida
far enough far enough wasnt far enough
couldnt quite seem to escape myself
far enough far enough far from florida
we were all drowsin in cruise control
far enough far enough wasnt far enough

bridge isaac brock
i stood on my hearts porch thinkin
oh my god ill probably have to carry this whole load
i couldnt remember if i tried
i couldnt remember if i took my brain out
threw it so directly at the goal
i couldnt remember if iâ€” ah ah augh
i could have my mind erased
and still not know exactly what i dont already know
refrain isaac brock
even as i had left florida2embed"
