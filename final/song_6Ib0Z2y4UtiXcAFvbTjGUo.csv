and im good good good to go
and im good good good to go
i gotta get away
get away from all of my mistakes
and im good good good to go
and im good good good to go
i gotta get away
get away from all of my mistakes

verse 1
so here i sit looking at the traffic lights
the red extinguishes the hope that the green ignites
i want to run away i want to ditch my life
cause all of my mistakes keep me awake at night

prechorus
and after all of my alibis desert me
i just want to get by i dont want nothing to hurt me
i had no idea where my head was at
but if my heart says im sorry can we leave it at that
because i just want for all of this to end

chorus
and i so hate consequences
and running from you is what is my best defense is
whoa consequences
god dont make me face up to this
and i so hate consequences
and running from you is what my best defense is
cause i know that i let you down i know that i let you down
and i dont want to deal with that
you might also likerefrain
and im good good good to go
and im good good good to go
i got to get away
get away from all of my mistakes

verse 2
it just now hit me this is more then just a set back
and when you spelled it out well i guess i didnt get that
and every trace of momentum is gone
and this isnt turning out the way i want

prechorus
and after all of my alibis desert me
i just want to get by i dont want nothing to hurt me
and i had no idea where my head was at
but if my heart says im sorry can we leave it at that
because i just want for all of this to end

chorus
and i so hate consequences
and running from you is what is my best defense is
whoa consequences
god dont make me face up to this
and i so hate consequences
and running from you is what my best defense is
cause i know that i let you down i know that i let you down
and i dont want to deal with that
bridge 1
and i spent all last night tearing down
every stoplight and stop sign in this town
now i think there might be no way to stop me now
ill get away despite the fact im so weighed down
all of my escapes have been exhausted
i thought i had a way but then i lost it
and my resistance was once much stronger
and i know i cant go on like this much longer

bridge 2
when i got tired of running from you
i stopped right there to catch my breath
there your words they caught my ears
you said i miss you son come home
and my sins they watched me leave
and in my heart i so believed
the love you felt for me was mine
the love id wished for all this time
and when the doors were closed
i heard no i told you sos
i said the words i knew you knew
oh god oh god i needed you
god all this time i needed you
i needed you
chorus
and i so hate consequences
running from you is what is my best defense is
i hate these consequences
cause i know that i let you down
and i dont want to deal with that1embed"
