well i want a home on the outskirts of town
come around sundown to hear the sound
kids and the crickets under pinkish skies
swing on by cause were drinkin tonight
well in my mind trees line the drive
theres a kind lovin lady belly laughin inside
and in the mornin while were drinkin brew
shell say the city aint nothin like the outskirts with you

chorus
with fireflies and some schemin ill turn this house into a home
then well grin in the driveway how your smile outdoes the dawn
hold on hope is on the way
oh i swear to god ill take you to the outskirts one day

verse 2
well i want a home on the outskirts of town
where the wind chimes sing to the porch swing crowd
june into august august to may
with the sun beatin down no snow in the way
the smell of freshcut grass in the yard
i dont care who you are drink a fifth bring your heart
you put down a tailgate ill put down a tune
cause out in the skirts we move and shake with the moon
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
with fireflies and some schemin ill turn this house into a home
then well grin in the driveway how your smile outdoes the dawn
hold on hope is on the way
oh i swear to god ill take you to the outskirts one day
oh i swear to god ill take you to the outskirts one day
with fireflies and some schemin ill turn this house into a home
then well grin in the driveway how your smile outdoes the dawn
hold on hope is on the way
oh i swear to god well make it to the outskirts one day
oh i swear to god well make it to the outskirts one dayembed"
