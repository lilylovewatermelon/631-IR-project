verse 1
mmm ahave you ever been down so low you cant see up
something dragging you around but you still aint had enough
oh you know its up there somewhere but you still cant feel the sun
youre on the edge a half a step away from coming undone

chorus
i dont drink cause i know my mind and every time i do
i just think about what youre doing and who youre doing it to
i dont take no pills to kill the pain cause they aint never told me the truth
i dont smoke cause i never get high enough to get over you
