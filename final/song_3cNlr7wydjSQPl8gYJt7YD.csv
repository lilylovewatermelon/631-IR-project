look yeah
see you harden at a young age when you in the h
we aint ever had to work out to be pushin weight
have yo mind locked up in a case
they like to tell you that you write your own script
but forget to remind you you cant erase
all the felonies and misdemeanors life is what you make
see the ogs drew the picture all you do is trace
when you follow in they footsteps look right and look left
praying that nobody pull up to speed up the pace
of that fast life that you livin
late night jumpin with good dope and women
told my brother think twice before he go grab the pack
they want you trapped in the same spots you trappin at
but what is he to do when all he really trynna do is eat
and the only thing that fed him was the streets
as this type of man you leave a mark where you stand like you wearin cleats
i just pray they dont get six feet deep
let me speak to you

outro
ouu
know you aint the type for coping
i know you been feelin down you been feelin hopeless
you aint tryna wait around you put things in motion
i dont want to slow you down i just need a momentmoment moment
times be getting hard but dont trip
you know you meant for the crown you know you was chosen
get your blessings out the ground get the doors to open
stormy waters never drown you just stay in focusfocus focus
