imagine me and you i do
i think about you day and night
its only right to think about the girl you love
and hold her tight
so happy together
if i should call you up invest a dime
and you say you belong to me and ease my mind
imagine how the world could be
so very fine
so happy together

and you say you belong to me and ease my mind ease my mind
imagine how the world could be so very fine very fine
