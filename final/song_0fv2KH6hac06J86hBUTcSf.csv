sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window

verse 1 tyler the creator
i saw a photo you looked joyous
my eyes are green i eat my veggies
i need to get her out the picture
shes really fuckin up my frame
shes not developed like we are

refrain tyler the creator
like magic like magic like magic gone
new magic new magic new magic wand ayy
like magic like magic like magic gone gone nigga
new magic woo new magic new magic wand

verse 2 tyler the creator
my brother said im on the spectrum
dont call me selfish i hate sharin
this 6040 isnt workin
i want a hundred of your time youre mine

chorus tyler the creator  santigold  jessy wilson

i wanna be found passenger in your car dont leave
you wanna be mean mixed signals dont park i can make her leave
shes gonna be dead i just got a magic wand dont leave
we can finally be together

bridge tyler the creator
you roll the dice hit a seven sure you right
beginners luck you not my first who gives a fuck
your other one evaporate we celebrate
you under oath now pick a side and if you dont
run run run run
ill pick you both
run run run run
its not a joke murder she wrote

verse 4 tyler the creator
ayo take one look in the mirror implications so clear
i live life with no fear except for the idea
that one day you wont be here
i will not fetch the ball
eyes are green i eat my vegetables
it has nothin to do with that broad
but if it did guarantee shed be gone well
i got a plan but the walkin depends
if you can’t understand im a hawk in the gym
eyes on the prize got weight on my chest
that i need to get off i aint talkin to them
cant be in the picture if it got no frame
and let the world know cause i aint got no shame
blow the whole spot up cause i aint—
i wanna share last names i wanna be your number one
not the other one keep it on the low
im in my right mind keep it on a high
janis joplin spillin feelings now im out here moppin em
four on the floor pack up your bags we hit the store
grab our supplies no need for masks bust through the door
get the job done like retirement i admit you look concerned
