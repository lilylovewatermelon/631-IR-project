i remember when we was like twelve we went through hell yo
back when niggas was gettin they biggies and they pelles took
bitches used to curve me used to swerve me nigga now look
they aint never want me now they askin to get they nails done
i know i smell like dope they gassin me tellin me i smell good
passin me the pussy i passed it to my homie real quick
audacity to ask me bout the bitches that i still fuck
the audacity to ask me bout the bitches that i still fuck
your ass is lookin fat them fashion nova jeans look real good
im glad that i came up cause i aint know where i would end up
the thirty clip is on me but the hoodie cover my extendo
and niggas act so tough
but i just swear they dont wanna start though
let me tell you bout this young nigga from the bronx though
everybody want his head but nobody had his heart though
robbin everybody like he dont believe in karma
somebody told the feds what he did they lined him
told em where that nigga lived yeah they really lined him
he still sleepin at his crib like fuck it if they find him
price is on his head cause he hit a oppa
money on his head got him movin wiser
hoodie on his head they wanna pin his poncho
pulled up to the crib he livin wit his moms though
but they dont even care they like hit em all up
his eyes turned red and his fists balled up
voices in his head sayin kill them all but
bullets hittin glass goin through the walls oh
all he heard was screamin he feel like his times up
he aint have no time to go reach for a glove
he just grabbed the pump start squeezin at the door
but then he seen his moms laid out on the floor
he dropped down to his knees head high to the lord
aint the type to cry but his mom he really loved
tears from his eyes dropped beside of the blood
he wishin it wont hurt but he cried cause it does
then he put his own pump right to his mouth
