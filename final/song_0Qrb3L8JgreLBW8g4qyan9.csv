so run
run right back to school
check it

verse 1
look back i sift through all the cliques
roaming the halls all year making me sick
while everyones out trying to make the cut what
and when you think you know me right i switch it up
behind the walls smokin cigarettes and sippin vodka
i hop a fence to catch a cab aint no one can stop us
give me a break about some other mess
what were you act like its everything you got

chorus
push back the square
now that you need her but you dont
so there you go
cause back in school
we are the leaders of it all so

verse 2
stop that quit all that quit
who ruined it you did now grab a notebook and a pen
start taking notes on me and everyone whos on the top
you think were on the same page but i know were not
ill be the man watch your backpacks pens and pencils
just like keith im flippin it while you just keep it simple
you just cant go on rocking the clothes
coppin the stance cause really its everything that youre not
you might also likechorus
push back the square
now that you need her but you dont
so there you go
cause back in school
we are the leaders of it all

bridge 1
so transpose
or stop your lies
its what you do
transpose or stop your lies
so run
so why dont you run so why dont you run
so why dont you run back to school
so why dont you run so why dont you run

bridge 2
all you are now im on the next page
all you are its time to close the book up
all you are im on the next page
all you are close the book up now

chorus
push back the square
now that you need her but you dont
so there you go
cause back in school
we are the leaders of all
outro
we are the leaders of all
we are the leaders of all
so why dont you run so why dont you run
so why dont you run back to school
so why dont you run so why dont you run8embed"
