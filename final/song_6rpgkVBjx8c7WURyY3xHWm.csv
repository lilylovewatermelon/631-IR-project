pierre you’re not lone
say i hope you understand
pierre you’re my friend
there’s a place you can call home

verse 1
those eyes
tell me something’s odd
you’re there but you’re not here
you understand
you care
it might not look this way
couldn’t be less true
you understand

chorus
pierre you’re not lone
say i hope you understand
pierre you’re my friend
there’s a place you still call home

verse 2
my friend
you have a vivid quill
a gift you need to use
to feel alive
those hands
look like crooked roots
pour them the right stuff
and feel alivesee men i trust liveget tickets as low as 100you might also like1embed"
