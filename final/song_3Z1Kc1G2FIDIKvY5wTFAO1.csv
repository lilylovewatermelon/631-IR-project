a heart like a lion a burning like fire
waiting just to be set free
a heart like a lion a burning like fire
how can i bear captivity

verse 1
some they tell me im a fool a fool who walks this road alone
so afraid of making changes remember that nothing is carved in stone
oh tell me why we are so afraid of the secrets locked within our souls
everything that were made of is dying just to be exposed oh yea

prechorus
so dont turn your back on yourself cause theres nowhere to run
you know your lifes aint a practice run
its time to wake up your mind oh yea
for maybe tomorrow will never come or maybe it will but by then its too late uh huh
theres nothing left to do but cry
so now you cry and you dont know why and now you cry but you dont know why

chorus
a heart like a lion a burning like fire
waiting just to be set free
a heart like a lion a burning like fire
how can i bear captivity
see rebelution liveget tickets as low as 115you might also likeverse 2
so what you want to be now well its time to realize
that everything you need now has been right in front of your eyes
dont point your fingers and blame remember its never too late to change
dont point your fingers and blame remember it will be okay

prechorus
so dont turn your back on yourself cause theres nowhere to run
you know your lifes aint a practice run
its time to wake up your mind oh yea
for maybe tomorrow will never come or maybe it will but by then its too late uh huh
theres nothing left to do but cry
so now you cry and you dont know why and now you cry but you dont know why

bridge
you better get up you better get out
you better get up and turn your life around
you only live once you better act now
cause you never know when its going to come back around

chorus
a heart like a lion a burning like fire
waiting just to be set free
a heart like a lion a burning like fire
