verse 1 malcolm kelley
yeah
you keep hanging with my whole crew
swearing that you like me
saying that you wanna be the one to wear my nikes
coming on strong yeah over the top
i would do anything to get you to stop
to the tic tok but i cant knock
how you keep rocking your fingers in my pocket
crazy how you wanna lock it down forever more
when all i wanna do is hit it then you hit the door

pre chorus tony oller
but maybe just maybe
im tired of tryna to fight it

verse 2 malcolm kelley
i aint looking for a spouse yet
looking for a house pet
you keep telling me to look at open houses
baby that aint gonna turn me on
quit trying to make lunch plans with my mom
hold up with your hold up
got a gun in my face tryna set a wedding date
baby you keep tryna give me serious advice
when all i want from you is to get serious tonight
