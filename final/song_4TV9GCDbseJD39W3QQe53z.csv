aint it funny how your life can change with a song
thats the first time i ever heard a country boy can survive
now i got a guitar and a little band
i live hard i live fast just like a man
cause you cant just play it boy its got to be part of your life
guess im finally whiskey bent now and hell bound
ive been low but i aint ever been this far down

i need a back road somewhere deep in the pines
burning my wheels until the sun shines
cause im back at the bottom and i aint got nothing to lose
yeah i pray to the lord the struggle is strong
but ill never get out this world alive
oh hank wont you help me cause im lowdown singing the blues

almost odd in denver just the other night
i was high in the rockies on a 13 hour flight
trying to get home to my country state of mind
now these blues they come and go just like the rain
i need a little more help to ease the pain
mr weatherman wont you please push these clouds away

leave me alone cause im singing all damn night
theres a tear in my beer i guess i finally know why
see whiskey myers liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likei need a back road somewhere deep in the pines
burning my wheels until the sun shines
cause im back at the bottom and i aint got nothing to lose
yeah i pray to the lord the struggle is strong
