outro missy elliott
this is the end
bye motherfucker nah im just playin
anyway uh you know once again i hope yall enjoyed what yall heard
you know i know somebody gon walk through the door who say they still dont feel me
they you know dont like my album or maybe somebody just shitted in your corn flakes so maybe somethin stink
but far as im concerned i do what i do the best way i can
so hopefully you felt some old school flavor in there
you you may not feel like im im a real hiphop artist but
i dont have to be i grew up on hiphop and thats what motivated me to do music
uh beef back then wasnt death threats between two artists
beefs was you know uh who had the realest skills who was the dopest on the mic
so magazine ready your folks whomever you know this shit is kinda in your court
i know sometimes you want the best stories and you gotta eat too just like everybody else
but sometimes we gotta sacrifice and say the best stories dont have to be somethin negative
lets not wait til we lose another important emcee in the rap game to start sayin chill out with the dumb shit
and all of that you know um
we could all stand for goin under a lil construction
so right now i aint gon turn into reverend elliott on yall
i just love music and if you dont like it i dont give a shit
aight basically i love ya god bless goodnightembed"
