an old cowboy went ridin out one dark and windy day
upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
when all at once a mighty herd of redeyed cows he saw
plowin through the ragged skies and up a cloudy draw

verse 2
their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
a bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
for he saw the riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

chorus
yippieyioh yippieyiaie
ghost riders in the sky

verse 3
their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred their shirts all soaked with sweat
hes ridin hard to catch that herd but he aint caught em yet
cause theyve got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
on horses snortin fire as they ride on hear their cry

verse 4
as the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
if you want to save your soul from hell aridin on our range
then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
tryin to catch the devils herd across these endless skies
