i know that hearts were loving
long before i was here
and im not the first to ever cry
in my bed or in my beer
there were songs before there was radio
of love that stays and love that goes
they were writing meloncholy tunes
and tearful words that rhyme

chorus
before my timex2

verse 2
there were songs in old dusty books
of love thats always been
sweet lovers in their glory
who are now gone with the wind
old fashion love words spoken then
keep coming back around again
nothings changed except the names
their love burns just like mine

chorus

verse 3
and in the dim of yesterday
i can clearly see
that flesh and blood cried out to someone
as it does in me
and there was some old song that said
i love you til i die
you might also likechorus

verse 4
but what the old time masters had
is what i feel for you
love is love and doesnt change
in a century or two
if someway they had seen and knew
how it would be for me and you
theyd wish for love like yours
and they would wish for love like mine
before my time2embed"
