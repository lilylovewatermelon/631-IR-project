she was still sleeping the problem will stay
one more day
said shes not sorry the wind blows her way

i wish it was not true but thats the way it is
its not your fault thats the way it is
im sick of you and thats the way it is
and will always be

verse 2
wednesday is over its over again
said my goodbyes to the life we wont spend
together

chorus
i wish it was not true but thats the way it is
its not your fault thats the way it is
im sick of you and thats the way it is
