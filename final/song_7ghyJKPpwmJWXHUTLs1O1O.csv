boot flask full of jack
nobodyd look nobodyd ask
holding out on a 10 oclock 12pack
win or lose it didnt matter
cause soon as those jerseys hit the field
you know thats when it got real
with the rivalries and ridewithmes
and letmeknowwhereyouregonnabes

chorus
at the home game wed rock
that small town fame in the parking lot
all the pretty girls yelling go big blue
best part never made the front page news
it was under the bleachers
cigarette stain on my lips from cowboy red
and her kiss and all of it all of it yeah
gone in a flash the times that we had
got the pictures to prove the good and the bad
its just what we did and now nothings changed
theyre still falling in love at the home game

verse 2
ta still on her cheek
party in a field she danced with me
