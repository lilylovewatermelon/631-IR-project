for all your sight theres no sight to see
little shadow little shadow
to the night will you follow me

pardon shadow
hold on tight to your darkened key
little shadow little shadow
to the night will you follow me

closer shadow
for all your strikes still were caught between
all this sorrow little shadow
to the night will you follow me

paler shade inside
deeper deep we dive
turn and turn aside
to a fantasy
little shadow
into the night will you follow me
