i think everybody in the world has lost their mind
i believe they lost something they cannot find
cause everybody is going crazy
and everybody is out their goddamn mind

verse 1
i dont wanna watch the news to see no bad news
dont wanna be glued to the youtube
i aint paying no attention to no sick dude
eat them people up like its chinese food
killer mommas storing babies in the dumpsters
aint no education for our little youngsters
politicians operate with no structure
youre working dirty thats why we dont trust ya
everybody just wanna be famous
whiling on the internet acting all shameless
yesterday the motherfuckers was nameless
now theyre on the talkshow aint really saying shit

prehook
everybody just following a blind man
buying water for the motherfucker sandman
hoping in the ocean looking for bin ladens body
the worlds going crazy
you might also likehook
i think everybody in the world has lost their mind
i believe they lost something they cannot find
cause everybody is going crazy
and everybody is out their goddamn mind

verse 2
i asked my momma what the hell is really going on
she said the worlds too cold keep your coat on
i heard a priest tell a lie at the podium
the whole world in a state of pandemonium
dont wait for the answer it aint coming soon
they pick cause is killing like its high noon
ak47 in the classroom kids killing each other like its cartoon
everybody unemployed no education for the kids got me so annoyed
they put the money in the prison like theyre paranoid
they put the bible down to pick up the tabloid

prehook
damn were all following a blind man
buying water for the motherfucker sandman
hopping in the ocean looking for bin ladens body
the worlds going crazy

hook
i think everybody in the world has lost their mind
i believe they lost something they cannot find
cause everybody is going crazy
and everybody is out their goddamn mind4embed"
