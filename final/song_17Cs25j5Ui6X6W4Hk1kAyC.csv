verse 1
sorrow and sadness next to me
old hoes see that im on so they textin me
exbitch tryna finesse me she wont get a damn thing
listen to my story its depressing
heartbreak mixed with the drugs not the best thing
the devil tryna test me im failing inhaling

bridge
you took it all back
all that heartbreak that was a year ago
wanted you back so bad but thats

verse 2
what you dont seem to understand is
you really took my love for granted
you really had me feeling helpless thats so selfish
havent been in love in a long while
wait until my next girl finds out
that im scared we gon break up and fall out
drownin in my thoughts baby looking for a lighthouse
aint no sleep ive been feeling like a night owl
music turnt up neighbors telling me to pipe down
on the other hand i think i found my future wife
but she not here with me so it get lonely at night ayy

bridge
i hope her love doesnt go away
i hope this aint a phase
one more heartbreak and ill be
