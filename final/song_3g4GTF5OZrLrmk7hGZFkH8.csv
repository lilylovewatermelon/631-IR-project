while everybody else is getting out of bed
im usually getting in it
im not in it to win it
and theres a thousand ways you can skin it
my feet have been on the floor
flat like an idol singer
remember winger i digress
i confess you are the best thing in my life

prechorus 1
but im afraid when i hear stories
about husband and wife
theres no happy endings no henry lee
but you are the greatest thing about me

hook 1
if its love
and we decide that its forever
no one else could do it better
if its love
and were two birds of a feather
then the rest is just whatever

chorus
and if im addicted to loving you
and youre addicted to my love too
we can be them two birds of a feather
that flock together
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likepostchorus
love love
got to have something to keep us together
love love
thats enough for me

verse 2
took a loan on a house i own
cant be a queen bee without a bee throne
i wanna buy you everything
except cologne cause its poison
we can travel to spain
where the rain falls mainly on the plain
sounds insane cause it is we can laugh we can sing
have ten kids and give them everything

prechorus 2
hold our cell phones up in the air
and just be glad that we made it here alive
on a spinning ball in the middle of space
i love you from your toes to your face

hook 1
if its love
and we decide that its forever
no one else could do it better
if its love
and were two birds of a feather
then the rest is just whatever
chorus
and if im addicted to loving you
and youre addicted to my love too
we can be them two birds of a feather
that flock together

postchorus
love love
got to have something to keep us together
love love
thats enough for me

bridge
you can move in
i wont ask where youve been
cause everybody has a past
when were older well do it all over
again

verse 1
when everybody else is getting out of bed
im usually getting in it
im not in it to win it
im in it for you

hook 2
if its love
and were two birds of a feather
then the rest is just whatever
then the rest is just whatever
if its love
and we decide that its forever
no one else could do it better
chorus
and if im addicted to loving you
and youre addicted to my love too
we can be them two birds of a feather
that flock together

postchorus
love love
got to have something to keep us together
