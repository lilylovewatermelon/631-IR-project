dont cry victim to me
everything we are and used to be
is buried and gone
now its my turn to speak
its my turn to expose and release
whats been killing me
ill be damned fighting you
its impossible impossible
say goodbye with no sympathy

chorus
im entitled to overcome
completely stunned and numb
knock me down throw me to the floor
theres no pain i can feel no more
im entitled to overcome
overcome

verse 2
finally see whats beneath
everything i am and hope to be
cannot be lost
ill be damned fighting you

youll never know what i was thinking before you came round
