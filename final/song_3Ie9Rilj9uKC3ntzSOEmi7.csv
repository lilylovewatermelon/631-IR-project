i know they say that the space between
can make it stronger then weve ever seen
they might be right but i disagree
cause ive never felt stronger than when youre with me

prechorus
sometimes i wonder why you even care
cause even when i leave youre always there with me
and like a candle makes a brighter place
this mark youve made on me cant be erased

chorus
i wanna be so far gone in you
so far nothing else will ever do
i wanna be so far gone in you
in you

verse 2
ive stood alone and ive fallen down
your hands were there to pick me off the ground
sometimes i cry cause i cant believe
your love is big enough to cover me

prechorus
sometimes ive wondered if youre even there
but when i feel far away you meet me there
and like a candle makes a brighter place
this mark youve made on me cant be erased

i wanna be lost in you
like a ship in the night
i wanna get lost in you
underneath your sky
i wanna be lost in you
like a ship in the night
so far gone tonight

i wanna be so far gone in you tonight
so far nothing else will ever do tonight
