im sorry for the demon ive become
you should be sorry for the angel you are not
i apologize for the cruel things that i did
but i dont regret one single word i said

chorus
just walk away make it easy on yourself
just walk away please release me from this hell
just walk away theres just nothing left to feel
just walk away pretend that none of this is real

verse 2
would you forgive me if i told you that i cared
would you be sorry if i swore that id be there
please forgive me for laughing when you fall
im so sorry but i never cared at all

chorus
just walk away make it easy on yourself
just walk away please release me from this hell
just walk away theres just nothing left to feel
just walk away pretend that none of this is
none of this is

chorus
just walk away make it easy on us both
just walk away there was never any hope
just walk away you already know the deal
just walk away pretend that none of this was
none of this was realsee five finger death punch liveget tickets as low as 79you might also like4embed"
