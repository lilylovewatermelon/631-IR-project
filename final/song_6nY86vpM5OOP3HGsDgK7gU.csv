we take a drive just to sing along
to every word of them rolling stones
stacys mom had it going on
lived three doors down i can see her now
her daughter had a heart that was wild and free
if you blink182 then youd miss me and her
every verse had a story
yeah them pocket lighter nights lit up our days of glory

chorus
back when the air guitars were the only sound
and youd strum the chords and id put the pedal down
twoman dashboard band rollin through this town
had that rearview shakin to the kickdrum beat
leaning west coast deep in the bucket seats
all i ever wanted was right there in that car
back when we were rockstars
yeah we were runnin all night chasing down a dream
howling at the moon baby you and me
back when we were rockstars
we were runnin all night chasing down a dream
howling at the moon baby you and me

verse 2
nothin like freedom two windows down
you singin along still hear it now
way too loud and sometimes off key
but you sounded like an angel to me
youd make fun of how i threw my head
and threw my fingers up in the air
thought i was kurt cobain or jimmy page
you were side seat center stage

back when the air guitars were the only sound
and youd strum the chords and id put the pedal down
twoman dashboard band rollin through this town
had that rearview shakin to the kickdrum beat
leaning west coast deep in the bucket seats
all i ever wanted was right there in that car
back when we were rockstars
back when we were rockstars

bridge
we never ended up on mtv
or heard our voices on a cd
but in your eyes and in my arms
we were each others rockstars

chorus
back when the air guitars were the only sound
and youd strum the chords and id put the pedal down
twoman dashboard band rollin through this town
had that rearview shakin to the kickdrum beat
leaning west coast deep in the bucket seats
all i ever wanted was right there in that car
back when we were rockstars
yeah we were runnin all night chasing down a dream
howling at the moon baby you and me
yeah back when we were rockstars
we were runnin all night chasing down a dream
howling at the moon baby you and me
back when we were rockstars
we were runnin all night chasing down a dream
howling at the moon baby you and me
you and me were rockstars
we were runnin all night chasing down a dream
howling at the moon baby you and me oh yeah
runnin all night chasing down a dream
outro
yeah we were runnin all night chasing down a dream
howling at the moon baby you and me1embed"
