chorus repeat 2x
im choppin twentyfos blowin good dro
yeah i got plenty hoes but life aint picture perfect
yeah you see the ice and i dress nice
make em look twice but life aint picture perfect

verse one
yeah im blowin on some good lime skatin down 285
wouldnt believe half of the shit thats skatin through a nigga mind
745 complimented with leather and wood
chickens on my dick cause a nigga fresh and smellin good
jack boys plottin for my stacks on deck
wanna put the tech to my chest for the ice on my neck
oh yeah its easy to attain it all harder to maintain it all
if you want a perfect picture only god can paint it dawg
niggas in these videos with multiplatinum projects
caint even get credit cards and they momma stay in projects
how is that scracth my head somethin dont seem right
your teeth full of ice so when you smile i seen lights
seems like im hatin im just statin the facts
i aint fin ta smile in your face and put a blade in your back
now now try not to get caught up on the way shit looks
cause everything aint picture perfect nigga listen to the hook

verse two
yeah im off in magic city trickin off on ass and titties
bitches blowin me kisses makin me wanna hit it
i must admit it got a good chick and she been holdin me down
but i aint fuck around theres too much shit goin round
like the rims on my pickup scared to get my dick sucked
nigga run into the clinic even from a hiccup
pick up the pieces to the fuckin puzzle
im affiliated with niggas who murder rob and hustle
plus you think im ballin cause im poppin crist and spendin gs
im just tryin to drink away the pain that killed my nigga steve
nigga please i aint shit cookies and cream
feelin like marvin it make me wanna holla and scream

chorus

verse three
now half the shit you doin already been done
and thats why half my niggas dead locked up or on the run
that dope money aint sufficient it dont last always
niggas trap all night in project hallways
all day long niggas front like stars
on them big ass rims that cost more than they cars
spent three hundred on the outfit a hundred on some nikes
but his baby needs wipes diapers and pedialite
and you probably got a cousin brother or a friend
and this song sound like him from beginnin to end
then again it might be me and im tired of the nonsense
caint sleep at night cause i got a guilty conscience
chorus

outro
cant you see cant you see cant you see
cant you see cant you seeeeeeeeeeee
cant you see repeats to fadeembed"
