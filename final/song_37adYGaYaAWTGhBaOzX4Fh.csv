verse 1
i dont ever wanna pick a slice
one is pretty but the other lies
chewing on a fat smoke
no filter but youre puffing
sucking on a slim vogue
dark fingernail polish

verse 2
im the treasure baby im the prize
cut me rails of that fresh cherry pie
shitty old pistola
shot a bullet through my wallet
gonna go to pensacola
gonna fuck my way through college

chorus
youve gone with the thick rims
big look with the lip ring and things
wake me when the bell rings
im gonna sleep cause you live in my daydreams
youve gone with the thick rims
big look with the lip ring and things
wake me when the bell rings
im gonna sleep cause you live in my daydreams

sitting pretty in the prime of life
im so tasty and the price is right
stewing in the black dope
im filthy and i love it
studebaker all gold
got a shotgun in my pocket

chorus
youve gone with the thick rims
big look with the lip ring and things
wake me when the bell rings
im gonna sleep cause you live in my daydreams25embed"
