same streets same party
drowning their problems in bacardi
same people still talking
whoa im so over it im sorry

chorus
baby you and me can leave right now
ditch all your friends and the guy you came with
get to know you where it aint so loud
just you and me alone some old moonlit road
well the two of us could disappear
just say the word well get outta here
baby you and me can leave right now
meet me out back if you like how that sounds
