why does it feel like night today
something in heres not right today
why am i so uptight today
paranoias all i got left
i dont know what stressed me first
or how the pressure was fed
but i know just what it feels like
to have a voice in the back of my head

prechorus mike shinoda
like a face that i hold inside
a face that awakes when i close my eyes
a face that watches every time i lie
a face that laughs every time i fall
and watches everything
so i know that when its time to sink or swim
that the face inside is here in me
right underneath my skin

chorus chester bennington  mike shinoda
its like im paranoid lookin over my back
its like a whirlwind inside of my head
its like i cant stop what im hearin within
its like the face inside is right beneath my skin

i know ive got a face in me
points out all my mistakes to me
youve got a face on the inside too
and your paranoias probably worse
i dont know what set me off first
but i know what i cant stand
everybody acts like the fact of the matter
is i cant add up to what you can

prechorus mike shinoda
but everybody has a face that they hold inside
a face that awakes when i close my eyes
a face that watches every time they lie
a face that laughs every time they fall
and watches everything
so you know that when its time to sink or swim
that the face inside is watchin you too
right inside your skin

chorus chester bennington  mike shinoda
its like im paranoid lookin over my back
its like a whirlwind inside of my head
its like i cant stop what im hearin within
its like the face inside is right beneath the skin
its like im paranoid lookin over my back
its like a whirlwind inside of my head
its like i cant stop what im hearin within
its like the face inside is right beneath the skin
postchorus mike shinoda
the face inside is right beneath your skin
the face inside is right beneath your skin
the face inside is right beneath your skin

bridge chester bennington
