when all those police men come chasin after you
you better run away keep yourself from day
hide out in the night they leave you without any right
i dont know why they are coming to take you away
if you had reasoned theyd call it treason
and blow your sorry ass away
you better run away get out while you still can
theres blood in your eyes your not a mortal manyou might also likeembed"
