we aint goin to the town
were goin to the city

and make this place a heart
to be a part of again

so baby make it with me in preparation for tonight
weve got so much to leave but thats not what makes this right
youve been building up steam ignited by this fight
so do this thing with me instead of tying on a tight one tonight
