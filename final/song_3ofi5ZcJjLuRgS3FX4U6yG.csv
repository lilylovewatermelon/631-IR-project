i only thought it for a minute but it got me down
the kind of feeling when youve got something to cry about
and all the talking turned to screaming that i couldnt help
this isnt me me me
i only thought it for a moment but its crippling
i guess the gravity of going out is sinking in
what if im missing the capacity for all of it
this isnt me me me

chorus
and im so scared of losing all control
dont you tell me its better to let go
when the weight of the world feels so close
its only me me me

verse 2
audrey told me that she thinks it might be in my head
how im overthinking everything i never said
how its killing me a little to be different oh
it isnt me me me

chorus
but im so scared of losing all control
dont you tell me its better to let go
when the weight of the world feels so close
its only me me me

hard to sleep could it be
only me only me
hard to sleep could it be
only me only me
hard to sleep could it be
only me only me
hard to sleep could it be
only me only me
mmmm mmhmm

outro
im so scared of losing control
when they tell me its better to let go
when the weight of the world feels so close
its only me me me
and im so scared of losing all control
when they tell me its better to let go
when the weight of the world is so close
its only me me me me me
its only me me me2embed"
