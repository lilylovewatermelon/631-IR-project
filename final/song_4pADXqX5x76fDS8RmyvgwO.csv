what has come over me
what madness taken hold of my heart
to run away the only answer
pulling me away to fall upon the night
the source of my recovery
sweet shadow taking hold of the light
another day has been devoured
calling me away bringing a question why

refrain
for saving me from all they’ve taken
let my honor fall again
giving me the strength to face them
feeling it taking over

prechorus
now
on a path to take it all away
there can be no better way of

chorus
knowing
in a world beyond controlling
are you gonna deny the savior
in front of your eyes
stare into the night
power beyond containing
are you gonna remain a slave
for the rest of your life
give into the night

this selfdiscovery
redemption taking hold of my mind
a serenade of haunting voices
calling me away to feast upon the night
the source of my felicity
dark maiden taking hold of my hand
lead me away from hibernation
strong and unafraid never a question why

refrain
for saving me from all they’ve taken
let my honor fall again
giving me the strength to face them
feeling it taking over

prechorus
now
on a path to take it all away
there can be no better way of

chorus
knowing
in a world beyond controlling
are you gonna deny the savior
in front of your eyes
stare into the night
power beyond containing
are you gonna remain a slave
for the rest of your life
give into the night
