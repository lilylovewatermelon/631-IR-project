let me paint a picture for you
then ill have to teach you to see it
illustrate the remnants of the life
i used to live here in eden
rolled a lucky pair of dice ended up in paradise
landed on a snakes eyes
took a bite and ended up bleedin

hook
you know if i could change anything
i think i would start with the name
the truth is all those angels started acting the same
and i know theres no going back now
cause life in eden
life in eden changed
no way to make the pain play fair
it doesnt disappear just because you say it isnt there
so when they ask whyd she go
you can say
cause life in eden
life in eden changed
life in eden changed

verse 2
walking in the garden
was a serpentshaped heart and he told me
that what is broken cannot show
and less than beautiful is worse than unholy
idolized my innocence stole it from me in the end
now im wide awakened
and still paying for the poison they sold me

you know if i could change anything
i think i would start with the name
the truth is all those angels started acting the same
and i know theres no going back now
cause life in eden
life in eden changed
no way to make the pain play fair
it doesnt disappear just because you say it isnt there
so when they ask whyd she go
you can say
cause life in eden
life in eden changed
life in eden changed

bridge
there was a time when
i was taking all bets
that this place was even better than
asgoodasitgets
and now looking back from the outside in
i think i was choking on the air in eden
choking on the air in eden
cause life in eden changed

hook
you know if i could change anything
i think i would start with the name
the truth is all those angels started acting the same
and i know theres no going back now
cause life in eden
life in eden changed
no way to make the pain play fair
it doesnt disappear just because you say it isnt there
so when they ask whyd she go
you can say
cause life in eden
life in eden changed
when they ask whyd she go
cause life in eden
life in eden changed
life in eden changed
life in eden changedembed"
