in a conversation but my mind is out the back door
watching this unfold like i am floating right above it
jake is on his phone and ill admit that i dont love it
i just said that when my friends moved here id interact more
who am i to judge i just detach it might be harder
harder not to tell you man whats really going on
in our conversation and im looking right down on it
then you pull my body back and whisper in my ear

prechorus
its easy to see it all with you it might be right there

chorus
somethings happening to me
a passing glance i see
in your eyes the man that i could be

break
change
for a minute in the sunlight
change
at the mention of a conflict
i change
when the jacket doesnt fit right
change
when you know it isnt perfect

dl909 at altitude my mind aint on it
knocking on the door entire years i locked away
but i can recollect a memory that i have forgotten
cut your ties believed your lies your final accolade

prechorus
but every mistake ive ever made has led me right here
its easier to refuse to change year after year

chorus
somethings happening to me
a change that i can see
i thought that change was bad
you have changed my mind
and put my heart at ease
i dont know what will be
somethings happening to me and i dont even think i wanna know
a passing glance i see just let go
in your eyes the man that i could be4embed"
