if i could put my problems in a paper
then id roll em up and blow em away
if i could find a pill to solve em
i would take a bottle and id be okay
if i could fit my sorrows in a glass
id pour a double shot and drink em away
if life was that easy then id never have to worry for the rest of my days
but life just aint that easy oh no no no
its taken its toll on me deep down in my soul

verse 1 jelly roll
cheers bottoms up
i wish that i could roll my problems up
wish i could put em in a pill and just swallow em
wish i could swallow em every time i pick the bottle up
then i would chug chug
you know that i would kill it get fucked up
i wish that that would end it
drowning in my liquor meant the drummer would be finished
but in reality that would just be the beginning
i really got a feeling that its time for me to change
instead of really dealing with it i just keep running away
i gotta start dealing with the shit thats on my plate
but its hard when im sick from the shit that i done ate
and im nauseous
and its hard to sleep at night when im turning and tossing
and its hard for a man like me to accept my losses
what do we do now when you froze inside
and its cold outside and the heat goes out
when youre already late and you gotta detour cause the streets shutdown
and its all on you cause you know you cant let your people down
you gotta go in beast mode now

if i could put my problems in a paper
then id roll em up and blow em away
if i could find a pill to solve em

if life was that easy then id never have to worry for the rest of my days

verse 2 brix
all my life i been fucking up
all my life i been not enough
its hard to learn to love when your mama just treat you like you aint nothing
she chose her man over her kids
stuck with him through a bid
but she wont answer my fucking call
man that shit just bring me to tears but fuck that
i gotta be strong cause i know my son is watching
i gotta make sure my daughter see her daddy thriving
cause these kids gon do what you do but not what you say
im teaching em that its not okay to be just okay thats never okay
feeling stress as i sit and reminisce about my open cases
a nigga meditate just to renovate all of my broken places
on the real i think i need therapy
cause some of these thoughts i be having just be scaring me
scaring me uh
hook jelly roll
if i could put my problems in a paper
then id roll em up and blow em away
if i could find a pill to solve em
i would take a bottle and id be okay
if i could fit my sorrows in a glass
id pour a double shot and drink em away
if life was that easy then id never have to worry for the rest of my days
but life just aint that easy oh no no no
its taken its toll on me deep down in my soul

outro
life aint just that easy oh no
its taking a toll on me deep down in my soulembed"
