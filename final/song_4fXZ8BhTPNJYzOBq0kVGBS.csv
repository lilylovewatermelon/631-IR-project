took a little breather of my own
i might be too far gone
little fragments of my life
are slowly dying
trying not to be so far from home
but will i be there alone
fragile pieces of my mind
im feeling paralyzed compromised

chorus
so let it out let it go
just spit it out straight till im not breathing
get it out take it all
just let it all find a way to be
so let it out let it go
just spit it out straight till im not breathing
get it out take it all
just let it all find a way to be
a way to be

verse 2
critical decisions took too long
my promises are strong
watching loyalties divide
so im taking back my life
golden visions from now on
cant carry you alone
no more explanations why
ive erased the dramatized neutralized

so let it out let it go
just spit it out straight till im not breathing
get it out take it all
just let it all find a way to be
so let it out let it go
just spit it out straight till im not breathing
get it out take it all
just let it all find a way to be
a way to be

so let it all out let it all go
let it out let it all out
so let it all out let it all go
let it out let it all out
so let it all out

chorus
so let it out let it go
just spit it out straight till im not breathing
get it out take it all
just let it all find a way to be
so let it out let it go
just spit it out straight till im not breathing
get it out take it all
just let it all find a way to be
a way to beembed"
