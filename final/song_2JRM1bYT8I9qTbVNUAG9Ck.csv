okay
i woke up in heaven today
she kissed me i floated away away
never felt anything so great mm
alright
now i brace myself for the fight
somethin must go wrong cause its way too right
im light as a feather tonight
yeah yeah

chorus
cause i cant feel the ground
someone let me down
ive never felt so high as i do now
its too good to be true
i dont deserve you
i never felt a love strong enough to
stop this world from spinnin
mm stop this world from spinnin
yeah yeah

verse 2
and i see
heaven when she looks at me
and her smile is the most amazing dream
and in her eyes i fall asleep oh oh
and i hope oh
hope that she can see through the smoke
of my imperfections into my soul
and my heart where she has control
she has control
