my heads facing down
watching specs in the road
whiz by before my eyes

take a two hour break to watch nosferatu
the old german vampire with the blinds closed
when the credits hit turn it off
and hit the streets of 4 pm once again

pedaling around
humiditys down
no longer curling my hair
so i stop off for a fountain drink

i pretend its a beer with a citrus aftertaste
and i wave hello to a guy i know but he cant recall my name
even though he once told me i was the most
talented person that hed ever met

pedaling around
my heads facing down
listening to the tires
on the asphalt below

wondering just how hot oozing tar would have to be to melt them
if it could would they explode or would the air leak slowly
just to play it safe i steer around the small patches of that black
goopy stuff but i do enjoy a deep inhale as i roll on by

my heads facing down
sweaty bangs in my eyes

half steering half eating ice cream
half steering half eating ice cream
half steering half eating ice cream
half steering half eating ice creamembed"
