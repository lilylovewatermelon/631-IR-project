something that i felt today something that i heard
swingin from the chandelier hangin on your word
i remember watching you once upon a time
dancin from across the room in another life

chorus
a little bit of resolve is what i need now
pin me down show me how
a little bit of resolve is what i need now
pin me down show me how

verse 2
lookin back to find my way never seemed so hard
yesterdays been laid to rest changin of the guard
i would never change a thing even if i could
all the songs we used to sing everything was good

chorus
a little bit of resolve is what i need now
pin me down show me how
a little bit of resolve is what i need now
pin me down show me how

one more tear that you wont hear
thats gone and passed you by
