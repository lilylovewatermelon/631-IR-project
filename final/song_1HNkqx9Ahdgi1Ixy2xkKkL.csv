lovin can hurt
lovin can hurt sometimes
but its the only thing that i know
and when it gets hard
you know it can get hard sometimes
it is the only thing that makes us feel alive

prechorus
we keep this love in a photograph
we made these memories for ourselves
where our eyes are never closin
hearts are never broken
and times forever frozen still

chorus
so you can keep me
inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
holdin me closer till our eyes meet
you wont ever be alone
wait for me to come home

verse 2
lovin can heal
lovin can mend your soul
and its the only thing that i know know
i swear it will get easier
remember that with every piece of ya
mm and its the only thing we take with us when we die

mm we keep this love in this photograph
we made these memories for ourselves
where our eyes are never closin
hearts were never broken
and times forever frozen still

chorus
so you can keep me
inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
holdin me closer till our eyes meet
you wont ever be alone
and if you hurt me
well thats okay baby only words bleed
inside these pages you just hold me
and i wont ever let you go
wait for me to come home

bridge
wait for me to come home
wait for me to come home
wait for me to come home

chorus
oh you can fit me
inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen
next to your heartbeat where i should be
keep it deep within your soul
and if you hurt me
well thats okay baby only words bleed
inside these pages you just hold me
and i wont ever let you go
outro
when im away i will remember how you kissed me
under the lamppost back on sixth street
hearin you whisper through the phone
wait for me to come home275embed"
