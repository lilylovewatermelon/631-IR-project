mr schuester chucklingi’m really happy for you son

will tell you the truth i’m terrified i don’t know how to do this

mr schuester no one does look at me i was a mess i worked all the time traveling i was too strict

will okay you’re not instilling with a great deal of confidence here dad sighs i mean i’m already up all night thinking about this

mr schuester that’s my fault– the confidence thing boys learn that from their fathers i started at zuckerman and zuckerman in college i needed some extra cash i was saving up for law school but i never went i never even applied didn’t have the balls so i settled for insurance i mean who was i to become a lawyer

will you would have been a great one you’re the smartest guy i know

mr schuester it’s not about brains son being a good father– hell being a man– is all about one thing guts and you’ve got about six months to figure out if you have any

int cut to choir room  day

will five six seven eight step and step step and step and turn it around down and up and hit hit down hit
rachel can we stop please

will you don’t have to ask me every time for permission to go to the bathroom rachel you can just go

rachel it’s not my bladder it’s the choreography

will okay what’s wrong with the choreography

rachel it sucks

int cut to hallway  day

quinn it sucks

santana it’s completely unoriginal

rachel are you guys going to get shunned for talking to me

quinn sweetie we’re a team now but you’ve got to do something about mr shue’s dance routines

int cut to choir room  day

rachel we can’t compete with vocal adrenaline with these steps you’re a great vocal coach mr shue but you’re not a a trained choreographer that’s what we need to be the best we need dakota stanley

int cut to hallway  day
quinn he’s the best show choir choreographer in the midwest he works with vocal adrenaline

santana you can’t take regionals without him he was the understudy to the candelabra in beauty and the beast on broadway

int cut to choir room  day

will just because he understudied doesn’t mean he ever performed

quinn did you ever perform mr schuester after high school did you even try

int cut to emma’s office  day

will i wanted to that was my dream you know ii just never had…

emma the guts they say it takes more certainty than talent to be a star i mean look at um look at john stamos

will i don’t know i guess i’m also just nervous about being a dad you know i want my kid to be proud of mei want to set a good example you know ii hope it’s cool– me unloading on you like this i don’t want there to be any awkwardness

emma oh no no none at all i mean you know especially since… we’re um we’re both in relationships now it’s both of us

right i’m in a relationship you’re in a relationship

will exactly yeah how’s it going with ken

emma great it’s great it’s wonderful i mean you know he’she’s flawed but hehe knows who he is and that’sthat’s great and there really is nothing sexier in a man than confidence you know

will wry laugh sandy i thought you weren’t allowed on campus

sandy no william i’m not allowed within 50 feet of children besides henri and i go way back i got him a job before we even had a shop class i told figgins that you are going to have a school full of nancies unless you get some hot wood in those teenagers’ hands here comes henri

will ah shoot terri was supposed to bring a cake

henri i’m back

will in voiceover henri had a little problem with overthecounter cough medicine

henri is shown using a saw he ended up cutting off his thumbs it was a real tragedy

henri i’ll never hitchhike across europe that was a dream man howard walks in carrying a cake with two thumbs ups

will where’s terri

howard doing inventory i can’t count higher than 30

willyou know this is nice i can’t remember the last time i just hung out with the guys really talked about our feelings

ken want to know what i’m feeling i live at the ymca i only have one pair of long pants

sandy oh please my life is a disaster with no creative outlet other than writing my desperate housewives fan fiction

howard i’m afraid of my vacuum

will i know how you guys feel i apparently don’t know how to dance

henri i don’t have thumbs

will uh sorry

henri sobbing sandy begins singing “for he’s a jolly good fellow” the others join in harmonizing sniffling

will hey that was pretty good begins singing ♫ this is how we do it ♫ men beat boxing two weeks ago i would have agreed that four grown men rehearsing a capella hiphop in my living room was embarrassing but busting out some whitehot new jack swing i’ll tell you i’ve never felt more confident henri though we should call our group…

henri crescendudes

will while ken thought…

ken testotertones

will …was more manly and then we heard a single word leave howard’s lips and we knew we had our name

howard acafellas

♫ yo we made it it feels so good ♫

sandy i’m ready for my closeup mr demille

will sandy we voted when you’re in the group it’s creepy

sandy wait i… will closes the door

♫ this is how we do it ♫ man beat boxing ♫ this is how we do it ♫

terri will if i don’t get some sleep i could miscarry

will i’m sorry terri i’ll be right in

terri i hope so

will in voiceover being in a boy band did wonders for our love life seeing me feel so good about myself made my wife more attracted to me in every way sighs it was amazing i mean we started doing it once a week it was like she was trying to make a twin

int cut to choir room  day

bell ringing

rachel walking in he’s not coming

finn what happened

int cut to will’s spanish room

rachel they’re my famous sugar cookies i bake them for the poor during christmastime but i whipped up a special batch just for you i wanted to say how sorry i was for what i said

will don’t be you were right you know the truth is rachel if you weren’t so hard on me i never would have had the guts to start acafellas

rachel but we need you mr schue you’ve missed six rehearsals in the past couple of weeks and when you’re there you’re not really there

will which is why i think you should go ahead and hire montana

rachel dakota

will whatever you know i’ll still be there to help you guys sing and stuff but uh i just don’t have time for all of it anymore

int cut to choir room  day

finn of course he doesn’t want anything to do with us after you kicked him in the nads

rachel then why did he thank me

santana the goal is to win and now that mr schuester has agreed to let us hire dakota stanley we can

finn but he doesn’t want us to he just doesn’t have the confidence to coach us anymore guys are real sensitive when it comes to this kind of stuff

rachel and that’s my fault

finn do you see anyone else in here with a plate of “i’m sorry” cookies i don’t just you

quinn i’m bored all those in favor of hiring dakota stanley all except finn raise their hand

bell ringing

int cut to hallway  day

finn hey wait up you can’t do this to mr schuester

rachel what make him a hero once we hire dakota and win nationals he’ll thank me for it you heard santana it’s all about winning

finn since when

rachel look you have your popular clique and your football and your cliché of a blonde girlfriend glee is my one shot if this doesn’t work out then my whole high school life will be nothing but an embarrassment

finn what’s a cliché is that a bad thing wait wait wait wait wait is this one of those chick things where you’re pissed about one thing but you’re just pretending like you’re pissed about something else ‘cause…

rachel i don’t know what you’re talking about

finn well for a while there you were kind of all over me and now you just yell at me all the time it makes me think that you’re still upset about what happened in the auditorium

rachel i’m not i’ve moved on and i’m focusing on my career now

finn so you want to talk about it

rachel no and neither do you it’s kind of ironic how you’re mr popular and i’m just this nobody that everybody makes fun of but i have enough confidence to say out loud that what happened between us in the auditorium was real you have feelings for me and you just don’t have the guts to admit it we’re hiring dakota stanley

finn even if it means me quitting

rachel yes

int cut to sue’s office  day

sue it’s a good start you’re sewing the seeds of destruction

quinn mr schuester barely even shows up for rehearsals

sue oh no no no “barely” will not cut it i will not be satisfied until glee club is disbanded and what about this dakota character any chance he actually helps

quinn they’re soft he’ll eat them alive i give them 15 minutes before the first one quits or tries to commit suicide

finn now just hold on a second

dakota what what was that frankenteen why don’t you uh wipe that dopey look off your face and get some lotion for those knuckles you’ve been dragging on the ground

finn what’s wrong with you

dakota what’s wrong with me what’s wrong with me is that you’re freakishly tall i feel like a woodland creature um am i hurting your feelings did i say something wrong because i thought you wanted somebody who respected you enough to tell you the truth but maybe you don’t have the confidence to hear it hmm maybe you need somebody who’s going to lie to you and tell you things like “you got what it takes” but you know what as far as i can see you don’t so why don’t you just take a little second take a breather and ask yourself “do i want to be a winner laughs or not”

finn screw this i quit

tina me ttttoo let’s roll artie

dakota no great great you know separate the wheat from the chaff that’s perfect

rachel wait barbra streisand when barbra was a young ingénue everyone told her in order to be a star she’d have to get a nose job thankfully she refused

dakota where’s this going yentl

rachel where it’s going is that we don’t need you let’s face it we’re never going to be as good of dancers as vocal adrenaline we’re gonna win because we’re different and that’s what makes us special

mercedes they told j lo her booty was too big

artie curtis mayfield was more successful after he became paralyzed
