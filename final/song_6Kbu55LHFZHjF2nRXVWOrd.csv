walk a thousand miles
just to see her see her

hook chris richardson
but she’s far far away
and i’d do anything just to see her face
but she’s far far away
walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

verse 1 tyga
sittin’ on a plane
reminscing back when i made that mistake
i wish it never ended with a heartbreak
now your heart broken tears in ya face
ask myself why looking at the sky
if i could turn back i’d make it all right
praying that you better but its still stormy weather
don’t wanna let go but the rain wont let up
now you gone still thinking bout you everyday
and i know feelings was hurt and you can blame me but
i’m sorry for the games that i played
but now it’s too late
and now she’s…

hook chris richardson
but she’s far far away
and i’d do anything just to see her face
but she’s far far away
walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again
see tyga liveget tickets as low as 300you might also likeverse 2 tyga
it’s cold putting up a fight
arguing back and forth through the night
regardless what i said i don’t mean most of it
you know i really love you this the realest goin’ get
it take time to realize what you really wanna know
you was ready for it all but your feelings i ignored
i know my fault i should’ve gave more
now you’re miles away and i’m miles on tour
now it’s drums playing crowd singing
life changing wish you was here to witness all
now that starts fading
they say two wrongs don’t make it right
and i was wrong and now it aint right

hook chris richardson
but she’s far far away
and i’d do anything just to see her face
but she’s far far away
walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

bridge tyga  chris richardson
na na na nah
if i could turn back
if i could make it right
i’d do just that
if i could make it right
i’d do it all tonight
hold you in my arms with you i’d spend my life
na na na nah
if i could turn back
if i could make it right
i’d do just that
i’d do just that
if i could turn back
come back here again
hook chris richardson
but she’s far far away
and i’d do anything just to see her face
but she’s far far away
walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again
