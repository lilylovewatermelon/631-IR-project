walking slowly tryna find a place to go
you begin to talk about your ex
and the way that he would lose control
and all your friends are trying to throw me
theyre asking questions i dont know
but baby i would buy you drinks too
but i dont think you need no more

chorus
then you said i need nothing from nobody
i can see it on your face youre hurting grab a hold of me
i said baby cant you see
that your past is your past
oh babe youve got a hold of me
youve got a hold of me ohooh
cause your past is your past
oh babe youve got a hold of me

verse 2
im tryna figure you out
as youre starin straight back at me
and you tell me you dont like your father
cause he would never let you be
and now youre standing beside the window
youre covered in the light from the street
and i say that it gets cold here in winter
do you want my coat youll freeze

then you said i need nothing from nobody
i can see it on your face youre hurting grab a hold of me
oh baby cant you see
that your past is your past
oh babe youve got a hold of me
youve got a hold of me ohooh
cause your past is your past
oh babe youve got a hold of me

bridge
youve been holding on so long
you keep pushing me out
you dont know where you belong

chorus
i need nothing from nobody
but i can see it on your face youre hurting grab a hold of me
i said baby cant you see
that your past is your past
oh babe youve got a hold of me
youve got a hold of me ohooh
cause your past is your past
oh babe youve got a hold of me
ohooh ohooh ohooh1embed"
