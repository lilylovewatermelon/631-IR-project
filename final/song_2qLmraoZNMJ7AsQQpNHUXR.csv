or some old umbrella to hold off the rain
dont have to cross over a river of tears all that i need is right here

chorus
holding you holds me together
when holding on gets just a little to hard
when this tight rope i travel
begins to unravel and i feel like
im falling apart
holding you holds me together

you know lifes a freight liner on a runaway track
but ill take the ride knowing that youll bring me back
no fates too uncertain no distance to far
as long as youre herre in my arms

repeat chorus
whenever i hold you tight
this crazy world of mine falls right in place
whatever the trouble is
you find a way to give back what it takes

when this tight rope i travel
begins to unravel and i feel like im falling apart
holding you holds me together
holding you holds me togetheryou might also likeembed"
