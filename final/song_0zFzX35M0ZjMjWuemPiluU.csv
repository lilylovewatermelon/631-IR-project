passin the kind buds
kickin back in the sand in the sun
to be alive is lovin where the shore meets the sea
man im hummin im hummin

prechorus
im free as i stare at the sea
and im not comin down
the world is yours once you have found
the good is to share
which is elsewhere

verse 2
the beauty of green is where light is now broken
by what it touches
remembering what you once had told me hit home
and hasnt it always been so

prechorus
im free as i stare at the sea
and im not comin down
the world is yours once you have found
the good is to share
which is elsewhere
