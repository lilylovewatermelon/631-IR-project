im living incomplete
my mind is racing day to day
its bleeding every part of me
ive been swimming in desire
thats fueling my soul
but i cant feed this fire alone

chorus
i cant feel alive
if i cant breathe the air thats been frozen
when youre so far away
and i just need to find
a simple kind of way to keep you closer
cause youre every part of me

verse 2
am i everything youll need
are you craving me the same way
inside my bodys screaming
im addicted to your taste
and the way you like to show me
how weve become one and the same

chorus
i cant feel alive
if i cant breathe the air thats been frozen
when youre so far away
and i just need to find
a simple kind of way to keep you closer
cause youre every part of me

every night ive been bleeding
its tearing me apart down to my bones
every time i feel completed
theres always one more thing
reminding me that im not whole
how can i let you go

chorus
i cant feel alive
if i cant breathe the air thats been frozen
when youre so far away
and i just need to find
a simple kind of way to keep you closer
cause youre every part of me

outro
every part of me
every part of meembed"
