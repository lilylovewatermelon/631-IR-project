verse 3 kanye west
tell me now can you make it past your caspers
so we can finally fly off into nasa
you was always the cheerleader of my dreams
that seemed to only date the head of football teams
and i was the class clown that always kept you laughing
we were never meant to be baby we just happened
so please dont mess up the trick
hey young world im the new slick rick
they say i move too quick but we cant let this moment pass us
let the hourglass pass right into ashes
let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
so i wrote this love letter right before my classes
how could a goddess ask someone thats only average for advice
omg you listen to that bitch
woe is me baby this is tragic
cause we had it we was magic
i was flyin now im crashing
this is bad real bad—michael jackson
now im mad real mad—joe jackson
you should leave your boyfriend now ima ask him
bridge keri hilson
so you gotta take the good with the bad happy and the sad
well will you bring a better future than i had in the past
oh cause i dont wanna make the same mistakes i did
i dont wanna fall back on my face again
whoa whoa mmhmmh ill admit it
i was scared to answer loves call
whoa whoa and if it hits better make it worth the fall
when it comes around hey
