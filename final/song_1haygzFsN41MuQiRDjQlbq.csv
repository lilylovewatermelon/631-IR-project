the one who is eager to hear of your sorrows
who says that the things that youre doing are not who you are

take your clothes off and jump into bed
and search for that happy thought the one from before
about how pleasant it would be if people wished they could be like you

throw your shoes on and hop on your bike
the cold air is good for you might want to stop somewhere
to pray with your friends
as you search for a love you can live inside of

lay your heart down and call it a day
its so hard to see you when fear is consuming you

when will you see yourself
try to forgive yourself
you just cant help yourself
you just cant help yourself
you just cant help yourself
you just cant help yourselfyou might also like1embed"
