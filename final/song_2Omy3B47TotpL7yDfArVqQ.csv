and after the storm
i run and run as the rains come
and i look up i look up
on my knees and out of luck
i look up

night has always pushed up day
you must know life to see decay
but i wont rot i wont rot
not this mind and not this heart
i wont rot

prechorus 1
and i took you by the hand
and we stood tall
and remembered our own land
what we lived for

chorus
but there will come a time
youll see with no more tears
and love will not break your heart
but dismiss your fears
get over your hill and see
what you find there
with grace in your heart
and flowers in your hair

and now i cling to what i knew
i saw exactly what was true
but oh no more
thats why i hold
thats why i hold with all i have
thats why i hold

prechorus 2
and i wont die alone
and be left there
well i guess ill just go home
oh god knows where
because death is just so full
and man so small
well im scared of whats behind
and whats before

chorus
there will come a time
youll see with no more tears
and love will not break your heart
but dismiss your fears
get over your hill and see
what you find there
with grace in your heart
and flowers in your hair
and there will come a time
youll see with no more tears
and love will not break your heart
but dismiss your fears
get over your hill and see
what you find there
with grace in your heart
and flowers in your hair14embed"
