i know i know the sun is hot
mosquitoes come suck your blood
and leave you there all alone
just skin and bone
when you walk among the trees
listening to the leaves
the further i go the less i know
the less i know

chorus
where will you run
where will you hide
lullabies to paralyze

verse 2
fat and soft pink and weak
foot and thigh tongue and cheek
you know im told they swallow you whole
skin and bone
cutting boards and hanging hooks
bloody knives cooking books
promising you wont feel a thing at all

chorus
swallow and chew
eat you alive
all of us food that hasnt died
see queens of the stone age liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likebridge
and the knife says

instrumental break

verse 3
simmering pick and pluck
tenderize bone to dust
the sweetest grease finest meat
youll ever taste taste
so you scream whine and yell
supple sounds of dinner bells
we all will feed the worms and trees
so dont be shy

chorus
swallow and chew
eat you alive
all of us food that hasnt died4embed"
