i look to the sky but theres nobody watchin
left here behind all alone and forgotten
so now the world belongs to me
the world belongs to me

verse 1
so many roads that ive taken
when nobody thought i could make it
and even though i had to go it alone i still survived
when you live in the darkness theres always confusion
sometimes your mind will provide the illusion
and your life can change in the blink of an eye yeah

chorus
i look to the sky but theres nobody watchin
left here behind all alone and forgotten
so now the world belongs to me
to live and to die by the word that is spoken
the legends a lie and the silence is broken
so now the world belongs to me
the world belongs to me

verse 2
i opened a box full of secrets
where the strongest of locks couldnt keep them
and even though i was the last to know they were livin inside
when you see through the darkness and find a solution
how quickly your eyes will remove the illusion
your life is gonna change in the blink of an eye yeah yeah

chorus
i look to the sky but theres nobody watchin

so now the world belongs to me
