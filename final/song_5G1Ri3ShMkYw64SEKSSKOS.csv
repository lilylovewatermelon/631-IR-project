broken home
all alone
broken home
all alone

verse 1
i cant seem to fight these feelings
im caught in the middle of this
and my wounds are not healing
im stuck in between my parents
i wish i had someone to talk to
someone i could confide in
i just want to know the truth i just want to know the truth
want to know the truth

chorus
broken home
all alone

verse 2
i know my mother loves me
but does my father even care
if im sad or angry
you were never ever there
when i needed you
i hope you regret what you did
i think i know the truth
your father did the same to you did the same to you

well im crying day and night now
what is wrong with me
i cannot fight now
i feel like a weak link
crying day and night now
what is wrong with me
well i cannot fight now
i feel like a weak link a weak link

chorus
broken home
all alone

verse 4
it feels bad to be alone
crying by yourself living in a broken home
how could i tell it so all you all could feel it
depression strikes me hard just like my old earth would tell it
to me her son she told me im the one
pain bottled up about to blow like a gun
stories that i tell are nonfiction
and you cant take it back cause its already done

chorus
broken home
broken home
verse 5
cant seem to fight these feelings
caught in the middle of this
my wounds are not healing
stuck in between my parents

outro
