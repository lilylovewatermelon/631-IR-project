this world will never be what i expected
and if i dont belong who would have guessed it

prechorus
i will not leave alone everything that i own
to make you feel like its not too late
its never too late

chorus
even if i say itll be alright
still i hear you say you want to end your life
now and again we try to just stay alive
maybe well turn it all around
cause its not too late
its never too late

verse 2
no one will ever see the side reflected
and if theres something wrong who would have guessed it

prechorus
and i have left alone everything that i own
to make you feel like its not too late
its never too late

even if i say itll be alright
still i hear you say you want to end your life
now and again we try to just stay alive
maybe well turn it all around
cause its not too late

bridge
the world we knew wont come back
the time weve lost cant get it back
the life we had wont be ours again
