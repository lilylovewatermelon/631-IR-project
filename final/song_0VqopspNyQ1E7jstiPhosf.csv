i woke up today
woke up wide awake
in an empty bed
staring at an empty room
i have myself to blame
for the state im in today
and now dying
doesnt seem so cruel
and oh i dont know what to say
and i dont know anyway
anymore

chorus
i hate myself for losing you
im seein it all so clear so clear
i hate myself for losing you
what do you do when you look in the mirror
and staring at you is why hes not here

verse 2
you got what you deserved
hope youre happy now
cause every time i think of her with you
its killing me
inside and
now i dread each day knowing that i cant be saved
from the loneliness of living without you
and oh
i dont know what to do
not sure that ill pull through
i wish you knew

i hate myself for losing you
im seein it all so clear so clear
i hate myself for losing you
what do you do when you look in the mirror
and staring at you is why hes not here

bridge
i hate myself for losing you
and oh i dont know what to do
not sure that ill pull through
i wish you knew
i wish you knew
and oh i dont know what to say
and i dont know anyway anymore more

chorus
i hate myself for losing you
im seein it all so im seein it all so clear
i hate myself for losing you
what do you do when you look in the mirror
and staring at you is why hes not here
what do you say when everything you said
is the reason why he left you in the end
how do you cry when every tear you shed
wont ever bring him back again
i hate myself for loving youembed"
