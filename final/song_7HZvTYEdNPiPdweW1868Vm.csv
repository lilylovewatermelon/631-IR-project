everything is so clear
this is not what it seems
i can see it from here
youve been blinded by dreams
its to good to be true
these pieces arent a collage
dont know what i can do
this is just a mirage

verse 1 kayr
so many lights in my vision now my writing is fishing
dropping lines in a wishing well and im fighting the friction
of this bic upon this diction call me science fiction
out of this world and out of your jurisdiction
no judging court is adjourned
cause i can hear the sounds of crowds and my mind is spurred
i make it burn make it burn yeah its my turn
like i flipped the script from scarface no stones unturned
i believe i can make it how can i doubt it
this new feeling in my bones and beat my hearts pounding
is the only thing i rhyme to now i can hear
i know what im seeing and well everything is so clear

hook
you might also likeverse 2 kayr
i flipped when i couldnt clear that popular sample
thought it was the only way to get a plaque on the mantle
thought that i couldnt handle failure protected myself
said if the album got shelved id blame the cards i got dealt
not the way that i played them and to all of the voyeurs
id blame the flop on stephen schwartzs lawyers
thinking if i got this clearance that id have popped this year and
at the same time man my pops was fearing
if i drop this year and take off from here then
his prediction for the future just would not appear man
sorry pops but im a still be what i have to be
i can see the bright lights now dont need gravity ugh

hook

bridge kayr and erin

im never going back
come back
im never going back
come back x 5
outro erin
this is not what it seems
youve been blinded by dreams
these pieces arent a collage
this is just a mirageembed"
