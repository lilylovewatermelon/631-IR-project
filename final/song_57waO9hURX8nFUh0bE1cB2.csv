verse 1
i have a vision to add the gift of subtractin limits
if everything was gone tomorrow who would miss it
and if i pack my bags and moved away who would visit
if you knew what you should say who would listen
yeah im talkin bout a new religion
somethin to feed off we searchin for it like groups of pigeons
kinda futuristic yeah its cool we different
cause what i dos terrific im just hopin you can feel it
yeah so tell me if you can
are you numb enough can you listen in
i would lose it all to show em id get rich again
but matter fact fuck that cause i dont give a damn
you see its simple when its only cigarillos
in the world no one should feel you dont expect it from a little man
fuck empty my glass is filled
countin roses daisies and daffodils chill

what to do in this world when it seems that theres nothing left
and we dream just to dream
but we dont know exactly how to get there yet
