there might be something outside your window
but youll just never know
there could be something right past the turnpike gates
but youll just never know
if my velocity starts to make you sweat
then just dont let go
and if their heaven aint got a vacancy
then we just then we just then we just
then we just get up and go

drop

verse 1 gerard way
ladies and gentlemen truth is now acceptable
fame is now injectable process the progress
