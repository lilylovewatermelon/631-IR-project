shell lie and steal and cheat
and beg you from her knees
make you think she means it this time
shell tear a hole in you
the one you cant repair
but i still love her i dont really care

prechorus
when we were young ohoh we did enough
when it got cold oohooh we bundled up
i cant be told ahah it cant be done

verse 2
its better to feel pain
than nothing at all
the opposite of love is indifference
so pay attention now
im standing on your porch screamin out
and i wont leave until you come downstairs

chorus
so keep your head up keep your love
keep your head up my love
keep your head up my love
keep your head up keep your love

and i dont blame you dear
for runnin like you did all these years
i would do the same you best believe
and the highway signs say were close
but i dont read those things anymore
i never trusted my own eyes

prechorus
when we were young ohoh we did enough
when it got cold oohooh we bundled up
i cant be told ahah it cant be done

chorus
so keep your head up keep your love
keep your head up my love
keep your head up my love
keep your head up keep your love

outro
head up love
head up love
head up love
head up love56embed"
