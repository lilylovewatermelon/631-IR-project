verse 1
woke up this morning with a bitch that i dont know suckin my dick
watchin cnn news all of this poverty shit how worse can it get
you say that you rich then poverty hit but we forever rich
not what i psychologically meant they want me to quit
you would do better making a doberman sit
i rose for this shit from one jail to another precinct
you told for this shit this shit you niggas sold for this shit
how old will it get before we start exposin and shit

chorus
we all makin choices just to die not to live its a lie yeah its a lie
its a thug nigga life
its a thug nigga life
they hollerin 1 gun 2 gun he shot whose son
how long til your time comes these hoes gon misuse him
its a thug nigga life
a thug nigga life yeah

verse 2
patek and audemar got both and it dont mean nothin uh uh
i rock too many chains just one feel like i mean somethin on god
back to back im swervin lanes leave a stain then i clean somethin lets go
i fucked her five times to her i bet that mean somethin it dont
they left a dime in the car thats ten shots
lil nigga i been there 223 hangin out the car with one glock
montana closed shop way he passed the phone with my homeboy trent now
dont trust nobody but it been good its a scary empire
