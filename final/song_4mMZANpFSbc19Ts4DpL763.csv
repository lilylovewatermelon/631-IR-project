verse
had to let em know
been caught up i been work too hard with mi amigos
i aint need to see ya im just bein me though
heard you threw my name around for status
said you wanna call and talk about it
but i aint got the time
i just pass you by bye
ooh i could cut ties with the silence ooh
i can cut ties i dont mind it
stay pressed for a text back
bout some advice that you sent uninvited

cause i like all my vices
said i like all my vices
whatever the price is
