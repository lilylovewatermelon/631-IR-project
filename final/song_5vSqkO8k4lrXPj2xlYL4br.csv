i think its gonna be a hell of a night a hell of a night
so we could do whatever you like like like like

verse 1
it took me all day to find some inspiration
it just hit me like a ton of bricks no renovation
problem with the game now there aint no innovation
i see my shit all in your shit we call that imitation
and they say thats flattering but i aint flattered at all
matter fact yall need to practice that more
see my man nate asked me if i gained weight
i said nah my pockets got fatter thats all
money was an issue but now that thats solved
i ball i ball like kobe in the fall
put trophies on my wall rather trophies on my mantle
dog my shows be off the handle
take the proceeds go to gamble
ha bet it on black and pray i quadruple my salary
if i win maybe then i could pay sallie mae
told her i be dealin with some reallife shit
she be askin when
bitch when i feel like it

hook

i got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry
bitch i made this in the crib watchin belly
eatin peanut butter jelly what the fuck the niggas tell me
they say im takin long i tell em patience is a virtue
im goin all out and bitch i never had a curfew
see when youre spittin so real
suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal
got em feelin like my niggas when they lose they appeal
then its back to the cell back to the hell
at times i watch the news and see they talkin bout diplomacy
and they aint got a clue my niggas aint got they diplomas see
rappers show me love i wonder what it could be
i think they scared of me and they should be
