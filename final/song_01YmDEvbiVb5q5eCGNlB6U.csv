let’s go out on the street
let’s go out on the street
you take me away
faces faces they fade
love love love stays
here here i’ll take you

chorus
cross my heart and hope to die
if you ever catch me in a white lie
i lay me down in the tall grass
tangled in the weeds in my messy bed

bridge
if you come and you come
come and come and if you if you

verse 2
let’s go out on the street
bring me under the soil in the roots i toil
trying crying trying to show
break through watch as i grow

chorus
cross my heart and hope to die
if you ever catch me in a white lie
i lay me down in the tall grass
tangled in the weeds in my messy bedsee odesza liveget tickets as low as 60you might also like13embed"
