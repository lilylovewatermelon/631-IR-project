oh ohoh oh hey

verse 1
for the record you oughta know
you wasnt thinking when you let me go
but whatever thats how it goes
win some you lose some and others you hold in your heart
why it gets so hard tears you all apart
even though you try to let go no no no
suddenly youre here and its all surreal
and i dont know what the deal

chorus
cause when im looking in your eyes
feels like the first time
give me one good reason why
we cant just press rewind
i dont wanna spend my life
thinking what it couldve been like
if we had another try one time
like back in the day that look on your face
feels like the first time

them other regularities they cant compete with mc
the whole entire world can tell
that you love yourself some me
people see you now asking all about me
and how they always thought we were so perfect together
lets rewrite the end start over again
and its gon go better now

chorus
cause when im looking in your eyes
feels like the first time
give me one good reason why
we cant just press rewind
i dont wanna spend my life
thinking what it couldve been like
if we had another try one time
like back in the day that look on your face
feels like the first time

bridge
for the record for the record
youll always be a part of me no matter what you do
and for the record for the record
cant nobody say i didnt give my all to you
and for the record for the record
i told you underneath the stars that you belong to me
and for the record for the record
its obvious that we just cant let go of us honey oh no oh
chorus
cause when im looking in your eyes
feels like the first time oh
give me one good reason why give me one good reason

feels like the first time oh
cause when im looking in your eyes
