her bags are packed and waiting for someone to come and pickem up outside
ah yeah i dont know
where they come from man i aint seen that much luggage in my life
she was always bad about leaving
especially every time i done her wrong
this time she might be through believing me
yeah this time
she might be good as gone gone gone

chorus
wed still be together but she left me
id got mad about it but it never did upset me
shell
remember me until the day she forgets me
wed still be together but she left me

verse 2
she took everything i had except some change that she left in the ashtray
i guess i got that going
for me if i plan on looking at it that way
she loaded up my boat and my motor
she took off with my
guitar and my guns
i heard she ran away with my best friend jake
and i know im gonna miss him when
its all said and done
