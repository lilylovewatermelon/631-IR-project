this vacations useless these white pills arent kind
ive given a lot of thought on this thirteen hour drive
i missed the grinding concrete where we sat past 8 or 9
and slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights
ive given a lot of thought to the nights we used to have
the days have come and gone our lives went by so fast
i faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
where i laid and told you but you swear you loved me more

chorus
do you care if i dont know what to say
will you sleep tonight will you think of me
will i shake this off pretend its all okay
that theres someone out there who feels just like me
there is

verse 2
those notes you wrote me ive kept them all
ive given a lot of thought of how to write you back this fall
with every single letter in every single word
there will be a hidden message about a boy that loves a girl

chorus
do you care if i dont know what to say
will you sleep tonight will you think of me
will i shake this off pretend its all okay
that theres someone out there who feels just like me
there is
do you care if i dont know what to say
will you sleep tonight will you think of me
will i shake this off pretend its all okay
that theres someone out there who feels just like me
do you care if i dont know what to say
will you sleep tonight will you think of me
will i shake this off pretend its all okay
that theres someone out there who feels just like me
there isyou might also like12embed"
