let me hold you for the day and let you know that its okay
give you all the love and peace that you usually send my way
when its dark for you dont know what to do
just know youre my light
maybe you can find some strength in knowing that will be alright

chorus
when the world is caving baby youre my safe haven
and when it all comes crashing i remember you saying
if you show me then ill show you
all the things that make me wanna know you
and when the world is caving
baby youre my safe haven youre my safe haven

verse 2
remember when you told me its the little things that hurt everyday
and i responded with a little smile and nodded it away
well i get it now cause its your scrunched eyebrows
that bring me to tomorrow
all the little things about you that make me forget
all my sorrow

chorus
when the world is caving baby youre my safe haven
and when it all comes crashing i remember you saying
if you show me then ill show you
all the things that make me wanna know you
and when the world is caving baby youre my safe haven
youre my safe haven
you might also likebridge
and when i leave you i stop looking for heaven
cause i found a piece of it wrapped up in your presence
oh with you and i theres love so divine
on my darkest day i know youll be my shine

chorus
when the world is caving baby youre my safe haven
and when it all comes crashing i remember you laughing
when the world is caving baby youre my safe haven
and when it all comes crashing i remember you saying
if you show me then ill show you
all the things that make me wanna know you
and when the world is caving baby youre my safe haven
baby youre my safe haven
baby youre my safe haven
baby youre my safe haven3embed"
