found a way to forgive myself
for the mistakes i made in my past
i think thats the first step right

verse
ive dug two graves for us my dear
cant pretend that i was perfect leavin you in fear
oh man what a world the things i hear
if i could act on my revenge no would i
some kill some steal some break your heart
and youd have thought that i would let it go and let you walk
well broken hearts break bones so break up fast
and i dont wanna let it go so in my grave ill rot
