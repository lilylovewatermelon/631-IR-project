there she was little blue jean buzz
just bare footing around
i said whats up she hopped in the truck
and we were right away running the town

prechorus 1
shes the kinda girl that walks in to your lonely world
and everything dark just lights up
but all summers end now shes gone with the wind
and the reason i spend so many nights up

chorus
somebody somebody shoulda told her
this party this party wasnt over
hands up in the air still swaying
that band she loves still playing
she had this old boy from the boondocks
sweet talking walking on moon rocks
i wish somebody woulda told her
this party this party wasnt over
this party this party wawawasnt over

verse 2
i still hear her laughing like it just happened
like i was just with her here
well she had the magic and i had the habit
but then she just disappeared

see im the kinda guy that just cant get her off my mind
no matter how hard i try shes all i think of
another lesson learned but hey the world still turns
so i guess its time to turn another drink up

chorus
somebody somebody shoulda told her
this party this party wasnt over
hands up in the air still swaying
that band she loves still playing
she had this old boy from the boondocks
sweet talking walking on moon rocks
i wish somebody woulda told her
this party this party wasnt over

bridge
these days i cant even hear a wave crash
and i get carried away and go george strait back
to a slow dance out in the sand
when the keg was still cold and she was holding my hand

chorus
somebody somebody shoulda told her
this party this party wasnt over
hands up in the air still swaying
that band she loves still playing
she had this old boy from the boondocks
sweet talking walking on moon rocks
i wish somebody woulda told her
this party this party wasnt over
outro
no it wasnt over
yeah this party this party this party wasnt over
hands still swaying band still playing
damn this party wasnt over
this party this party this party wasnt over
this party this party this party wasnt overembed"
