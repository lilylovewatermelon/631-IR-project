120873 that was all i got and now you got me
all i ever really wanted was to take the blame
i will go down in history and not down in flames
meningitis i will survive this
dry sockets and a schizophrenic crisis
the time of the nine has begun
get out of the way or you will suffer as one
oh this is so typical apocalyptical
hanging on abysmal release jesus
i dont need this dont wanna be this
icon in the making my hands are fucking shaking

refrain
what if god doesnt care
what if god doesnt care

prechorus
remember surrender
the time is now
continue were in you
and we will burn your cities down

chorus
america is a killing name
it doesnt feel or discriminate
life is just a killing field
its all thats left nothings real
throw away your disposable past
and fall apart like a cigarette ash
we are the fatal and vital ones of the world
and we will burn your cities down
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likeguitar solo

refrain
what if god doesnt care
what if god doesnt care

oh

chorus
america is a killing name
it doesnt feel or discriminate
life is just a killing field
its all thats left nothings real
throw away your disposable past
and fall apart like a cigarette ash
we are the fatal and vital ones of the world
and we will burn your cities down

bridge
down ha
we will burn your cities down
we will burn your cities down
yeah we will burn your cities down

verse 2
feed the hungry feed them shit
feed them bones and politics
you wanna revolutionize
be specific and believe your eyes
start a war in another backyard
and well destroy your house of cards
give me a minute and ill change your mind
give me a bullet and ill change your life
prechorus
remember surrender
the time is now
continue were in you
and we will burn your cities down

chorus
america is a killing name
it doesnt feel or discriminate
life is just a killing field
its all thats left nothings real
throw away your disposable past
and fall apart like a cigarette ash
we are the fatal and vital ones of the world
and we will burn your cities down

outro
down down
we will burn your cities down
down down
we will burn your cities down

what if god doesnt care6embed"
