if he forgets you
he forgets you for good
if you wanna feel
better start searching some more
because it was a happy time
now it’s winter time
and you’re cold

chorus
if he likes it let him do it
if he likes it let him do it

verse 1
i could never be a soldier
so i won’t make you stand so tall
and tonight’s the night
when there’s light in your eyes
and you say goodbye
or i die
