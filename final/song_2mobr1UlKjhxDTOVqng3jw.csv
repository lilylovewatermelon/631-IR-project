im staring out into the night
trying to hide the pain
im going to the place where love
and feeling good dont ever cost a thing
and the pain you feels a different kind of pain

chorus
well im going home
to the place where i belong
and where your love has always been enough for me
im not running from
no i think youve got me all wrong
i dont regret this life i chose for me
but these places and these faces are getting old
so im going home
well im going home

verse 2
the miles are getting longer it seems
the closer i get to you
ive not always been the best man or friend for you
but your love remains true
and i dont know why
you always seem to give me another try

be careful what you wish for
cause you just might get it all
