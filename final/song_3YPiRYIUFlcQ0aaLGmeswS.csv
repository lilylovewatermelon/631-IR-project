though i try to see you differently
i tow the line
you see im searching for what used to be mine

i saw your eyes
and then i saw her staring back at me
and i will try to find another one
who suited me as well as her

ive moved far away from you
and i want to see you here beside me dear
but things arent clear

when we never even tried
we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful
whenever i was away
id miss you
i miss you

she was mine
i was hers
and all thats in between
if she would cry
i would shelter her
and keep her from the darkness that will be

we never even tried
we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful
whenever i was away
id miss you
and i miss you

dont drop me in
its not my turn
if you cut deep
then i might learn
if you scar and leave me
like a sunburn

dont drop me in
its not my turn
if you cut deep
then i might learn
you scarred and left me
like a sunburn
we never even tried
we never even talked
we never even thought in the long run
whenever it was painful
whenever i was away
id miss you
i miss youembed"
