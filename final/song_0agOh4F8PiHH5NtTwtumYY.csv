i wished i was smarter
i wished i was stronger
i wished i loved jesus
the way my wife does
i wished it had been easier
instead of any longer
i wished i could have stood
where you wouldve been proud
but that wont happen now
that wont happen now

chorus
theres a whole lot of singin thats never gonna be heard
disappearin every day without so much as a word somehow
think i broke the wings off that little songbird
shes never gonna fly to the top of the world right now
top of the world

verse 2
i dont have to answer
any of these questions
dont have no god to
teach me no lessons
i come home in the evenin
sit in my chair
one night they called me for supper but i never got up
i stayed right there in my chair

theres a whole lot of singin thats never gonna be heard
disappearin every day without so much as a word somehow
think i broke the wings off that little songbird
shes never gonna fly to the top of the world right now

verse 3
i wished ida known you
wished ida shown you
all of the things i
was on the inside
id pretend to be sleepin
when you come in in the mornin
to whisper goodbye
go to work in the rain
i dont know why
dont know why

chorus
cause everyones singin we just wanna be heard
disappearin every day without so much as a word somehow
wanna grab a hold of that little songbird
take her for a ride to the top of the world right now

outro
whoaoh
whoaoh
to the top of the world
to the top of the world
to the top of the world
to the top of the world
to the top of the world
to the top of the world
to the top of the world
to the top of the world1embed"
