i have a tale to tell
sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
i was not ready for the fall
too blind to see the writing on the wall

chorus
a man can tell a thousand lies
ive learned my lesson well
hope i live to tell the secret i have learned
til then it will burn inside of me

verse 2
i know where beauty lives
ive seen it once i know the warm she gives
the light that you could never see
it shines inside you cant take that from me

chorus
a man can tell a thousand lies
ive learned my lesson well
hope i live to tell the secret i have learned
til then it will burn inside of me

postchorus
the truth is never far behind
you kept it hidden well
if i live to tell the secret i knew then
will i ever have the chance again

if i ran away id never have the strength to go very far
how would they hear the beating of my heart
will it grow cold the secret that i hide will i grow old
how will they hear when will they learn how will they know

chorus
a man can tell a thousand lies
ive learned my lesson well
hope i live to tell the secret i have learned
til then it will burn inside of me

postchorus
the truth is never far behind
you kept it hidden well
if i live to tell the secret i knew then
will i ever have the chance again

chorus
a man can tell a thousand lies
ive learned my lesson well
hope i live to tell the secret i have learned
til then it will burn inside of me6embed"
