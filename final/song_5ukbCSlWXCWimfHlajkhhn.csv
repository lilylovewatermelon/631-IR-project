is it just me or did the world stop spinning
i swear i felt it slowing down for a minute
i know it sounds crazy
but looking at you baby
with your summer hair thats falling down in slow motion
your bodys swaying like the waves in the ocean
i know that youre thinking exactly what im thinking

prechorus
if i could go anywhere
i wouldnt go anywhere
im already there

chorus
girl we aint gotta leave this room
to make it feel like a honeymoon
dont need coppertone on your skin
when my hands can still pretend
girl we dont need a white sand beach
when your lips get to kissing on me
it already feels like paradise
well take it nice and slow tonight
loving on island time

verse 2
aint gotta worry about a beach bar closing
i gotta bottle of tequila we can open right here
im just saying its like were on vacation

girl we aint gotta leave this room
to make it feel like a honeymoon
dont need coppertone on your skin
when my hands can still pretend
girl we dont need a white sand beach
when your lips get to kissing on me
it already feels like paradise
well take it nice and slow tonight
loving on island time
loving on island time yeah

prechorus
if i could go anywhere
i wouldnt go anywhere

outro
girl we aint gotta leave this room
to make it feel like a honeymoon
dont need coppertone on your skin
when my hands can still pretend
girl we dont need a white sand beach
when your lips get to kissing on me
it already feels like paradise
well take it nice and slow tonight
loving on island time
