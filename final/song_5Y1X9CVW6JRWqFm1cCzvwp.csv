verse 1
hey now call it a split because you know that you will
ohoh you bite your friend like chocolate
you said we go where nobody know
with guns hidden under our petticoat
no were never gonna quit it no were never gonna quit it no
now we run run away from the boys in the blue
oh my car smells like chocolate
hey now i think about what to do
i think about what to say i think about how to think
pause it play it pause it play it pause it

chorus
oh we go where nobody know
with guns hidden under our petticoats

yеah were dressed in black from head to toe
we got guns hidden under our petticoat
no were never gonna quit it no were never gonna quit it no
