when i close my eyes
i can see for miles
theres comfort in my dark seat
and chaos in the aisles

chorus
these eyes are not your eyes
and these eyes are not the color
that your arid eyes might be
no i was not around
when those eyes of yours decided so
i refuse to kneel before the sights you choose to see

verse 2
when i close my eyes
i remember why i smile
under my umbrella
im an accomplished exile

chorus
these eyes are not your eyes
and these eyes are not the color
that your arid eyes might be
no i was not around
when those eyes of yours decided so
i refuse to kneel before the sights you choose to see
