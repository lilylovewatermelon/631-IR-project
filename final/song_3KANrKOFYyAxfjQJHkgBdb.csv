save some face you know youve only got one
change your ways while youre young
boy one day youll be a man
oh girl hell help you understand

chorus
smile like you mean it
smile like you mean it

verse 2
looking back at sunsets on the east side
we lost track of the time
dreams arent what they used to be
some things slide by so carelessly

chorus
smile like you mean it
smile like you mean it

bridge
and someone is calling my name
from the back of the restaurant
and someone is playing a game
in the house that i grew up in
and someone will drive her around
down the same streets that i did
on the same streets that i did
