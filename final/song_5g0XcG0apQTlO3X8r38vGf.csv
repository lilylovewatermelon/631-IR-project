i got a house down a back road
i got a flag on the front porch
i got a dog named waylon
i got a driveway that needs pavin
i got a boat with a two stroke
a couple guaranteedtomakeyalaugh jokes
i got friends in low places
yeah life is what you make it

chorus
i might not end up in the hall of fame
with a star on a sidewalk with my name
or a statue in my hometown when im gone
nobody gonna name their babies after me
i might not go down in history
but ill go down to the honkytonk

verse 2
i got a girl named shelia
she goes batshit on tequila
got a job that gets the job done
i got a loan at the bank its a big one
the only place you might see my name
is on a wall for a good time call
im a local legend on a friday night
then a pabst blue ribbon and a neon light
