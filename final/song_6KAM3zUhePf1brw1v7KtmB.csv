i remember now but i still have my doubts
i think its gonna be today
everybody came but its just not the same
why did it have to be today
now my chest is tight no i am not all right
it doesnt have to be this way
why does it have to be this way

chorus
i dont know whats wrong
its like im too far gone
it doesnt matter anyway
fear is in my heart
just when i stop it starts
and i can never live this way

verse 2
freedom in a cage no sun and too much rage
i dont know how much i can take
push it down inside but it knows just where i hide
i know that normal is hard to fake
bleeding into life its like a thousand knives
are slowly turning me into this
why does it have to be like this

i dont know whats wrong
its like im too far gone
it doesnt matter anyway
fear is in my heart
just when i stop it starts
and i can never live this way
i dont know whats wrong
its like im too far gone
it doesnt matter anyway
fear is in my heart
just when i stop it starts
and i can never live this way

bridge
i lost again today

chorus
i dont know whats wrong
its like im too far gone
it doesnt matter anyway
fear is in my heart
just when i stop it starts
and i can never live this way

outro
living with a curse sometimes its even worse
it slowly kills me everyday
something i despise is gonna take my life
i guess ill try again todayembed"
