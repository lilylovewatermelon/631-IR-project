if someone stood up in a crowd
and raised his voice up way out loud
and waved his arm and shook his leg
youd notice him
if someone in the movie show yelled
fire in the second row
this whole place is a powder keg
youd notice him

and even without clucking like a hen
everyone gets noticed now and then
unless of course that personage should be
invisible inconsequential me

cellophane mister cellophane
shoulda been my name mister cellophane
cause you can look right through me walk right by me
and never know im there i tell ya
cellophane mister cellophane
shoulda been my name mister cellophane
cause you can look right through me walk right by me
and never know im there

suppose you was a little cat
residing in a persons flat
who fed you fish and scratched your ears
youd notice him
suppose you was a woman wed
and sleeping in a double bed
beside one man for seven years
youd notice him
you might also likea human beings made of more than air
with all that bulk youre bound to see him there
unless that human being next to you
is unimpressive undistinguished youknowwho

shoulda been my name mister cellophane
cause you can look right through me walk right by me
and never know im there i tell ya
cellophane mister cellophane
shoulda been my name mister cellophane
cause you can look right through me walk right by me
and never know im there

never even know im there
spoken
i hope i havent taken up too much of your timeembed"
