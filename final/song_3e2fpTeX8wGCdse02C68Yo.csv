when it rains
i pour a couple more rounds
til the hurting and the heartache start to drown

i turn out the light
i turn up dwight
and i lock my door when it rains
when it rains
i pour

verse 1
when life aint going my way
and i cant take one more day of gray
hey hey
its ok

i dont need a dose of dr phil
i dont need your make it all better pill
when im low
dont you know
dont you know

repeat chorus

verse 2
i dont have to have a girls night out
or runaround with a rowdy crowd to get down
whiskey bent and hell bound
you might also likewhen i feel like i aint got a friend
i just call on my old buddy jim again
and again i like him

repeat chorus

oh dont you know
when it rains
when it rains
i pourembed"
