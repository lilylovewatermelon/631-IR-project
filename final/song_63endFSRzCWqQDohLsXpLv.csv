first things first girl recognize
who is with you now
second thing cant blame me for how
you were treated before i came

right there for you since day one
so where is all this coming from

chorus
see now im not to blame for the pain
that was caused by previous cats
who had your heart before me
im not to blame for the pain
that was caused by previous cats
you gotta see me for me

verse 2
now what is with all the questioning
