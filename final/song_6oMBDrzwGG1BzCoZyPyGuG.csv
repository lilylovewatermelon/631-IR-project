i am waiting til i dont know when
cause im sure its gonna happen then
time keeps creepin through the neighborhood
killing old folks waking up babies just like we knew it would

verse 2
all the neighbors are starting up a fire
burning all the old folks the witches and the liars
my eyes are covered by the hands of my unborn kids
but my heart keeps watching through the skin of my eyelids

chorus 1
they say a watched pot wont ever boil
well i closed my eyes and nothing changed
just some water getting hotter in the flames

verse 3
its not a lover i want no more
and its not heaven im pining for
but theres some spirit i used to know
thats been drowned out by the radio

chorus 2
they say a watched pot wont ever boil
you cant raise a baby on motor oil
just like a seed down in the soil youve got to give it timesee arcade fire liveget tickets as low as 81you might also like10embed"
