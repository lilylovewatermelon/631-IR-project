like a prayer surroundin us movin effortlessly
every word is relief
im in dance floor therapy all my babies and me
but tonight its for free
no selfsabotage no letting my thoughts run
me and this spiral are done
burn this camouflage ive been wearing for months
tryna let a little happy in for once

dont get me down i wont let me get me ooh
dont get me down i wont let me get me ooh
im good right now i wont let me get me
take that tired heart and go and turn it insideout

verse 2
diving in ferociously dancing intimately
im so connected to me
in the dark im letting go so anonymously
i guess this is what it feels like to be free
