ah ah ha ha ha ha
yeah mhm

verse 1
i’m alone now
staring at the ceiling
i’m kinda bored now
i can’t sleep i cant sleep
and you only can make my life complete
and when you come you slip into a dream

chorus
when its late at night and youre fast asleep
i let my fingers do the walking
i press record i become a fiend
and no one else is watching
i let my fingers do the walking

verse 2
im starving
for some attention
im begging pleading bleeding
for a suggestion
i bite my tongue because i wanna scream
im almost there and you turn and look at me
see pnk liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likechorus
when its late at night and youre fast asleep
i let my fingers do the walking
i press record i become a fiend
and no one else is watching i let my fingers do the walking

verse 3
rewind and you will see you will see
why in the morning im happy im happy
right there on the tv screen on the tv
¡me vengo me vengo

verse 4
im restless
you need some caffeine
im wasted
if you could only see only see
cause i need more than you are gonna give

chorus
when its late at night and youre fast asleep
i let my fingers do the walking ahh
i press record i become a fiend
and no one else is watching no no no no
when its late at night and youre fast asleep
i let my fingers do the walking i let my fingers do the walking
i press record i become a fiend
and no one else is watching no one else is watching
i let my fingers do the walking
