yeah mane you know im smokin at the beginnin of the song man like a damn rapper

verse 1 earl sweatshirt
in 09 we were still on the bus nigga
before nak was deluxe when i didnt have a brush
when there still wasnt hoes tryna fuck with me
fore i cleaned up a bit like its company comin
i aint know we was on the cusp of the money
tryna get a few bucks under custody
and my twin brothers was all syd brothers
so my kin gully and my skin toughened
thick lens coverin my eyes now
they aint bright nigga im just high now
and if this a different way to clear my mind out
i need to find out im doin fine now
and i dont look as stupid when i talk now
and everybody at the show look astounded
posted up drowsy
in the cut so much that its pus round me
catch him in the daytime or dusk hours
smokin out the pound houndin mutts out it
if your tucks lousy then you cant sit with us nah
cant call it harsh livin when the margin between you and all these fuck niggas is about as large as it gets
and you workin givin arm and a leg
say he workin but he just talkin cause he aint workin
like a longdistance bitch
who you know thats out thats harder than this
chargin niggas like a tomlinson win nigga
slight frown on the brow on the brim color brown
runnin wild on the route that was picked
when the clouds were enshrouded
im out with my face in the shallow end drownin again
you might also likechorus mac miller
i could drown you with a shallow soul
shallow soul shallow soul
you are drinkin from a shallow soul
shallow soul shallow soul

verse 2 dah
drugs got me feelin like vigo carpathian
just look at the state hes in yo yo
the most critically acclaimed slang contortionist
that aint suckin corporate dick
said it with my balls in grip
other hand got a cork to hit
all this ralph be the sportsmanship
walked in and said i needed all the chips
as well as the one on my shoulder
feel like my heart got pneumonia blunt laced covered in odor
cops still lockin niggas up for quotas
brain still numb from the shit in the soda so
a generation lost
facin a paul allen in vacant loft
warrants bein filed for the cases fought
and them drugs get obtained by debatin cost
you aint superman when that cape is off
just clark nigga sittin in his highrise
tryna see the bright side of life
and a nigga just keep comin back with a dark picture
its like hard liquor and see people are books
so you judge a mafucka by the first page
and a bitch by the back cover
the crime is longsleeved so the tats covered
real ones im the last brother when they see me on stage
they said my shit was so insane it was like cobain did his last number
motherfucker
chorus mac miller
i could drown you with a shallow soul
shallow soul shallow soul
you are drinkin from a shallow soul yeah
shallow soul um shallow soul yeah

verse 3 mac miller
yeah well
isnt he dizzy off the ups and downs
he got a lil whitney put it in a blunt for now smoke
shit was sposed to get me high
why the fuck i wanna die now damn and im
strung out on this dusty couch
in a big white ugly house i tell the bitch slow down
down stop runnin your mouth
you holdin my money just shut up and count my woo count my
right nostril hasnt worked in a week
plus the plug got work like he servin for a sheik
me im swervin in a jeep
burnin weed doin circles in the street skrrt yellin
play my shit or wake the baby up wake up
i get her faded put it back in her labia
all my life ive been afraid of powder
all my life ive been afraid of power where did all that go
the wrong decision always call my phone okay
last supper i was fuckin with the corleones uhhuh
i need somethin stronger than a cortisone
that can save me from the war i know
shout out to soulo soul and rest in peace alori joh
the devil on the other side of this glory hole woah
any time any place you can bet ima eat
cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road woah woah woah woah woah
woah look at all these new faces
i see i see i see
they comin on a plane but theyre leavin their suitcases
been a criminal before scales were digital
used to put the weed in the sole of my blue asics woah 
hate myself fuck the strangers woo
but the raps are just way too flagrant so
here i go here i go
throwin up a prayer its a hail mary
woah where its at ive never been religious
but i feel like the scriptures got it all there
its not just gypsies and fairies fairies this could be my last breath
last breath ima take my time
wait a second please
cause ima go out the same way i came in
right by the pussy with nothin on my mind
outro mac miller
you are standing in a shallow soul
you are speaking with a shallow soul
shallow soul
i could drown you with a shallow soul
will you wash your sins with me
shallow soul shallow soul
you are drinking from a shallow soul
it will set us free
shallow soul shallow soul
you are standing in a shallow soul
