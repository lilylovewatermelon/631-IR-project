i will smoke a little something but i dont inhale
everywhere that i go everywhere they be asking hows it going
say the goings well go figure victors light skinned

but these kids these days they get so high
burn trees smoke chlorophyll til they cant feel shit
shitfaced faced it 15 hits on this l
elevated train and the craziest thing

verse 3 twista
i could make a flow pitter patter with a patter pitter juicy
used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
i ended up on an album cover in a coogi
you see i be still a god but a goofy
you be flowing about drugs and a uzi
thats the dual principle sometimes ima be about some hoes
sometimes ima wanna make a movie
and when it come to rapping fast im the higgs boson yeah
and though my style freakish
i could still break your body down to five pieces like i did voltron
cause im addicted to the craft and i be off a og
know me im the obiwan kenobi of the dope see what
never scared of mean spirits methamphetamine lyrics
cooler like im off of codeine low key
dont be so judgmental even though im reminiscing
if i dont know what i miss is
ima end up figuring out that its home
and my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
this is just a testament to the ones that raised me
the ones that i praise and im thanking
i need em but the chronic all up in my clothes
and i wanna get a hug and i cant cause im stanking
never too old for a spanking igh
