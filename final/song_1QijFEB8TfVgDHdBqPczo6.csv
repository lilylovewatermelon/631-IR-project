days feel harder night grows longer
summer says its goodbye
in darkness cover we find shelter
our own place to hide

chorus
oh as the light goes out
thoughts turn to angels over us
oh as the night comes in
dreams start their drifting and you hear a lullaby
lullaby
you and i

verse 2
trees touch windows say their hellos
we hear this house as it settles in
worry slips away it dont know your name
it dont know where to find us

chorus
oh as the light goes out
thoughts turn to angels all around us
oh as the night comes in
dreams start their drifting and we hear a lullaby
a lullaby
