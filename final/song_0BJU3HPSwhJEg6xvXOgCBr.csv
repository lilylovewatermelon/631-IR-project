who put the spiders in my applesauce
took the pins out my hand grenade
somebody said that i deserve to die
i looked him in the eye said the devils not circumcised
who put spiders in my applesauce
took the pins out my hand grenade
somebody tell me i deserve to die
i looked him in the eye and said the devil not circumcised

verse 1 mac miller
so play me a song on the guitar guitar
got a rainforest in my cigar cigar
theres knots in my yoyo string
put a crown on my stallion im the polo king
i fell in love with a gogo dancer she a single mom
the underdog like to play the game with diddy kong
she the god type throw that bitch a klondike
everything is alright see its written in the psalms
i told her i get rich off my little songs
gave her a million reasons that she should come along
immediately she dropped her shit
but everywhere i go they told me watch yo bitch
goddamn i guess i got another one
good vibrations marky mark and the funky bunch
i put the gourmet flavors inside the honey blunt
got my head underwater but i aint comin up
fuck air my bitch ass is like a plump pear
and she aint pretty or ugly i say she just fair
man this life is unfair

verse 2 mac miller
im readin old playboy magazines
somethin from the 50s when the journalism had its peak
you play the background you just a member of the faculty
im actually out here decision makin
had to get my shit together i was missin payments
i just pray to god that my lady isnt famous
she threw the gown on and we hit the banquet
she got her own story just let the bitch explain it
verse 3 mike jones
mac i think the girl that you speakin bout
