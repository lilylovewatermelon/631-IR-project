theres something bout the way
the street looks when its just rained
theres a glow off the pavement you walk me to the car
and you know i wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot yeah
oh yeah

verse 2
were driving down the road i wonder if you know
im trying so hard not to get caught up now
but youre just so cool run your hands through your hair
absentmindedly making me want you

chorus
and i dont know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first fearless
and i dont know why but with you id dance
in a storm in my best dress fearless

verse 3
so baby drive slow til we run out of road
in this one horse town i wanna stay right here
in this passengers seat
you put your eyes on me
in this moment now capture it remember it
