billy wont you stay youve been up all night
talkin bout flowers from 65
that print on that dress that you always liked
when we were young enough to go out and dance at night

verse 2
wed cross the street and youd hold my hand
same man now that you were back then
young kids good for nothing but high hopin
broke and starvin plastic ring perfect for elopin

verse 3
the years went by fast you were so good to me
our children have children billy how could it be
but ninety years is nothing to some kids like us
so baby stick around and tell a story just because

chorus
billy stay a while
lately youve been slippin in and out
billy stay a child
and tell me bout that girl you dreamed about
billy stay a while
tell me of the lovers who once were
and billy stay a child
tell me bout that girl and how you loved her

billy dont forget wont you keep on tryin
ill keep my ears open to keep from cryin
youre more handsome now than you were back then
and im the same girl you fell for when we were kids

verse 5
if love was enough then youd stay forever
but i guess sometimes that the end is better
cause love turns to loss as the time goes by
you dont know your own name but you know mine

chorus
billy stay a while
lately youve been slippin in and out
billy stay a child
tell me bout that girl you dreamed about
billy stay a while
tell me of the lovers who once were
billy stay a child
tell me bout that girl and how you loved her

instrumental break

outro
you went back home in your sleep last night
and i heard you whisper i love you goodbye
but maybe your heavens 1965
with my hair in your face on a long summer drive
to me youll never be the times you forgot
but all of our good times and the flowers you boughtembed"
