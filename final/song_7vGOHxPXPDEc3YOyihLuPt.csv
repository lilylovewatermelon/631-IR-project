wine is fine but whiskeys quicker
suicide is slow with liquor
take a bottle and drown your sorrows
then it floods away tomorrows away tomorrows
evil thoughts and evil doings
cold alone you hang in ruins
thought that youd escape the reaper
you cant escape the master keeper

chorus
cause you feel lifes unreal and youre living a lie
such a shame whos to blame and youre wondering why
then you ask from your cask is there life after birth
what you saw can be hell on this earth hell on this earth

verse 2
now you live inside a bottle
the reapers traveling at full throttle
its catching you but you dont see
the reapers you and the reaper is me

chorus
breaking laws knocking doors but theres no one at home
made your bed rest your head but you lie there and moan
where to hide suicide is the only way out
dont you know what its really about
you might also likebridge
ah now people you really know where its at
ah ah you got it fox
get the flaps out satan satan satan ha ha ha

outro
wine is fine but whiskeys quicker
suicide is slow with liquor
take a bottle drown your sorrows
then it floods away tomorrows
take me away oh oh tomorrow
its never gettin fixed no flaps nobody no flaps nothing3embed"
