i think i found hell
i think i found something
i think i found something in my tv screen
i think i found out that i have nothing
that i have nothing in this place for me
i watched it all in my head perfect sense
theyll take me from my bed
leave everything that is worth a single cent
and just take me instead
that tv show i saw as i fell asleep
had me on both my knees
praying to whatever is in heaven please send me a felon
and dont let the police know

chorus
anything anything
dont tell them anything
anything please
anything anything
dont tell them anything
anything please oh

verse 2
i think i can tell
i think i can tell them
tell them they were made for me
im thinking theyll know know it already
im thinking theyll know just about everything
i bet they planned it all out like the shows
went everywhere i go
walked in the store right behind me
stood in line right beside me and followed me to my home
im sure they figured it out early on
that i would never run
that they could shoot but thats no fun
cause then theyre killing the stolen son
