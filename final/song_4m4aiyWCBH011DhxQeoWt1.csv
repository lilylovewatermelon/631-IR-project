verse 1 travis thompson
okay 2 am im posted im posted
dope all in my jansport
movin the youth i run with
might treat your block like a dance floor
finesse the rent out the landlord
mama said pull your pants up
bendin corners and scraper im loyal to til my bands up
im pushin movin work improvin
theres commas on the way
put the pussy on pedestal
blow the medical to the face
its evident on my face
rollin heaven in my new wraith
declinin the call from labels
still grubbin on struggle plates

verse 2 macklemore
i grew up on old english thats that malt liquor aha
never smoked a backwood it was all swishers uhuh
before i pulled a fake id out on a bartender
i was on a bag of cubensis walkin off kilter shrooms shrooms shrooms
we aint have no common sense
do that dirt and hop that fence
roastin talkin shit we mobbin i just got my mommas whip hell yeah
we blow dank out that window right with your tape up its garbage
i used to roll up a spliff and i mixed the weed with the parliament ayy oh shit
couldnt tell you bout our future nah
we was on the corner posted yeah

sweatpants shorts wife beater posted on the porch
reminiscin 211 and we smokin on some ports

verse 3 dave b
