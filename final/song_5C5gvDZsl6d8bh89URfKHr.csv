pineapples are in my head
got nobody cause im braindead
pineapples are in my head
got nobody cause im braindead

verse 1
somewhere in southend when you were fun
you took my hand and you made me run
up past the prison to the seafront
you climbed the cliff edge and took the plunge

prechorus
why can’t we laugh now like we did then
how come i see you and ache instead
how come you only look pleased in bed
lets climb the cliff edge and jump again whoo

chorus
pineapples are in my head
pineapples are in my head
got nobody cause i’m braindead
got nobody cause i’m braindead
verse 2
somebody said im a fuckin slum
don’t know where i belong
maybe you’re fucking dumb
maybe i’m just a bum
maybe you’re fucking scum
don’t you go psycho chum
i want you for the world
i want you all the time stop

pineapples are in my head
when you were fun
got nobody cause i’m braindead
you made me run
pineapples are in my head
to the seafront
got nobody cause i’m braindead
she took the plunge

bridge
five thousand footsteps in your wet dress
back to the house with your arms round my neck
we drank pork soda with tangled legs
i won’t forget how you looked at me then
i know im no sweet prince of love
those times that we got drunk
maybe jamaica rum
maybe some jonnie dub
maybe you still think of us
phone buzz and still i jump
why dont i say it then
i want you all the time

prechorus
why can’t we laugh now like we did then
how come i see you and ache instead
how come you only look pleased in bed
lets climb the cliff edge and jump again
chorus
pineapples are in my head
pineapples are in my head
got nobody cause i’m braindead
got nobody cause i’m braindead
pineapples are in my head
pineapples are in my head
got nobody cause i’m braindead
got nobody cause i’m braindead

outro
pineapples are in my head
pineapples are in my head
got nobody cause i’m braindead
got nobody cause i’m braindead
pineapples are in my head
pineapples are in my head
got nobody cause i’m braindead
got nobody cause i’m braindead32embed"
