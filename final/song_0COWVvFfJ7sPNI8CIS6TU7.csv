the glove compartment is inaccurately named
and everybody knows it
so im proposing a swift orderly change
cause behind its door

chorus
theres nothing to keep my fingers warm
and all i find are souvenirs from better times
before the gleam of your taillights fading east
to find yourself a better life

verse 2
i was searching for some legal document
as the rain beat down on the hood
when i stumbled upon pictures i tried to forget
and thats how this idea was drilled into my head
cause its too important to stay the way its been

chorus
but theres no blame for how our love did slowly fade
and now that its gone its like it wasnt there at all
and here i rest where disappointment and regret
collide lying awake at night

chorus
and theres no blame for how our love did slowly fade
and now that its gone its like it wasnt there at all
and here i rest where disappointment and regret
collide lying awake at night
up all night when im lying awake at nightsee death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also like9embed"
