take your white finger
slide the nail under the top and bottom buttons of my blazer
relax the fraying wool slacken ties
and im not to look at you in the shoe
but the eyes find the eyes

chorus
find me and follow me through corridors refectories and files
you must follow leave this academic factory
you will find me in the matinée the dark of the matinée
its better in the matinée the dark of the matinée is mine
yes its mine

verse 2
time every journey to bump into you accidentally
i charm you and tell you of the boys i hate all the girls i hate
all the words i hate all the clothes i hate
how ill never be anything i hate
you smile mention something that you like
oh how youd have a happy life if you did the things you like

chorus
find me and follow me through corridors refectories and files
you must follow leave this academic factory
you will find me in the matinée dark of the matinée
its better in the matinée the dark of the matinée is mine
yes its mine

so im on bbc two now
telling terry wogan how i made it
and what i made is unclear now
but his deference is and his laughter is
my words and smile are so easy now
yes its easy now
yes its easy now

chorus
find me and follow me through corridors refectories and files
you must follow leave this academic factory
you will find me in the matinée dark of the matinée
its better in the matinée the dark of the matinée
you will find me and follow me through corridors refectories and files
you must follow leave this academic factory
you will find me in the matinée dark of the matinée
better in the matinée the dark of the matinée is mine
yes its mine7embed"
