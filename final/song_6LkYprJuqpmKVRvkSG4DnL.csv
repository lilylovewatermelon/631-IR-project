f250 with a daisy on the dash
god guns country bumper sticker on the back
throwback bell rangin britches fit like a friday night
mamas got chicken popping in the crisco
daddy prays for rain so the green money grows
barefoot barbed wire boondocks till i tiedye

chorus
hillbilly hippie
right down to the bone
a little mississippi
whole lotta rollin stone
all peace and love up until i aint
willied up with a whiskey drank
hillbilly hippie all day long

verse 2
hand me downs hangin out on the clothesline
crystal on my neck bringin on the good vibes
walmart wild heart guitars thatd be me

chorus
hillbilly hippie
right down to the bone
a little mississippi
whole lotta rollin stone
all peace and love up until i aint
willied up with a whiskey drank
hillbilly hippie all day long hey

red as the roads runnin through my veins

lost as a feather from a bluebird wing
wild as i wanna be

chorus
hillbilly hippie
right down to the bone
a little keith whitley
