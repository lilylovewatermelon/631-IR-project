uh yeah
i guess
i guess i fuckin guess

verse 1
wanted hood fame cause the love different
mobbin with the gang daily drug dealin
rappers who to blame for me mud sippin
puddle full of pain come from blood drippin
just designer shoes really no ambition
he just savin for the next club kickin
shawty aint got no morals but a dime or a five only time we judge bitches
feel like fuck the world fuck his enemies
dead niggas in his lungs hittin
nigga aint no guidance when them thugs drillin
just a bunch of sirens and them slugs spittin
mama told me the block gon always be there
but not if its gentrified im just reppin where i was raised
nigga i aint never had me an option to pick a side
lot of shit changed in the hood when my niggas died
really dont shed tears but a nigga cried
whether its us or police we get victimized
angry and ignorant we never civilized
fuck a political figure cause im still a nigga
cant win me over with a stimulus bribe
still want me stuck in the system
they hate that we chosen it kill em inside
i cant breathe and this mask cant muzzle me
cant conform and they hate my reluctancy
yeah i made it out the hood but its stuck in me
from the slums always where the trouble be
aint a rapper in my lane that can fuck with me
man this whole new generation is under me
dont know how i can say that shit humbly
way at the top im just waitin for company
you might also likeinterlude
i mean its its lonely up here like
its cold all type of shit like
but nah for real though like
i just really be thinkin sometimes i hear myself spittin
im like who can really fuck with me
but thats another discussion

verse 2
do this shit for my ancestors in them slave fields rockin corduroys
do you get the picture like a polaroid
niggas say we opps and we dont know them boys
when these rappers talkin i be so annoyed
say they makin noise but its only noise
a confrontation what i wont avoid
my confidence thats what they wont destroy
these niggas missed they targets hit the youth
they aint tryna bargain they just shoot
the apple dont fall too far from the tree
them guns thats loaded like forbidden fruit
line em all up then its rip aint apologizin in the booth
a prophecy my life the livin proof
give props to me what i dont hear em do
keep sayin im the goat and they never believe it
quite frankly im gettin tired of tellin you cletus
i been on the roll like im paraplegic
way up on the opps well never get even
a lot of sick talk when them weapons be speakin
go grab the white chalk cause they left him not breathin
slave to the block cause they chop what they teachin
thats why we outside in whatever the season
a hundred years ago they woulda hanged us
before cuban links we was chained up
freedom was the asset that we prayed for
no a constitution never made us
im just waitin on a revolution
with no fear im older when that day come
either house nigga or a mansion nigga
their refusings covered up a pay cut
outro fred hampton
im the deputy chairman of the state of illinois black panther party fred hampton
i be teaching that solidarity is a thing
the end of complete wipe out of imperialism is a thing
so if youre gon be thinking about me thats what bobby would be teaching
if youre gon be thinking about aint no thing about going nowhere getting killed
all we want to know is that youre doing what wed be doing if we were here
and you got to do that
you cant do it unless you believe that you can do it
in the spirit of liberation in the spirit of liberation9embed"
