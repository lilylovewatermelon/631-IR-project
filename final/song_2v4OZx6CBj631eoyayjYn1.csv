losses losers and more
gain of lifes pleasures cohorts listen behind the doors
to a life sheltered in less than zero in me
all my walls falling down pains aloft misery
im sure that the lessons were learned
im sure that the punishments went well deserved
by the pawn in the plan taste of shit bitterness
walk from me everything systematically

chorus
come on
youre the one youre the one
to dredge up shit inside of me
in my pointless life of nothing
tell me what im supposed to be
tell me who im supposed to be
tell me what it takes to ascend
tell me what it takes to live

verse 2
patience pleasures and rewards
come in due time stare at the sun im bored
in a life meaningless soaking up all of me
like the cross you worship life is loss look at me
im sure that some day well wake up
im sure that some day well wake from the dream
of success and focus tunneling to the light
glowing deep inside of me your taunting i wake up

come on
youre the one youre the one
to dredge up shit inside of me
in my pointless life of nothing
tell me what im supposed to be
tell me who im supposed to be
tell me what it takes to ascend
tell me what it takes to live

postchorus
tell me now
tell me now

bridge
pain misery distress dismal
know where depressed idiot failure
loser in me loser who i am
loser in me
dont feel sorry
dont feel sorry for me
dont need your sympathy or empathy
dont need your sympathy inside of me
dont need your sympathy or empathy
dont need your sympathy inside of me
dont feel sorry
dont feel sorry for me
outro
come on
i know youre the one youre the one
numb to feelings inside of me
why ive seized my vision
dont need you to tell me what to be
dont need you to tell me who to be
dont need you to tell me how to ascend
dont need you to tell me how to live1embed"
