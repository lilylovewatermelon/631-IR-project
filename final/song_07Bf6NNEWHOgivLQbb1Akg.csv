where to begin
oh lets pretend we never met
so i can disappear a moment
been trying to swim with both my hands behind my back
my dear i always feared the ocean
and somehow this one word in my mouth thats left unspoken

prechorus
i wont admit my parents split when i got sick
but i refuse to be a burden
and i said

chorus
is there something keeping me here for the minute darling
did you find the key and what is the meaning of it
cause honey sometimes i feel this emptiness
howling out

is there something keeping me here for the minute darling
did i lose my mind and and am i still looking for it
cause i dont know why i feel this emptiness
howling out
howling out

verse 2
youâ€™re not alone the world is small
and i am sick of all the talk of finding purpose
love comes and goes
but the big black dog he trails along
am i the only one who knows him
and now
and somehow i gained 15 pounds but lost my focus
and i suffocate things slow
until im just the black fly circling my bullshit
ooh
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likechorus
is there something keeping me here for the minute darling
did you find the key and what is the meaning of it
honey sometimes i feel this emptiness
howling out
is there something keeping me here for the minute darling
did you lose my mind and and am i still looking for it
i dont know why i feel this emptiness
howling out
howling out

verse 3
where to begin
oh lets pretend we never met
so i can disappear a moment
ive been trying to swim with both my hands behind my back
my dear i always feared the ocean
and somehow this one word in my mouth thats left unspoken
and i said
chorus
is there something keeping me here for the minute darling
did you find the key and what is the meaning of it
cause honey sometimes i feel this emptiness
howling out

tell me one thing keeping me here for the minute honey
but if i leave you now then whats out there waiting for me
i dont know why i feel this emptiness
howling out
