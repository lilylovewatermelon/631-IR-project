and i heard a voice through the discord of a deluge of passersby
and i saw one gaze frozen in time watching me passing by
and i swear ill know your face in the crowd
and ill hear your voice so loud when youre whispering

chorus spencer chamberlain and aaron marsh
hey unfaithful i will teach you
to be stronger to be stronger
hey ungraceful i will teach you
to forgive one another

verse 2 aaron marsh aaron gillespie
heres my kiss to betray kiss to betray
desperate to brush the lips of grace brush the lips of grace
do you feel hollow when you
think of how ive lied
o sweet angel of mercy with your grace like the morning
wrap your loving arms around me
o sweet angel of mercy with your grace like the morning
wrap your loving arms around me

chorus spencer chamberlain and aaron marsh
hey unfaithful i will teach you
to be stronger to be stronger
hey ungraceful i will teach you
to forgive one another
hey unfaithful i will teach you
to be stronger to be stronger
hey unloving i will love you
i will love you i will love you
