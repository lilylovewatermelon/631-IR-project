wake up say a little prayer
out of bed to the bathroom where
i take a look at myself and i stop and stare
and i wonder who is this standing here

bridge
and i try to find the will to carry on
wonder how much longer i can carry on
cause these days they take so long yes they do

chorus
hey how are you true
the light will guide you home yes it will
hey how are you true
well theres one thing that you should know
yes you should
you need love you need love you need love
you need love

verse 2
all your days spend counting numbers
til one day youll find day youll find
that life has passed you by
and in the quiet still of silence try to hide your eyes hide your eyes
oh no so dont cry oh no
see cage the elephant liveget tickets as low as 399you might also likechorus
hey how are you true
the light will guide you home yes it will
oh the years they turn so fast
soon the present will be past and youll look back and laugh
yes you will

outro
well i can still remember yes i was a young man too
alone but not forgotten and the candle shining through
still all these words ive spoken dont mean anything at all
without love without love without love
without love
do do do oh yeah
do do do oh yeah

verse 3
i remember clearly we were both there on the airplane
told me all your secrets oh i never saw it coming
i thought that you were joking
you were actually quite serious9embed"
