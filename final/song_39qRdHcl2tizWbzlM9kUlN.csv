what if there was no light
nothing wrong nothing right
what if there was no time
and no reason or rhyme
what if you should decide
that you dont want me there by your side
that you dont want me there in your life

verse 2
what if i got it wrong
and no poem or song
could put right what i got wrong
or make you feel i belong
what if you should decide
that you dont want me there by your side
that you dont want me there in your life

chorus
ooh thats right
lets take a breath jump over the side
ooh thats right
how can you know it if you dont even try
ooh thats right

verse 3
every step that you take
could be your biggest mistake
it could bend or it could break
but thats the risk that you take
what if you should decide
that you dont want me there in your life
that you dont want me there by your side
