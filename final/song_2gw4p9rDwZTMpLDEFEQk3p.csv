i dont know why you cant buy wine round here on sunday
or an icecold beer at a college football game
i dont know why at eighteen mama gave me a curfew
but it was son youre under my roof then youre under my rules

prechorus
i guess its all a part of a bigger plan
but some of them ill never understand

chorus
but they got their reasons just like you
when you walked out of my life when you didnt have to
you send me reelin theres nothin i can do
about you takin my heart and breakin it right in two
so if you see me soakin in these thoughts im thinkin
drownin in some barroom off the deep end
i got my reasons

verse 2
i dont know why them uptown guys sittin three seats from me
are raisin em up just as fast as they can put em down
or why that old timer wants the yankees on the tv
and the barkeep keeps buyin that one girl free rounds

chorus
but they got their reasons just like you
when you walked out of my life when you didnt have to
you send me reelin theres nothin i can do
about you takin my heart and breakin it right in two
so if you see me soakin in these thoughts im thinkin
drownin in some barroom off the deep end
i got my reasons
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likebridge
some are good and some are bad
some are true and some are sad
everyones got some but i need one
that brings you back

chorus
we all got our reasons just like you
when you walked out of my life and you didnt have to
you send me reelin theres nothin i can do
about you takin my heart and breakin it right in two
so if you see me soakin in these thoughts im thinkin
drownin in some barroom off the deep end
i got my reasons

outro
woah i got my reasons
