i fell by the wayside like everyone else
i hate you i hate you i hate you but i was just kidding myself
our every moment i start to replace
cause now that theyre gone all i hear are the words that i needed to say

prechorus
when you hurt under the surface
like troubled water running cold
well time can heal but this wont

chorus
so before you go
was there something i coulda said to make your heart beat better
if only ida known you had a storm to weather
so before you go
was there something i coulda said to make it all stop hurting
it kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
so before you go

verse 2
was never the right time whenever you called
went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
our every moment i start to replay
but all i can think about is seeing that look on your face

when you hurt under the surface
like troubled water running cold
well time can heal but this wont

chorus
so before you go
was there something i coulda said to make your heart beat better
if only ida known you had a storm to weather
so before you go
was there something i coulda said to make it all stop hurting
it kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
so before you go

bridge
would we be better off by now
if ida let my walls come down
maybe i guess well never know
you know you know

chorus
before you go
was there something i coulda said to make your heart beat better
if only ida known you had a storm to weather
so before you go
was there something i coulda said to make it all stop hurting
it kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
