ah

verse 1
hello
the sunny place for shady people
a crowded room where nobody goes
you can be whoever you wanna be here
and oh
ive been livin at the chateau
shouldnt drive but i should really go home
i dont even know em but they wont leave here

prechorus
frightened by my own reflection
desperate for a new connection
pull you in but dont you get too close
love you now but not tomorrow
wrong to steal but not to borrow
pull you in but dont you get too close

chorus
ive been california dreamin
plastic hearts are bleedin
keep me up all night keep me up
keep me up all night all night
lost in black hole conversation
sunrise suffocation
keep me up all night keep me up
keep me up all night
