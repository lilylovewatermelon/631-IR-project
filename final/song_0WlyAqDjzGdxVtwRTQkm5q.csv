until i started to lose my way
it all goes back to when i dropped outta school
havin fun i was livin the life
but now i got a problem with that little white rock
see i cant put down the pipe

bridge
and it is breakin me down watchin the world spin round
while my dreams fall down is anybody out there
it is breakin me down no more friends around
and my dreams fall down is anybody out there

chorus
can anybody out there hear me
cause i cant seem to hear myself
can anybody out there see me
cause i cant seem to see myself
theres gotta be a heaven somewhere

and the craziest thing is ill probably never know
the colour of my daughters eyes
