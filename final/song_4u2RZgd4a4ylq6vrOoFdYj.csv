if you were to give me a crystal ball and tell me
i had one glance to see my future
one chance to see it all
id pick it up and throw it down and tell
im not here forever
im here for here and now and

chorus
im just along for the ride
im just here for the good times
thats the greatest thing about
this crazy life were
all just along for the ride

verse 2
if i could see the world from gods view
i probably wouldnt want to
see what it is coming to
and i never wanna know the day i die
or what heaven really looks like
itd just spoil the big surprise

verse 3
cause its all gonna fall right in the line
everythings gonna happen in its own sweet time
so why do we worry try
to ask ourselves why
were all just along for the ride

thats the greatest thing about
this crazy life were
all just along for the ride
were all just along for the rideembed"
