i put on a play in my old house
in my cape jumpin on the old couch
puttin up lights when its cold out
mom and dad both seats sold out
show you my play

verse 2
havent seen the old house lately
wonder if they found my spaceship
i dont want my own love wasted
tell me this is what youre sayin

prechorus
if you both outgrew one another
i could start now lookin for a lover
but if love dies do i fuckin bother

chorus
i just really really really really wanna
show you my play
and i dont wanna do it for dad
at dads new place
i worked really really really really hard
let me show you my play
and i dont wanna do it twice
cause its not the same

ive been on dates bringin flowers
tryna be great for an hour
you and me might go sour
but if we dont hold out then were cowards

verse 4
i put on a play in my basement basement
mom and dad smilin faces faces
but now i dont know if they faked it faked it
guess everything is complicated

prechorus
if you both outgrew one another
i could start now lookin for a lover
but if love dies do i fuckin bother

chorus
i just really really really really wanna
show you my play
and i dont wanna do it for dad
at dads new place
i worked really really really really hard
let me show you my play
and i dont wanna do it twice
cause its not the same
bridge
you did everything everything everything that you could
we do everything everything everything til its through
ill do everything everything everything when im you

outro
but when i show you my play
will you pretend you didnt know
if i make a mistake
its gonna get really really really really bad
before its okay
but maybe youll forget it all
while youre watchin my play33embed"
