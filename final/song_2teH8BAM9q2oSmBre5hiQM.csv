intro mf doom
it never really mattered too much to me
that i was just too damn old to emcee
all that really matters is if your rhymes was ill
girl thats all that really mattered to me oh baby
verse mf doom
looks like its gonna be a great day today
to get some fresh air like a stray on a straightaway
hey you got a light nah a bud light
early in the morning face crud from like a mud fight
looky here its just the way the cookie tear
prepare to get hurt and mangled like kurt angle rookie year
the rocket scientist with the pocket wine list
some even say he might need some pussychiatrist
doom are you pondering what im pondering
yes but why would the darn thing be wandering
shes like a foundling barely worth fondling
my posses on broadway like mama i want to sing
mad plays the bass like the race card
villain on the case to break shards and leave her face scarred
groovy dude not to prove to be rude
but this stuff is like what you might put on movie food
uh what is jalapeños
get it like a whoopin when you holla at your seniors
dolla he can overhear the hashish fienda
he just came from over there the grass is greener
last wish i wish i had two more wishes
and i wish they fixed the door to the matrix theres mad glitches
spit so many verses sometimes my jaw twitches
one thing this party could use is more ahem
booze put yourself in your own shoes
and stay away from all those pairs of busted timbs you dont use
he only keep em to decorate
if you wanna peep em select a date
and bring a deep check like checkmate
i kid you not on the dotted line signed
ever since a minor kids considered him some kind of einstein
on a diamond mine grind  she was dumb fine
but not quite the type that you might want to wine and dine
couldnt find a pen had to think of a new trick
this one he wrote in cold blood with a toothpick
on second thought its too thick
his assistant said doom you sick he said true through acoustics
psycho his flow is drowned in lawrys seasoning
with micro power hes sound and right reasoning
its easy as pi threepointonefour
one more one false move and theyre done for—you might also like38embed"
