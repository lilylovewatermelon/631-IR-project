smokin on that cali kush my boy sells it by the bush
im packin heat with the 45 magnum in my belt
shawty lookin so fine wish i couldve felt
when i drugged the bitch the drug i couldve melt
im feelin so fine in the back of my hummer
ridin down a main street im stuntin like a winner
ive been in the running for a long time
i feel its safe to say that dpalm can bust a bomb rhyme
when i write down a verse there aint no controversy
look at your bitch shes fifteen call that statutory
smokin on arabian shit dont you know the good stuff
the smoke hit the back of your throat the shit is rough
told you suckers dpalm gonna murder this investigation
whos the next bad rapper turnin on a mutilator
fry you bitches up in what is called frialator
i worked at fast food dont fuck with what im sayin
i dont wanna be the next rapper on tv
i just wanna be me enough about succeeding
smokin spliffs and we be hittin that mauwie wowie shit
drinkin til we dazey knockin back down shots of bacardi

verse 2 prez
parental advisory stickers all over my merchandise
like i was gonna put a fuck you in front of my merchants eyes
who the fuck is dana carvey im the master of disguise
get as high as i am right now and youll be clappin in the skies
dont be foolish that plots kinda like the flick mission impossible
your homeboys sayin shit that got me actin kinda pausible
pause thats aka for actin gay
concoct your own acronym for prez is gonna spray
best believe me ill do it my words are the truest
and i will throw some shit that leaves you lyin in your fluids
young money cosigner please free weezy
so we can be broadcast live like cable tv
im new to this league but great like john wall
we be burnin sean paul hard to kill steven seagal
we goin in like a robber hide your toddler
windows we smash em tvs we grab em dont holler
no problems solutions we got em
melt your head off in layers like a human gobstopper
orville poppin smith  wes glockin
and we treat red lights like bed nights and we aint stoppinyou might also likeembed"
