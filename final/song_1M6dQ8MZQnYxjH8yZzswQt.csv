have you ever fed a lover with just your hands
closed your eyes and trusted just trusted
have you ever thrown a fistful of glitter in the air
have you ever looked fear in the face and said i just dont care

chorus
its only half past the point of no return
the tip of the iceberg the sun before the burn
the thunder before the lightning and the breath before the phrase
have you ever felt this way

verse 2
have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone
your whole life waiting on the ring to prove youre not alone
have you ever been touched so gently you had to cry
have you ever invited a stranger to come inside

chorus
its only half past the point of oblivion
the hourglass on the table the walk before the run
the breath before the kiss and the fear before the flames
have you ever felt this way

bridge
lalalala lalalala
there you are
sitting in the garden
clutching my coffee
calling me sugar
you called me sugar

have you ever wished for an endless night
lassoed the moon and the stars and pulled that rope tight
have you ever held your breath and asked yourself
will it ever get better than tonight
