different you a angel true to me
they gon try to convince me that its different
but i know its in my spirit and i can feel it yeah
she dont bring up when these bitches bein miserable and typical
take my blood baby we goin digital
thousand dollar ski boots by perry ellis
and i dont plan on taking no ski trip they aint even drip woo
chanel fanny pack out in egypt aint no reason
gucci bucket hat for all my heathens
temporary distractions aint no grievin cause they reachin
copy and they clone what im feedin they be thievin
china white in my home be strategic i got fiji
grind up on my own cause i see how they mistreat me
dont you let em turn you on me i see it i can peep it
clear like white patron i can see it you conceited
talkin on the phone you can hear my tone mischievous
plastic or the chrome whatever we need to keep us heated
canary yellow stone girl shine on my demons
i feel it in my bones when you takin out my semen
i purchased a couple cashmere sweaters this evening
take you for a walk in the park like a deacon
half a ticket pullin up on you and mamacita
give you the keys in her face to show her how i treat you
im takin you out on dinner dates got franklins like aretha
trained in the warzone codeine in my one liter
pain in my attitude its vicious and its lethal
came off the avenue and ran into a diva
brokenhearted baby had me down had to get you
you out the garden baby im from the jungle with the leeches
clouded my lungs up and i slowly started speakin
rain thunderin showin you grace for this meetin
givin you compliments throughout the day and the weekend
fall in love with revenge hopin thatll kill my demons
sittin out on my porch im in disbelief
give me glory give me lori thats victory
moment i drop your name is it chemistry
fuck this money and fame if its meant to be
like a rock star showin up at a symphony
rock hard pissin on my enemy
fuck em all we dont show em sympathy
her favorite color blue i bought her tiffany
out the trap spot i got my dope degree
they persuaded me they gon try to persuade you to leave
had laid in it played in it and stayed in it for weeks
mistakes like earthquakes they cant break us a piece
im not catholic but had to have a talk with the priest
acrobatic flips gettin european cash cross the sea
its so radical automatical im knowin we elite
fascinated by the lifestyle you know it bring greed
fascinated by your feistiness okay
fascinated over your crisis its warfare
when we roll one we converse we like orphans
coast to coast float the ocean like a starfish
check my post ima toast to the heartless
thats why im prayin for better days on this continent
i dont need a ghost to write my promises
you boost my confidence
chorus
lord forgive me ive been on a rampage
grim reaper ridin in the rolls royce yeah yeah
spent a day to sober up then i popped me one up
i cant pop up when i want with her she popular
ive been tryna fight my demons ive been tryna fight my cup
i always tell her she my therapy i told her it was rough
she acceptin all my flaws i got diamonds with the cut
ive been sufferin withdrawals missin out on real love8embed"
