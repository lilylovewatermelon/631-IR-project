you might find us early sunrisin
tractor drivin growin your greens
stayin alive workin 9 to 5
just livin that american dream
were the plumbers and the preachers
the precare teachers
the mailman in your neighbourhood
but it dont matter what we do
we damn sure do it good

chorus
my kinda folk buy beer on friday
get right on saturday night
were all good people
spend sunday under steeple
come monday well be right on time
there oughta be a law against workin this hard
and still havin this much fun
we get it done drink a beer
catch a fish hunt a deer
and then well firе up a little smoke
me and my kinda folk

verse 2
thеres a whip of southern wind singin
and a red sun sinkin
back beneath a grove of oak trees
were takin it slow easy come easy go
a county road philosophy
i aint sayin its right what were livin like
but it feels pretty hard to beat

yeah my kinda folk buy beer on friday
get right on saturday night
were all good people
spend sunday under steeple
come monday well be right on time
there oughta be a law against workin this hard
and still havin this much fun
we get it done drink a beer
catch a fish hunt a deer
and then well fire up a little smoke
me and my kinda folk

we get it done drink a beer
catch a fish hunt a deer
and then well fire up a little smoke
