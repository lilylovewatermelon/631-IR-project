if you want to pin me down
better get your hammer girl
and nail me to the ground
cause you wont find no grass stains
on the bottom of my feet
the only home ive ever known
is out there on the street

you call me insane
honey thats my middle name
and i dont care which way the wind will blow
cause i dont know
so down the road i go

you see i tried to settle down
not too long ago
you can lock my body up
but you cant calm my soul
i dont want to hurt you
or put you on a shelf
but my daddy told me all my life
youve got to be yourself

you call me insane
honey thats my middle name
and i dont care which way the wind will blow
cause i dont know so down the road i go
see travis tritt liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likeim sure theres lots of guys out there
whove learned to tow the line
complared to them my life may look a wreck
but girl youve been to college
so you should know by now
and if you cant understand me
what the hell did you expect

im giving you fair warning
im gonna say goodbye
and when im walkin out the door
dont want to hear you cry
theres so much highway out there
that i aint never seen
and all i need is cigarettes guitars and gasoline

you call me insane
honey thats my middle name
and i dont care which way the wind will blow
cause i dont know
so honey down the road i go
down the road i go
ill see you around
cause im leaving town
yeah yeah yeahhhembed"
