you arise along with the sun
where have you been darlin what have you done
you were out finding trouble again
theres a fire in your eyes and theres blood on your hands

come inside and lie down to sleep
you aint gonna run and you know that youre beat
rest awhile theyre coming for you
theres a price to be paid for the things that we do

bridge
fall asleep and forget all your troubles
dream of laughter and old friends and lovers
dream of when you were innocent
dream forever

verse 2
lord knows youve been round in your day
but this kind of trouble wont just go away
darlin now youre adrift in the deep
so just lay down your head and ill sing you to sleep
