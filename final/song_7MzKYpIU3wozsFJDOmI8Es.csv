maryanne the matriarch is stirring in the dark
she knows just what to do with time
but i dont know where to start
cause in the daylight there are monsters in my closet
using up the wifi
hope she never knows whats on my mind on my own time
cause that feels right

prechorus
as i move very well
yes i move very well
in silence

verse 2
every phone call im pacing the halls
am i the only one that sleeps with the tv on
and im good feels better than im hanging on
when i need the time alone
so i pitched a tent where the wild things crow
to feel the earth again
try to avoid the pollution from this revolution
try to see the dust on the stars

prechorus
babe i move very well
yes i move very well
in silence they say
see mt joy liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likechorus

im a wreck im a wreck
but im your wreck like im your wreck like

postchorus
lifes a bitch i swallowed
no teeth no hands
and lifes a bitch i swallowed
no tears no plans

and whatever happens theres money in the mattress
and whatever happens please remember all the laughter
stitch it together kid i know you know better
take a real deep breath now burn the letter
this is headlights in the fog
this is headlights in the
ooh

outro
come meet me in san francisco
come move through this fog
cause when we are together
its that slip off your shoes that snap in the groove
but when you take forever
i know time moves slow but i wanna know
you will remember that i put my soul into it all3embed"
