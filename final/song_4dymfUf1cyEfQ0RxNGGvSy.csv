why dont they hate you
why do they hate me
why are their blogs set up to debate
but only forsake me
huh how am i doing
and why do you care
when my failures come with smiles
when i win i write you just compare
so why must i try to own your love
when im better than what ive been
but thats not good enough
why why
you cant hear my decency
instead of me singin at friends
im talkin over enemies

chorus
the world is so loud loud loud
its so loud loud loud
its like hearin pins drop in the crowd
they wont stop until they goddamn tear you down
man the world is so loud loud loud
its so loud loud loud
i try to drown them all out in my sound
but they wont stop stop until they tear you down
until they tear me down take me as i am
until they tear me down as i am
you might also likeverse 2
wish for my destruction
thats why im so reluctant
want me to pass the ball
but youre not on my team
you wanna cast a stone
were so ready to fight
got the nerve to ask how did i sleep
i heard you all through the night
somebody tell me why
i know its not just me
over a billion voices dont think just speak
you hate me when im up hey
you love me when im down woo
im so confused by the world hey

chorus
hey the world is so loud loud loud
its so loud loud loud
its like hearin pins drop in the crowd
they wont stop until they goddamn tear you down
man the world is so loud loud loud
its so loud loud loud
i try to drown them all out in my sound
but they wont stop stop until they tear you down
until they tear me down hey oohwoah woo take me as i am
until they tear me down as i am
until they tear me down
until they tear me down
until they tear me down
until they tear me down
bridge
long ago i swear
i couldnt hear a sound
i couldnt hear a sound
theres a little girl now
with a little old fortune with a little old fortune
hoping this is true hoping this is true
so take me down tear me down

chorus
oh the world is so loud its so loud loud loud
its so loud its so loud loud loud
its like hearin pins drop in the crowd
they wont stop until they goddamn tear you down
and the world is so loud its so loud hey loud loud
its so loud loud loud
i try to drown them all out in my sound i try to drown them all out
but they wont stop stop until they tear you down
until they tear you down
until they tear you down yeah yeah yeah yeah
