got you cranked up loud getting pumped for the night
but when we pull in her drive gonna turn you down quiet
ill have one arm around her one on the wheel
hey radio lets make a deal

chorus
ill do the driving you get us going
play us a summer song that she knows and
ill find a spot ill pull it over
you slow it down and ill pull her closer
ill find the moon and you bring the backbeat
you set the mood well dance in the front seat
hey radio while youre playing well be falling
ill do the kissin you do the talkin

verse 2
lets make it a night that shell never forget
put nothing but thinking bout love in her head
with nothing but the glow of your light in the dark
take us home with the one that we call ours

chorus
ill do the driving you get us going
play us a summer song that she knows and
ill find a spot ill pull it over
you slow it down and ill pull her closer
ill find the moon and you bring the backbeat
you set the mood well dance in the front seat
hey radio while youre playing well be falling
ill do the kissin you do the talkin

outro
ill do the driving you get us going
play us a summer song that she knows and
ill find a spot ill pull it over
you slow it down and ill pull her closer
ill find the moon and you bring the backbeat
you set the mood well dance in the front seat
hey radio while youre playing well be falling
hey radio while youre playing well be falling all night long and
ill do the kissin you do the talkin
yeah ill do the kissin you do the talkinembed"
