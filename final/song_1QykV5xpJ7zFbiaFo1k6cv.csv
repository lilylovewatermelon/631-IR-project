youve been sleeping the whole night
tried my best to not even call
cause if youre not here by my side
ill come knocking at your door
did you mean what you had said
cause its fucking with my head
id give it all to get you back
but now i know i know you dont mean that

prechorus
cause i can feel you when im low
i can feel you when im high
and struggle to sleep when im alone im alone

chorus
cause i cant get you out of my mind
cause nothing is true and no one is you
and nothing at all ever feels right
youre caught in my head youre stuck in my mind
im trying my best to say my goodbyes ohohohoh
i think its time to go i think its time to go
its time to go

verse 2
you always saw the best in me
although i know i could make it hard
but you could always make me laugh
youd take the good youd take the good from all the bad
