coming from where he did
he was turned away from every door like joseph

chorus
to even the toughest among us that would be too much

verse 2
he didnt know what it was to be black
til they gave him his change
but didnt want to touch his hand

chorus
to even the toughest among us dont you know that would be too much

isnt it just enough
how hard it is to live
isnt it hard enough
just to make it through a day

bridge
the secret of their fear and their suspicion
standing there looking like an angel
in his brown shoes
his short suit
his white shirt
and his cuffs a little frayed
coming from where he did
he was such a dignified child
