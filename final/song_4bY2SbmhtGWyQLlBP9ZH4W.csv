typical enough for me
that i burn inside in agony
what power will enable me
to bury my vision
the hunger coming over me
as i learn to hide the agony
to make a final remedy
to close that door once and for all

in a world that i don’t want to know
with a message that i never want to send
to be freed from all of this
