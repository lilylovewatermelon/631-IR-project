and memories like spies
and salt betrays my eyes again
i started losing sleep and gaining weight
and wishing i was was ten again
so i could be your friend again

these days we go to waste like wine
thats turned to turpentine
its six am and im all messed up
i didnt mean to waste your time
so ill fall back in line
but im warning you were growing up

i heard you found some pretty words to say
you found your little game to play
and theres no one allowed in
then just when we believe we could be great
reality it permeates
and conquers from within again

these days we go to waste like wine
thats turned to turpentine
its six am and im all messed up
i didnt mean to waste your time
so ill fall back in line
but im warning you were growing up
i know were growing
i know were ok
these days we go to waste like wine
thats turned to turpentine
its six am and im all messed up
i didnt mean to waste your time
so ill fall back in line
but im warning you were growing upsee brandi carlile liveget tickets as low as 189you might also like1embed"
