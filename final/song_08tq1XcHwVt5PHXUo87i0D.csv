im jealous of the blue jeans that youre wearing
and the way theyre holding you so tight
im jealous of the moon that keeps on staring
so lock the door and turn out the night

chorus
i want you all to myself
we dont need anyone else
let our bodies do the talking
let our shadows paint the wall
i want you here in my arms
well hide away in the dark
slip your hand in my back pocket
go and let your long hair fall
i want you all to myself
to myself

verse 2
im jealous of the song that youve been singing
and the way its rolling off your lips
it might be selfish but im thinking
i dont need nothing between you
leaning for another kiss yeah

chorus
i want you all to myself
we dont need anyone else
let our bodies do the talking
let our shadows paint the wall
i want you here in my arms
well hide away in the dark
slip your hand in my back pocket
go and let your long hair fall
i want you all all all to myself
to myself yeah
