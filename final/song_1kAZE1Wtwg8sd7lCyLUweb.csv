i woke up with the power out
not really something to shout about
ice has covered up my parents hands
dont have any dreams dont have any plans
i went out into the night
i went out to find some light
kids are swinging from the power lines
nobodys home so nobody minds

verse 2
i woke up on the darkest night
neighbors all were shouting that they found the light
we found the light
shadows jumping all over my walls
some of them big some of them small
i went out into the night
i went out to pick a fight with anyone
light a candle for the kids
jesus christ dont keep it hid

chorus
hoooo

ice has covered up my parents hands
dont have any dreams dont have any plans
growing up in some strange storm
nobodys cold nobodys warm
i went out into the night
i went out to find some light
kids are dying out in the snow
look at them go look at them go

chorus
hoooo
hoooo
hoooo
oooo

bridge
and the powers out in the heart of man
take it from your heart put it in your hand hand
whats the plan
whats the plan

verse 4
is it a dream is it a lie
i think ill let you decide
just light a candle for the kids
jesus christ dont keep it hid
because nothings hid
from us kids
you aint fooling nobody
with the lights out
outro
and the powers out in the heart of man
take it from your heart put it in your hand
and theres something wrong in the heart of man
you take it from your heart and put it in your hand
whered you go6embed"
