12lhVucmZIwc7v9gZEauv7,The Taker - Live in Texas - September 1974,Waylon Jennings,76v3XMhmRuxlakE6e3lKox,"1 contributorswat overkill appendix of case studies lyricsparamilitary drug raids have been growing in number for 25 years as they’ve become more frequent so too have incidents in which these raids have gone wrong criminologist peter kraska says his research shows that between 1989 and 2001 at least 780 cases of flawed paramilitary raids reached the appellate level a dramatic increase over the 1980s where such cases were rare or earlier when they were practically nonexistent280 yet despite the ongoing reporting of botched raids in media outlets the phenomenon is still consistently dismissed by supporters of paramilitary policing as a series of “isolated incidents” the truth is mistaken raids continue to happen with disturbing regularity they can’t all be isolated incidents this section will catalogue an extensive list of botched raids between 1995 and april 2006 found over the course of several months of research it is by no means comprehensive the cato institute has also plotted an expanded list of cases on an interactive map which can be found at httpwwwcatoorg raidmap the aim of this section is to demonstrate that botched paramilitary drug raids—and the death injury and terrorizing of innocents that come with them—aren’t merely a regrettable infrequent consequence of an otherwise effective police tactic rather they’re the inevitable consequence of a flawed overbearing and unnecessary form of drug policing wrong address the botched drug raids that seem to generate the most public outrage are those in which police force entry into a home that turns out to be the wrong address it’s bad enough to have a system in place that is needlessly violent and provocative for known or suspected drug offenders but it’s particularly frustrating to see wholly innocent people terrorized injured and killed because police policymakers and judges cling to a flawed policy281 no case better illustrates the preventable tragic consequences of this flawed system than the death of alberta spruill alberta spruillon may 16 2003 a dozen new york city police officers stormed an apartment building in harlem on a noknock warrant they were acting on a tip from a confidential informant who told them a convicted felon was dealing drugs and guns from the sixth floor there was no felon the only resident in the building was alberta spruill described by friends as a “devout churchgoer”282 before entering police deployed a flashbang grenade the blinding deafening explosion stunned the 57yearold city worker as the officers realized their mistake and helped spruill to her feet the woman slipped into cardiac arrest she died two hours later a police investigation would later find that the drug dealer the raid team was looking for had been arrested days earlier and was still in police custody he couldn’t possibly have been at spruill’s apartment the officers who conducted the raid did no investigation whatsoever to corroborate the informant’s tip283 worse a police source later told the new york daily news that the informant had offered police tips on several occasions none of which had led to an arrest his record was so poor in fact that he was due to be dropped from the city’s informant list284 nevertheless police took his tip on the excon in spruill’s building to the manhattan district attorney’s office which approved the application for a noknock entry a judge then issued the warrant resulting in spruill’s death the entire process took only a matter of hours after the spruill case the media began to take notice of other victims of botched noknocks including the following three cases in the fall of 2002 about six months before the raid that killed spruill

• williemae mack on september 3 2002 police broke down the door of brooklyn resident williemae mack in a predawn drug raid her twin 13yearold sons were asleep at the time one frightened by the noise and the explosive device police used to gain entry hid under the bed police pulled him out and put a gun to his head police then handcuffed both boys at gunpoint they found no drugs they had raided the wrong address285

• robert and marie rogerson october 15 2002 about 20 police armed with pistols and shotguns served a noknock warrant on the home of retired police officer robert rogers and his wife marie the two were watching television when the officers stormed their home in queens mr rogers initially grabbed his handgun believing the police to be intruders once he recognized they were law enforcement he dropped his weapon and covered it with his body rogers later told newsday that had the raiding officers seen his gun “i’d be dead” again the police had the wrong address286marie rogers would take the news of alberta spruill’s death especially hard “when i heard about what happened to this woman i broke down and cried” rogers later told the new york post “you would have thought that i knew her then i was angry”287

• michael thompson a day before the raid on the rogerses police also burst into the home of michael thompson also of queens that raid left the man’s large mahogany front door broken into pieces the police then trained their guns on thompson’s chest while they searched his home and the upstairs apartment of a tenant for drugs once again they had raided the wrong address288 the victims of the above three raids were represented in civil suits filed by norman siegel former director of the new york civil liberties union mr siegel told the new york times in the fall of 2003 that according to police data police were conducting about 460 such searches of private residences each month with the vast majority of those served under noknock warrants289 in fact just days after the raid on the rogerses’ home siegel held a press conference and pled with police to end the practice of noknock raids nearly predicting the spruill raid that would happen a year later siegel warned “we must do a better job of noknock search warrants otherwise someone might wind up dead as a result of how we implement this procedure”290

• timothy brockmanjust two days before the spruill raid police from nypd and the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms displayed extraordinary ineptitude in executing another botched noknock raid this time on the home of former marine timothy brockman acting on a tip from a confused anonymous informant police stormed the public housing apartment of the 61yearold brockman who used a walker to get around police deployed a flashbang grenade setting brockman’s carpet on fire then handcuffed the man and threw him to the floor while they searched his home for drugs they had the wrong address brockman would later be cleared of all charges291 the brockman case is another illustration of how the mishmash of court precedents governing the use of noknock raids can lead to errors in brockman’s case new york police wanted to raid the apartment on the basis of the testimony of a single informant who had visited the targeted residence on just one occasion state law required more evidence for a noknock warrant federal law however is more deferential to police and in this case allowed for a noknock entry new york investigators merely called the us attorney for the southern district of new york who sent an agent from alcohol tobacco and firearms along for the raid the brockman raid was now a federal case governed by federal guidelines miscommunication between local and federal police led to series of errors that caused the police to mistakenly break down brockman’s door though a potentially grave and inexcusable error on the part of federal and local police the brockman case was ignored by the media and treated with indifference by the police as the times writes “at the time the incident received no publicity and no serious attention from the police leadership”292 in a followup piece published months after spruill’s death the village voicereported that complaints about police abuses with respect to noknocks had been pouring in for years “until spruill’s death the nypd had done nothing to stem the number of incidents” the voice wrote “despite receiving a memo from the citizen complaint review board in january noting the high number of raid complaints last march the naacp also approached nypd commissioner raymond w kelly about the raids”293 indeed the new york times ran a story back in 1998 a full five years before spruill’s death headlined “as number of police raids increase so do questions”294 the paper noted that the number of narcotics search warrants issued in new york city doubled from 1447 in 1994 to 2977 in 1998 most of these according to the times were noknock warrants295 the times also profiled several cases of botched no knocks from the late 1990s among them were the following

• mary and cornelius jefferson the article began with a description of a botched noknock on the home of cornelius and mary jefferson a couple in their 60s in which police used a battering ram to obliterate the front door of an apartment “where plastic slipcovers protect the sofas and diplomas and awards line the walls” cornelius told the times “i thought they were coming to rob us coming to kill us” they had the wrong address296

• ellis elliott on february 27 1998 police conducted a noknock raid on the bronx home of elliott on the basis of information they later determined to be “miscommunication with an informant” as police attempted to break down his door elliott feared he was being attacked and fired a shot through the door police responded with a barrage of 26 bullets all of which miraculously missed elliott elliott was then dragged out of his home naked allegedly peppered with racial epithets then arrested on charges of possessing an unlicensed weapon police later admitted their error and paid 1000 to have elliott’s door repaired297elliott pled guilty to disorderly conduct for firing at the officers and was given a conditional discharge no police officers were charged or disciplined for the error298

• the crown heights raid on may 1 1998 police broke down the door to a home in brooklyn’s crown heights neighborhood in a noknock raid that was based on the word of a single confidential informant they expected to find a drug den instead according to the times police found “a retired banker a home health attendant and their two daughters” one of the daughters was mentally disabled and was showering at the time of the raid police pulled her from the shower handcuffed her and despite her pleas to the officers that she was menstruating refused to give her a sanitary pad until she began visibly bleeding299

• sandra soto on june 5 1997 police carried out a noknock warrant based on information from an anonymous informant in the east new york area of brooklyn the warrant instructed them to raid a gray door marked “2m” finding no such door they simply broke down the nearest door which was red and marked “2l” they found a woman sandra soto and her two children—but no drugs300

•shaunsia patterson new york times columnist bob herbert later reported that on the same dayas the raid on ellis elliott’s home new york city police raided the bronx apartment of shaunsia patterson and her two children ages three and two patterson was eight months pregnant police first grabbed patterson’s sister misty 15 who was also in the room and threw her to the floor they then confronted patterson who was sitting on her bed one officer pushed patterson onto her back another jumped on top of her patterson was eventually pushed to the floor and handcuffed while in patterson’s words “one of the cops stepped on the side of my face and pressed my face into the floor” when patterson asked what the police wanted she says she was told to “shut the fuck up” police handcuffed patterson while she wore only her underwear officers then screamed expletives at the two women while they scoured the apartment for drugs—demolishing the furniture kitchen and floor in the process the raid so frightened patterson she urinated on herself the police refused to allow her to change police also refused to show her a warrant hours later an officer told her “we got the wrong apartment” and released her from her handcuffs one confidential police source told new york times columnist bob herbert referring to the patterson and elliott raids “two in one day—that’s bad but i’ll tell you what i honestly believe—i don’t think this happens that often”301 those kinds of assurances from police officials are common in new york and elsewhere despite repeated media reports of “wrong door” raids throughout the late 1990s city officials continued to insist such incidents were uncommon—and nothing to be alarmed about but in february 1998 the new york police department circulated a memo among the city’s police officers instructing them how to contact locksmiths and door repair services should they break down the door to the wrong address suggesting that mistakes were in fact fairly common 302 as discussed earlier the review procedures new york city had in place to deal with police brutality failed as well the civilian complaint review board hamstrung by bureaucracy limited jurisdiction and squabbles with the police union was helpless to effect any real change to stem the tide of “wrong door” warrants new york had plenty of warnings that a case like spruill’s might happen the city’s public officials did little to heed them

just after spruill’s death and ensuing media coverage manhattan borough president c virginia fields set up a hotline for victims of erroneous noknock raids for the first time city officials encouraged victims of mistaken raids to come forward the hotline received more than 100 calls in its first week of operation303fields’s staff followed up with many of those calls and her office published a report detailing its findings among the cases included in that report are the following

• mary bardy bardy went to the city council hearings to give her account of a january 2002 botched raid on her home police mistakenly believed her son was dealing drugs the raiding officers broke down her door and at gunpoint ordered everyone inside—including her 2yearold granddaughter—to lie down313 “i saw what happened to that poor woman spruill and i said this is crazy this can’t keep happening” bardy told the new york daily news 314 bardy who had recently retired after an administrative career with the nypd said she wrote “dozens of letters” and “made lots of phone calls” after the raid on her home but found no one who could give her answers about the circumstances of the investigation leading to the night police broke into her home her son was never charged315 a day after the spruill city council hearings manhattan borough president fields held hearings of her own according to the village voice dozens of black and latino victims— nurses secretaries and former officers— packed her chambers airing tales one more horrifying than the next most were unable to hold back tears as they described police ransacking their homes handcuffing children and grandparents putting guns to their heads and being verbally and often physically abusive in many cases victims had received no followup from the nypd even to fix busted doors or other physical damage the voicethen echoed the newsday report some complainants reported that they had filed grievances with the citizen complaint review board and were told there was no police misconduct unless there is proven abuse the ccrb disregards complaints about warrants that hold a correct address but are faulty because of bad evidence from a confidential informant316 the key recommendation from the fields report was that nypd produce an annual report detailing “all statistics regarding the execution of warrants” fields believed such a report would provide some transparency and accountability in the issuance and execution of drug warrants particularly those authorizing noknock raids nypd issued no such report in 2005 less than a year after spruill’s death nypd was back in the headlines with the mistaken raid on martin and leona goldberg mentioned earlier317 another highprofile wrongdoor raid that provoked local media and public officials to take a harder look at the use of paramilitary drug raids was the denver colorado case of ismael mena ismael mena on september 29 1999 a denver swat team executed a noknock drug raid on mena’s home mena a mexican immigrant believed he was being robbed and confronted the swat team with a gun police said they fired the eight shots that killed mena only after mena ignored repeated warnings to drop his weapon and first fired at them mena’s family says police never announced themselves and that it was the police who fired first318 police later discovered they had raided the wrong home on the basis of bad information from a confidential informant319they found no drugs in mena’s house nor were any found in his system320 subsequent investigations by the city police department’s internal affairs division and by a special prosecutor found no wrongdoing on the part of the swat team but weeks later new details began to emerge about the mena case an aide to the special prosecutor for example said that mena’s body had been moved at least 18 inches after he was shot a lab report then found that the gunshot residue found on mena’s hand didn’t match mena’s gun but was instead only consistent with the residue given off by the submachine guns the swat team uses police found no fingerprints on mena’s gun or on the ammunition inside it raising speculation that the gun was tampered with or planted321 an internal affairs investigation cleared the swat team of wrongdoing but did find that the officer who prepared the search warrant for mena’s home falsified information322as the shooting gained traction in the media denver city officials began to portray mena as a mexican criminal refugee wanted for murder mena had shot a man in mexico in selfdefense but had been cleared of any wrongdoing a “blame the victim” strategy unfortunately common in police brutality cases 323 members of the police department also later started what local media would call a “spy file” on a citizens’ organization agitating for a more thorough investigation of mena’s death worse the head of the police intelligence unit that kept a “spy file” on mena’s supporters was also the head of the swat team that conducted the raid on mena’s home324

mena’s family eventually hired former fbi agent james kearney to conduct a private investigation over the course of that investigation kearney became convinced that denver police murdered mena then planted the gun to cover up the botched raid kearney found evidence not uncovered by previous investigations including two slugs in the floor of mena’s apartment that suggest the raid didn’t happen as swat officials said it did kearney made his accusations on a local radio station leading to a lawsuit against the station and kearney by members of the swat team the radio station settled kearney in turn filed suit against the swat team and sought to prove his allegations of a coverup in court325 the suit was thrown out in federal court but as of november 2005 kearney was still waiting on word of his appeal326 mena’s family ultimately settled with the city of denver for 400000327 to its credit the city of denver instituted some strong reforms in response to mena’s death the reforms drastically cut down on the number of noknock warrants carried out in the city though reforms stopped short of an outright prohibition on noknock warrants for drug raids328 denver is the exception however most highprofile swat tragedies temporarily put reporters on the scent for similar abuses light a fire under activists and put policymakers on the defensive but that public scrutiny is usually followed by a return to business as usual the case that spurred the capital times indepth investigation of swat team proliferation to smalltown wisconsin stemmed from an incident in tiny dalton a rural town 50 miles north of madison wendy and jesus olveda wendy olveda who was five months pregnant her husband jesus and their threeyearold daughter zena were at home one evening in october 2000 when a blackclad swat team broke down their front door and threw the couple facefirst to the floor zena olveda looked on from the couch jesus olveda told the paper that as he lifted his head to tell police they had the wrong address “one of them put a knee on my head and ground it into the floor”329 police had the wrong address when they realized their error they rushed through the olveda’s garage door to the home next door the times reported that one officer went back to the olveda’s home minutes later to retrieve the search warrant the olvedas filed a claim for compensation against the police departments in charge of carrying out the raid the claim was rejected330 two years before the olveda raid police in another small wisconsin town mistakenly raided the home of daniel and cythia cuervo holding the couple at gunpoint while the officers ransacked their home the cuervos eventually accepted a settlement in their lawsuit against the responsible local police agencies the mistaken raid on their home inspired a significant reorganization of the multijurisdictional enforcement group narcotics unit in the lake winnebago area of wisconsin331 but the rash of media reports of botched raids in wisconsin in the year 2000 came a full five years after the state had already done some introspection on paramilitary police tactics when such tactics had ended with a man’s death scott bryant on april 17 1995 police in dodge county wisconsin forcefully entered the mobile home of scott bryant after finding traces of marijuana in his garbage the officers would later say they knocked and announced before entering but neighbors who witnessed the raid say police entered without doing either moments later detective robert neuman shot an unarmed bryant in the chest killing him bryant’s eightyearold son was asleep in the next room neuman told investigators he “can’t remember” pulling the trigger332 dodge county sheriff stephen fitzgerald compared the shooting to a hunting accident333 two years later bryant’s family was awarded a 950000 settlement by dodge county334 after the bryant case made headlines three victims of a similar raid by the dodge county sheriff’s department also filed suit according to that lawsuit police raided a home in juneau wisconsin after finding traces of marijuana and material “suspected of packing cocaine” in garbage bags outside the house police entered the home “suddenly and violently” at 245 am threw the three occupants to the floor and handcuffed them police then searched the house for more than three hours no charges were filed335 after the settlement in the bryant case and a year after the shooting sheriff fitzgerald seemed remorseful he told the milwaukee journalsentinel that his own department would make substantial changes to the way it conducts searches “it’s safe to say any time there’s a tragic accident like this that people would want to do things differently” he said336 unfortunately that message didn’t make it to other small towns in wisconsin according to the capital times 18 new swat teams have been formed across the state since the bryant shooting337 although the case studies listed here cut off in the mid1990s the epidemic of botched militarystyle drug raids goes back to the early 1980s338 as far back as 1990 an article in playboy magazine took note of a curious rise in media accounts of botched drug raids and published a list of more than a dozen documented “wrong door” raids from the 1980s339 in 2004 usa today ran an editorial citing the spruill and goldberg raids and calling for reform in the execution of drug warrants but the same paper ran a similar story more than a decade earlier in 1993 and even earlier in 1989 ticking off a list of botched raids and a critique of noknock and paramilitary raids in general including the problems with confidential informants asset forfeiture lack of oversight and the militarization of civilian policing described in this study340 the editorial also included responses from law enforcement officials dismissing botched raids as “isolated incidents”341 so not only is the problem of mistaken raids not new neither is the cycle of media and public officials temporarily taking notice of them then neglecting to enact any real reforms here in reverse chronological order is a partial list of other documented wrongdoor raids dating back to 1995

• h victor buerosse on december 30 2005 police in pewaukee wisconsin broke into the home of 68yearold h victor buerosse in a predawn raid buerosse was thrown into a closet door then to the ground and hit in the head with a police shield despite his protests that police had the wrong address they didn’t concede their mistake until a sergeant arrived later they left without an apology the swat team eventually raided the correct residence where they found a small amount of marijuana buerosse a retired attorney told a local reporter “swat teams are not meant for simple pot possession cases the purpose of swat teams it to give police departments a specially trained unit to react to a violent situation not to create one this should not happen in america to me you can’t justify carrying out simple routine police work this way”342

• the andre madison raidon november 7 1995 police in north minneapolis minnesota raided the home of andre madison after local media merely recounted the police version of events minneapolis city pages conducted an indepth investigation according to the paper’s account police obtained a noknock warrant on madison’s home after a confidential informant allegedly purchased some marijuana at the residence454 at about 8 pm the minneapolis paramilitary unit called eru deployed flashbang grenades at the front of madison’s home at the same time police from the city’s housing unit were entering the home from the rear reports at the time say police began firing when madison fired his shotgun at them but a forensics team later determined that madison’s gun was never fired the night of the raid instead an investigation conducted by a police chief from a nearby county speculated that the housing unit officers mistook the flashbang grenades deployed by the eru unit for gunfire from the suspect and opened fire themselves the two police units then mistook one another for assailants and began to fire upon one another when officer mark lanasa went down shot in the neck by a colleague the commanding officer called for “suppressive fire” giving officers carte blanche to shoot at will upon hearing that a fellow officer had gone down more police soon arrived at the scene they too joined in the shooting hundreds of rounds were fired into the building there were bullet holes found in neighboring buildings as well madison the suspect was shot in the neck and the arm miraculously no one was killed455 police found only a small amount of marijuana in madison’s home he was never charged with a drug crime he was charged with four felony counts of seconddegree assault with a firearm—not for shooting but for pointing his shotgun at police he could have been sentenced to 12 years in prison madison insists he thought the police were intruders prosecutors then offered to let madison plead to a misdemeanor count of reckless use of a firearm which carries a sentence of just 90 days the hitch was that a guilty plea to the lesser charge would have prevented madison from suing the city the subsequent investigation and report from the outside police chief concluded that minneapolis’s eru unit “executes too many warrants and relies too heavily on dynamic doorramming raids” explaining that “there are other alternative tactics that eru is aware of however when so many raids are conducted using dynamic entry other tactics may be forgotten”456 confronting nonviolent offenders with violent tactics drug war supporters and casual observers often find it difficult to criticize paramilitary raids ending in the death or injury of nonviolent drug users or dealers noting that those people are after all breaking the law if drugs are found at the scene even raids ending in a suspect’s death are somehow deemed less troubling than raids ending in the deaths of innocents the case against the suspect and in favor of the decision to raid with a paramilitary unit seems to grow stronger if the suspect also possesses weapons or worse points them at or attempts to use them against the raiding police officers perhaps it’s true that such scenarios shouldn’t trouble us as much as raids on the homes of innocents but they’re still troubling for two reasons first by some estimates more than 96 million americans have consumed marijuana at some point in their lives457 the overwhelming majority of them have done so peacefully and at the expense of no one else legalizing marijuana is a debate for another time but it would be absurd to suggest that the 96 million americans who have tried or continue to smoke marijuana have effectively given up their fourth amendment rights smoking marijuana or even selling it to someone else isn’t a violent crime and consequently doesn’t merit a home invasion by police armed with the weaponry and mindset of soldiers it certainly doesn’t merit death yet a troublingly high number of these raids are aimed at marijuana offenders second as discussed earlier given the tactics associated with noknock warrants it isn’t difficult to see why people might grab weapons to defend themselves and their families when police violently storm a home late at night or just before dawn that a suspect pointed a weapon at police serving a noknock warrant doesn’t prove that the suspect was violent or a threat to the public it only proves that someone in the privacy of his own home was understandably threatened by the presence of armed intruders the fact that police find weapons or marijuana at the scene of a raid then still doesn’t mean paramilitary tactics and forced entry were justified it’s possible—likely even—that millions of americans are both harmless recreational marijuana users and legal gun owners the presence of both doesn’t make them a threat to the community and the only legitimate use of paramilitary units like swat teams indeed the reason they were originally implemented is to deal with real immediate and obvious threats to the public safety perhaps the best example of how such violent tactics unleashed on nonviolent drug users invite tragedy is the case of clayton helriggle clayton helriggle helriggle 23 lived in a house with four roommates in west alexandria ohio in september 2002 a local swat team conducted a noknock raid on the house local police had only recently put the swat team together—the most experienced members of the team had less than four hours of tactical training others had never trained with the swat team before a postraid report would later find that “wrong dates were used in an affidavit and investigators questioned why so little time was provided for surveillance of the house and why there were no controlled narcotic purchases from the house”458according to the dayton daily news the search warrant was “largely based on overheard conversations a few hours of surveillance and the word of a convicted felon who had recently lied to a court to remain free on bond” informant kevin leitch insisted there were “pounds and pounds” of marijuana at the residence and specifically identified helriggle as a dealer leitch later told investigators he was mistaken helriggle’s family says he was a recreational marijuana smoker though not a dealer459 on september 27 2002 25–30 police officers emerged from nearby woods and swarmed the farmhouse swat officers detonated several flashbang grenades on the first floor then used a battering ram to force their way into the rented farmhouse as police in shields and body armor subdued three of the house’s occupants helriggle asleep in an upstairs bedroom was awakened by the commotion and descended the stairs police at the scene say he was carrying a handgun at the time helriggle’s roommates insist that while helriggle did own a licensed handgun he’d left it in the bedroom and was holding a blue cup of water whatever helriggle was holding his last words—“what’s going on”—indicate he wasn’t aware that the armed intruders in his home were police a swat team member interpreted the item in his hand to be a gun and put a single shotgun blast into helriggle’s chest he died at the scene in the arms of one of his roommates460 immediately after the raid police told local reporters that they’d found marijuana pills weapons drug paraphernalia and drug “packaging materials” at the home the pills proved to be a bottle of prescribed codeine the weapons were helriggle’s legal handgun an old shotgun and a 22caliber rifle not particularly unusual for an ohio farmhouse the “packaging materials” turned out to be a box of sandwich bags and police found less than an ounce of marijuana no charges were filed against any of the house’s occupants461 in addition to the tip from an unreliable informant police raided the farmhouse on the basis of evidence they say they collected while conducting surveillance as it turns out that evidence too was questionable officer george petitt who both conducted the surveillance and planned the raid told investigators he concluded the farmhouse was a “dope house just by the activity” of cars pulling in and out of the driveway but when pressed he conceded that he had no firsthand knowledge of a single marijuana deal that took place at the farmhouse462 the absurdity of using a highly armed poorly trained swat team to carry out a violent volatile raid on a house rented by recreational marijuana users was captured by ian albert a resident of the farmhouse who also happened to have just completed navy seal training it was albert who held helriggle in his arms as he bled to death according to the dayton daily news albert’s first thought at the time was “wow they took down a farm of unarmed hippies” “if they would have come to the door and said ‘give us your dope hippies’” he added “we’d have gotten about a 100 ticket”463 a grand jury and internal investigation later found no criminal wrongdoing on the part of police officers but did find the swat team “ill prepared” and “lacking experience in dangerous searches”464 the grand jury report also noted that the officers who conducted the raid had refused to cooperate with investigators465 in january 2004 greene county ohio prosecutor bill schenk suggested the possibility of reopening the helriggle case saying that he was concerned that helriggle had been publicly portrayed as a drug dealer “i think it’s fair to say that there was no drug dealing by mr helriggle” he told the dayton daily news 466 despite the fact that he was at the time awaiting sentencing for more than a dozen crimes including forgery theft burglary breaking and entering and safecracking informant kevin leitch was never charged for lying to police officers nor was he charged for lying under oath to the grand jury investigating the raid467 these kinds of cases are increasingly common it’s now routine for police to deploy swat teams to serve search warrants on nonviolent marijuana suspects for crimes that in many cases barely qualify as misdemeanors these unnecessarily violent and confrontational tactics are also increasingly bearing tragic results some examples
