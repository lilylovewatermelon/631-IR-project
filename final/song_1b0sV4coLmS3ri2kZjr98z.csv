maybe its been years since i genuinely smiled
and maybe its been years since i wanted to be a part of anything
but lately ive been good you know ive actually been great
man i even laughed a little today oh so strange so strange

chorus
tell me its okay to be happy now because im happy now
tell me its okay to be happy now because im happy now
tell me its okay tell me its okay
tell me its okay tell me its okay

verse 2
thought it was my right to be as sorry as i wanted to be
i wasted all my teenage years being a misery factory
but something had to give i had to finally see the light
i think at 23 its time to practice what i preach
and what i preach is

chorus
tell me its okay to be happy now because im happy now
tell me its okay to be happy now because im happy now
tell me its okay tell me its okay
tell me its okay tell me its okay

bridge
all my wasted hope
i let go when i shouldve held tighter
and now when the is sun out
i let it burn not afraid to feel it shine on me

chorus
