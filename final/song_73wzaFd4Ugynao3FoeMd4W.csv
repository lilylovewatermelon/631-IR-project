feel how the winter succumbs to the spring
over the palisade morning will break
rise up to meet it oh sleeper awake
gather the soldiers the heir to enfold
crown him and give him a scepter to hold
sound every horn as the columns extend
up to the hill where the king will ascend
look to the sky where the sign will be shown
heaven and earth and the king on his throne
look to the sky where the sign will be shown
