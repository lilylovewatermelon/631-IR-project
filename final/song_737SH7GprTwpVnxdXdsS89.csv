hey

i love you i love you iii love you

verse
ladies and gentlemen
you are now in tune to an unknown buffoon
with enough room in his tomb to blow your mind like “boom”
oh i like this one
then you assume that ive done something wrong in my life
uh huh you know it mayne
but at the same time i’m gonna try to describe the vibe of the world through my eyes cmon whoo
and maybe you won’t  despise me
or try to deprive me of the respect that i need

oh i see
you don’t know that a nigga motor just blow
and i’m walking by myself  talking to myself
up and down the streets when both my feets is in old shoes
and all these old dudes talking ‘bout  “oh it aint that bad i walked through the snow in school” hahaha
bitch we live in tallahassee a place were it never snows
but it rains on pain ‘cause faheem can’t take it wow
my head is a mail box and it’s full and i don’t want to check it wow
i wanna buy a whole damn car just to wreck it wow
‘cause this fuck nigga told my wife i got two other girls pregnant damn pain
see tpain liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likenow you think i’m gon’ change ‘cause my wife cries all night
and i’m not quite the husband type
you damn right okay
‘cause i’ve been living my whole damn life without my damn mic
and my damn light bill due and one day i
might see you and if i
fight with you i can take your
life in two ways oh shit
the hard way  and the bad way
‘cause if i have a bad day then you might not make it to the youngbloodz concert

ladies and gentlemen i’m sorry if i’m losing you
but i’m just sick and tired of trying to get mine go get it
so don’t come to me with your 23’s cmon
with that fake ass smile cmon
smoking on your blacknmile ‘cause all the while cmon
i know what you’re saying in your head
this nigga go stronger than me uh huh
longer than me uh huh
but he aint  gon’ ever be shit cause everything belonging to me damn
see i refuse to be abused and misused and accused of not paying my dues
i am not a crack addict but if you want everything i got
you gon’ get it
‘cause imma let your ass have it
