i used to pray when i was sixteen
if i didnt make it then id probably make my wrist bleed
not to mislead turn my nightmares into big dreams
whole squad mobbin even though we only six deep
i was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
walking in the snow before i ever made my wrist freeze
i was blowing smoke had me dizzy like gillespie
niggas had no homes we were living in the dead streets
you couldnt find me like im hoffa
cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
spending all my money on these niggas that i brought up
taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
and i had nothing to believe in
double cup leanin
couldnt even breathe and
for that money i was fiending
cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving

chorus
leaving leaving into the night
now a nigga leaving leaving
leaving into the night oh

verse 2
she like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
futuristic sex give her philip k dick
she never need a man she what a man need
so i keep on falling for her daily
we was at coachella going brazy
stack a couple ms like i was shady
now im in tribeca like im jayz
rockin sorayama like he pay me
i just signed a new deal with mercedes
got me movin dirty like im swayze
all my diamonds dancing like they swayze
all my diamonds hitting like they swae lee
jet so big got a business and a coach
always livin on the road rockin louis à la mode nigga
and for that money i been fiending
cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving

leaving leaving into the night
now a nigga leaving leaving
leaving into the night oh

bridge
twenty mill mansion never lived in it
zero edge pool never dipped in it
superstar neighbor in my business
paparazzi tryna catch me slippin and
going on tour is my vacation
every month another accusation
only thing im phobic of is failing
i was never blessed with any patience

chorus
so a nigga leaving leaving leaving into the night
now a nigga leaving leaving
leaving into the night oh82embed"
