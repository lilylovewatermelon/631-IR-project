youre growing tired of me
you love me so hard and i still cant sleep
youre growing tired of me
and all the things i dont talk about

refrain
sorry i dont want your touch
its not that i dont want you
sorry i cant take your touch

chorus
its just that i fell in love with a war
and nobody told me it ended
and it left a pearl in my head
and i roll it around
every night just to watch it glow
every night baby thats where i go

refrain
sorry i dont want your touch
its not that i dont want you
sorry i cant take your touch

but its just that  i fell in love with a war
and nobody told me it ended
and it left a pearl in my head
and i roll it around
every night just to watch it glow
