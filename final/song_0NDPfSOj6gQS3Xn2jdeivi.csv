hemingways whiskey
warm and smooth and mean
even when it burns
itll always finish clean
he didnt like it watered down
he took it straight up and neat
if it was bad enough for him
you know its bad enough for me
hemingways whiskey

verse 2
ah its tough out there
a good muse is hard to find
living one word to the next
one line at a time
theres more to life than whiskey
theres more to words than rhyme
sometimes nothing works
sometimes nothing shines
like hemingways whiskey

bridge
sail away sail away
three sheets to the wind
live hard die hard
