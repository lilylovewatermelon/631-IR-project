finally we have seen some things
some awfully nice some dreadfully bad
but we will sing wash the blood off our knees
cause our love breaks through rough seas our ship will sail
and i dont understand how this world would work
cause time will tell us nothing
ill take a chance on something

chorus
feeling old feelings this time take you
down river down river down river down
walk these stairs put the pieces back together
go dont stop go dont stop
go dont stop go dont stop now go

verse 2
finally we have seen some things
but bells in your hallways dont move you in the right place
so we will sing cast our hopes out to sea
though our hearts break through violent winds our ship will sail
and i dont understand how this world would work
cause time will tell us nothing
ill take a chance on something

chorus
feeling old feelings this time take you
down river down river down river down
walk these stairs put the pieces back together
go dont stop go dont stop
go dont stop go dont stop now go
go dont stop go dont stop
go dont stop go dont stop
go dont stop go dont stop
go dont stop go dont stop now go
