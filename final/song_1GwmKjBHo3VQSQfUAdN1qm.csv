never owned a brand new car
never worked in a white collar
never held a woman longer
than i held one single dollar
i never went out chasing rainbows
‘cause there can’t be that much to it
even if i found my pot of gold
i know i’d piss right through it

i can’t remember ever wanting
for one second of my life
even if i did it cost too much
to ever pay the price
i don’t dance out on the dark side
ain’t no secrets i have to tell
so you don’t have to say a prayer for me
i just said one for myself

chorus
i’m living my life
under my terms
i’m calling the shots
as far as i can see
i don’t owe nobody nothing
i don’t answer to a soul
might not work for you
but it works for me
you might also likeverse 2
i’ve been bent and bruised and broken
and flat busted once or twice
i brought most of it upon myself
but i never compromised
my pride’s too hard to swallow
so i’ve chewed a lot of it
mildmannered and softhearted
and hardheaded as you get
i live out on the back roads
where i walk my country mile
and if it’s so good in the city
why don’t anybody smile
the traffic’s always heavy
and the air ain’t fit to breathe
i ain’t saying that it’s wrong for you
it just don’t make sense to me

chorus
i’m living my life
under my terms
i’m calling the shots
as far as i can see
i don’t owe nobody nothing
i don’t answer to a soul
might not work for you
but it works for meembed"
