ive seen your eyes as they fix on me
what is he doin what on earths the plan has he got one
you better give me some pointers
since you are the big rocket launcher and im just the shotgun
i aint got no dollar signs in my eyes
that might be a surprise but its true said im not like you
and i dont want your advice or your praise
or to move in the ways you do and i never will

chorus
cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know youre certain well fail

verse 2
ive seen your eyes as they fix on me full of confusion
your snarl is just so condescending
trying to explain that were on to a win
if the fee we get in near recoups what were spendin
he said i cant believe that you drove all that way
well how much did they pay ya how much did they pay ya
youd have been better to stay round our way
thinkin bout things but not actually doing the things

cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know youre certain well fail
cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know youre certain well fail
