when you fall asleep with your head upon my shoulder
when youre in my arms but youve gone somewhere deeper

prechorus
are you going to age with grace
are you going to age without mistakes
are you going to age with grace
or only to wake and hide your face

chorus
when oblivion is calling out your name
you always take it further than i ever can

verse 2
when you play it hard and i try to follow you there
its not about control but i turn back when i see where you go

prechorus
are you going to age with grace
are you going to leave a path to trace

chorus
when oblivion is calling out your name
you always take it further than i ever can
when oblivion is calling out your name
you always take it further than i ever canyou might also like203embed"
