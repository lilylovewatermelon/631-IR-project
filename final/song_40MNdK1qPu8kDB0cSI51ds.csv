we were going way too fast
chasing down the hourglass
running from my past
headed out with no direction no direction
kerosene beauty queen
looking for her matchstick king to burn in to my heart
hand in to the flame
we could set the world ablaze cause

chorus
baby you’re all i need
come now set me free
like a wildfire like a wildfire
breathless i can’t resist
melt with your scarlet kiss
like a wildfire like a wildfire

verse 2
i look into your sunset eyes
waiting for the moon to rise
so i can feel your heat
this love is so completely crazy
you been fucking with my dreams
rip me like your torn up jeans
i don’t even care
you can take me there
you can set my world ablaze cause
you might also likechorus
baby you’re all i need
come now set me free
like a wildfire like a wildfire
breathless i can’t resist
melt with your scarlet kiss
like a wildfire like a wildfire

bridge
baby tell me where you wanna run run
cause i’ve been burning like the morning sun
take my hand
you can burn this city with me
play me like your first guitar
where every single notes too hard
i don’t even care
you can take me there
we can set the world on fire

chorus
baby you’re all i need
come now set me free
like a wildfire like a wildfire
breathless i can’t resist
meltin your scarlet kiss
like a wildfire like a wildfire4embed"
