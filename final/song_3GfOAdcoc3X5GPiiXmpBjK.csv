woohoo
woohoo

verse 1
i got my head checked
by a jumbo jet
it wasnt easy
but nothing is no

chorus
woohoo when i feel heavy metal
woohoo and im pins and im needles
woohoo well i lie and im easy
all of the time but im never sure why i need you
pleased to meet you
verse 2
i got my head done
when i was young
its not my problem
its not my problem

chorus
woohoo when i feel heavy metal
woohoo and im pins and im needles
woohoo well i lie and im easy
all of the time but im never sure why i need you
pleased to meet you
