well i barely know if ill be alive tomorrow
let alone if the people i trustll stay
so all ill need while im breathin is to be content this evenin
find hope in tomorrow either way
and i dont think those city girls are right for me
cause i dont fall for shallow pleasantries
and the conversations nice but all the talkin dont seem right
to a soul that prefers silence and the trees

chorus
cause i got hope in tomorrow and regret in yesterday
so if you could find a way to forgive me
then maybe i could find just a piece of peace of mind
and carry on tomorrow hopefully
and carry on tomorrow hopefully

verse 2
and this worlds expectin so much from the man
that gets so wrecked on saturdays that he can barely stand
and i swear to ride this bronco until the wheels and my heart dont go
its not youre fault if they dont understand

chorus
cause i got hope in tomorrow and regret in yesterday
so if you could find a way to forgive me
then maybe i could find just a little peace of mind
and carry on tomorrow hopefully
and carry on tomorrow hopefully

and i went and talked to deann at the bay
and she told me that everything just might be okay
i know youre jaded and youre faded and youre pissed off at the world
but you can only be the man you are today

chorus
cause i got hope in tomorrow and regret in yesterday
so if you could find a way to forgive me
then maybe i could find just a piece of peace of mind
and carry on tomorrow hopefully
and carry on tomorrow hopefullyembed"
