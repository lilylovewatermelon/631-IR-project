yah vizzy

verse 1
slick mcs like me are hard to find
i mastermind a faster rhyme to pass the time half the time
i’m fishing for attention i got half a mind to cast a line
girl so penny eat it up like it’s pasta time
penny like the scribbling don’t stop
penny for your thoughts if the penny ever drop
cause if a dudes a nuisance i’ll put my two cents
on his eyes if he tryna take shots woah
minotaur with the metaphor
better put your white flags up  semaphore
i just trap trap trap like a cellar door
restock 50 shades cause i’m selling more uh
burncity but i’m fucking with sydeney
say i’m not a goat ahhhh you must be kidding me
you keep it at 100 while i keep it at infinity
if pressure makes i diamond i should change my name to tiffany uh

chorus
stay northside always stay northside stay north

stay northside always stay northside stay north
with the gang gang we gon’ party all night all night
gonna hang hang till we see the sunlight

lotta people mad that your girl been killing shit
talking out your ass like a fucking ventriloquist
talk is cheap publicity is free
so say what you like just talk about me
i could sell shade to an umbrella
rap till i go blind call me helen keller
talkin about money i could be your bank teller
put it down put it down like old yeller uh
rhyme time on my irish wrist watch
everybody knows i’m a bit posh
t minus 10 to the liftoff boys get ya kits off
pop a bottle now get a bit sloshed
look vizzy on the ball courtside
rock a mic and a boat portside
third eye looking see it with my foresight
i stay repping my hood northside

chorus
stay northside always stay northside stay north
with the gang gang we gon’ party all night all night
gonna hang hang till we see the sunlight
kiss kiss bang bang yep yep we gon get it done right
stay northside always stay northside stay north
with the gang gang we gon’ party all night all night
gonna hang hang till we see the sunlight
kiss kiss bang bang yep yep we gon get it done right
verse 3
click click as i pose on the mattress
profile pic on catfish
sit back and let ‘em go batshit
just learning these lines like an actress
call me stephen schwartz cause the girl write wicked
got a stamp of approval y’all can lick it
not down with me tell you where you can stick it
if you’re sitting on the fence then i hope it’s a picket
you’re new to the game bro i can tell
just stop with the rude stuff i am twelve
it’s the viz honey i can spell
staying off the grid but i still excel
look vizzy came to kick it like kung fu
punchlines like a mic check 1 2
kill it every time bae what you gon do
just chilling northside you should come through

interlude rhiannon the voice tuffield
look at all these people riding their bicycles around
so many bicycles
hipsters with their 90s fashion and blunt fringes
oh my god
they look so cool

chorus
ayy yah yah yah northside
stay northside always stay northside stay north
with the gang gang we gon’ party all night all night
gonna hang hang till we see the sunlight
kiss kiss bang bang yep yep we gon get it done right
stay northside always stay northside stay north
with the gang gang we gon’ party all night all night
gonna hang hang till we see the sunlight
kiss kiss bang bang yep yep we gon get it done rightembed"
