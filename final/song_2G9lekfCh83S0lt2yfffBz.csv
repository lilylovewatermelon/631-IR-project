hear ye hear ye my name is samuel seabury
and i present “free thoughts on the
proceedings of the continental congress”
heed not the rabble who scream revolution
they have not your interests at heart

mulligan
oh my god tear this dude apart

seabury
chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
dont let them lead you astray
this congress does not speak for me

burr

seabury
theyre playing a dangerous game
i pray the king shows you his mercy
for shame for shame…

hamilton  seabury
yo
hed have you all unravel at the sound of screams
but the revolution is comin
the havenots are gonna win this
its hard to listen to you with a straight face
heed not the rabble who scream revolution
they have not your interests at heart
chaos and bloodshed already haunt us honestly you shouldnt even talk
and what about boston look at the cost
n all that weve lost n you talk about congress
chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
dont let them lead you astray
this congress does not speak for me
my dog speaks more eloquently than thee
theyre playing a dangerous game
but strangely your mange is the same
i pray the king shows you his mercy
is he in jersey
for shame
for the revolution
for shame
you might also likecompany
for the revolution
