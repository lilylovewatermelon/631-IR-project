i need love
you need love
give me love
and ill give you my love

verse 1 macklemore
they say thirtys the new twenty
and twentys the new thirty shit i guess
makes sense cause fifteenyearolds seem twenty
and twentyfiveyearolds seem ten
i used to drink away my paycheck
celebrate the mistakes i hadnt made yet
our generation isnt the best on safe sex
we forget the latex becoming planned parenthood patients
synthetic heroin is the new basehead
so much to escape fuck a straight edge
walk around looking through a fake lens
apps this good whos got time to make friends
i wish i didnt care
if cynical hipsters with long hair and cocaine problems like my music
its not my issue i cant solve it yeah

chorus evan roman
said my flight has finally landed down
and the ground has stopped moving all around
eyes open awake for the very first time
we both forfeit this game of crime
you might also likeverse 2 macklemore
they say its so refreshing to hear somebody on records
no guns no drugs no sex just truth
the guns thats america the drugs are what they gave to us
and sex sells itself dont judge til its you
uh im not more or less conscious
than rappers rapping bout strippers up on a pole poppin
these interviews are obnoxious
saying that its poetry youre so well spoken stop it
i grew up during reaganomics
when ice t was out there on his killing cops shit
or rodney king was getting beat on
and they let off every single officer
and los angeles went and lost it
now every month theres a new rodney on youtube
its just something our generation is used to
in neighbourhoods where you never see a news crew
unless theyre gentrifying white people dont even cruise through
and my subconscious telling me stop it
this is an issue that you shouldnt get involved in
dont even tweet rip trayvon martin
dont wanna be that white dude millionman marching
fighting for a freedom that my people stole
dont wanna make all my white fans uncomfortable
but you dont even have a fuckin song for radio
why you out here talking race trying to save the fucking globe
dont get involved if the cause isnt mine
white privilege white guilt at the same damn time
so we just party like its 1999
celebrate the ignorance while these kids keep dying
chorus evan roman
my flight has finally landed down
and the ground has stopped moving all around
eyes open awake for the very first time
we both forfeit this game of crime

outro evan roman
i need love
you need love
give me love
and ill give you my love23embed"
