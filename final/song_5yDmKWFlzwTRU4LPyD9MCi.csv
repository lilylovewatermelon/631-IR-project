way to go
it was time
to hit the road
hes just a boy
in working boots
it didnt work so you cut him loose

hey atta girl
you thought it through
and what you did
is hard to do
i bet youre thinking bout some things that you shouldnt
just remember now and then that youre looking

at a girl whos got a damn good heart
and some big dreams up ahead
and now you got you a brand new start and both sides of a queen bed
he mighta took your love mighta took your time
and the rug out from under your world
but he cant take all your happiness
go and get it now atta girl

hes at a bar
with his friends
thats where ya go
when it ends
they say atta boy
have another round
theres plenty girls
in this collegе town
then he meets one
thats hurting too
whilе hes kissing her
hes missing you
and now its sinking in deep that he missed that train
he can throw back a drink but he cant throw blame
