down in my chair when you dance over me
i cant help myself
ive got to see you again
late in the night when im all alone
and i look at the clock and i know youre not home
i cant help myself
ive got to see you again
i could almost go there
just to watch you be seen
i could almost go there
just to live in a dream

but no i wont go for any of those things
to not touch your skin is not why i sing
i cant help myself
ive got to see you again
i could almost go there
just to watch you be seen
i could almost go there
just to live in a dream

no i wont go to share you with them
but oh even though i know where youve been
i cant help myself
ive got to see you againsee norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeembed"
