injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere

verse 1
maybe i stare too much maybe not long enough
funny how i forget to blink
but when you let down your hair dancin like no ones there
i know im where im supposed to be

prechorus
say i love you under my breath
more times than you can digest
music every time i hear your name oh
your heads layin right on my chest
suns up and i still aint got no rest

chorus
dont wanna close my eyes im scared ill miss too much
dont wanna fall asleep id rather fall in love
when i cant feel you i feel out of touch
two seconds without yous like two months
dont wanna close my eyes im scared ill miss too much
dont wanna fall asleep id rather fall in love
cause eternity with you aint long enough
two seconds without yous like two months and thats too much

love the way you love your mom and take on all your friends problems
still somehow stop the world for us oh
i still relive that second i met my biggest blessin
prayed for you look what god has done

prechorus
say i love you under my breath
more times than you can digest
music every time i hear your name oh
your heads layin right on my chest
suns up and i still aint got no rest

chorus
dont wanna close my eyes im scared ill miss too much
dont wanna fall asleep id rather fall in love
when i cant feel you i feel out of touch
two seconds without yous like two months
dont wanna close my eyes im scared ill miss too much
dont wanna fall asleep id rather fall in love
cause eternity with you aint long enough
two seconds without yous like two months and thats too much12embed"
