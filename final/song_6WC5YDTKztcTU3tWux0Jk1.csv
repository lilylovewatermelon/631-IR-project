i know whats wrong i know whats right
i see the truth but i stay blind
i say im fine but i know theres no hope inside
cant even take my own advice
even though youve been showing signs
maybe you go your way and so will i

prechorus
now im sitting in a car that i wont start
maybe i got too much to say right now
like im paralyzed from the waist down
why is it so hard

chorus
cause every time i try to leave
something keep pulling me back
every time i try to leave
something keep pulling me back
i know i know better
but something just wont let up let up
every time i try to leave
something keep pulling me back
yeah

verse 2
was it a fight we never had
was there a good in all the bad
is it enough for me to never want to come back oh yeah
maybe im running from a truth
but baby i blame it all on you
its really me but all my pride would never say that
you might also likeso im sitting in a car that i wont start wont start
maybe i got nothing to say right now
like im paralyzed from the waist down
why is it so hard

chorus
cause every time i try to leave
something keep pulling me back
every time i try to leave
something keep pulling me back
i know i know better better
but something just wont let up let up
every time i try to leave
something keep pulling me back

outro
every time i try to leave
something keep pulling me back
telling me i need you in my life
mmm yeah
every time i try to leave
something keep pulling me back
telling me i need you in my life
need you in my life2embed"
