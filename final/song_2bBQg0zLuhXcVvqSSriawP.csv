ive been waiting many hours
by the silent moon
and in the wild the jungle flower
your toxic perfume
tell my friends im gone its true
ive passed on now
to the eyes of a dark lost blue

chorus
i dont believe you
im in a parachute
falling in deep
sleep
out of control
can you feel it
is this the end of the road
falling in deep
lost in a dreaeam
ooh
ooh
ooh

verse 2
and the rains begin to shower
cover me in bloom
in the wild the watchmans tower
your perfect monsoon
tell my friends im gone its true
tell my son ive gone away with you
you might also likechorus
i dont believe you
im in a parachute
falling in deep
sleep
out of control
can you feel it
is this the end of the road
trick up your sleeve
breathe
i dont believe
is this the end of the sea
staring at me
i could be freeee
in a dreaeam

outro
lay down by the firelight
for all i know its the last time
tell my son9embed"
