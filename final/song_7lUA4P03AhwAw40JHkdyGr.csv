ms third ward your first question
what is your aspiration in life
oh well my aspiration in life would be
to be happy

verse 1
mama said youre a pretty girl
whats in your head it doesnt matter
brush your hair fix your teeth
what you wear is all that matters
prechorus
just another stage
pageant the pain away
this time im gonna take the crown
without fallin down down down

chorus
pretty hurts
we shine the light on whatevers worst
perfection is a disease of a nation pretty hurts pretty hurts
pretty hurts
we shine the light on whatevers worst
we try to fix something
but you cant fix what you cant see
its the soul that needs a surgery

bridge
aint got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
the pains inside and nobody frees you from your body
its the soul its my soul that needs surgery
its my soul that needs surgery
plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
youre left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past
chorus
pretty hurts
we shine the light on whatevers worst pretty hurts
perfection is a disease of a nation pretty hurts
pretty hurts pretty hurts
we shine the light on whatevers worst
tryna fix something pretty hurts
but you cant fix what you cant see
its the soul that needs a surgery

outro
when youre alone all by yourself pretty hurts pretty hurts
and youre lyin in your bed pretty hurts pretty hurts
reflection stares right into you pretty hurts pretty hurts
are you happy with yourself pretty hurts pretty hurts
you stripped away the masquerade pretty hurts pretty hurts
the illusion has been shed pretty hurts pretty hurts
are you happy with yourself pretty hurts pretty hurts
are you happy with yourself pretty hurts pretty hurts
yeah yes ah ah ah196embed"
