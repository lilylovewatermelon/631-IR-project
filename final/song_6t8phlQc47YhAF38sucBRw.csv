mad in a way but i dont say
its what youre used to got the words but cant convey
i know youll turn it all around
its the rhythm that youre goin through
get it back and youre not obliged to say
not intact but youre better off anyway
somehow its never up to me

prechorus 1
what if i would say simple words i cant relate
i dont place upon your view
its the rhythm that youre goin through

chorus
i know what i want
you just take me through the motions
i know what i want
and thats more than you can say

postchorus
since you found me out
since you found me out
since you found me out
since you found me out

your story still remains
its so unlike you still you stay the same
but all the while youre counting on your day to come
but nothin ever told you
you would say that its only for a day
yesterdays last week tomorrows on its way
im falling faster all the time

prechorus 2
what if i would say
simple words i cant relate
what came easys now too late
and it was always standing right in front of me

chorus
cause i know what i want
you just take me through the motions
i know what i want
and thats more than you can say

bridge
all the time you thought worth saving
still ends up with memories fading
after all that you wouldnt do
it makes no sense its the rhythm that youre goin through
chorus
i know what i want
you just take me through the motions
i know what i want
and thats more than you can say
i know what i want
you just take me through the motions
i know what i want
and thats more than you can say

postchorus
since you found me out
since you found me out
since you found me out
since you found me out1embed"
