how do i deal with rejection
im dealing with a lot of rejection right now
it makes me feel very small
oh thats great
if nobody wants you youre free

verse 1
tried to wash all of my shit away
tried to wash all my emotions
need a few brews need a palm tree
i be drinkin in private dont call me to party though
fuck on your nigga for cardio
too good he really fell in love right away
i put my feelings on layaway im

prechorus
done being used done playing stupid
done faking cool
i dont want none of that shit i dont want it
done being screwed done feeling clueless
thats how you do
i dont want none of that shit got me runnin so

chorus

lately i feel less cool as before
nobody under my garter belt
nobody out here to tell me im special
made you check your bullshit at the door
got an appetite hungry to feed my ego
nobody round me to be my hero
always on my mind trust is hard to find
everything reminds me of us
i just want my sanity back
better than being your enemy
better than letting go scared of that oh

prechorus
done being used done playing stupid
done being cool
i dont want none of that shit i aint goin
done getting screwed done playing clueless
thats how you do
i dont want none of that shit got me runnin so

chorus
far far like i dont recognize me
far far cause i let you define me
im far far cause i cant trust nobody
far stay far so far
bridge
i remember when you had me upsidedown
stress me out and turn me out its all bad now
i remember when i wasnt so burnt out
id rather that than be your enemy ready to let it go

chorus

far far cause i let you define me
im far far cause i cant trust nobody
