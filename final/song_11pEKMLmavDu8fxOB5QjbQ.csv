im working on dying
said you belong to the streets but the streets belong to me
its like home to me she belongs to the streets
its like home to me
i tatted your passport up
now its lookin like a arm sleeve
just know that was all me

verse 1
and when you see chanel i wish thats how you saw me
that shit you tell chanel i wish thats how you called me
that raw shit that honesty yeah
you know i love you more than all them niggas put together
and its a lot of niggas trust i put the list together
and its a lot just to assume were meant to be together
you gotta live that shit for real you cant just say whatever
you could never tell nobody that you held me down
if it was ride or die then you shouldve been dead right now

chorus
so i dont get how youre yelling at me
how much i gotta spend for you to pipe down pipe down
how deep i gotta dig for you to pipe down pipe down
all the things ive done up until right now right now
i need a thousand pages just to write it down write it down
writing down these feelings its been overdue overdue
dont know how many pens its gonna take to get over you
how much i gotta pen for you to pipe down pipe down
how deep i gotta dig for you to pipe down

tried to run it back a hundred times
the world is yours but the citys mine
i cant believe you put it on your mothers life
i cant believe you told me it was ride or die
cause youre not here somehow youre still alive
true enough i know you from the other side
i set my expectations way too high
yeah and i would listen to the lies that you would tell all night
angel eyes but youve been giving me hell all night
i know the book that you would write is a tellsome not a tellall
just to make sure you well off you would sell all rights
why does your ex think we beefin is that man alright
that nigga cant even look at me he fell off twice
and im back poppin i still remember the day i saw you
i was on your ass like back pockets
niggas love to hate but what is that stopping
so much shit i wanted to say straight to your face
cause youre so twofaced that i dont know which face
youre the reason well be going separate ways
youre the reason we cannot communicate
its not the things you say its what you dont say
im not in your way youre in your own way

chorus
so i dont get how youre yelling at me
how much i gotta spend for you to pipe down pipe down
how deep i gotta dig for you to pipe down pipe down
all the things ive done up until right now right now
i need a thousand pages just to write it down write it down
writing down these feelings its been overdue overdue
dont know how many pens its gonna take to get over you
how much i gotta pen for you to pipe down pipe down
how deep i gotta dig for you to pipe down
outro
