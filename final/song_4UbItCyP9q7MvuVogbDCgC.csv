there was a girl with the toughest of skin
she made sure that everyone around knew that she wasnt sensitive
she walked around ah ah
let nobody in ah ah
thought if shed never gave her heart away itd never end up broken

prechorus 1
but boy x across the street oh he was one of a kind
made her fall in love with only just a look in her eyes
when they wandered off to someone elses for the first time
she cried and cried and cried

chorus
next time you move on
like i know youll do
tell me you wont treat her like you did with me and you
when she falls hard
and a little too soon
promise you wont promise things you know just wont come true
and dont you dare make her feel like shes the only thing youre seeing no
dont do that stupid thing with your eyes unless you mean it
when you get bored like you always do
tell me that youll let her go before you look for someone new

verse 2
yeah this very girl
brown eyes and blonde ends
no she never wasted time but time with him just felt so different
she wrote him songs
just to watch him listening
a hundred songs a couple months in
no she never saw it comin

the next time boy x he crossed the street shed never see him again
she really thought he was forever then forever was dead
left her holdin up the pieces of her heart by a thread
he left her there to die

chorus
next time you move on move on
like i know youll do know youll do
tell me you wont treat her like you did with me and you
when she falls hard falls hard
and a little too soon little too soon
promise you wont promise things you know just wont come true
and dont you dare make her feel like shes the only thing youre seeing no
dont do that stupid thing with your eyes unless you mean it
when you get bored like you always do
tell me that youll let her go before you look for someone new

outro
there was a girl
not too different from me
she thought she found the world
but then the world found out shes weak
i guess thats okay
no i just couldnt see
that there was a billion of boy x but babe theres only one of me6embed"
