blue slide park
its blue slide park man
uh its fuckin blue slide park

verse 1
hey i got these rayban shades
kinda look like somethin lennon would rock
it seems like now i got a couple bags whenever i shop
louis shoes polo socks some name brand dumb shit
logo never make a man but im still blowin thousands on it
no clue what im callin my album
fans be at my van screamin callin me malcolm
never knew the outcome be this much cash now
bank account lookin like a george jung stash house
young and actin out the topics that i rap about
be varyin from politics to bitches pullin asses out
thats exactly how i do this as a rapper
im nuttin in her mouth you tongue kissin her after
daughters moms kinda want me neutered
but they also want the kid to cum right on they cooter
have the music soundin better than guitar tuners
plus im doin shows daily call me jon stewart
so who you know thats iller than mac miller and company
its like i planted money seeds right underneath the fuckin tree
now i got a hundred gs so none of yall can fuck with me
yeah i said it publicly so run and tell your mother motherfucker
i said run and tell your mother motherfucker
you might also likeinterlude
hold up jerm let me spit the second

verse 2
ayo i breeze past haters in the eclass quickly
in deep did a hundred songs and thatâ€™s this week
shit keeps goin on and on
we just tryna go bananas like its donkey kong
yeah on my grind always need to work
so i be eatin good you be eatin dirt
if you talkin shit you gon see me smirk
while the dj be scratchin til the needles burst
a couple screws probably loose in my head
holler at my girl tell her bring that doobie to bed
im a regular guy with an irregular life
except im a lamborghini if its racin a bike
who knew that i can turnturn sound into somethin so cool
fresh kids see me im bustin the moves
comin in soon to a theater near you
creep in your kitchen start eating your food
girls tryna fuck i dont be in the mood
no time for pussy when money in the room
ooh i switch flows switch rhythm
sick spittin unlimited ammunition hey
