i can still smell the fire
though i know its long died out
the smoke still hangs in my hair
and on some quiet evenings it burns my eyes

chorus
so darling play your violin
i know its what you live for
darling play your violin
we will manage somehow

verse 2
i once lived in the sea
bring me to your ear you can hear
the tide where i used to be
though now im but a shell

prechorus
oh baby dont say sorry

chorus
darling play your violin
i know its what you live for
darling play your violin
we will manage somehow

we will manage somehow
