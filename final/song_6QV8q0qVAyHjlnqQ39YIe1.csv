nobodys looking at us i feel delirious
cause the beat penetrates my body
shaking inside my bones
and youre pushing all my buttons
taking me out of my zone yeah

the way that you stare starts the fire in me
come up to my room you sexy little thing
and lets play a game i wont be a tease
ill show you the boom my sexy little thing

chorus
i wish you would push up on me
i wish you would push up on me
i wish you would light me up and say you want me
push up on me
i wish you would push up on me
