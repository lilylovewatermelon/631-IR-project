say i gotta get up out these streets asap before its too late

verse
i done been around murderers and burglars and all that shit
but they aint rich as this
and all the killers and drug dealers i know been tryna beat the streets forever
but they aint did it yet
cause aint nobody defeat the street life
tryna run the streets and get away with it
you and your dawg on the block so strong for so long
you get locked and he dont pay a visit
he got sentenced came home did a bid came home
then went again cause he dont get it yet
and the judge gave midget a hundred years
he wanna come home but he aint finished yet
doin the wrong things with my power that god gave me
god gave me power i used it for satan
instead of spreadin love i be growin evil
instead of liftin my niggas i tell em kill people
he gon lie with his heat he dont need the keys
hell be fine in these streets you can let him be
he gon die in these streets it aint no inbetween
he gon die in these streets cause he dont wanna leave
gotta get up out these streets they say that karma real
gotta get up out these streets before they kill bill
he feel like if he ran these streets then he could run the world
he losin feelings for his children and his old girl
losin feelings for his mama nem cause he love the streets
he losin feelings for his family nem his mammy nem cause he love to beef
aint nobody beat the street life and i already got my street stripes
so ima get up out this darkness before my past haunt me
im twentyone i been here before like a thousand times
ima make this song cry i wrote about a thousand rhymes
pain they take me in vain they entertained by it
niggas talkin bout my homie and im slangin ks bout it
im so quick to make this 9 stretch im on that gang violence
tryna get up out this mindset its like im chained by it
gotta switch up all this shit before they get me
and catch me down bad like they did biggie
they know im thuggin to the tee like my name grizzley
im on the ugly when im free im in them same trenches
when i aint busy im in these streets im in them same trenches
hangin with losers i make em forget that they aint winnin
my house bigger than his mama crib but i be still in it
my nigga been gone for five years but i be still visitin
im sippin lean and poppin pills you think i got the remedy
at least if i got killed in the field it wouldnt be for anything
cause thats where all my lyrics came
so thats where all these millions came
life gave me lemons but i aint know how to make no lemonade
i made grenadine run around on heavy beans
im tryna be a better me but niggas they wanna intervene
i took my mama through a bunch my baby still strong
i heard the good die young so i gotta live longyou might also likeembed"
