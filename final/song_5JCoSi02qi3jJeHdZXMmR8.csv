know that i loved you so bad
i let you treat me like that
i was your willing accomplice honey
and i watched as you fled the scene
doeeyed as you buried me
one heart broke four hands bloody

chorus
the things i did
just so i could call you mine
the things you did
well i hope i was your favorite crime

verse 2
you used me as an alibi
i crossed my heart as you crossed the line
and i defended you to all my friends
and now every time a siren sounds
i wondеr if youre around
cause you know that id do it all again

chorus
all the things i did
just so i could call you minе
the things you did
well i hope i was your favorite crime

its bittersweet to think about the damage that wed do
cause i was goin down but i was doin it with you
yeah everything we broke and all the trouble that we made
but i say that i hate you with a smile on my face
oh look what we became

chorus
all the things i did
just so i could call you mine
all the things you did
well i hope i was your favorite crime

outro
your favorite crime
your favorite crime
cause baby you were mine75embed"
