do you remember when we first met i sure do
it was sometime in early september
though you were lazy about it you made me wait around
i was so crazy about you i didnt mind

verse 2
so i was late for class i locked my bike to yours
it wasnt hard to find you painted flowers on it
i guess that i was afraid that if you rolled away
you might not roll back my direction real soon

chorus 1
well i was crazy about you then and now the craziest thing of all
is over ten years have gone by
and youre still mine were locked in time
lets rewind

verse 3
do you remember when we first moved in together
the piano took up the living room
you played me boogiewoogie i played you love songs
youd say were playing house now you still say we are

verse 4
we built our getaway up in a tree we found
we felt so far away but we were still in town
now i remember watching that old tree burn down
i took a picture that i dont like to look at

well all these times they come and go and alone dont seem so long
over ten years have gone by
we cant rewind were locked in time
but youre still mine
