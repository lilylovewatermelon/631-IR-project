oh rainy day woman
ive never seem to see you for the good times or the sunshine
you have been a friend of minerainy day woman

verse 1
that woman of mine she aint happy
unless she finds something wrong and has someone to blame
if it aint one thing its another one on the way

i woke up this morning to the sunshine
it sure as hell looks just like rain
i know where to go on a cloudy day
