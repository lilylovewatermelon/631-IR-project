im finding my way back to sanity again
though i dont really know what im gonna do when i get there
take a breath and hold on tight
spin around one more time
and gracefully fall back to the arms of grace

chorus
cause i am hanging on every word you say
and even if you dont want to speak tonight
thats alright alright with me
because i want nothing more
than to sit outside heavens door
and listen to you breathing
is where i want to be yeah
where i want to be

verse 2
im looking past the shadows of my mind into the truth
and im trying to identify the voices in my head
god which ones you
let me feel one more time what it feels like to feel
and break these calluses off of me one more time

chorus
cause i am hanging on every word you say
and even if you dont want to speak tonight
thats alright alright with me
cause i want nothing more
than to sit outside your door
and listen to you breathing
is where i want to be yeah

i dont want a thing from you
bet youre tired of me waiting
for the straps to fall off of your table to the ground
i just want to be here now

chorus
cause i am hanging on every word you say
and even if you dont want to speak tonight
thats alright alright with me
cause i want nothing more
than to sit outside heavens door
and listen to you breathing
is where i want to be yeah
cause i am hanging on every word you say
and even if you dont want to speak tonight
thats alright alright with me
cause i want nothing more
than to sit outside heavens door
and listen to you breathing
is where i want to be yeahembed"
