wanna fuck the world i’m a walkin erection
spend without a thought we do it reckless
your nigga caught us texting
you said “baby don’t be mad you know how brent is”

verse 1
don’t open your mouth if you ain’t speaking good to me
i ain’t built like him
you fuckin with a g
just cause i fuck you that don’t mean i trust you i don’t
you got some high hopes
high hopes baby
fuck me crazy and i’ll tell you bout me
i was nothin at all
took a trip to london just to hear how they talk
back to 410
you should hear how they talk
he might be mr track and field but i done ran through em all
yeah that nigga play d1 but you still watch how we ball
i ain’t never home for long but you pull up when i call
all the hood niggas respect me
strippers wanna sex me
you bluffed on him
now he mad because you let me
if it ain’t fucked up don’t change it
i’d prolly be dead if i was basic
would you still give me head if i had day shifts
i work when i want
i do what i want
she get what she want
i call her my wishing wand
wash it off when you top me off you know i be slumped

your nigga caught us texting
you said “baby don’t be mad you know how brent is”

verse 2
don’t come around if you ain’t close to me
i ain’t built like them you gotta work for me
just cause i haunt you it don’t mean i want you i don’t
you got some high hopes
high hopes

chorus
wanna fuck the world i’m a walkin erection
