im pushing through just to make you melt away
are you all alone is someone home
is there nothing left for us to take
cause if you believe we can surely find a way
what more can i say

does it radiate
does it break your heart in two
does it take you down when you dont know where youre running to
does it save your faith
does it ever go that far
what else is it for

we can run away leave the world behind
the human race and this imaginary grace i can see us breaking
is there something more
we wont know till we try
the futures open wide

does it radiate
does it break your heart in two
does it take you down when you dont know where youre running to
does it save your faith
does it ever go that far
what else is it for
you might also liketwisted bent turned around
just about lost inside your maze
we can let it go and take a chance today
are we better off on our own
nobody to tell us what weve got and what we dont

does it radiate
yeah it does for me
i can take you down
it will knock you over to your knees
let it save your faith
we can let it go that far what else is it for

twisted bent turned around
just about lost inside your mazeembed"
