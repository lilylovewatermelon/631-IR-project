weep not for roads untraveled
weep not for paths left alone
cause beyond every bend is a long blinding end
its the worst kind of pain ive known

verse 2 mike shinoda  chester bennington
give up your heart left broken
and let that mistake pass on
cause the love that you lost wasnt worth what it cost
and in time youll be glad its gone

verse 3 chester bennington
weep not for roads untraveled
weep not for sights unseen
may your love never end and if you need a friend
theres a seat here alongside me
