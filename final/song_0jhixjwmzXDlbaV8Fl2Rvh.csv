oh my god its you
i never thought id see you here
looks like all is well
like youre having a hell of a good time
me im not gonna lie

chorus
got the sunshine on my shoulders
got a fistful of fourleaf clovers
yeah my cup runneth over
my sky is blue
been kissed by lady luck
the stars are all lined up
every arrow that i aim is true
but i miss you

verse 2
you cant have your cake and eat it too
i should have known
cause what good is good anyway
and havin it all is just a state of mind
and i i got no reason to cry

chorus
got the sunshine on my shoulders
got a fistful of fourleaf clovers
yeah my cup runneth over
my sky is blue
been kissed by lady luck
the stars are all lined up
every arrow that i aim is true
but i miss you
you might also likeoutro
been kissed by lady luck
the stars are all lined up
every arrow that i aim is true
i got a big smile on my face
its the best one i can fake
im as happy as half a heart can do
but i miss you5embed"
