all my lonesome
i have been waiting for
a girl like you so wholesome
someone i cant ignore

and oh did you mean it
when you told me i was more than family
cause i surely believe it
i keep those words all so close to me ohoh ohoh

chorus
ill find you over again
ill find you over again

verse 2
all my lonesome
i have been waiting for
a girl like you to look up to
someone i could adore

prechorus 2
and oh did you mean it
when you told me i was someone to believe
cause i sure did beat it
i keep those words all so closе to me ohoh ohoh

and tеll those old folks on the sidelines
that this is not their love
and all your shit friends setting landmines
oh this is not their love
if youre just here for a good time
then this is not your love

ill find you over againembed"
