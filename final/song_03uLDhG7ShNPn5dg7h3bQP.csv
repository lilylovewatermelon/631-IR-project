verse 1 oddy nuff da now leopard
uhh uhh
its the grey player im a dame slayer
playin games hos peelin off my layers
fuck a hater ima blame it on the navigator
never gettin paper but i got a pair of boots that was made from alligator uh
fuckboy see you later keep your mouth shut i dont fuck with traitors
gotta make a dent in this world gotta find a flavor
cherry marmalade bitch i spread it on my bread like a baker
bitch im fuckin sunk like an anchor
let me sink down i dont need a lifesaver bitch
i made a fuckin promise to the devil that id trade my fuckin soul
so i settle with the motherfucking razor uh

walk into the mind of a uicide god
chalk drawn lines with a body inside
ride with the blade or the mac or the gauge
lil gauge in the back make the blunt rotate
no fuckin role model ill die before forty
got xans on me now ill pop more in the mornin
bitches be snappin they tits but its borin
rather that hydrocodeine when im pourin
that codeine too weak for a fiend with a tolerance
strip her down fuck her once then i go rob the bitch
grey in my eyes and my heart dont feel nothin
my fuckin drug use never up for discussion
foreverever pour the yella yella
tombstone header readin triple six and thats foreverever13embed"
