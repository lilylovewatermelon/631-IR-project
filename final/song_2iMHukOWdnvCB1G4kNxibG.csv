i can feel the color running
as its fading from my face
try to speak but nothings coming
nothing i could say to make you stay

verse 1
grabbed your suitcase called a taxi
its 3 am now where you gonna go
gonna stay with friends in london
and thats all i get to know

prechorus
just a cigarette gone
no you couldnt be that far
im driving my car to where i hope you are
maybe i can talk you down
maybe i can talk you down

chorus
oh were standing on a tiny ledge
before this goes over the edge
gonna use my heart and not my head
and try to open up your eyes
this is relationship suicide
see the script liveget tickets as low as 119you might also likecause if you go i go
cause if you go i go

verse 2
taking shortcuts through the alleys
while youre racing through my mind
cops can chase but they wont catch me
not before i get to speak my mind
if theres still time

prechorus
just a cigarette gone
no you couldnt be that far
im driving my car to where i hope you are
maybe i can talk you down
maybe i can talk you down

chorus
oh were standing on a tiny ledge
before this goes over the edge
gonna use my heart and not my head
and try to open up your eyes
this is relationship suicide

cause if you go i go
cause if you go i go
cause if you go i go
cause if you go i go
