bite my tongue bide my time
wearing a warning sign
wait til the world is mine
visions i vandalize
cold in my kingdom size
fell for these ocean eyes

chorus
you should see me in a crown
im gonna run this nothing town
watch me make em bow
one by one by one
one by one by
you should see me in a crown
your silence is my favorite sound
watch me make em bow
one by one by one
one by one by one

verse 2
count my cards watch them fall
blood on a marble wall
i like the way they all scream
tell me which one is worse
living or dying first
sleeping inside a hearse i dont dream
you might also likebridge
you say come over baby
i think youre pretty
im okay im not your baby
if you think im pretty

chorus
you should see me in a crown
im gonna run this nothing town
watch me make em bow
one by one by one
one by one by
you should see me in a crown
your silence is my favorite sound
watch me make em bow
one by one by one
one by one by one
