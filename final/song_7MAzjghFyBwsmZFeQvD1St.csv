drum dummie
uh

verse
picture me rolling in my 500 benz
i got no love for these niggas aint no need to be friends
i don’t fuck with these niggas aint no need to pretend
aint no trust in a nigga after this
you said you love me but you’re leaving me
i guess nothings what it seem to be
i need some happiness again this life done beat on me
i caught a flight to ease the pain i switched the scenery drum dummie
through the pain know i gotta stay focused
cause since a kid this all i wanted
i heard he feed his problem to the vultures
he couldnt take no more so he exploded
read the book on murder when she wrote it
we hit the street with heat and we unload it
atr for life i run with soldiers
heard he drive his coupe like he stole it
pray to god that i can see the morning
i pray to god that i can see the morning uh
and now i lay me down to sleep
pray the lord my soul to keep
if i should die before i wake i
i pray the lord my soul to take

can you hear me mama i need you now answer your phone
its been too much shit going on uh
these demons want my soul
life too short to be living in a lie
its too much pain to be living just to die
cant feel my pain cause i hid it deep inside
i keep my head to the ribbon in the sky okay drum dummie

chorus
ribbon in the sky
life too short to be living in a lie
it’s too much pain to be living just to die
i keep my head to the ribbon in the sky
ribbon in the sky
ribbon in the sky
life too short to be living in a lie
it’s too much pain to be living just to die drum dummie

outro
uh ribbon in the sky okay
ribbon in the sky
i keep my head to the ribbon in the sky
ribbon in the sky
ribbon in the sky woah woah woah woah2embed"
