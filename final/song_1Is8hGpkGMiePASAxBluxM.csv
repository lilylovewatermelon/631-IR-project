born into status tell nobody that you never had it
dont tell nobody that you was abandoned
im the only one that know about your tragedy
i cant feel sorry when you lost random
i cant feel sorry youre a lost ransom
drown yourself in expensive fabrics
i think you picked up a lot of bad habits
just appreciate yourself

chorus
wont you think about you and i
just grab my hand and look me in the eye
but this aint something you should decide
this aint something that you should decide
wont you think about you and i
just grab my hand and look me in the eye
but this aint something you should decide
this aint something that you should decide

my mama mad at me i know i fucked up big
my girl mad at me i know i fucked up big
whats love i guess ill never understand

im sorry for the things i said i will be honest
