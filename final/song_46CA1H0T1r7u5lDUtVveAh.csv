intro tyler the creator
day that i met you girl
i knew that it was something special
but i couldnt put my finger on it fuck i cant sing whatever look
we met through mutual friends mutual friends
and this is where the story and confusion began
cause i was at nirvana but i had to pretend that i wasnt
prechorus tyler the creator
there go the policeman knocking at my door
do i leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat
or do i answer real confused like i dont know i dont know
now me and she held hands and we danced nothing more
she kissed my hand a couple times facetime when were bored
theres nobody at the door man im so paranoid
fuck because

chorus charlie wilson  tyler the creator
cause girl youre perfect but youre too fucking young for me uh
and when temptation calls my phone i never pick up no
and girl you stole my heart but youre too fucking young
and this is more than a crush i just might be in love oh my god

verse 1 tyler the creator
a sixyear difference uh
is a ten year sentence
and with the pigment on my skin
i dont want to be another statistic
you bring me joy joy joy joy
and you fill a void that was once missing
and i can say im in love

verse 2 tyler the creator
when youre thirtyfive ill be fortyone
and when im twentyseven youll be twentyone yo this is dumb
and when that time comes for that 18 ill probably run
cause im fucking terrified yo this is dumb you should find someone else
im not the one for you shit im still growing up by myself
and mentally youre older than me and that shit doesnt help
cause if they see you with t theyll think t needs some help
so when you mention hang im thinking bout a tree and a belt
and i dont want no relation shit no relation
ship when my dick is longer than my attention
span its gonna suck if shit hits that kitchen fan
and splatter on me like my dick in my hand
what im still fucking off not good at ducking off
because i found a goose that i like but im still running off
she gon want a nest thats why i cannot get fucking caught
thats a scary word you could save that shit for the birds um
but i found my wings fuck
outro tyler the creator  charlie wilson
but youre too fucking young
i really like you
and when temptation calls my phone i never pick up
i dont know what to do
and girl you stole my heart but youre too fucking young
