i wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
if i can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
theyll probably think im a terrorist eat my asparagus
then im asking her thoughts of a young nigga
fast money and freedom a crash dummy for dollars
i know you dying to meet him ill probably die in a minute
just bury me with twenty bitches twenty million and a comptown fitted

chorus

verse 2
back in this bitch in the back of that bitch
with my back against the wall and your bitch on the edge of my dick jump off
i call a bitch a bitch a ho a ho a woman a woman
i never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
tire mark gave you evidence that im easily peddlin
with the speed of a lightning bolt
as a kid i killed two adults im too advanced
i lived my twenties at two years old the wiser man
truth be told im like eightyseven
wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
from a distance dont know which one is a christian damn
who can i trust in 2012 theres no one not even myself
a gemini screaming for help somebody
