verse 3 sean paul
yow yow
inseparable at the beginning when we started
good chemistry between me and you girl we got it
i spit you game and just to tame you was my target
that was my aim just to be playing with your body
thought that forever we could continue this party
and now youre telling me that your love is departed
right im just saying you gon miss your sugardaddy
how you gon get me out ya hair girl when i bought it
bridge jade  all
girlfriend you need to catch up on him erase that number
don’t call him back cause he don’t deserve it
and when you see him in the club just flick your hair
dont show him any love cause youve had enough woah oh

outro

got me goin mad sittin in this chair
like i dont care
gotta get him out my hair
i tried everything but its useless
he pushed me so far now im on the edge
make him disappear
go get him out my hair1embed"
