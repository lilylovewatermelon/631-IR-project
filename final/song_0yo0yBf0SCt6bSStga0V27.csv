theres clothes all over the floor
i dont remember them being here before
smell of perfume isnt here
whys lipstick on the mirror
and still i dont understand

verse 1
no pictures left in the hall
theres three new holes in my wall
where the hells my credit cards whys my wallet in the yard
and still i dont understand

chorus
well now i guess i shouldve listened
when you said youd had enough
a little trick i picked up from my father
in one ear and out the other whys love gotta be so tough

verse 2
should see the look on my face
my shits all over the place
whys this happening to me whyd you take both sets of keys
and still i dont understand

chorus
well now i guess i shouldve listened
when you said youd had enough
a little trick i picked up from my father
in one ear and out the other whys love gotta be so tough
oh now i guess i shouldve listened

i dont remember them being here before
there are no candles in here lipstick on my mirror
and still i dont understand

chorus
oh now i guess i shouldve listened
when you said youd had enough
a little trick i picked up from my father
in one ear and out the other why must life be so tough

chorus
oh well now i guess i shouldve listened

a little trick i picked up from my father
in one ear and out the other whys love gotta be so tough1embed"
