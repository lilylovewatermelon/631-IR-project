in the heat of the fight i walked away
ignorin words that you were sayin tryna make me stay
i said this time ive had enough
and youve called a hundred times
but im not pickin up

prechorus
cause im so mad i might tell you that its over
but if you look a little closer

chorus
i said leave but all i really want is you
to stand outside my window throwin pebbles
screamin im in love with you
wait there in the pourin rain comin back for more
and dont you leave cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door

verse 2
well me and my stupid pride are sittin here alone
goin through the photographs starin at the phone
i keep goin back over things we both said
and i remember the slammin door
and all the things that i misread

oh babe if you know everything
tell me why you couldnt see
when i left i wanted you to chase after me yeah

chorus
i said leave but all i really want is you
to stand outside my window throwin pebbles
screamin im in love with you
wait there in the pourin rain comin back for more
and dont you leave cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door

bridge
and ill scream out the window
i cant even look at you
i dont need you but i do i do i do
i say theres nothin you can say
to make this right again i mean it i mean it
but what i mean is

chorus
i said leave but baby all i want is you
to stand outside my window throwin pebbles
screamin im in love with you
wait there in the pourin rain comin back for more
and dont you leave cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door
outro
with your face and the beautiful eyes
and the conversation with the little white lies
and the faded picture of a beautiful night
you carried me from your car up the stairs
and i broke down cryin was she worth this mess
after everything and that little black dress
after everything i must confess
i need you18embed"
