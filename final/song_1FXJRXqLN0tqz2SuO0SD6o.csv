withered flowers forget
what they wept for day after dayayayay
withered flowers must blossom
in the stream of tears
they still think of the cause

turning misery into meaningfulness
changing day after dayayayay
turning misery into meaningfulness
changing day after day

verse 2
highly spirited with pride
saving those left under the forgotten houses
highly spirited with courage
taking all the blame
seems losing the game

flowers blossom when you believe
days go by without sunny days
flowers blossom when you believe
