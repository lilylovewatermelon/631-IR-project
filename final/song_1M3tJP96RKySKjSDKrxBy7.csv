eight
bout the wait
bein in the hood with no escape
learned from my mistakes
sentence on cases

verse 1
back when i was five years old i knew that i was gon be great
i found my gift for music back around the age of eight
i knew id be successful it was more about the wait
so unacceptable as being in the hood with no escape
my mama taught me right but i just learned from my mistakes
started washing up the day i caught a sentence on the case
hunger pains shaped me to the way i am today
i gotta live with it feelings that wont ever go away
not every day i pray but that aint nothing cute to say
the money good but how i know my buzz is finna stay
put my all into this music i aint make it here to play
came a long way from booking niggas me and trigga trey
okay im just tryna shed a little bit of light
and motivate them kids who havent found they way in life
remember i aint have nowhere to lay my head at night
trappin on the block i was sellin weed and dirty sprite
dont wait until you hurtin fore you choose to pray to christ
shooter on my package you ever see me on them bikes
still be in my hood im comin up im playin dice
i earned my stripes so i walk around my city like shit nice
on god i wish i could make sure everybody eat
red bottoms drippin off of everybody feet
hard feelings i be thinking everybody keep
and im workin hard i be up while everybody sleep
asthma acting up fuck it i dont really care
still spittin bars while im wheezing for some air
pocket hold a deuce and yeah its small im well aware
when it flare hit your melon bet your salsa hit the air
vvss diamonds on me reason why they stare
youngest out the city reason i dont really care
hatin on my body best believe im well aware
caught a milli on the gram lil boy youre nowhere near
flexed up just was next up now im up now
down to earth true to all my fans i could touch ground
run up on me thinkin i dont got it you get pumped down
bustdown glizzy in my pocket stupid nigga
no security 18 i dont think they hearing me
apparently niggas aint real shit be scaring me
im glizzied up got that glizzy tucked why they fearing me
rap nigga try to throw shade why he daring me
18 got a clean record thanks to yo
your bitch she swallow
you feel a way then catch a hollow
and hits really nothin we dont really care for fiveo
i been doin this shit as a kid i was nineo
but they dont really know that somethin like a throwback
tryna clean the image up so i dont wanna show that
headed to the top i aint never tryna go back
signs you see me throwin up they nothin like a zodiac
fuck the other side see my nuts they can hold that
showin off them pistols i aint never seen you blow that
smelly hella proud and the opps already know that
if yall want me gone why dont you come and pull up where a show at

and out here look at you today yeah quiet

verse 2
remember sellin white up on the block
tryna make some knots
ds try to run up in the spot
me and smelly sittin in the trap
smokin on the pack
wrong crib all you smell is crack
and i done put my trenches onto rap
i wish i could go back
to august 14th to be exact
thats when my nigga smelly would be here
trauma so severe
i had to watch him crying out for air
bet hes in the air make me cough
spinnin through the fourth
catch an opp im finna take him off
and i call the shots im a boss
skinny version ross
dummy in the air take a loss
outro

got me talkin hot and shit man
niggas know my body though
