got no place to call my home no more
im a wanderer a wandering wanderer
got no one to call my own no more

got no strings to tie me down
got no cause to hang around
what difference does it make which way i go
got an empty feelin down inside
still i need to stay alive
and who can tell what waits beyond this road
im a drifter a driftin drifter
got no one to call my own no more

got no strings to tie me down
got no cause to hang around
what difference does it make which way i go
got an empty feelin deep inside
still i need to stay alive
who can tell what waits beyond this road
im a drifter a driftin drifter
got no one to call my own no more

got no place to call my home no moreyou might also likeembed"
