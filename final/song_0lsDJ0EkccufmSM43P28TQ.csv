verse 1
i was raised in the hood called what the dif
where the brothers in the hood we chivalrous
so i rest defense on my ligaments
pistol grip pump on my lap riskin it
full life living it never giving it back
too late for slipping so slack up
on my lap its on your lips so track shot
a steel dick more clip for pump but
all im saying aint no question who the man is
in my civic or in this showbiz
i shoot a fool kill the fool come on what you say
i think i can take care of all you motherfuckers dont delay right away

chorus
pistol grip pump on my lap at all times

pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
they can be fuckin wit other niggas shit but they cant be fuckin wit mine
pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
they can be fuckin wit other niggas shit but they cant be fuckin wit mine

pistol grip pump on my lap at all times right
cause tricks be out for your blind side
never understood it but remember i showed you
that in these times you gotta look over your shoulder strap
well that aint nothin but the intent of gettin high
and a cop giving you shit for just passing you by
if youre ever in trouble or on the double best to call your pals
if you aint got none now sucka i got a million styles around me
are we getting along we family we better be
we got your back we got your back kid
just dont be pointing one of them guns aight man
