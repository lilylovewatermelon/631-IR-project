im so alive
im so enlightened
i can barely survive
a night in my mind
so ive got a plan
im going to find out just how boring i am
and have a good time

prechorus
cause ever since i tried
trying not to find
every little meaning in my life
its been fine ive been cool
with my new golden rule

chorus
numb is the new deep
done with the old me
and talk is the same cheap its been

verse 2
is there a god
why is he waiting
dont you think of it odd
when he knows my address
and look at the stars
dont they remind you of just how feeble we are
well it used to i guess
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likeprechorus
cause ever since i tried
trying not to find
every little meaning in my life
its been fine ive been cool
with my new golden rule

chorus
numb is the new deep
done with the old me
and talk is the same cheap its been

verse 3
im a new man
i wear a new cologne and
you wouldnt know me if your eyes were closed
i know what youll say
this wont last longer than the rest of the day
but youre wrong this time
youre wrong

chorus
numb is the new deep
done with the old me
im over the analyzing tonight
outro
stop trying to figure it out
you try to figure you try to figure it out
deep will only bring you down
you know i used to be
the back porch poet with my book of rhymes
always open knowing all the time im probably
never going to find the perfect rhyme
for heavier things1embed"
