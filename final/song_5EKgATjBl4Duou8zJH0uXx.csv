chorus
a mastermind sees it coming before it comes
a mastermind before he go to war he counts his ones
a mastermind everything planned out perfect
in case yall niggas got to get murdered
a mastermind sleeps at night real easy
a mastermind cause everything he does is by the book
a mastermind never do a thing irrational
lives forever these tales are classical

verse 1
velvet bow ties
bulletproofs in the tux when i roll by
in a car similar to osamas in my diamonds
and my principal is to study drama
look what happened in manhattan
a couple of years ago when guns started clappin
two of my dogs fell two of my niggas ran
they was amateurs in beef with a grown man
it taught me the lessons of how the strong stand
and how the weak end up in a coffin
play it cool thats the old school rule man
keep your ears to the street youll never lose man
make your enemies believe theres love there
cause in war belief is all fair
rock them to sleep shots in your jeep
and you aint never know the plot was from me
its from my masterminds

verse 2
it aint a game its the life
think its a game you lame
and im nice on that black stone merlot
toast to my hero nat turner
weather below zero gave the keys to kelis
whispered in her earlobe drive home
cause she the wife and they the freaks
the underneath my girl caliber
they smiled at her and said goodbye
with niggas who thug or die they wild as us
my bodyguards in my denali truck
knowing that im surrounded by ogs
that i dont really get down with
they got a separate table for their freaks bought them drinks
so we could talk mantoman so real niggas could link
i knew they kill hoes too like rae carruth
they used to spray troops now they managing groups
the main nigga sonny had big money since 82
had two of my dogs whacked nothing i could do
that was back when i had no crew i switched that
now im strong with niggas who feel sonny was wrong
my moneys long his money is weak hes losing sleep
trying to feel me out to see what its gon be
but im a mastermind

verse 3
i live a clean life i dont even steal cable

lucky us this rap done worked out fine
feds check me out its no dirt yall find

every nigga get burned but its what you did with it
niggas who brilliant came in and killed it
made millions every three months new jury
im low smoking blueberry with a ho
that know a few scary individuals its eerie as she get into it
squares they into voodoo
she says a hail mary then she said she knew who
would come and try to kill you too
