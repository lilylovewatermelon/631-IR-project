last night i had a dream
i found myself in a desert called cyberland
it was hot my canteen had sprung a leak and i was thirsty

out of the abyss walked a cow elsie
i asked if she had anything to drink
she said im forbidden to produce milk in cyberland we only drink
diet coke
she said only thing to do is jump over the moon
they closed everything real down
like barns and troughs and performance spaces
and replaced it all with lies and rules and virtual life

but there is a way out
leap of faith leap of faith
oooooooo leap of faith leap of faith
only thing to do is jump over the moon leap of faith leap of faith leap of faith leap of faith

ive gotta get out of here
its like im being tied to the hood of a yellow rental truck
being packed in with fertilizer and fuel oil
pushed over a cliff by a suicidal mickey mouse
ive gotta
gotta
gotta
gotta
gotta

only thing to do is jump over the moon

then a little bull dog entered
his name we have learned was benny
and although he once had principles
he abandoned them to live as a lapdog to a wealthy daughter of the revolution

uh one two three thats bull he said
ever since that cat took up the fiddle that cows been jumping
the dish and the spoon were evicted from the table and eloped
shes had trouble with the milk and that moon ever since
maybe its a female thing

cause whod want to leave cyberland anyway
walls aint so bad
the dish and the spoon for instance theyre down on their luck
they come knocking on my doghouse door and i say
not in my backyard utensils go back to china

the only way out is up
elsie whispered to me a leap of faith
sill thirsty parched have some milk
and i lowered myself beneath her and held my mouth to her swollen udder
and i sucked the sweetest milk i have ever tasted slurp
climb onboard she said
and as a harvest moon rose over cyberland we reared back
we sprang into a gallop
leaping out of orbit i awoke singing

leap of faith leap of faith
oooooo leap of faith leap of faith
only thing to do only thing to is jump leap of faith leap of faith leap of faith leap of faith
only thing to do is jump over the moonleap of faith leap of faith leap of faith leap of faith
only thing to do is jump over the moonleap of faith leap of faith leap of faith leap of faith
over the moon leap of faith leap of faith
