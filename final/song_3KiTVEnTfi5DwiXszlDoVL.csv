the stars lean down to kiss you
and i lie awake and miss you
pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere
cause ill doze off safe and soundly
but ill miss your arms around me
id send a postcard to you dear
cause i wish you were here

verse 2
ill watch the night turn light blue
but its not the same without you
because it takes two to whisper quietly
the silence isnt so bad
til i look at my hands and feel sad
cause the spaces between my fingers
are right where yours fit perfectly
ill find repose in new ways
though i havent slept in two days
cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone
but drenched in vanilla twilight
ill sit on the front porch all night
waistdeep in thought because when i think of you
i dont feel so alone

bridge
i dont feel so alone
i dont feel so alone
as many times as i blink ill think of you
tonight tonight tonight tonight
ill think of you tonight
see owl city liveget tickets as low as 46you might also likeverse 3
when violet eyes get brighter
and heavy wings grow lighter
ill taste the sky and feel alive again
and ill forget the world that i knew
but i swear i wont forget you
oh if my voice could reach back through the past
id whisper in your ear
oh darling i wish you were here
