shes beautiful in her simple little way
she dont have too much to say when she gets mad
she understands she dont let go of anything
even when the pain gets really bad
i guess i shouldve been more like that
you had it all for a pretty little while
and somehow you made me smile when i was sad
you took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart
and then you realized you wanted what you had
i guess i shouldve been more like that

chorus
i should have held on to my pride
i should have never let you lie
i guess you got what you deserved
i guess i shouldve been more like her

verse
forgiving you
well shes stronger than i am
you dont look much like a man from where im at
its plain to see desperation showed its truth
you love her and she loves you with all she has
i guess i shouldve been more like that

i should have held on to my pride
i should have never let you lie
i guess you got what you deserved
i guess i shouldve been more like her
