verse 1 jason mraz
calm down
deep breaths
and get yourself dressed instead
of running around
and pulling on your threads
and breaking yourself up
if its a broken part replace it
if its a broken arm then brace it
if its a broken heart then face it

chorus jason mraz
and hold your own
know your name
and go your own way
hold your own
know your name
and go your own way
and everything will be fine

verse 2 jason mraz
hang on
help is on the way
and stay strong
im doing everything

bridge james morrison
are the details in the fabric
are the things that make you panic
are your thoughts results of static cling
are the things that make you blow
hell no reason go on and scream
if youre shocked its just the fault
of faulty manufacturing

chorus james morrison and jason mraz
everything will be fine
everything in no time at all
everything
hold your own
know your name
go your own way
hold your own are the details in the fabric
know your name are the things that make you panic
go your own way are your thoughts results of static cling
hold your own are the details in the fabric
know your name are the things that make you panic
go your own way is it mother natures sewing machine
hold your own are the things that make you blow
know your name hell no reason go on and scream
go your own way if youre shocked its just the fault
of faulty manufacturing
bridge jason mraz and james morrison
everything will be fine
everything in no time at all
hearts will hold
