i heard about this frog
its a very tiny frog
but its also very special
you can only find it in the jungle
so far away from here
but if you find it and if you touch it your world can change forever
if you touch its skin
you can feel your body changing
and your vision also
and blue becomes red and red becomes blue
and your mommy suddenly becomes your daddy
and everything looks like a giant cupcake
and you keep laughing and laughing and laughing
nothing is ever quite the same really
and after you finished laughing
its time to turn into a frog yourself
its very funny to be a frog
you can dive into the water and cross the rivers
and the oceans
and you can jump all the time and everywhere
do you wanna play with me
we could be a whole group of friends
a whole group of frogs
jumping into the streets
jumping into the planet
climbing the buildings
swimming in the lakes and in the bathtubs
we would be hundreds thousands millions
the biggest group of friends the world has ever seen
jumping and laughing forever
it would be great right

see all the colors in the sky
see all the colors in the sky9embed"
