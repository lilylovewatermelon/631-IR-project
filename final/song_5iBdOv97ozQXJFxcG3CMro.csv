blind date with the chancer we had oysters and dry lancers
and the check when it arrived we went dutch dutch dutch dutch
a redder shade of neck on a whiter shade of trash
and this emory board is giving me a rash
im flat out
youre so beautiful to look at when you cry
freeze dont move
youve been chosen as an extra in the movie adaptation of the sequel to your life

chorus
a shady lane everybody wants one
a shady lane everybody needs one
oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god
oh my god oh your god oh his god oh her god
its everybodys god its everybodys god its everybodys god its everybodys god
the worlds collide but all that we want is a shady lane

verse 2
glance dont stare
soon youre being told to recognize your heirs
no not me
im an island of such great complexity
stress surrounds
in the muddy peaceful center of this town
tell me off
in the hotel lobby right in front of all the bellboys and the overfriendly concierge

a shady lane everybody wants one
a shady lane everybody needs one
oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god
oh my god oh your god oh his god oh her god
its everybodys god its everybodys god its everybodys god its everybodys god
the worlds collide but all that i want is a shady lane6embed"
