turn me up in the headphones

verse
been a lot of cheap talk but i rock still
from the streets of shanghai back to knoxville
sitting high on a mountain top holding shop spreading the good news
been alotta false prophets and quick hits
and a lot of unamerican bullshit
but the time has come to settle and the devils going to make you choose
and just like a cold wind blowing can you feel me coming for u
just like a freight train rolling packed tight full of rhythm and blues
testify
its a rock revival
dont need a suit
you dont need a bible
get up and dance
im going to set you free yeah
testify
its all sex drugs rock n roll
a soul sensation that you cant control
and you can see i practice what i preach
im your rock and roll jesus
yes i am
been a lot of bling bling but it isnt real
and a lot of new kings but i wont kneel
sitting high on a mountain top holding shop singing the raw dog blues
like in old mississippis dirty cotton fields
or in detroit citys unforgotten wheels
its the same song spinning but the same songs always been true
and im going to take my roll because i am not got nothing to lose
and im going to save your soul if its really what you want me to do
see kid rock liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeoutro
im your rock and roll jesus1embed"
