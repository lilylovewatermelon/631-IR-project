verse
im from the bottom whip that soft thats what we play there
from dracos to cutters everything i slang that
i got a couple niggas mad give me my dick back
tryna fuck your daughter in her ass do she like that
bat a nigga in his shit and make that nigga fight back
i aint scared of shit block told me you better not stop that
nigga shot my brother six times you know we cancer that
out the window with that stick you know how i get down with that
rat nigga in a monkey suit you know what them bullets do
ask the last nigga who was walkin is he bulletproof
baby you know joe
that lil nigga out his mind he be steppin for free
he smoke with joe to cool his nerves before he handle his business
pop a perky out his mind so he gon step on the whitney
i heard its money on his head but he died in the trenches
better put insurance on him fore the creatures come get him
shit we be gettin it know we with it bitch we strapped with them poles
and we come through hollerin that bottom bitch we bangin that four
and chopper bullets rip his body leave his shit on the floor
i call lil fred he out his body shit my nigga on go
