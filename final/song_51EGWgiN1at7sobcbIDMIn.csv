you made me cy some too
you sent me off to a world of pain
and made me someone new
you made me all kinds of promises
but only some came true
now i know you need me more than i need you

to think i used to love you
for reasons i dont know
you polished up my halo
and i dirtied up your soul
i sure had a good time
but we both know i cant stay
to think i used to love you but im leaving anyway

you know im not perfect
and i tried to make you see
somehow you thought of everything
but you didnt think about me
lies and disappointment
makes your world go round
its to late save me so you might as well come down

to think i used to love you
for reasons i dont know
you polished up my halo
and i dirtied up your soul
i sure had a good time
but we both know i cant stay
to think i used to love you but im leaving anyway

for reasons i dont know

and i dirtied up your soul

but we both know i cant stay
