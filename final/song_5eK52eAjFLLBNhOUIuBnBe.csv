oh yeah
candles burning low
lots of mistletoe
lots of snow and ice
everywhere we go
choirs singing carols
right outside my door

chorus
all these things and more
all these things and more
thats what christmas means to me my love
thats what christmas means to me my love

verse 2
oh yeah
hey hey yeah yeah yeah

and ya know what i mean
i see your smiling face
like i never seen before
even though i love ya madly
it seems i love you more
the little cards you give me
will touch my heart for sure

verse 3
oh yeah ha ha
i feel like running wild
running wild
as anxious as a little child
greet you neath the mistletoe
kiss you once and then some more
and wish you a merry christmas baby
wish you a merry christmas baby
and such happiness in the coming year
happiness in the coming year
oh baby
lets deck the halls with holly
sing sweet silent night
fill the tree with angel hair
and pretty pretty lights
go to sleep and wake up
just before daylight
chorus
all these things and more baby
all these things and more baby
whoa
thats what christmas means to me my love
thats what christmas means to me my love
oh baby baby

outro
yeah
candles burning low
lots and lots of snow
alright
christmas bells are ringing
christmas choirs singing
coo
christmas mistletoeembed"
