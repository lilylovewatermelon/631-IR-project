ive watched those eyes light up with a smile
river in the not good times
oh you taught me all that i know i know
ive seen your soul grow just like a rose
made it through all of those thorns
girl into the woman i know

and its killing me me to say im fine im fine

all i know you taught me yeah
youre my all and more
but i need room to breathe yeah

verse 2
i found new york laying in your arms
well melt into the bedroom floor
never knew id stay for so long
and this truth cuts not through one but both
not through one but both of us
but its deeper if i hold on
