feelin comfortable right here where you are
sun all on your skin and im watchin it
light up every part of me every part of me
weve been hidin hidin
layin by your side as you wakin up
losin track of time as our feelings touched
we fall deep into the bed we become the threads
intertwinin

chorus
i just wanna stay in the world we created
i just wanna sink in the plans that we makin
when i leave im not lookin for a replacement for what i got
i need you to trust and believe when i say this
aint nothing or nobody thats ever gonna break us
not lookin for situations i aint forgot

verse 2
tell me why you always overthinkin
not like me to switch up like the seasons
no i havent had a change of feelings
you stay in the back of my mind
everything i do is for tomorrow
runnin but ill never let your hand go
no more second guessin cause were so close
even on the hardest nights
you might also likechorus
i just wanna stay in the world we created we created
i just wanna sink in the plans that we makin we makin
when i leave im not lookin for a replacement for what i got
i need you to trust and believe when i say this
aint nothing or nobody thats ever gonna break us
not lookin for situations i aint forgot
