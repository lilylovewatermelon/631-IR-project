look at this stuff
isnt it neat
wouldnt you think my collections complete
wouldnt you think im the girl
the girl who has everything
look at this trove
treasures untold
how many wonders can one cavern hold
looking around here youd think
sure
shes got everything

verse 2
ive got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
ive got who it is and what it is galore
you want thingamabobs
i got twenty
but who cares
no big deal
i want more

verse 3
i want to be where the people are
i want to see
want to see them dancing
walking around on those
what you call them
oh  feet
flipping your fins you dont get too far
legs are required for jumping dancing
strolling along down a
whats that word again
street
up where they walk
up where they run
up where they stay all day in the sun
wandering free
wish i could be
part of that world
verse 4
what would i give
if i could live
out to these waters
what would i pay
to spend a day
warm on the sand
betcha on land
they understand
bet they dont reprimand their daughters
bright young women
sick of swimming
ready to stand

verse 5
and im ready to know what the people know
ask them my questions
and get some answers
whats a fire and why does it
whats the word burn

verse 6
whens it my turn
wouldnt i love
love to explore that shore up above
out of the sea
wish i could be
part of that worldyou might also like1embed"
