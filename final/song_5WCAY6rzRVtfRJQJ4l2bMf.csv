you hold in your hands one the great books of our century fnord
some great books are recognized at once with a fusilade of critical huzzahs and gonfolons like joyces ulysses others appear almost furtively and are only discovered 50 years later like moby dick or mendels great essay on genetics the principia discordia entered our spacetime continuum almost as unobtrusively as a catburglar creeping over a windowsill

in 1968 virtually nobody had heard of this wonderful book in 1970 hundreds of people coast to coast were talking about it and asking the identity of the mysterious author malaclypse the younger rumors swept across the continent from new york to los angeles from seattle to st joe malaclypse was actually alan watts one heard no said another legend  the principia was actually the work of the sufi order a third very intriguing myth held that malaclypse was a penname for richard m nixon who had allegedly composed the principia during a few moments of lucidity i enjoyed each of these yarns and did my part to help spread them i was also careful never to contradict the occasional rumors that i had actually written the whole thing myself during an acid trip

the legendry the mystery the cult grew slowly by the mid1970s thousands of people some as far off as hong kong and australia were talking about the principia and since the original was out of print by then xerox copies were beginning to circulate here and there

when the illuminatus trilogy appeared in 1975 my coauthor bob shea and i both received hundreds of letters from people intrigued by the quotes from the principia with which we had decorated the heads of several chapters many who had already heard of the principia or seen copies asked if shea and i had written it or if we had copies available others wrote to ask if it were real or just something we had invented the way hp lovecraft invented the necronomicon we answered according to our moods sometimes telling the truth sometimes spreading the most godawful lies and myths we could devise fnord

why not we felt that this book was a true classic literatus immortalis and since the alleged intelligentsia had not yet discovered it the best way to keep its legend alive was to encourage the mythology and the controversy about it increasingly people wrote to ask me if timothy leary had written it and i almost always told them he had except on fridays when i am more whimsical in which case i told them it had been transmitted by a canine intelligence  vast cool and unsympathic  from the dog star sirius

now at last the truth can be told

actually the principia is the work of a timetravelling anthropologist from the 23rd century he is currently passing among us as a computer specialist bon vivant and philosopher named gregory hill he has also translated several volumes of etruscan erotic poetry under another penname and in the 18th century was the mysterious man in black who gave jefferson the design for the great seal of the united states

i have it on good authority that he is one of the most accomplished timetravelers in the galaxy and has visited earth many times in the past using such coveridentities as zeno of elias emperor norton count cagliostro guilliame of aquaitaine etc whenever i question him about this he grows very evasive and attempts to persuade me that he is actually just another 20th century earthman and that all my ideas about his extra terrrestrial and extratemporal origin and delusions hah i am not that easily deceived after all a timetravelling anthropologist would say just that so that he could observe us without his presense causing cultureshock

i understand that he has consented to write an afterward to this edition hell probably contradict everything ive told you but dont believe a word he says fnord he is a master of the deadpan puton the plausible satire the philosophical legpull and all the branches of guerilla ontology

for full benefit to the head this book should be read in conjunction with the illuminoids by neal wilgus sun press albuquerque nm and zen without zen masters by camden benares andor press berkeley california we are operating on many levels here as ken kesey used to say

in conclusion there is no conclusion things go on as they always have getting weirder all the time

the pentabarf was discovered by the hermit apostle zarathud in the fifth year of the caterpillar he found them carved in gilded stone while building a sun deck for his cave but their import was lost for they were written in a mysterious cypher however after 10 weeks  11 hours of intensive scrutiny he discerned that the message could be read by standing on his head and viewing it upside down

worried whether or not the rest of the plumbing fixtures would fall from the
second floor bathroom to join the pipes and other trash he was sitting on
he worried how would he know when the moon rose on the next night  he
worried about what the people who walked through the room said about him

his worrying and meditation were disturbed when as if in a test of his
faith ordure fell from the second floor onto him  at that time two people
walked into the room  the first asked the second who the man was sitting

the birth of the erisian movement

the revelation

just prior to the decade of the nineteensixties when sputnik was alone and new and about the time that ken kesey took his first acid trip as a medical volunteer before underground newspapers viet nam and talk of a second american revolution in the comparative quiet of the late nineteen fifties just before the idea of renaissance became relevant
two young californians known later as omar ravenhurst and malaclypse the younger were indulging in their habit of sipping coffee at an allnight bowling alley and generally solving the worlds problems this particular evening the main subject of discussion was discord and they were complaining to each other of the personal confusion they felt in their respective lives solve the problem of discord said one and all other problems will vanish indeed said the other chaos and strife are the roots of all confusion

first i must sprinkle you with fairy dust

suddenly the place became devoid of light then an utter silence enveloped them and a great stillness was felt then came a blinding flash of intense light as though their very psyches had gone nova then vision returned
the two were dazed and neither moved nor spoke for several minutes they looked around and saw that the bowlers were frozen like statues in a variety of comic positions and that a bowling ball was steadfastly anchored to the floor only inches from the pins that it had been sent to scatter the two looked at each other totally unable to account for the phenomenon the condition was one of suspension and one noticed that the clock had stopped

marginalia no girdle ever cured a pregnancy

there walked into the room a chimpanzee shaggy and grey about the muzzle yet upright to his full five feet and poised with natural majesty he carried a scroll and walked to the young men

gentlemen he said why does pickerings moon go about in reverse orbit gentlemen there are nipples on your chests do you give milk and what pray tell gentlemen is to be done about heisenbergs law he paused somebody had to put all of this confusion here

and with that he revealed his scroll it was a diagram like a yin yang with a pentagon on one side and an apple on the other and then he exploded and the two lost consciousness

eris  goddess of chaos discord  confusion

they awoke to the sound of pins clattering and found the bowlers engaged in their game and the waitress busy with making coffee it was apparant that their experience had been private
they discussed their strange encounter and reconstructed from memory the chimpanzees diagram over the next five days they searched libraries to find the significance of it but were disappointed to uncover only references to taoism the korean flag and technocracy it was not until they traced the greek writing on the apple that they discovered the ancient goddess known to the greeks as eris and to the romans as discordia this was on the fifth night and when they slept that night each had a vivid dream of a splendid woman whose eyes were as soft as feather and as deep as eternity itself and whose body was the spectacular dance of atoms and universes pyrotechnics of pure energy formed her flowing hair and rainbows manifested and dissolved as she spoke in a warm and gentle voice

i have come to tell you that you are free many ages ago my consciousness left man that he might develop himself i return to find this development approaching completion but hindered by fear and by misunderstanding
you have built for yourselves psychic suits of armor and clad in them your vision is restricted your movements are clumsy and painful your skin is bruised and your spirit is broiled in the sun

i am chaos i am the substance from which your artists and scientists build rhythms i am the spirit with which your children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy i am chaos i am alive and i tell you that you are free

during the next months they studied philosophies and theologies and learned that eris or discordia was primarily feared by the ancients as being disruptive indeed the very concept of chaos was still considered equivalent to strife and treated as a negative no wonder things are all screwed up they concluded they have got it all backwards they found that the principle of disorder was every much as significant as the principle of order

with this in mind they studied the strange yinyang during a meditation one afternoon a voice came to them

it is called the sacred chao i appoint you keepers of it therein you will find anything you like speak of me as discord to show contrast to the pentagon tell constricted mankind that there are no rules unless they choose to invent rules keep close the words of syadasti tis an ill wind that blows no minds and remember that there is no tyranny in the state of confusion for further information consult your pineal gland

what is this mumbled one to the other a religion based on the goddess of confusion it is utter madness

and with those words each looked at the other in absolute awe omar began to giggle mal began to laugh omar began to jump up and down mal was hooting and hollering to beat all hell and amid squeals of mirth and with tears on their cheeks each appointed the other to be high priest of his own madness and together they declared themselves to be a society of discordia for what ever that may turn out to be

josh the dill
king kong kabal

it is my firm belief that it is a mistake
to hold firm beliefs
the classical greeks were not influenced by the classical greeks
do not circulate
what we know about eris not much

the romans left a likeness of her for posterityshe was shown as a grotesque woman with a pale and ghastly look her eyes afire her garment ripped and torn and as concealing a dagger in her bosom actually most women look pale and ghastly when concealing a chilly dagger in their bosoms
her geneology is from the greeks and is utterly confused either she was the twin of ares and the daughter of zeus and hera or she was the daughter of nyx goddess of night who was either the daughter or wife of chaos or both and nyxs brother erebus and whose brothers and sisters include death doom mockery and friendship and that she begat forgetfullness quarrels lies and a bunch of gods and goddesses like that

one day mal2 consulted his pineal gland and asked eris if she really created all of those terrible things she told him that she had always liked the old greeks but that they cannot be trusted with historic matters they were she added victims of indigestion you know

suffice it to say that eris is not hateful or malicious but she is mischievous and does get a little bitchy at times

the pineal gland is where each and every one of us can talk to eris if you have trouble activating your pineal then try the appendix which does almost as well reference dogma i metaphysics 3 the indoctrine of the pineal gland

the inside story

the law of fives

the law of fives is one of the oldest erisian mysterees it was first revealed to good lord omar and is one of the great contributions to come from the hidden temple of the happy jesus
poee subscribes to the law of fives of omars sect and poee also recognizes the holy 23 235 that is incorporated by episkopos dr mordecai malignatus kns into his discordian sect the ancient illuminated seers of bavaria

the law of fives states simply that all things happen in fives or are divisible by or are multiples of five or are somehow directly or indirectly appropriate to 5

the law of fives is never wrong

in the erisian archives is an old memo from omar to mal2 i find the law of fives to be more and more manifest the harder i look

please do not use this
document as toilet tissue

the nagas of upper burma say that the sun
shines by day because being a woman it

 john kenneth galbraith
the myth of the apple of discord

it seems that zeus was preparing a wedding banquet for peleus and thetis and did not want to invite eris because of her reputation as a trouble maker
this made eris angry and so she fashioned an apple of pure gold and inscribed upon it kallisti to the prettiest one and on the day of the fete she rolled it into the banquet hall and then left to be alone and joyously partake of a hot dog

now three of the invited goddesses athena hera and aphrodite each immediately claimed it to belong to herself because of the inscription and they started fighting and they started throwing punch all over the place and everything

finally zeus calmed things down and declared that an arbitrator must be selected which was a reasonable suggestion and all agreed he sent them to a shepherd of troy whose name was paris because his mother had had a lot of gaul and had married a frenchman but each of the sneaky goddesses tried to outwit the others by going early and offering a bribe to paris

athena offered him heroic war victories hera offered him great wealth and aphrodite offered him the most beautiful woman on earth being a healthy young trojan lad paris promptly accepted aphrodites bribe and she got the apple and he got screwed

as she had promised she maneuvered earthly happenings so that paris could have helen the helen then living with her husband menelaus king of sparta anyway everyone knows that the trojan war followed when sparta demanded their queen back and that the trojan war is said to be the first war among men

and so we suffer because of the original snub and so a discordian is to partake of no hot dog buns

do you believe that

 this is called the doctrine of the original snub
 there is historic disagreement concerning whether this apple was of metallic gold or acapulco

 actually there were five goddesses but the greeks did not know the law of fives

5 an age of confusion or an ancient age is one in which history as we know it begins to unfold in which whatever is coming emerges in corporal form more or less and such times are ages of balanced unbalance or unbalanced balance
6 an age of bureaucracy is an imperial age in which things mature in which confusion becomes entrenched and during which balanced balance or stagnation is attained

7 an age of disorder or an aftermath is an apocalyptic period of transition back to chaos through the screen of oblivion into which the age passeth finally these are ages of unbalanced unbalance

 the five fingered hand of eris 

the official symbol of poee is here illustrated it may be this or any similar device to represent two opposing arrows converging into a common point it may be vertical horizontal or else such and it may be elaborated or simplified as desired
the esoteric name for this symbol is the five fingered hand of eris commonly shortened to the hand

  

  
note in the lore of western magic the  is taken to symbolize horns especially the horns of satan or of diabolical beasties the five fingered hand of eris however is not intended to be taken as satanic for the horns are supported by another set of inverted horns or maybe it is walrus tusks i dont know what it is to tell the truth

 poee 
poee pronounced poee is an acronym for the paratheoanametamystikhood of eris esoteric the first part can be taken to mean equivalent deity reversity beyondmystique we are not really esoteric its just that nobody pays much attention to us
my high reverence malaclypse the younger ab dd ksc is the high priest of poee and poee is grounded in his episkopotic revelations of the goddess he is called the omnibenevolent polyfather of virginity in gold

the poee head temple is the joshua norton cabal of the discordian society which is located in mal2s pineal gland and can be found by temporally and spacially locating the rest of mal2

poee has no treasury no bylaws no articles no guides save mal2s pineal gland and has only one scruplewhich mal2 keeps on his key chain

poee has not registered incorporated or otherwise chartered with the state and so the state does not recognize poee or poee ordinations which is only fair because poee does not recognize the state

poee has 5 degrees

there is the neophyte or legionnaire disciple

poee  its priests

if you like erisianism as it is presented according to mal2 then you may wish to from your own poee cabal as a poee priest and you can go do a bunch of poee priestly things a poee cabal is exactly what you think it is
the high priest makes no demands on his priests though he does rather expect good will of them the office of the polyfather is point not to teach once in a while he even listens

should you find that your own revelations of the goddess become substantially different that the revelations of mal2 then perhaps the goddess has plans for you as an episkopos and you might consider creating your own sect from scratch unhindered episkoposes are not competing with each other and they are all poee priests anyway as soon as i locate them the point is that episkoposes are developing separate paths to the erisian mountain top see the section discordian society

ordination as a poee priest

there are no particular qualifications for ordination because if you want to be a poee priest then you must undoubtedly qualify who could possibly know better than you whether or not you should be ordained
an ordained poee priest or priestess is defined as one who holds an ordination certificate from the office of the polyfather

how to start a poee cabal without messing around with the polyfather

if you cant find the polyfather or having found him dont want anything to do with him you are still authorized to form your own poee cabal and do priestly things using the principia discordia as a guide your official rank will be poee chaplin for the legion of dynamic discord which is exactly the same as a poee priest except that you dont have an ordination certificate the words you are now reading are your ordination

 the poee baptismal rite 

this mysteree rite is not required for initiation but it is offered by many poee priests to proselytes who desire a formal ceremony
1 the priests and four brothers are arranged in a pentagon with the initiate in the center facing the priests if possible the brothers on the immediate right and left of the priest should be deacons the initiate must be totally naked to demonstrate that he is truly a human being and not something else in disguise like a cabbage or something

2 all persons in the audience and the pentagon excepting the priest assume a squatting position and return to a standing position this is repeated four more times this dance is symbolic of the humility of we erisians

3 the priest begins i complete holy name with mystical titles and degrees designations offices etc ordained priest of the paratheoanametamystikhood of eris esoteric with the authority invested at me by the high priest of it office of the polyfather the house of the rising podge poee head temple do herewith require of ye

are ye a human being and not a cabbage or something
the initiate answers yes
thats too bad do ye wish to better thyself
the initiate answers yes
how stupid are ye willing to become philosophically illuminized
he answers yes
very funny will ye dedicate yeself to the holey erisian movement
the initiate answers probably
then swear ye the following after me
the priest here leads the initiate in a recital of the erisian affirmation
the priest continues then i do here proclaim ye poee disciple name legionnaire of the legion of dynamic discord hail eris hail hail hail yes
4 all present rejoice grandly the new brother opens a large jug of wine and offers it to all who are present

the parable of the bitter tea

by rev dr hypocrates magoun pp poee priest okinawa cabal
when hypoc was through meditating with st gulik he went there into the kitchen where he busied himself with preparing the feast and in his endeavor he found that there was some old tea in a pan left standing from the night before when he had in his weakness forgot about its making and had let it sit steeping for 24 hours it was dark and murky and it was hypocs intention to use this old tea by diluting it with water and again in his weakness chose without further consideration and plunged into the physical labor of the preparations it was then when deeply immersed in the pleasure of that trip he had a sudden loud clear voice in his head saying it is bitter tea that involves you so hypoc heard the voice but the struggle inside intensified and the pattern previously established with the physical laboring and the muscle messages coordinated and unified or perhaps coded continued to exert their influence and hypoc succummed to the pressure and he denied the voice

and again he plunged into the physical orgy and completed the task and lo as the voice had predicted the tea was bitter

the honest book of truth

being a bible of the erisian movement

episkopos lord omar khayyam ravenhurst ksc bull goose of limbo and master pastor of the church invisible of the laughing christ hidden temple of the happy jesus laughing buddha jesus lbj ranch

from the honest book of truth the book of explanations chapter 1

there came one day to lord omar bull goose of limbo a messenger of our lady who told him of a sacred mound wherein was buried an honest book
and the angel of eris bade of the lord go ye hence and dig the truth that ye may come to know it and knowing it spread it and spreading it wallow in it and wallowing in it lie in it and lying in the truth become a poet of the word and a sayer of sayings  an inspiration to all men and a scribe to the gods
so omar went forth to the sacred mound which was to the east of mullah and thereupon he worked digging in the sand for five days and five nights but found no book
at the end of five days and five nights of digging it came to pass that omar was exhausted so he put his shovel to one side and bedded himself down on the sand using as a pillow a golden chest he had uncovered on the first day of his labors
omar slept
on the fifth day of his sleeping lord omar fell into a trance and there came to him in the trance a dream and there came to him in the dream a messenger of our lady who told him of a sacred grove wherein was hidden a golden chest
and the angel of eris bade of the lord go ye hence and lift the stash that ye may come to own it and owning it share it and sharing it love in it and loving in it dwell in it and dwelling in the stash become a poet of the word and a sayer of sayings  an inspiration to all men and a scribe to the gods
but omar lamented saying unto the angel  what is this shit man what care i for the word and sayings what care i for the inspiration of all men wherein does it profit a man to be a scribe to the gods when the scribes of the governments do nothing yet are paid better wages
and lo the angel waxed in anger and omar was stricken to the ground by an invisible hand and did not arise for five days and five nights
and it came to pass that on the fifth night he dreampt and in his dream he had a vision and in this vision there came unto him a messenger of our lady who entrusted to him a rigoletto cigar box containing many filing cards some of them in packs with rubber bands around and upon these cards were sometimes written verses while upon others nothing was written
thereupon the angel commanded to lord take ye this honest book of truth to thine bosom and cherish it carry it forth into the land and lay it before kings of nations and collectors of garbage preach from it unto the righteous that they may renounce their ways and repent
conventional chaos

greyface

in the year 1166 bc a malcontented hunchbrain by the name of greyface got it into his head that the universe was as humorless as he and he began to teach that play was sinful because it contradicted the ways of serious order look at all the order around you he said and from that he deluded honest men to believe that reality was a straightjacket affair and not the happy romance as men had known it
it is not presently understood why men were so gullible at that particular time for absolutely no one thought to observe all the disorder around them and conclude just the opposite but anyway greyface and his followers took the game of playing at life more seriously than they took life itself and were known even to destroy other living beings whose ways of life differed from their own

the unfortunate result of this is that mankind has since been suffering from a psychological and spiritual imbalance imbalance causes frustration and frustration causes fear and fear makes for a bad trip man has been on a bad trip for a long time now

it is called the curse of greyface

the book of uterus

from the honest book of truth revealed to lord omar

before the beginning was the nonexistent chao balanced in oblivion by the perfect counterpushpull of the hodge and the podge
whereupon by an act of happenstance the hodge began gradually to overpower the podge  and the primal chaos thereby came to be
so in the beginning was the primal chaos balanced on the edge of oblivion by the perfect counterpullpush of the podge and the hodge
whereupon by the law of negative reversal the podge swiftly underpowered the hodge and everything broke loose
and therein emerged the active force of discord the subtle manifestation of the nonexistent chao to guide everything along the path back to oblivion  that it might not become lost among precepts of order in the region of thud
forasmuch as it was active the force of discord entered the state of confusion wherein it copulated with the queen and begat eris our lady of discord and gross manifestation of the nonexistent chao
and under eris confusion became established and was hence called bureaucracy while over bureaucracy eris became established and was hence called discordia
by the by it came to pass that the establishment of bureaucracy perished in a paper shortage
thus it was in accord with the law of laws
during and after the fall of the establishment of bureaucracy was the aftermath an age of disorder in which calculation computations and reckonings were put away by the children of eris in acceptance and preparation for the return to oblivion to be followed by a repetition of the universal absurdity moreover of itself the coming of aftermath waseth a resurrection of the freedomflowing chaos hail eris
herein was set into motion the eristic pattern which would repeat itself five times over seventythree times after which nothing would happen
  this doctrine should not be confused with dogma iii  history 6 historic cycles which states that social progress occurs in five cycles the first three the tricycle of which are thesis antithesis and parenthesis and the last two the bicycle of which are consternation and moral warptitude

 the law of negative reversal states that if something does not happen then the exact opposite will happen only in exactly the opposite manner from that in which it did not happen

note it is from this text from the book of uterus that poee has based its erisian calendar with the year divided into 5 seasons of 73 days each each of the five apostles of eris has patronage over one season a chart of the seasons patrons days of the week holydays and a perpetual gregorian converter is included in this edition of principia

the five orders of discordia them

gen pandaemonium commanding

the seeds of the orders of discordia were planted by greyface into his early disciples they form the skeleton of the aneristic movement which over emphasizes the principle of order and is antagonistic to the necessary compliment the principle of disorder the orders are composed of persons all hung up on authority security and control ie they are blinded by the aneristic illusion they do not know that they belong to orders of discordia but we know
the military order of the knights of the five sided temple this is for all the soldiers and bureaucrats of the world
the political order of the party for war on evil this is reserved for lawmakers censors and like ilk
the academic order of the hemlock fellowship they commonly inhabit schools and universities and dominate many of them
the social order of the citizens committee for concerned citizens this is mostly a grassroots version of the more professional military political academic and sacred orders
the sacred order of the defamation league not much is known about the dl but they are very ancient and quite possibly were founded by greyface himself it is known that they now have absolute domination over all organized churches in the world it is also believed that they have been costuming cabbages and passing them off as human beings
a person belonging to one or more order is just as likely to carry a flag of the counterestablishment as the flag of the establishment just as long as it is a flag

go to your leftright

the following is quoted from bergan evans
on norbert weiner nuclear physicist
the second concept wiener has to establish is that of entropy probability is a mathematical concept coming from statistics entropy comes from physics it is the assertion established logically and experimentally that the universe by its nature is running down moving toward a state of inert uniformity devoid of form matter hierarchy or differentiation
that is in any given situation less organization more chaos is overwhelmingly more probable than tighter organization or more order

the tendency for entropy to increase in isolated systems is expressed in the second law of thermodynamics perhaps the most pessimistic and amoral formulation in all human thought

it applies however to a closed system to something that is an isolated whole not just a part within such systems there may be parts which draw their energy from the whole that are moving at least temporarily in the opposite direction in them order is increasing and chaos is diminishing

the whirlpools that swirl in a direction opposed to the main current are called enclaves and one of them is life especially human life which in a universe moving inexorably towards chaos moves towards increased order

before he became a hermit zarathud was a young priest and took great delight in making fools of his opponents in front of his followers
one day zarathud took his students to a pleasant pasture and there he confronted the sacred chao while she was contentedly grazing

tell me you dumb beast demanded the priest in his commanding voice why dont you do something worthwhile what is your purpose in life anyway

munching the tasty grass the sacred chao replied mu

upon hearing this absolutely nobody was enlightened primarily because nobody could understand chinese

the sacred chao

the sacred chao is the key to illumination devised by the apostle hung mung in ancient china it was modified and popularized by the taoists and is sometimes called the yinyang the sacred chao is not the yinyang of the taoists it is the hodgepodge of the erisians and instead of a podge spot on the hodge side it has a pentagon which symbolizes the aneristic principle and instead of a hodge spot on the podge side it depicts the golden apple of discordia to symbolize the eristic principle
the sacred chao symbolizes absolutely everything anyone need ever know about absolutely anything and more it even symbolizes everything not worth knowing depicted by the empty space surrounding the hodgepodge

here follows some psychometaphysics

if you are not hot for philosophy best just to skip it
the aneristic principle is that of apparent order the eristic principle is that of apparent disorder both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of pure chaos which is a level deeper that is the level of distinction making

with our concept making apparatus called mind we look at reality through the ideasaboutreality which our cultures give us the ideasabout reality are mistakenly labeled reality and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people especially other cultures see reality differently it is only the ideasaboutreality which differ real capitalt true reality is a level deeper that is the level of concept

we look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids concepts different philosophies use different grids a culture is a group of people with rather similar grids through a window we view chaos and relate it to the points on our grid and thereby understand it the order is in the grid that is the aneristic principle

western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will hence say unenlightened westerners be true this is illusory it is what we erisians call the aneristic illusion some grids can be more useful than others some more beautiful than others some more pleasant than others etc but none can be more true than any other

disorder is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid but like relation norelation is a concept male like female is an idea about sex to say that maleness is absence of femaleness or vice versa is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary the artificial concept of norelation is the eristic principle

the belief that order is true and disorder is false or somehow wrong is the aneristic illusion to say the same of disorder is the eristic illusion

the point is that littlet truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment and that capitalt truth metaphysical reality is irrelevant to grids entirely pick a grid and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered pick another grid and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered

reality is the original rorschach

verily so much for all that


the words of the foolish and those of the wise
are not far apart in discordian eyes
hbt the book of advise 21

the podge of the sacred chao is symbolized as the golden apple of discordia which represents the eristic principle of disorder the writing on it kallisti is greek for to the prettiest one and refers to an old myth about the goddess but the greeks had only a limited understanding of disorder and thought it to be a negative principle
the pentagon represents the aneristic principle of order and symbolizes the hodge the pentagon has several references for one it can be taken to represent geometry one of the earliest studies of formal order to reach elaborate development for another it specifically accords with the law of fives


the truth is five but men have only one name for it
patamunzo lingananda
it is also the shape of the united states military headquarters the pentagon building a most pregnant manifestation of straightjacket order resting on a firm foundation of chaos and constantly erupting into dazzling disorder and this building is one of our more cherished erisian shrines also it so happens that in times of medieval magic the pentagon was the generic symbol for werewolves but this reference is not particularly intended and it should be noted that the erisian movement does not discriminate against werewolves our membership roster is open to persons of all races national origins and hobbies


 the greek geometrician pythagoras however was not a typical aneristic personality he was what we call an exploded aneristic and an avatar we call him archangle pythagoras

brunswick shrine

in the los angeles suburb of whittier there lives a bowling alley and within this very place in the year of our lady of discord 3125 1959 eris revealed herself to the golden apple corps for the first time
in honor of this incredible event this holy place is revered as a shrine by all erisians once every five years the golden apple corps plans a pilgrimage to brunswick shrine as an act of devotion and therein to partake of no hot dog buns and ruminate a bit about it all

it is written that when the corps returns to the shrine for the fifth time five times over than shall the world come to an end

impending doom has arrived

and five days prior to this occasion the apostle the elder
malaclypse shall walk the streets of whittier bearing a sign
for all literates to read thereof doom as a warning of
forthcoming doom to all men impending and he shall signal
this event by seeking the poor and distributing to them precious
mao buttons and whittier shall be known as the region of thud
for these five days
as a public service to all mankind and civilization in general and to us in particular the golden apple corps has concluded that planning such a pilgrimage is sufficient and that it is prudent to never get around to actually going

do these 5 pebbles really form a pentagon
note they were pebbles originallytry doing ascii pebbles dtc those biased by the aneristic illusion would say yes those biased by the eristic illusion would say no crisscross them and it is a star

an illuminated mind can see all of these yet he does not insist that any one is really true or that none at all is true stars and pentagons and disorder are all his creations and he may do with them as he wishes indeed even so the concept of number 5

your acute observation that eris spelled backwards is sire and your inference to the effect that there is sexual symbolism here have brought me to some observations of my own

eris spelled forepartaftwards is rise and spelled inside out is reis which is a unit of money albeit portugesebrazilian and no longer in use from this it may be concluded that eris has usurped eros god of erotic love in the eyes of those who read backwards which obviously made eros sore then she apparently embezzeled the olympian treasury and went to brazil whereupon she opened a chain of whorehouses which certainly would get a rise from the male population i figure it to be this in particular because madam reads the same forwards and backwards and further it is a term of great respect similar to sire

and so thank you for your insight it may well be the clue to the mystery of just where eris has been fucking around for 3125 years

form no odd iibii137dvvm3134
dogma iii  history 2 cosmogony

which is not the same as
dogma i  metaphysics 2 cosmology book of uterus

in the beginning there was void who had two daughters one the smaller was that of being named eris and one the larger was of non being named aneris to this day the fundamental truth that aneris is the larger is apparent to all who compare the great number of things that do not exist with the comparatively small number of things that do exist
eris had been born pregnant and after 55 years goddesses have an unusually long gestation period longer even than elephants her pregnancy bore the fruits of many things these things were composed of the five basic elements sweet boom pungent prickle and orange aneris however had been created sterile when she saw eris enjoying herself so greatly with all of the existent things she had borne aneris became jealous and finally one day she stole some existent things and changed them into non existent things and claimed them as her own children this deeply hurt eris who felt that her sister was unjust being so much larger anyway to deny her her small joy and so she made herself swell again to bear more things and she swore that no matter how many of her begotten that aneris would steal she would beget more and in return aneris swore that no matter how many existent things eris brought forth she would eventually find them and turn them into nonexistent things for her own and to this day things appear and disappear in this very manner

at first the things brought forth by eris were in a state of chaos and went in every which way but by the by she began playing with them and ordered some of them just to see what would happen some pretty things arose from this play and for the next five zillion years she amused herself by creating order and so she grouped some things with others and some groups with others and big groups with little groups and all combinations until she had many grand schemes which delighted her

engrossed in establishing order she finally one day noticed disorder previously not apparent because everything was chaos there were many ways in which chaos was ordered and many ways in which it was not

hah she thought here shall be a new game

and she taught order and disorder to play with each other in contest games and to take turns amusing each other she named the side of disorder after herself eristic because being is anarchic and then in a mood of sympathy for her lonely sister she named the other side aneristic which flattered aneris and smoothed the friction a little that was between them

now all of this time void was somewhat disturbed he felt unsatisfied for he had created only physical existence and physical non existence and had neglected the spiritual as he contemplated this a great quiet was caused and he went into a state of deep sleep which lasted for 5 eras at the end of this ordeal he begat a brother to eris and aneris that of spirituality who had no name at all

when the sisters heard this they both confronted void and pleaded that he not forget them his first born and so void decreed thus

that this brother having no form was to reside with aneris in nonbeing and then to leave her and so that he might play with order and disorder reside with eris in being but eris became filled with sorrow when she heard this and then began to weep

why are you despondent demanded void your new brother will have his share with you but father aneris and i have been arguing and she will take him from me when she discovers him and cause him to return to non being i seereplied void then i decree the following

when your brother leaves the residence of being he shall not reside again in nonbeing but shall return to me void from whence he came you girls may bicker as you wish but my son is your brother and we are all of myself

and so it is that we as men do not exist until we do and then it is that we play with our world of existent things and order and disorder them and so it shall be that nonexistence shall take us back from existence and that nameless spirituality shall return to void like a tired child home from a very wild circus

on occultism

magicians especially since the gnostic and the quabala influences have sought higher consciousness through assimilation and control of universal opposites goodevil positivenegative malefemale etc but due to the steadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the ancient methods of the shaman occultists have been blinded to what is perhaps the two most important pairs of apparent or earthplane opposites orderdisorder and serioushumorous
magicians and progeny the scientists have always taken themselves and their subject in an orderly and sober manner thereby disregarding an essential metaphysical balance when magicians learn to approach philosophy as a malleable art instead of an immutable truth and learn to appreciate the absurdity of mans endeavours then they will be able to pursue their art with a lighter heart and perhaps gain a clearer understanding of it and therefore gain more effective magic chaos is energy

this is an essential challenge to the basic concepts of all western occult thought and poee is humbly pleased to offer the first breakthrough in occultism since solomon

the curse of greyface and the introduction of negativism

to choose order over disorder or disorder over order is to accept a trip composed of both the creative and the destructive but to choose the creative over the destructive is an allcreative trip composed of both order and disorder to accomplish this one need only accept creative disorder along with and equal to creative order and also willing to reject destructive order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder
the curse of greyface included the division of life into orderdisorder as the essential positivenegative polarity instead of building a game foundation with creativedestructive as the essential positivenegative he has thereby caused man to endure the destructive aspects of order and has prevented man from effectively participating in the creative uses of disorder civilization reflects this unfortunate division


order           disorder

erisian magic ritual  the turkey curse

revealed by the apostle dr van van mojo as a specific counter to the evil
curse of greyface the turkey curse is here passed on to erisians everywhere
for their just protection

the turkey curse works  it is firmly grounded on the fact that greyface and
his followers absolutely require an aneristic setting to function and that a
timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize their foundation
the turkey curse is designed solely to counteract negative aneristic vibes
and if introduced into a neutral or positive aneristic setting like a poet
working out word rhythms it will prove harmless or at worst simply
annoying  it is not designed for use against negative eristic vibes
although it can be used as an eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes
into a misguided eristic setting  in this instance it would be the
responsibility of the erisian magician to manufacture the positive
vibrations if results are to be achieved  caution all magic is powerful
and requires courage and integrity on the part of the magician  this
ritual if misused can backfire  positive motivation is essential for
selfprotection

to perform the turkey curse

take a foot stance as if you were john l sullivan preparing for fisticuffs
face the particular greyfaced you wish to shortcircuit or towards the
direction of the negative aneristic vibration that you wish to neutralize
begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner and make motions with your
hands as though you were mandrake feeling up a sexy giantess  chant loudly
and clearly
gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble
the results will be instantly apparent



a primer for erisian evangelists by lord omar

the socratic approach is most successful when confronting the
ignorant  the socratic approach is what you call starting an argument by
asking questions  you approach the innocent and simply ask did you know
that gods name is eris and that he is a girl  if he should answer yes
then he probably is a fellow erisian and so you can forget it  if he says
no then quickly proceed to
the blind assertion and say well he is a girl and his name is
eris  shrewedly observe if the subject is convinced  if he is swear him
into the legion of dynamic discord before he changes his mind  if he does
not appear convinced then proceed to
the faith bit  but you must have faith  all is lost without
faith  i sure feel sorry for you if you dont have faith  and then add
the argument by fear and in an ominous voice ask do you know what
happens to those who deny goddess  if he hesitates dont tell him that he
will surely be reincarnated as a precious mao button and distributed to the
poor in the region of thud which would be a mean thing to say just shake
your head sadly and while wiping a tear from your eye go to
the first clause ploy wherein you point to all of the discord and
confusion in the world and exclaim well who the hell do you think did all
of this wise guy  if he says nobody just impersonal forces then
quickly respond with
the argument by semantical gymnastics and say that he is absolutely
right and that those impersonal forces are female and that her name is
eris  if he wonder of wonders still remains obstinate then finally
resort to
the figurative symbolism dodge and confide that sophisticated people
like himself recognize that eris is a figurative symbol for an ineffable
metaphysical reality and that the erisian movement is really more like a
poem than like a science and that he is liable to be turned into a precious
mao button and distributed to the poor in the region of thud if he does not
get hip  then put him on your mailing list


sink

a game

by ala hera el ns rayville apple panthers

sink is played by discordians and people of much ilk

purpose to sink object or an object or a thing
in water or mud or anything you can sink something in

rules sinking is allowd in any manner  to date ten pound chunks of mud
were used to sink a tobacco can  it is preferable to have a pit of water or
a hole to drop things in  but rivers  bays  gulfs  i dare say even
oceans can be used

turns are taken thusly  who somever gets the junk up and in the air first

duty  it shall be the duty of all persons playing sink to help find more
objects to sink once one object is sunk

upon sinking  the sinked shall yell i sank it or something equally as
thoughtful

naming of objects is some times desirable  the object is named by the
finder of such object and whoever sinks it can say for instance i sunk

dear brother mal2

in response to your request for unclassified agitprop to be inserted
in the new edition of principia hope the following will be of use  and
please stop bothering us with your incessant letters

episkopos mordecai keeper of the notary sojac informs me that you
are welcome to reveal that our oldest extant records show us to have been
fully established in atlantis circa 18000 bc under kull the galley
slave who ascended to the throne of valusia  revived by pelias of koth
circa 10000 bc  possibly it was he who taught the innerteachings to
conan of cimmeria after conan became king of aquilonia  first brought to
the western hemisphere by conan and taught to mayan priesthood conan is
quetzlcoatl  that was 4 ahua 8 cumhu mayan date  revived by abdul
alhazred in his infamous al azif circa 800 ad  al azif translated into
latin by olaus wormius 1132 ad as the necronomicon  in 1090 ad was
the founding of the ismaelian sect hashishim by hassan i sabbah with
secret teachings based on alhazred pelias and kull  founding of the
illuminated ones of bavaria by adam weishaupt on may 1 1776  he based it
on the others  weishaupt brought it to the united states during the period
that he was impersonating george washington and it was he who was the man
in black who gave the design for the great seal to jefferson in the garden
that night  the illuminated tradition is now of course in the hands of
the ancient illuminated seers of bavaria aisb headquartered here in
the united states

our teachings are not need i remind you available for publication
no harm though in admitting that some of them can be found disguised in
joyces finnegans wake burroughs nova express the king james translation
of the holy bible though not the latin or hebrew and the blue book  not
to speak of ben franklins private papers  but we are still suppressing
those

considering current developmentsyou know the ones i speak ofit
has been decided to reveal a few more of our front organizations  your
publication is timely so mention that in addition to the old fronts like
the masons the rothchild banks and the federal reserve system we now have
significant control of the federal bureau of investigation since hoover
died last year but that is still secret the students for a democratic
society the communist party usa the american anarchist assn the junior
chamber of commerce the black lotus society the republican party the john
dillinger die for you society and the camp fire girls  it is still useful
to continue the sham of the birchers that we are seeking world domination
so do not reveal that political and economic control was generally complete
several generations ago and that we are just playing with the world for a
while until civilization advances sufficiently for phase five

in fact you might still push vennards the federal reserve hoax
since the babylonian captivity there has existed a determined behindthe
scenes underthetable atheistic satanic antichristian forceworshipers
of mamonwhose undying purpose is world control through the control of
money  july 1 1776 correct that to may 1st vennard cant get anything
right the serpent raised its head in the underground secret society known
as the illuminati founded by adam weishaupt  there is considerable
documentary evidence to prove all revolutions wars depressions strikes
and chaos stem from this source etc etc you know the stuff

the general location of our us hq incidentally has been nearly
exposed and so we will be moving for the first time this century what a
drag  if you want you can reveal that it is located deep in the
labyrinth of sewers beneath dealy plaza in dallas and is presided over by
the dealy lama  inclosed are some plans for several new potential
locations  please review and add any comments you feel pertinent
especially regarding the eristic propensity of the pentagon site

oh and we have some good news for you brother mal  you know that
zambian cybernetics genius who joined us  well he has secretly co
ordinated the fbi computers with the zurich system and our theoriticians are
in ecstasy over the new information coming out  look if you people out
there can keep from blowing yourselves up for only two more generations
then we will finally have it  after 20000 years kulls dream will be
realized  we can hardly believe it  but the outcome is certain given the
time  our grandchildren mal  if civilization makes it through this
crises our grandchildren will live in a world of authentic freedom and
authentic harmony and authentic satisfaction  i hope im alive to see it
mal success is in our grasp  twenty thousand years

ah i get spaced just thinking about it  good luck on the
principia

salvation from an ugly and barbarous existence that is the result of taking
order so seriously and so seriously fearing contrary orders and disorder
that games are taken as more important than life rather than taking life as
the art of playing games

to this end we propose that man develop his innate love for disorder and
play with the goddess eris  and know that it is a joyful play and that
thereby can be revoked the curse of greyface

if you can master nonsense as well as you have already learned to master
sense then each will expose the other for what it is absurdity  from that
moment of illumination a man begins to be free regardless of his
surroundings  he becomes free to play order games and change them at will
he becomes free to play disorder games just for the hell of it  he becomes
free to play neither or both  and as the master of his own games he plays
without fear and therefore without frustration and therefore with good
will in his soul and love in his being

and when men become free then mankind will be free
may you be free of the curse of greyface
may the goddess put twinkles in your eyes
may you have the knowledge of a sage
and the wisdom of a child
hail eris                                              tai

the last word
the foregoing document was revealed to mal2 by the goddess herself through
many consultations with her within his pineal gland  it is guaranteed to be
the word of goddess  however it is only fair to state that goddess doesnt
always say the same thing to each listener and that other episkoposes are
sometimes told quite different things in their revelations which are also
the word of goddess  consequently if you prefer a discordian sect other
than poee then none of these truths are binding and it is a rotten shame
that you have read all the way down to the very last word


discordian society
dedicated to an advanced
understanding  of the paraphysical
manifestations of everyday chaos

did you know that you have a lopsided pineal gland

well probably you do have one and its unfortunate because lopsided pineal
glands have perverted the free spirit of man and subverted life into a
frustrating unhappy and hopeless mess

fortunately you have before you a handbook that will show you how to
discover your salvation through eris the goddess of confusion  it will
advise you how to balance your pineal gland and reach spiritual
illumination  and it will teach you how to turn your miserable mess into a
beautiful joyful and splendid one
