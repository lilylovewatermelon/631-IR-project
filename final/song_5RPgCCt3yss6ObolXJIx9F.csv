a withered past and a blurry future
my hearts on an auction it goes out to the highest bid
i live too fast and i know i will lose her
but there is an option to die is to live in her head

prechorus
so ill hang on never let go
i dug this pain into my chest its dead

chorus
one last chance to reverse this curse
you stole my heart but i had it first
and now i see youve got something to prove
and nothing to lose so let me tell you the truth

verse 2
a deadly wish but it shouldve come sooner
a corpse in a funeral that i would never attend
there is a light on in the back of this house
but youre not around to die is to live in her head

prechorus
so ill hang on never let go
i dug this pain into my chest its dead

out to the ones that fall in love
and to the girl
that filled my dark

last night i had the weirdest dream
that you and i drove up the darkest street
always felt it never had it always felt it never had it
passing through these city lights
always felt it never had it always felt it never had it
closure for the kids that died

chorus
one last chance to reverse this curse
you stole my heart but i had it first
and now i see youve got something to prove
and nothing to lose so let me tell you the truth

and nothing to lose so let me tell you the truth
