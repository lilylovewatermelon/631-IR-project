        the bottoms succeeded to hell row hell row was a block of thatched bulging cottages that stood by the brookside on greenhill lane there lived the colliers who worked in the little ginpits two fields away the brook ran under the alder trees scarcely soiled by these small mines whose coal was drawn to the surface by donkeys that plodded wearily in a circle round a gin and all over the countryside were these same pits some of which had been worked in the time of charles ii the few colliers and the donkeys burrowing down like ants into the earth making queer mounds and little black places among the cornfields and the meadows and the cottages of these coalminers in blocks and pairs here and there together with odd farms and homes of the stockingers straying over the parish formed the village of bestwood

        then some sixty years ago a sudden change took place ginpits were elbowed aside by the large mines of the financiers the coal and iron field of nottinghamshire and derbyshire was discovered carston waite and co appeared amid tremendous excitement lord palmerston formally opened the companys first mine at spinney park on the edge of sherwood forest

        about this time the notorious hell row which through growing old had acquired an evil reputation was burned down and much dirt was cleansed away

        carston waite  co found they had struck on a good thing so down the valleys of the brooks from selby and nuttall new mines were sunk until soon there were six pits working from nuttall high up on the sandstone among the woods the railway ran past the ruined priory of the carthusians and past robin hoods well down to spinney park then on to minton a large mine among cornfields from minton across the farmlands of the valleyside to bunkers hill branching off there and running north to beggarlee and selby that looks over at crich and the hills of derbyshire six mines like black studs on the countryside linked by a loop of fine chain the railway

        to accommodate the regiments of miners carston waite and co built the squares great quadrangles of dwellings on the hillside of bestwood and then in the brook valley on the site of hell row they erected the bottoms

        the bottoms consisted of six blocks of miners dwellings two rows of three like the dots on a blanksix domino and twelve houses in a block this double row of dwellings sat at the foot of the rather sharp slope from bestwood and looked out from the attic windows at least on the slow climb of the valley towards selby

        the houses themselves were substantial and very decent one could walk all round seeing little front gardens with auriculas and saxifrage in the shadow of the bottom block sweetwilliams and pinks in the sunny top block seeing neat front windows little porches little privet hedges and dormer windows for the attics but that was outside that was the view on to the uninhabited parlours of all the colliers wives the dwellingroom the kitchen was at the back of the house facing inward between the blocks looking at a scrubby back garden and then at the ashpits and between the rows between the long lines of ashpits went the alley where the children played and the women gossiped and the men smoked so the actual conditions of living in the bottoms that was so well built and that looked so nice were quite unsavoury because people must live in the kitchen and the kitchens opened on to that nasty alley of ashpits

        mrs morel was not anxious to move into the bottoms which was already twelve years old and on the downward path when she descended to it from bestwood but it was the best she could do moreover she had an end house in one of the top blocks and thus had only one neighbour on the other side an extra strip of garden and having an end house she enjoyed a kind of aristocracy among the other women of the between houses because her rent was five shillings and sixpence instead of five shillings a week but this superiority in station was not much consolation to mrs morel

        she was thirtyone years old and had been married eight years a rather small woman of delicate mould but resolute bearing she shrank a little from the first contact with the bottoms women she came down in the july and in the september expected her third baby

        her husband was a miner they had only been in their new home three weeks when the wakes or fair began morel she knew was sure to make a holiday of it he went off early on the monday morning the day of the fair the two children were highly excited william a boy of seven fled off immediately after breakfast to prowl round the wakes ground leaving annie who was only five to whine all morning to go also mrs morel did her work she scarcely knew her neighbours yet and knew no one with whom to trust the little girl so she promised to take her to the wakes after dinner

        william appeared at halfpast twelve he was a very active lad fairhaired freckled with a touch of the dane or norwegian about him

        can i have my dinner mother he cried rushing in with his cap on cause it begins at halfpast one the man says so
        you can have your dinner as soon as its done replied the mother

        isnt it done he cried his blue eyes staring at her in indignation then im goin beout it

        youll do nothing of the sort it will be done in five minutes it is only halfpast twelve

        theyll be beginnin the boy half cried half shouted

        you wont die if they do said the mother besides its only halfpast twelve so youve a full hour

        the lad began hastily to lay the table and directly the three sat down they were eating batterpudding and jam when the boy jumped off his chair and stood perfectly stiff some distance away could be heard the first small braying of a merrygoround and the tooting of a horn his face quivered as he looked at his mother

        i told you he said running to the dresser for his cap

        take your pudding in your hand—and its only five past one so you were wrong—you havent got your twopence cried the mother in a breath

        the boy came back bitterly disappointed for his twopence then went off without a word

        i want to go i want to go said annie beginning to cry

        well and you shall go whining wizzening little stick said the mother and later in the afternoon she trudged up the hill under the tall hedge with her child the hay was gathered from the fields and cattle were turned on to the eddish it was warm peaceful

        mrs morel did not like the wakes there were two sets of horses one going by steam one pulled round by a pony three organs were grinding and there came odd cracks of pistolshots fearful screeching of the cocoanut mans rattle shouts of the aunt sally man screeches from the peepshow lady the mother perceived her son gazing enraptured outside the lion wallace booth at the pictures of this famous lion that had killed a negro and maimed for life two white men she left him alone and went to get annie a spin of toffee presently the lad stood in front of her wildly excited

        you never said you was coming—isnt the a lot of things—that lions killed three men—ive spent my tuppence—an look here
        he pulled from his pocket two eggcups with pink mossroses on them

        i got these from that stall where yave ter get them marbles in them holes an i got these two in two goesaepenny a gotheyve got mossroses on look here i wanted these

        she knew he wanted them for her

        hm she said pleased they are pretty

        shall you carry em cause im frightened o breakin em

        he was tipful of excitement now she had come led her about the ground showed her everything then at the peepshow she explained the pictures in a sort of story to which he listened as if spellbound he would not leave her all the time he stuck close to her bristling with a small boys pride of her for no other woman looked such a lady as she did in her little black bonnet and her cloak she smiled when she saw women she knew when she was tired she said to her son

        well are you coming now or later

        are you goin aready he cried his face full of reproach

        already it is past four i know

        what are you goin aready for he lamented

        you neednt come if you dont want she said

        and she went slowly away with her little girl whilst her son stood watching her cut to the heart to let her go and yet unable to leave the wakes as she crossed the open ground in front of the moon and stars she heard men shouting and smelled the beer and hurried a little thinking her husband was probably in the bar

        at about halfpast six her son came home tired now rather pale and somewhat wretched he was miserable though he did not know it because he had let her go alone since she had gone he had not enjoyed his wakes
        has my dad been he asked

        no said the mother

        hes helping to wait at the moon and stars i seed him through that black tin stuff wi holes in on the window wi his sleeves rolled up

        ha exclaimed the mother shortly hes got no money an hell be satisfied if he gets his lowance whether they give him more or not

        when the light was fading and mrs morel could see no more to sew she rose and went to the door everywhere was the sound of excitement the restlessness of the holiday that at last infected her she went out into the side garden women were coming home from the wakes the children hugging a white lamb with green legs or a wooden horse occasionally a man lurched past almost as full as he could carry sometimes a good husband came along with his family peacefully but usually the women and children were alone the stayathome mothers stood gossiping at the corners of the alley as the twilight sank folding their arms under their white aprons

        mrs morel was alone but she was used to it her son and her little girl slept upstairs so it seemed her home was there behind her fixed and stable but she felt wretched with the coming child the world seemed a dreary place where nothing else would happen for her—at least until william grew up but for herself nothing but this dreary endurance—till the children grew up and the children she could not afford to have this third she did not want it the father was serving beer in a public house swilling himself drunk she despised him and was tied to him this coming child was too much for her if it were not for william and annie she was sick of it the struggle with poverty and ugliness and meanness

        she went into the front garden feeling too heavy to take herself out yet unable to stay indoors the heat suffocated her and looking ahead the prospect of her life made her feel as if she were buried alive

        the front garden was a small square with a privet hedge there she stood trying to soothe herself with the scent of flowers and the fading beautiful evening opposite her small gate was the stile that led uphill under the tall hedge between the burning glow of the cut pastures the sky overhead throbbed and pulsed with light the glow sank quickly off the field the earth and the hedges smoked dusk as it grew dark a ruddy glare came out on the hilltop and out of the glare the diminished commotion of the fair

        sometimes down the trough of darkness formed by the path under the hedges men came lurching home one young man lapsed into a run down the steep bit that ended the hill and went with a crash into the stile mrs morel shuddered he picked himself up swearing viciously rather pathetically as if he thought the stile had wanted to hurt him

        she went indoors wondering if things were never going to alter she was beginning by now to realise that they would not she seemed so far away from her girlhood she wondered if it were the same person walking heavily up the back garden at the bottoms as had run so lightly up the breakwater at sheerness ten years before

        what have i to do with it she said to herself what have i to do with all this even the child i am going to have it doesnt seem as if i were taken into account

        sometimes life takes hold of one carries the body along accomplishes ones history and yet is not real but leaves oneself as it were slurred over

        i wait mrs morel said to herself—i wait and what i wait for can never come

        then she straightened the kitchen lit the lamp mended the fire looked out the washing for the next day and put it to soak after which she sat down to her sewing through the long hours her needle flashed regularly through the stuff occasionally she sighed moving to relieve herself and all the time she was thinking how to make the most of what she had for the childrens sakes

        at halfpast eleven her husband came his cheeks were very red and very shiny above his black moustache his head nodded slightly he was pleased with himself

        oh oh waitin for me lass ive bin elpin anthony an whats think hes gen me nowt br a lousy haefcrown an thats ivry penny—

        he thinks youve made the rest up in beer she said shortly

        an i avent—that i avent you blieve me ive ad very little this day i have an all his voice went tender here an i browt thee a bit o brandysnap an a cocoanut for th children he laid the gingerbread and the cocoanut a hairy object on the table nay tha niver said thankyer for nowt i thy life did ter

        as a compromise she picked up the cocoanut and shook it to see if it had any milk

        its a good un you may back yer life o that i got it fra bill hodgkisson bill i says tha non wants them three nuts does ter arena ter for giein me one for my bit of a lad an wench i ham walter my lad e says tae which on em ters a mind an so i took one an thanked im i didnt like ter shake it afore is eyes but e says thad better mae sure its a good un walt an so yer see i knowed it was hes a nice chap is bill hodgkisson es a nice chap

        a man will part with anything so long as hes drunk and youre drunk along with him said mrs morel

        eh tha mucky little ussy whos drunk i shd like ter know said morel he was extraordinarily pleased with himself because of his days helping to wait in the moon and stars he chattered on

        mrs morel very tired and sick of his babble went to bed as quickly as possible while he raked the fire

        mrs morel came of a good old burgher family famous independents who had fought with colonel hutchinson and who remained stout congregationalists her grandfather had gone bankrupt in the lacemarket at a time when so many lacemanufacturers were ruined in nottingham her father george coppard was an engineer—a large handsome haughty man proud of his fair skin and blue eyes but more proud still of his integrity gertrude resembled her mother in her small build but her temper proud and unyielding she had from the coppards

        george coppard was bitterly galled by his own poverty he became foreman of the engineers in the dockyard at sheerness mrs morel—gertrude—was the second daughter she favoured her mother loved her mother best of all but she had the coppards clear defiant blue eyes and their broad brow she remembered to have hated her fathers overbearing manner towards her gentle humorous kindlysouled mother she remembered running over the breakwater at sheerness and finding the boat she remembered to have been petted and flattered by all the men when she had gone to the dockyard for she was a delicate rather proud child she remembered the funny old mistress whose assistant she had become whom she had loved to help in the private school and she still had the bible that john field had given her she used to walk home from chapel with john field when she was nineteen he was the son of a welltodo tradesman had been to college in london and was to devote himself to business

        she could always recall in detail a september sunday afternoon when they had sat under the vine at the back of her fathers house the sun came through the chinks of the vineleaves and made beautiful patterns like a lace scarf falling on her and on him some of the leaves were clean yellow like yellow flat flowers

        now sit still he had cried now your hair i dont know what it is like its as bright as copper and gold as red as burnt copper and it has gold threads where the sun shines on it fancy their saying its brown your mother calls it mousecolour

        she had met his brilliant eyes but her clear face scarcely showed the elation which rose within her

        but you say you dont like business she pursued

        i dont i hate it he cried hotly

        and you would like to go into the ministry she half implored

        i should i should love it if i thought i could make a firstrate preacher

        then why dont you—why dont you her voice rang with defiance if i were a man nothing would stop me

        she held her head erect he was rather timid before her

        but my fathers so stiffnecked he means to put me into the business and i know hell do it

        but if youre a man she had cried

        being a man isnt everything he replied frowning with puzzled helplessness

        now as she moved about her work at the bottoms with some experience of what being a man meant she knew that it was not everything

        at twenty owing to her health she had left sheerness her father had retired home to nottingham john fields father had been ruined the son had gone as a teacher in norwood she did not hear of him until two years later she made determined inquiry he had married his landlady a woman of forty a widow with property

        and still mrs morel preserved john fields bible she did not now believe him to be—well she understood pretty well what he might or might not have been so she preserved his bible and kept his memory intact in her heart for her own sake to her dying day for thirtyfive years she did not speak of him

        when she was twentythree years old she met at a christmas party a young man from the erewash valley morel was then twentyseven years old he was well setup erect and very smart he had wavy black hair that shone again and a vigorous black beard that had never been shaved his cheeks were ruddy and his red moist mouth was noticeable because he laughed so often and so heartily he had that rare thing a rich ringing laugh gertrude coppard had watched him fascinated he was so full of colour and animation his voice ran so easily into comic grotesque he was so ready and so pleasant with everybody her own father had a rich fund of humour but it was satiric this mans was different soft nonintellectual warm a kind of gambolling

        she herself was opposite she had a curious receptive mind which found much pleasure and amusement in listening to other folk she was clever in leading folk to talk she loved ideas and was considered very intellectual what she liked most of all was an argument on religion or philosophy or politics with some educated man this she did not often enjoy so she always had people tell her about themselves finding her pleasure so

        in her person she was rather small and delicate with a large brow and dropping bunches of brown silk curls her blue eyes were very straight honest and searching she had the beautiful hands of the coppards her dress was always subdued she wore dark blue silk with a peculiar silver chain of silver scallops this and a heavy brooch of twisted gold was her only ornament she was still perfectly intact deeply religious and full of beautiful candour

        walter morel seemed melted away before her she was to the miner that thing of mystery and fascination a lady when she spoke to him it was with a southern pronunciation and a purity of english which thrilled him to hear she watched him he danced well as if it were natural and joyous in him to dance his grandfather was a french refugee who had married an english barmaid—if it had been a marriage gertrude coppard watched the young miner as he danced a certain subtle exultation like glamour in his movement and his face the flower of his body ruddy with tumbled black hair and laughing alike whatever partner he bowed above she thought him rather wonderful never having met anyone like him her father was to her the type of all men and george coppard proud in his bearing handsome and rather bitter who preferred theology in reading and who drew near in sympathy only to one man the apostle paul who was harsh in government and in familiarity ironic who ignored all sensuous pleasure—he was very different from the miner gertrude herself was rather contemptuous of dancing she had not the slightest inclination towards that accomplishment and had never learned even a roger de coverley she was puritan like her father highminded and really stern therefore the dusky golden softness of this mans sensuous flame of life that flowed off his flesh like the flame from a candle not baffled and gripped into incandescence by thought and spirit as her life was seemed to her something wonderful beyond her

        he came and bowed above her a warmth radiated through her as if she had drunk wine

        now do come and have this one wi me he said caressively its easy you know im pining to see you dance

        she had told him before she could not dance she glanced at his humility and smiled her smile was very beautiful it moved the man so that he forgot everything

        no i wont dance she said softly her words came clean and ringing

        not knowing what he was doing—he often did the right thing by instinct—he sat beside her inclining reverentially

        but you mustnt miss your dance she reproved

        nay i dont want to dance that—its not one as i care about

        yet you invited me to it

        he laughed very heartily at this

        i never thought o that thart not long in taking the curl out of me

        it was her turn to laugh quickly

        you dont look as if youd come much uncurled she said

        im like a pigs tail i curl because i canna help it he laughed rather boisterously

        and you are a miner she exclaimed in surprise

        yes i went down when i was ten

        she looked at him in wondering dismay

        when you were ten and wasnt it very hard she asked

        you soon get used to it you live like th mice an you pop out at night to see whats going on

        it makes me feel blind she frowned

        like a moudiwarp he laughed yi an theres some chaps as does go round like moudiwarps he thrust his face forward in the blind snoutlike way of a mole seeming to sniff and peer for direction they dun though he protested naively tha niver seed such a way they get in but tha mun let me tae thee down some time an tha can see for thysen

        she looked at him startled this was a new tract of life suddenly opened before her she realised the life of the miners hundreds of them toiling below earth and coming up at evening he seemed to her noble he risked his life daily and with gaiety she looked at him with a touch of appeal in her pure humility

        shouldnt ter like it he asked tenderly appen not it ud dirty thee

        she had never been theed and thoud before

        the next christmas they were married and for three months she was perfectly happy for six months she was very happy

        he had signed the pledge and wore the blue ribbon of a teetotaller he was nothing if not showy they lived she thought in his own house it was small but convenient enough and quite nicely furnished with solid worthy stuff that suited her honest soul the women her neighbours were rather foreign to her and morels mother and sisters were apt to sneer at her ladylike ways but she could perfectly well live by herself so long as she had her husband close

        sometimes when she herself wearied of lovetalk she tried to open her heart seriously to him she saw him listen deferentially but without understanding this killed her efforts at a finer intimacy and she had flashes of fear sometimes he was restless of an evening it was not enough for him just to be near her she realised she was glad when he set himself to little jobs

        he was a remarkably handy man—could make or mend anything so she would say

        i do like that coalrake of your mothers—it is small and natty

        does ter my wench well i made that so i can make thee one

        what why its a steel one

        an what if it is tha slt hae one very similar if not exactly same

        she did not mind the mess nor the hammering and noise he was busy and happy

        but in the seventh month when she was brushing his sunday coat she felt papers in the breast pocket and seized with a sudden curiosity took them out to read he very rarely wore the frockcoat he was married in and it had not occurred to her before to feel curious concerning the papers they were the bills of the household furniture still unpaid

        look here she said at night after he was washed and had had his dinner i found these in the pocket of your weddingcoat havent you settled the bills yet

        no i havent had a chance

        but you told me all was paid i had better go into nottingham on saturday and settle them i dont like sitting on another mans chairs and eating from an unpaid table

        he did not answer

        i can have your bankbook cant i

        tha can hae it for what good itll be to thee

        i thought— she began he had told her he had a good bit of money left over but she realised it was no use asking questions she sat rigid with bitterness and indignation

        the next day she went down to see his mother

        didnt you buy the furniture for walter she asked

        yes i did tartly retorted the elder woman

        and how much did he give you to pay for it

        the elder woman was stung with fine indignation

        eighty pound if youre so keen on knowin she replied

        eighty pounds but there are fortytwo pounds still owing

        i cant help that

        but where has it all gone

        youll find all the papers i think if you look—beside ten pound as he owed me an six pound as the wedding cost down here

        six pounds echoed gertrude morel it seemed to her monstrous that after her own father had paid so heavily for her wedding six pounds more should have been squandered in eating and drinking at walters parents house at his expense

        and how much has he sunk in his houses she asked

        his houses—which houses

        gertrude morel went white to the lips he had told her the house he lived in and the next one was his own

        i thought the house we live in— she began

        theyre my houses those two said the motherinlaw and not clear either its as much as i can do to keep the mortgage interest paid

        gertrude sat white and silent she was her father now

        then we ought to be paying you rent she said coldly

        walter is paying me rent replied the mother

        and what rent asked gertrude

        six and six a week retorted the mother

        it was more than the house was worth gertrude held her head erect looked straight before her

        it is lucky to be you said the elder woman bitingly to have a husband as takes all the worry of the money and leaves you a free hand

        the young wife was silent

        she said very little to her husband but her manner had changed towards him something in her proud honourable soul had crystallised out hard as rock

        when october came in she thought only of christmas two years ago at christmas she had met him last christmas she had married him this christmas she would bear him a child

        you dont dance yourself do you missis asked her nearest neighbour in october when there was great talk of opening a dancingclass over the brick and tile inn at bestwood

        no—i never had the least inclination to mrs morel replied

        fancy an how funny as you should ha married your mester you know hes quite a famous one for dancing

        i didnt know he was famous laughed mrs morel

        yea he is though why he ran that dancingclass in the miners arms clubroom for over five year

        did he

        yes he did the other woman was defiant an it was thronged every tuesday and thursday an satday—an there was carryinson accordin to all accounts

        this kind of thing was gall and bitterness to mrs morel and she had a fair share of it the women did not spare her at first for she was superior though she could not help it

        he began to be rather late in coming home

        theyre working very late now arent they she said to her washerwoman

        no later than they allers do i dont think but they stop to have their pint at ellens an they get talkin an there you are dinner stone cold—an it serves em right

        but mr morel does not take any drink

        the woman dropped the clothes looked at mrs morel then went on with her work saying nothing

        gertrude morel was very ill when the boy was born morel was good to her as good as gold but she felt very lonely miles away from her own people she felt lonely with him now and his presence only made it more intense

        the boy was small and frail at first but he came on quickly he was a beautiful child with dark gold ringlets and darkblue eyes which changed gradually to a clear grey his mother loved him passionately he came just when her own bitterness of disillusion was hardest to bear when her faith in life was shaken and her soul felt dreary and lonely she made much of the child and the father was jealous

        at last mrs morel despised her husband she turned to the child she turned from the father he had begun to neglect her the novelty of his own home was gone he had no grit she said bitterly to herself what he felt just at the minute that was all to him he could not abide by anything there was nothing at the back of all his show

        there began a battle between the husband and wife—a fearful bloody battle that ended only with the death of one she fought to make him undertake his own responsibilities to make him fulfill his obligations but he was too different from her his nature was purely sensuous and she strove to make him moral religious she tried to force him to face things he could not endure it—it drove him out of his mind

        while the baby was still tiny the fathers temper had become so irritable that it was not to be trusted the child had only to give a little trouble when the man began to bully a little more and the hard hands of the collier hit the baby then mrs morel loathed her husband loathed him for days and he went out and drank and she cared very little what he did only on his return she scathed him with her satire

        the estrangement between them caused him knowingly or unknowingly grossly to offend her where he would not have done

        william was only one year old and his mother was proud of him he was so pretty she was not well off now but her sisters kept the boy in clothes then with his little white hat curled with an ostrich feather and his white coat he was a joy to her the twining wisps of hair clustering round his head mrs morel lay listening one sunday morning to the chatter of the father and child downstairs then she dozed off when she came downstairs a great fire glowed in the grate the room was hot the breakfast was roughly laid and seated in his armchair against the chimneypiece sat morel rather timid and standing between his legs the child—cropped like a sheep with such an odd round poll—looking wondering at her and on a newspaper spread out upon the hearthrug a myriad of crescentshaped curls like the petals of a marigold scattered in the reddening firelight

        mrs morel stood still it was her first baby she went very white and was unable to speak

        what dost think o im morel laughed uneasily

        she gripped her two fists lifted them and came forward morel shrank back

        i could kill you i could she said she choked with rage her two fists uplifted

        yer non want ter make a wench on im morel said in a frightened tone bending his head to shield his eyes from hers his attempt at laughter had vanished

        the mother looked down at the jagged closeclipped head of her child she put her hands on his hair and stroked and fondled his head

        oh—my boy she faltered her lip trembled her face broke and snatching up the child she buried her face in his shoulder and cried painfully she was one of those women who cannot cry whom it hurts as it hurts a man it was like ripping something out of her her sobbing

        morel sat with his elbows on his knees his hands gripped together till the knuckles were white he gazed in the fire feeling almost stunned as if he could not breathe

        presently she came to an end soothed the child and cleared away the breakfasttable she left the newspaper littered with curls spread upon the hearthrug at last her husband gathered it up and put it at the back of the fire she went about her work with closed mouth and very quiet morel was subdued he crept about wretchedly and his meals were a misery that day she spoke to him civilly and never alluded to what he had done but he felt something final had happened

        afterwards she said she had been silly that the boys hair would have had to be cut sooner or later in the end she even brought herself to say to her husband it was just as well he had played barber when he did but she knew and morel knew that that act had caused something momentous to take place in her soul she remembered the scene all her life as one in which she had suffered the most intensely

        this act of masculine clumsiness was the spear through the side of her love for morel before while she had striven against him bitterly she had fretted after him as if he had gone astray from her now she ceased to fret for his love he was an outsider to her this made life much more bearable

        nevertheless she still continued to strive with him she still had her high moral sense inherited from generations of puritans it was now a religious instinct and she was almost a fanatic with him because she loved him or had loved him if he sinned she tortured him if he drank and lied was often a poltroon sometimes a knave she wielded the lash unmercifully

        the pity was she was too much his opposite she could not be content with the little he might be she would have him the much that he ought to be so in seeking to make him nobler than he could be she destroyed him she injured and hurt and scarred herself but she lost none of her worth she also had the children

        he drank rather heavily though not more than many miners and always beer so that whilst his health was affected it was never injured the weekend was his chief carouse he sat in the miners arms until turningout time every friday every saturday and every sunday evening on monday and tuesday he had to get up and reluctantly leave towards ten oclock sometimes he stayed at home on wednesday and thursday evenings or was only out for an hour he practically never had to miss work owing to his drinking

        but although he was very steady at work his wages fell off he was blabmouthed a tonguewagger authority was hateful to him therefore he could only abuse the pitmanagers he would say in the palmerston

        th gaffer come down to our stall this morning an e says you know walter this erell not do what about these props an i says to him why what art talkin about what dst mean about th props itll never do this ere e says youll be havin th roof in one o these days an i says thad better stan on a bit o clunch then an hold it up wi thy ead so e wor that mad e cossed an e swore an tother chaps they did laugh morel was a good mimic he imitated the managers fat squeaky voice with its attempt at good english

        i shant have it walter who knows more about it me or you so i says ive niver fun out how much tha knows alfred itll appen carry thee ter bed an back

        so morel would go on to the amusement of his boon companions and some of this would be true the pitmanager was not an educated man he had been a boy along with morel so that while the two disliked each other they more or less took each other for granted but alfred charlesworth did not forgive the butty these publichouse sayings consequently although morel was a good miner sometimes earning as much as five pounds a week when he married he came gradually to have worse and worse stalls where the coal was thin and hard to get and unprofitable

        also in summer the pits are slack often on bright sunny mornings the men are seen trooping home again at ten eleven or twelve oclock no empty trucks stand at the pitmouth the women on the hillside look across as they shake the hearthrug against the fence and count the wagons the engine is taking along the line up the valley and the children as they come from school at dinnertime looking down the fields and seeing the wheels on the headstocks standing say

        mintons knocked off my dadll be at home

        and there is a sort of shadow over all women and children and men because money will be short at the end of the week

        morel was supposed to give his wife thirty shillings a week to provide everything—rent food clothes clubs insurance doctors occasionally if he were flush he gave her thirtyfive but these occasions by no means balanced those when he gave her twentyfive in winter with a decent stall the miner might earn fifty or fiftyfive shillings a week then he was happy on friday night saturday and sunday he spent royally getting rid of his sovereign or thereabouts and out of so much he scarcely spared the children an extra penny or bought them a pound of apples it all went in drink in the bad times matters were more worrying but he was not so often drunk so that mrs morel used to say

        im not sure i wouldnt rather be short for when hes flush there isnt a minute of peace

        if he earned forty shillings he kept ten from thirtyfive he kept five from thirtytwo he kept four from twentyeight he kept three from twentyfour he kept two from twenty he kept oneandsix from eighteen he kept a shilling from sixteen he kept sixpence he never saved a penny and he gave his wife no opportunity of saving instead she had occasionally to pay his debts not publichouse debts for those never were passed on to the women but debts when he had bought a canary or a fancy walkingstick

        at the wakes time morel was working badly and mrs morel was trying to save against her confinement so it galled her bitterly to think he should be out taking his pleasure and spending money whilst she remained at home harassed there were two days holiday on the tuesday morning morel rose early he was in good spirits quite early before six oclock she heard him whistling away to himself downstairs he had a pleasant way of whistling lively and musical he nearly always whistled hymns he had been a choirboy with a beautiful voice and had taken solos in southwell cathedral his morning whistling alone betrayed it

        his wife lay listening to him tinkering away in the garden his whistling ringing out as he sawed and hammered away it always gave her a sense of warmth and peace to hear him thus as she lay in bed the children not yet awake in the bright early morning happy in his mans fashion

        at nine oclock while the children with bare legs and feet were sitting playing on the sofa and the mother was washing up he came in from his carpentry his sleeves rolled up his waistcoat hanging open he was still a goodlooking man with black wavy hair and a large black moustache his face was perhaps too much inflamed and there was about him a look almost of peevishness but now he was jolly he went straight to the sink where his wife was washing up

        what are thee there he said boisterously sluthe off an let me wesh mysen

        you may wait till ive finished said his wife

        oh mun i an what if i shonna

        this goodhumoured threat amused mrs morel

        then you can go and wash yourself in the softwater tub

        ha i can an a tha mucky little ussy

        with which he stood watching her a moment then went away to wait for her

        when he chose he could still make himself again a real gallant usually he preferred to go out with a scarf round his neck now however he made a toilet there seemed so much gusto in the way he puffed and swilled as he washed himself so much alacrity with which he hurried to the mirror in the kitchen and bending because it was too low for him scrupulously parted his wet black hair that it irritated mrs morel he put on a turndown collar a black bow and wore his sunday tailcoat as such he looked spruce and what his clothes would not do his instinct for making the most of his good looks would

        at halfpast nine jerry purdy came to call for his pal jerry was morels bosom friend and mrs morel disliked him he was a tall thin man with a rather foxy face the kind of face that seems to lack eyelashes he walked with a stiff brittle dignity as if his head were on a wooden spring his nature was cold and shrewd generous where he intended to be generous he seemed to be very fond of morel and more or less to take charge of him

        mrs morel hated him she had known his wife who had died of consumption and who had at the end conceived such a violent dislike of her husband that if he came into her room it caused her haemorrhage none of which jerry had seemed to mind and now his eldest daughter a girl of fifteen kept a poor house for him and looked after the two younger children

        a mean wizzenhearted stick mrs morel said of him

        ive never known jerry mean in my life protested morel a openerhanded and more freer chap you couldnt find anywhere accordin to my knowledge

        openhanded to you retorted mrs morel but his fist is shut tight enough to his children poor things

        poor things and what for are they poor things i should like to know

        but mrs morel would not be appeased on jerrys score

        the subject of argument was seen craning his thin neck over the scullery curtain he caught mrs morels eye

        mornin missis mester in

        yes—he is

        jerry entered unasked and stood by the kitchen doorway he was not invited to sit down but stood there coolly asserting the rights of men and husbands

        a nice day he said to mrs morel

        yes

        grand out this morning—grand for a walk

        do you mean youre going for a walk she asked

        yes we mean walkin to nottingham he replied

        hm

        the two men greeted each other both glad jerry however full of assurance morel rather subdued afraid to seem too jubilant in presence of his wife but he laced his boots quickly with spirit they were going for a tenmile walk across the fields to nottingham climbing the hillside from the bottoms they mounted gaily into the morning at the moon and stars they had their first drink then on to the old spot then a long five miles of drought to carry them into bulwell to a glorious pint of bitter but they stayed in a field with some haymakers whose gallon bottle was full so that when they came in sight of the city morel was sleepy the town spread upwards before them smoking vaguely in the midday glare fridging the crest away to the south with spires and factory bulks and chimneys in the last field morel lay down under an oak tree and slept soundly for over an hour when he rose to go forward he felt queer

        the two had dinner in the meadows with jerrys sister then repaired to the punch bowl where they mixed in the excitement of pigeonracing morel never in his life played cards considering them as having some occult malevolent power—the devils pictures he called them but he was a master of skittles and of dominoes he took a challenge from a newark man on skittles all the men in the old long bar took sides betting either one way or the other morel took off his coat jerry held the hat containing the money the men at the tables watched some stood with their mugs in their hands morel felt his big wooden ball carefully then launched it he played havoc among the ninepins and won half a crown which restored him to solvency

        by seven oclock the two were in good condition they caught the 730 train home

        in the afternoon the bottoms was intolerable every inhabitant remaining was out of doors the women in twos and threes bareheaded and in white aprons gossiped in the alley between the blocks men having a rest between drinks sat on their heels and talked the place smelled stale the slate roofs glistered in the arid heat

        mrs morel took the little girl down to the brook in the meadows which were not more than two hundred yards away the water ran quickly over stones and broken pots mother and child leaned on the rail of the old sheepbridge watching up at the dippinghole at the other end of the meadow mrs morel could see the naked forms of boys flashing round the deep yellow water or an occasional bright figure dart glittering over the blackish stagnant meadow she knew william was at the dippinghole and it was the dread of her life lest he should get drowned annie played under the tall old hedge picking up alder cones that she called currants the child required much attention and the flies were teasing

        the children were put to bed at seven oclock then she worked awhile

        when walter morel and jerry arrived at bestwood they felt a load off their minds a railway journey no longer impended so they could put the finishing touches to a glorious day they entered the nelson with the satisfaction of returned travellers

        the next day was a workday and the thought of it put a damper on the mens spirits most of them moreover had spent their money some were already rolling dismally home to sleep in preparation for the morrow mrs morel listening to their mournful singing went indoors nine oclock passed and ten and still the pair had not returned on a doorstep somewhere a man was singing loudly in a drawl lead kindly light mrs morel was always indignant with the drunken men that they must sing that hymn when they got maudlin

        as if genevieve werent good enough she said

        the kitchen was full of the scent of boiled herbs and hops on the hob a large black saucepan steamed slowly mrs morel took a panchion a great bowl of thick red earth streamed a heap of white sugar into the bottom and then straining herself to the weight was pouring in the liquor

        just then morel came in he had been very jolly in the nelson but coming home had grown irritable he had not quite got over the feeling of irritability and pain after having slept on the ground when he was so hot and a bad conscience afflicted him as he neared the house he did not know he was angry but when the garden gate resisted his attempts to open it he kicked it and broke the latch he entered just as mrs morel was pouring the infusion of herbs out of the saucepan swaying slightly he lurched against the table the boiling liquor pitched mrs morel started back

        good gracious she cried coming home in his drunkenness

        comin home in his what he snarled his hat over his eye

        suddenly her blood rose in a jet

        say youre not drunk she flashed

        she had put down her saucepan and was stirring the sugar into the beer he dropped his two hands heavily on the table and thrust his face forwards at her

        say youre not drunk he repeated why nobody but a nasty little bitch like you ud ave such a thought

        he thrust his face forward at her

        theres money to bezzle with if theres money for nothing else

        ive not spent a twoshillin bit this day he said

        you dont get as drunk as a lord on nothing she replied and she cried flashing into sudden fury if youve been sponging on your beloved jerry why let him look after his children for they need it

        its a lie its a lie shut your face woman

        they were now at battlepitch each forgot everything save the hatred of the other and the battle between them she was fiery and furious as he they went on till he called her a liar

        no she cried starting up scarce able to breathe dont call me that—you the most despicable liar that ever walked in shoeleather she forced the last words out of suffocated lungs

        youre a liar he yelled banging the table with his fist youre a liar youre a liar

        she stiffened herself with clenched fists

        the house is filthy with you she cried

        then get out on it—its mine get out on it he shouted its me as brings th money whoam not thee its my house not thine then ger out ont—ger out ont

        and i would she cried suddenly shaken into tears of impotence ah wouldnt i wouldnt i have gone long ago but for those children ay havent i repented not going years ago when id only the one—suddenly drying into rage do you think its for you i stop—do you think id stop one minute for you

        go then he shouted beside himself go

        no she faced round no she cried loudly you shant have it all your own way you shant do all you like ive got those children to see to my word she laughed i should look well to leave them to you

        go he cried thickly lifting his fist he was afraid of her go

        i should be only too glad i should laugh laugh my lord if i could get away from you she replied

        he came up to her his red face with its bloodshot eyes thrust forward and gripped her arms she cried in fear of him struggled to be free coming slightly to himself panting he pushed her roughly to the outer door and thrust her forth slotting the bolt behind her with a bang then he went back into the kitchen dropped into his armchair his head bursting full of blood sinking between his knees thus he dipped gradually into a stupor from exhaustion and intoxication

        the moon was high and magnificent in the august night mrs morel seared with passion shivered to find herself out there in a great white light that fell cold on her and gave a shock to her inflamed soul she stood for a few moments helplessly staring at the glistening great rhubarb leaves near the door then she got the air into her breast she walked down the garden path trembling in every limb while the child boiled within her for a while she could not control her consciousness mechanically she went over the last scene then over it again certain phrases certain moments coming each time like a brand redhot down on her soul and each time she enacted again the past hour each time the brand came down at the same points till the mark was burnt in and the pain burnt out and at last she came to herself she must have been half an hour in this delirious condition then the presence of the night came again to her she glanced round in fear she had wandered to the side garden where she was walking up and down the path beside the currant bushes under the long wall the garden was a narrow strip bounded from the road that cut transversely between the blocks by a thick thorn hedge

        she hurried out of the side garden to the front where she could stand as if in an immense gulf of white light the moon streaming high in face of her the moonlight standing up from the hills in front and filling the valley where the bottoms crouched almost blindingly there panting and half weeping in reaction from the stress she murmured to herself over and over again the nuisance the nuisance

        she became aware of something about her with an effort she roused herself to see what it was that penetrated her consciousness the tall white lilies were reeling in the moonlight and the air was charged with their perfume as with a presence mrs morel gasped slightly in fear she touched the big pallid flowers on their petals then shivered they seemed to be stretching in the moonlight she put her hand into one white bin the gold scarcely showed on her fingers by moonlight she bent down to look at the binful of yellow pollen but it only appeared dusky then she drank a deep draught of the scent it almost made her dizzy

        mrs morel leaned on the garden gate looking out and she lost herself awhile she did not know what she thought except for a slight feeling of sickness and her consciousness in the child herself melted out like scent into the shiny pale air after a time the child too melted with her in the mixingpot of moonlight and she rested with the hills and lilies and houses all swum together in a kind of swoon

        when she came to herself she was tired for sleep languidly she looked about her the clumps of white phlox seemed like bushes spread with linen a moth ricochetted over them and right across the garden following it with her eye roused her a few whiffs of the raw strong scent of phlox invigorated her she passed along the path hesitating at the white rosebush it smelled sweet and simple she touched the white ruffles of the roses their fresh scent and cool soft leaves reminded her of the morningtime and sunshine she was very fond of them but she was tired and wanted to sleep in the mysterious outofdoors she felt forlorn

        there was no noise anywhere evidently the children had not been wakened or had gone to sleep again a train three miles away roared across the valley the night was very large and very strange stretching its hoary distances infinitely and out of the silvergrey fog of darkness came sounds vague and hoarse a corncrake not far off sound of a train like a sigh and distant shouts of men

        her quietened heart beginning to beat quickly again she hurried down the side garden to the back of the house softly she lifted the latch the door was still bolted and hard against her she rapped gently waited then rapped again she must not rouse the children nor the neighbours he must be asleep and he would not wake easily her heart began to burn to be indoors she clung to the doorhandle now it was cold she would take a chill and in her present condition

        putting her apron over her head and her arms she hurried again to the side garden to the window of the kitchen leaning on the sill she could just see under the blind her husbands arms spread out on the table and his black head on the board he was sleeping with his face lying on the table something in his attitude made her feel tired of things the lamp was burning smokily she could tell by the copper colour of the light she tapped at the window more and more noisily almost it seemed as if the glass would break still he did not wake up

        after vain efforts she began to shiver partly from contact with the stone and from exhaustion fearful always for the unborn child she wondered what she could do for warmth she went down to the coalhouse where there was an old hearthrug she had carried out for the ragman the day before this she wrapped over her shoulders it was warm if grimy then she walked up and down the garden path peeping every now and then under the blind knocking and telling herself that in the end the very strain of his position must wake him

        at last after about an hour she rapped long and low at the window gradually the sound penetrated to him when in despair she had ceased to tap she saw him stir then lift his face blindly the labouring of his heart hurt him into consciousness she rapped imperatively at the window he started awake instantly she saw his fists set and his eyes glare he had not a grain of physical fear if it had been twenty burglars he would have gone blindly for them he glared round bewildered but prepared to fight

        open the door walter she said coldly

        his hands relaxed it dawned on him what he had done his head dropped sullen and dogged she saw him hurry to the door heard the bolt chock he tried the latch it opened—and there stood the silvergrey night fearful to him after the tawny light of the lamp he hurried back

        when mrs morel entered she saw him almost running through the door to the stairs he had ripped his collar off his neck in his haste to be gone ere she came in and there it lay with bursten buttonholes it made her angry

        she warmed and soothed herself in her weariness forgetting everything she moved about at the little tasks that remained to be done set his breakfast rinsed his pitbottle put his pitclothes on the hearth to warm set his pitboots beside them put him out a clean scarf and snapbag and two apples raked the fire and went to bed he was already dead asleep his narrow black eyebrows were drawn up in a sort of peevish misery into his forehead while his cheeks downstrokes and his sulky mouth seemed to be saying i dont care who you are nor what you are i shall have my own way

        mrs morel knew him too well to look at him as she unfastened her brooch at the mirror she smiled faintly to see her face all smeared with the yellow dust of lilies she brushed it off and at last lay down for some time her mind continued snapping and jetting sparks but she was asleep before her husband awoke from the first sleep of his drunkenness
