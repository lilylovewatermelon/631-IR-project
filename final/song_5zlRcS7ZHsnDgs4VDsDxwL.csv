yeah

i look up i see i got bout seven rides in the streets

living life to the fullest you know what im saying

chorus
aint got no regrets i cant complain my life is great im straight
i just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
i sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
so many blue hundreds they stickin like they counterfeit i print this shit
whole lot of ones im in the cut im going dumbdumb
im sippin act and that some real deal do you want some
same ones tryin run with the clique
be the same ones that throwing salt on the clique
main reason why im fuckin ya bitch i aint gon say shit

verse 1
i asked you about it you lied
you asked me about it i kept it one hundred im nothin like these other guys
i really spent two thousand on kicks and only wear em one time
something about a nigga mind frame
diamonds doing jumpinjacks in the ap i can make the time change
two hundred hoes in my call log and i aint got not a name saved
took her out the hood put her on the drip now i got her rockin name brand
me and ced had two different spots we usually around the corner doin the same thing
everywhere i go my chains hang free the bros out the chain gang
new maybach cost 230 i dont even get my shoes dirty
i dont even sleep when i get tired you can see the adderall in my eyes
tiger said he got the drop on the opps
fuck it slide and shoot up the block
niggas know how we come through
g5 out the sunroof

verse 2
we use trap out my mom house turn the condo to a hideout
we cant be fuckin at my house niggas be runnin they damn mouth
walk down on them broad daylight it aint no fun in no driveby
im cool on the love and the highfives
you niggas cant keep up with my guys
you cant get all this drip in a lifetime
i got out and ran it up at the right time
we got dracos whenever its nighttime
we aint ever gonna stop at the stop sign
went to wafi i told em i want to shine
then the coupe quarter million they wiped me down
im running this town everything i say facts niggas cant take that
new lamborghini 18
only thing i do is make cream i dont why these niggas hating
only thing i do is drink lean rest in peace to fredo santana
i just keep on buying all these fantas
i dont want to go out like that only thing i know is get racks
chorus
aint got no regrets i cant complain my life is great im straight
i just woke up today made a hundred thousand dollar play
i sold a hundred bags before an hour hit
so many blue hundreds they stickin like they counterfeit i print this shit
