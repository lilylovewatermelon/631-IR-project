verse 1
get up in the morning
i cant keep it in
im falling all over myself
and i could jump out of my skin
wanna break the door down
just to greet the day
cause there aint nothing thats more certain
to keep my blues away

refrain
and i say
la la hey hey
and i say
la la hey hey

prechorus
and it can settle the sadness
and the voices in my head
when im in the glow of the warmth you throw
i can put all that to bed

chorus 1
in your light just when im in your light
in your light just when im in your light
in your light just when im in your light
in your light just when im in your light
in your light just when im in your light
in your light just when im in your light
and i wont get by if you take that light away
in your light just when im in your light

and when youre smiling on me smiling on me
that is all i need
to put behind me all my worry all my worries
and lifes complexities
it may be only a moment
but the world just falls away
and i forget myself and everything else
that depressed me yesterday

refrain
and i can sing
la la hey hey
yeah i sing
la la hey hey

bridge
when im in your light all of this is clear
if only i could always be just as i am right here in your light
when im in your light just when im in your light in your light
and i wont get by if you take that light away in your light

verse 3
when im in your light nothing brings me down in your light
if only i could always feel in your light just as i do right now in your light
