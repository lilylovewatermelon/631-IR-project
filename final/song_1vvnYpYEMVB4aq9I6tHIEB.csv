yeah for your eyes
for your eyes only for your eyes
for your eyes only for your eyes only
for your eyes for your eyes
for your eyes only

verse 1 j cole
hey niggas be dyin on the daily
it seems my dreams faded for far too long
the consequences deadly
cant visualize myself as nothin but a criminal
control the block servin up rocks and stay subliminal
cause young niggas is hardheaded they lettin off
full of adrenaline ignorant to what death can cause
aint no comin back family dressed in black
plus its hot now the cops outside its hard to flip a pack
and my daughter gotta eat her mama be stressin me
like i aint the one who put them js on her feet
like i aint out in the field like that
i might be low for the moment but i will bounce back
despite the charges back to the wall i fight regardless
screamin fuck the law my life is lawless
thats what you call it aint got to be no psychic
to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
this is hell and i dont mean that hyperbolic
i try to find employment even if its wipin toilets
but these felonies be makin life the hardest
resistin the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
thats why i write this sonnet
if the pressure get too much for me to take and i break
play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
for your eyes let her know my life is on it
for your eyes for your eyes only

for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes do you understand me
for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes do you understand me
for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes do you understand me
for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes only

verse 2 j cole
you prolly grown now so this songll hit you
if you hearin this unfortunately means that im no longer with you
in the physical not even sure if i believe in god but because you still alive
he got me prayin that the spiritual is real
so i can be a part of you still my pops was killed too
so i know how part of you feels
maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me
life goes in cycles maybe youll date a nigga just like me
i hope not im tired of dope spots
and fiends that smoke rocks
ive seen far too many niggas hopes rot
im writin this because me and the devil had a dance
now i see death around the corner pologizin in advance
dont know if i ever had a chance
at a glance im a failure
addicted to pushin paraphernalia
but daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once
innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
my pops shot up drugrelated mama addicted
so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hangin
blood was stainin the concrete
older niggas i loved talked like they was above
maintainin a timesheet thats slow money
picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
six years later was handed sentence
round the same time is when you came in this world
me and your mama thinkin
what the fuck we namin this girl
i told her nina the prettiest name that i could think of most prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen
for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen i was nineteen
took me two felonies to see the trap this crookedass system set for me
and now i fear its too late for me to ever be
the one that set examples that was never set for me
im livin fast but not fast enough
cause karma keeps on catchin up to me
and if my past becomes the death of me
i hope you understand
chorus j cole
for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes do you understand me
for your eyes do you understand hope you understand
for your eyes do you understand me
for your eyes do you understand hope you understand
for your eyes do you understand me
for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes only

verse 3 j cole
its several ways i couldve went out too many to count
was it the triggerhappy crackers that the badges give clout
was it the young niggas blastin frustrated cause the cash runnin out
niggas dont know how to act in a drought
see baby girl i realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed
my views misshaped by new mixtapes
that confirmed the shit i learned in the streets was true
that real niggas dont speak when they beef with you
they just pull up on your street let the heat achoo
and if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food
i was a fool spent all my time duckin school duckin cops
duckin rules huggin blocks that dont love you
i pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you
into a box where your son dont even know his pops
and the cyclical nature of doin time continues
my worst fear is one day that you come home from school
and see your father face while hearin bout tragedy on news
i got the strangest feelin your daddy gonna lose his life soon
and sadly if youre listenin now it must mean its true
but maybe theres a chance that its not
and this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels
and i can teach you this in person like im teachin you to tie your own shoes
i love you and i hope to god i dont lose you
for your eyes only
chorus chargaux  j cole
for your eyes for your eyes only
for your eyes for your eyes only
for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes only

verse 4 j cole
one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feelin
what hed been dealin with lately he wasnt tellin
i tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealin
but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice
and it was chillin he said
jermaine i knew you since we was children
i never asked for nothin when times was hard
i never had discussions with you beggin you to help me
i dealt with the repercussions of my actions
i know you tried to steer me way from that shit
but that shit was in my blood you know my life
i know your momma nigga send my love
in case i never get a chance to speak again
i wont forget the weekends spent sleepin at your crib
thats the way i wished my family lived
but my granny crib was in the jects
i had to interject like
nigga what you talkin bout fuck is you gettin at
he said listen i got no time to dive into descriptions
but i been havin premonitions
just call it visions from the other side
i got a feelin i wont see tomorrow
like the time im livin on is borrowed
with that said the only thing im proud to say i was a father
write my story down and if i pass
go play it for my daughter when she ready
and so im leavin you this record for your eyes only
dont you ever scratch or disrespect it
this perspective is a real one another lost ville son
i dedicate these words to you and all the other children
affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
that sent your pops to prison when he needed education
sometimes i think that segregation wouldve done us better
although i know that means that i would never
be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled
when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesboro
with lil zach and cole world barely one years old
now its thirty years later makin sure this storys told
girl your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was cold
not because he was the first to get some pussy twelve years old
not because he used to come through in the caddy on some vogues
not because he went from baggin up them grams to servin os
nah your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was hard
not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
not because he screamed fuck the law
although that was true
your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you
