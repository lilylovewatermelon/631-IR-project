there was snow there was snow
stretched for miles and more
where we buried where we buried our souls
oh i long oh i long
for them days left and gone
where we sang and where we danced to a brighter song
but now i look upon a field with bodies stretched out and i feel nothing
but somethings burning in my soul i let it lose control and im in
oh god ive sinned

prechorus
but i tried so hard and we tried so hard
and its a long long road that you told me so
yeah i tried so hard to forget where we are

chorus
and all we do is laugh and we sing
and we laughed oh and we cried and thought
oh what a life
and we laughed oh and we cried and thought
oh what a life
and we laughed and we cried and thought
oh what a life

prechorus
but i tried so hard but we killed our hearts
in valleys low i hear the trumpets blow
yeah i tried so hard yet im lost and scarred
you might also likechorus
and im filled with regret yet i sing
and we laughed oh and we cried and thought
oh what a life
and we laughed oh and we cried and thought
oh what a life
and we laughed and we cried and thought
oh what a life
and we laughed oh and we cried and thought
oh what a life
and we laughed oh and we cried and thought
oh what a life
and we laughed and we cried and thought
oh what a life1embed"
