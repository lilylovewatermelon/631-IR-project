some day i know youre coming back i know your coming back girl baby
someday tell me why you went away why you went away
and left me lonely left me lonely

chorus
im wishing on a star im wishing on a star
to follow where you are to follow where you are
im wishing on a dream im wishing on a dream
to follow all my dreams to follow all these dreams

if i could take every second every moment that we spent
erase it from my life and start over again
i wouldnt do it i couldnt even try
cuz even if the pain and the tears never dry
at least i know i had my days with you
remembering when it was just me and you
i closed my eyes and wished it was a dream
that i could wake up and you would be next to me
did you love me did you lie to me
whyd you make a promise that you knew you couldnt keep
you got me twisted and im losing my grip
if i never met you girl love wouldnt mean shhhh
so i aint never giving up on you
i built my whole world and it was all around you
i made a promise and im keeping it true
so ill never love again if i cant have you

im wishing on a star im wishing on a star
to follow where you are to follow where you are
im wishing on a dream im wishing on a dream
to follow all my dreams to follow all these dreams

if i had a wish baby it would be this
take you back to the days where we first kissed
you had never been touched we loved each other so much
holding you tight until the moon at night
i was yours you were mine every thing was all right
a wish upon a star most precious of all
cant image being without you with all weve been through
theres nothing in this world i wouldnt do for you
now i sit here alone never knew i could cry
all i have is painfully memories and wondering why
why you left me cold rip my heart from my soul
every day i pray ill see your smile once more
come back love i need you cant take it no more
dying inside life means nothing no more
dont wanna say goodbye but i gotta let you know
if you ever change your mind my love is all yours

chorus
im wishing on a star
you know im wishing on a star
trying to follow where you are
trying to follow where you are tonight
ohh you are you are
where are you baby
you know im wishing on a star
im wishing on a star
trying to follow where you are you are
oh you are you are you are you are
now when i had you i loved you
and when you had me all you ever did was hurt me
even when i wanted to let go i couldnt
my soul wouldnt let me
even on the bad days i smiled on the good days we shared together
and its hard to enjoy the success without you here but i maintained
magic told me this was gonna be my best verse
i told him i just wrote it down cuz my soul hurt
im tired of living a lie i miss how she hugged and kissed me loved and held me
never thought my head could turn to hell so quickly
you gave me this broken heart youre the only one who could fix it
forget the past we got a lifetime to make up for that
and even though we met other people we got to admit
its never equal the sunshine and the pleasure that we made together

chorus
im wishing on a star
you know im wishing on a star
trying to follow where you are
trying to follow where you are tonight
ohh you are you are
where are you baby
you know im wishing on a star
im wishing on a star
trying to follow where you are you are
oh you are you are you are you areembed"
