but a heart must be the one thing
you were born without
im through wasting my time
i dont know where ill sleep tonight
you say that you can do without me
go ahead now try and live without me

baby save up all your tears
you might need them someday
when the tears start to fall
i wont wipe them away
when you cry in the night
for the love that you need
baby save up your tears
cause youll be cryin over me

you got used to my touch
i got used to not feeling much
winter set in your eyes
time will melt your castle of ice
you think that you wont feel the pain now
your eyesll be cryin like the rain now
baby save up all your tears
you might need them someday
when the tears start to fall
i wont wipe them away
when you cry in the night
for the love that you need
baby save up your tears
cause youll be cryin over me
you dont know it now
but some wounds get deeper with time
you dont feel it now
till the need burns a knife turns
your heart bleeds like minesee bonnie tyler liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeembed"
