you dont remember me but i remember you
i lie awake and try so hard not to think of you
but who can decide what they dream
and dream i do

chorus
i believe in you
ill give up everything just to find you
i have to be with you to live to breathe
youre taking over me

verse 2
have you forgotten all i know and all we had
you saw me mourning my love for you
and touched my hand
i knew you loved me then

chorus
i believe in you i believe in you
ill give up everything just to find you
i have to be with you to live to breathe
youre taking over me

bridge
i look in the mirror and see your face
if i look deep enough
so many things inside that are just like you are taking over
