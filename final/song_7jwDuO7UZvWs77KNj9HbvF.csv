put on your war paint

verse 1
you are a brick tied to me thats dragging me down
strike a match and ill burn you to the ground
we are the jackolanterns in july
setting fire to the sky
here here comes this rising tide so come on
put on your war paint
cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to dies
silver clouds with grey linings

prechorus
so we can take the world back from the heartattacked
one maniac at a time we will take it back
you know time crawls on when youre waiting for the song to start
so dance alone to the beat of your heart

chorus
hey young blood doesnt it feel
like our time is running out
im gonna change you like a remix
then ill raise you like a phoenix
wearing our vintage misery
no i think it looked a little better on me
im gonna change you like a remix
then ill raise you like a phoenix
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeverse 2
bring home the boys in scraps scrap metal the tanks
get hitched make a career out of robbing banks
because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
you broke our spirit says the note we pass

prechorus
so we can take the world back from the heartattacked
one maniac at a time we will take it back
you know time crawls on when youre waiting for the song to start
so dance alone to the beat of your heart

chorus
hey young blood doesnt it feel
like our time is running out
im gonna change you like a remix
then ill raise you like a phoenix
wearing our vintage misery
no i think it looked a little better on me
im gonna change you like a remix
then ill raise you like a phoenix
