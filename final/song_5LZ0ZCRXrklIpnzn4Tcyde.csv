ahhh let me know

verse 1 drake
uhh yeah
this is really one of my dumbest flows ever i haven’t slept in days
and me and my latest girl agreed to go our separate ways
so i’m single thinkin bout what we had and missin you
but i aint santa i got somethin for these bad bitches too
i mean paparazzi on me tryin not to get caught out
they always seem to catch me with the woman that i brought out
baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
and all the girls that played me eat your muthafuckin heart out
its drizzy always gone but never hard to find
and since you can’t escape me do i ever cross your mind
because all this shit is new to me i’m learnin to behave
and still spendin every dollar they encourage me to save
but i’m good i know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
i’m lookin forward to the memories of right now
never forgettin from where i came
and no matter where i’m headed i promise to stay the same
