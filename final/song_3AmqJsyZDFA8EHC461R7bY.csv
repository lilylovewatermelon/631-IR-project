verse 1
sometimes it feel like niggas you love the most be the one that brings you down
just speakin from experience since i done been around
i remember shit was smooth we was dreamin cap and gowns
the older niggas preached to us the shit that we see now
some of your friends gon die some of your friends gon live
some of em go to jail for all the shit they did
every year they solid every year they straight
i was always solid solid all the way oh
the way this shit at stake you couldnt wait your turn
studied my position really had to sit and learn
reel up all my money better pay me like big worm
still im cleanin money like a nigga fraid of germs
drippin im the flyest you could never call me sherm
this louis v on me cost me like nothin i could burn
life is so funny like every day i see it turn
misunderstood dont understand you could learn

chorus
i was born to be great
and i wont let nobody tell me i aint
and i cant stop wont stop
and i i i i

you need to be done done done done
and think somethin over
you just need to chill and focus
try to get your life in motion
dont think that i need to
gave you your position you just gotta see it through
tried to help some niggas they aint want it it was cool
now they try to tell me that im actin brand new
i was on my dick in the pit goin through all types of shit
swear my momma always told me this the only life you get
havin fun goin dumb cause we started off with nothin
i swear we was tryna catch an opp and put two in his bun
try and run are you dumb its a beam on every gun
witnesses is dyin man i seen that when we come
i done seen a lot of niggas fold
seen a lot of niggas change niggas bold
growin up im gettin old start settin goals
tryna make more money off my businesses and shows
and everybody gon hate im great i know
everybody can hate im great i know
and im just gettin wiser as you see the time go
im just gettin wiser as you see the time go
and everybody can hate im great i know
everybody can hate im great i know
chorus
i was born to be great
and i wont let nobody tell me i aint
and i cant stop wont stop
and i woah woah18embed"
