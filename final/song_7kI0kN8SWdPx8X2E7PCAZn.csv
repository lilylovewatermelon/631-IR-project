no more second chances no more plastic lies
no more giving me reasons to make me have to say goodbye oh

verse 1 malcolm kelley

gps in my phone the bug in the house like she a stalker
she trying to lock me down with
a pie like shes some betty crocker

putting new words to an old tune
just move out the parts where i loved you
i loved you yea

prechorus tony oller
cause this is my only life
so ive got to let you go

verse 5 harloe
uh trying to say im crazy but its you that chased me
aint no black and white theres crazy different shades of shady
remember when i caught your fingers creepin round me
texting her at midnight boy you just a phony ooh
and i looked right past it like it was old news
and i told myself why should i doubt you
about to turn the tables on you
im bout to turn the tables on you
