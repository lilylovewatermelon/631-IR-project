yeah
let me just take a second go grizz
just got a lot to get off my chest haha

verse 1
im a bad bitch and i got bad anxiety
people call me rude cause i aint lettin em try me
sayin im a ho cause im in love with my body
issues but nobody i could talk to about it
they keep sayin i should get help
but i dont even know what i need
they keep sayin speak your truth
and at the same time say they dont believe man
excuse me while i get into my feelings for a second
usually i keep it in but today i gotta tell it
not that anybody gives a fuck anyway
but everybody talkin shit probably sucks anyway
yall dont even know how i feel
i dont even know how i deal
today i really hate everybody
and thats just me bein real yeah

if i could write a letter to heaven
i would tell my mama that i shoulda been listenin
and i would tell her sorry that i really been wildin
and ask her to forgive me cause i really been tryin
and i would ask please show me who been real
and get em from around me if they all been fake
its crazy how i say the same prayers to the lord
and always get surprised about who he take man

and i dont do drugs so i never get a time when im at ease
