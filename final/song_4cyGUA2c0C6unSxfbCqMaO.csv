i float in a boat
in a raging black ocean
low in the water
and nowhere to go
the tiniest lifeboat
with people i know
 
cold clammy and crowded
the people smell desperate
well sink any minute
so someone must go
the tiniest lifeboat
with the people i know
 
everyones pushing
everyones fighting
storms are approaching
theres nowhere to hide
if i say the wrong thing
or i wear the wrong outfit
theyll throw me right over the side
 
im hugging my knees
and the captain is pointing
well who made her captain
still the weakest must go
the tiniest lifeboat
full of people i know
the tiniest lifeboat
full of people i knowyou might also like12embed"
