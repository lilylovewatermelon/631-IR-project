gotta have it
the feeling you give me is savage
why do we all gotta make it complicated
the moderns overrated
can we take it take it back to basics oh
we can rough it
with the moon and the stars up above us
like the millions of years before we ever got together
a prehistoric pleasure
can we take it take it back to basics
oh yeah

before the fire
