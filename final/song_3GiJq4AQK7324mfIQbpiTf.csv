intro
yeah
yeah
rise

interlude
halfalive and starkraving free and maligned
for encroaching on the purpose of this commercialfree interruption
due to the prolific nature of this statement
listener aggression is advised

verse 1
its strange whenever i see a gun
i think about just how petty you are
and it blows my fucking mind
yeah it blows my fucking mind
these days i never seem to get enough
im tired of this shit i wanna go home
dont waste my fucking time
dont waste my fucking time
because anything exceptional
gets crushed by common people
with jealousy and ignorance
and all their common evils
this planet isnt special
collections made of clay
im waiting for the punishment
i know its on my way

postchorus
irreverence is my disease
its secondhand but you know me
the son of a bitch is on his knees
the last man standing gets no pity

verse 2
somewhere on a toilet wall i read the words
you form a line to formalize the former lies
and i finally saw the truth
something so profound and it was sitting there
surrounded by the garbage and the stains
another victim of the refuse
now ive been saying this for years
but you dont comprehend it
i fight hell and i fight fear
because i understand it
androgyny and insults
you try so hard to be difficult
you wanna win the war
know what youre fighting for

postchorus
irreverence is my disease
its secondhand but you know me
the son of a bitch is on his knees
the last man standing gets no pity
with angel eyes and demon seeds
youre missing what you really need
when all is said and done you see
the last man standing gets no pity
