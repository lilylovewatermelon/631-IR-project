when marimba rhythms start to play
dance with me make me sway
like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
hold me close sway me more
like a flower bending in the breeze
bend with me sway with ease
when we dance you have a way with me
stay with me sway with me

refrain
other dancers may be on the floor
dear but my eyes will see only you
only you have that magic technique
when we sway i go weak
i can hear the sounds of violins
long before it begins
make me thrill as only you know how
sway me smooth sway me now

instrumental break

when we sway i grow weak
i can hear the sounds of violins
long before it begins
make me thrill as only you know how
sway me smooth sway me now
