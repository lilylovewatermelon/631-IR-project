cold hands white light
yellow lamps on blackened skies
duffel hoods and deep brown eyes
ill sing you a song that i think youll like
and well walk to places we always go
a million faces i dont know
ill say the words youd always hope
set our hearts on racing even though

chorus
i know what you told me
i know that its all over
and i know i cant keep calling
every time i run yeah i keep on falling
i know what you told me
i know that its all over
and i know i cant keep calling
its just every time i run
yeah i keep on falling on you

verse 2
on the way you stand on the way you sway
the way your hair curls in the rain
the little lines that write your face
or the winter nights youd come and stay
or the way you hit me when you wanna fight
the way i yearn the way i cry
the way our love rolls with the tides
but we know well make up every time
