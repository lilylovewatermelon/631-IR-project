black is my favorite color
makes me feel like we know each other
blank tapes and posters on the door
listen to my pink floyd cover
take a seat like a backbeat lover
mixed tapes and cushions on the floor

i sold my bed but not my stereo

verse 2
paper bags and escalators
pushin up those broken faders
only way to find out who you are
in a town of ones and zeros
you are one magnetic hero
little things will always get you far
