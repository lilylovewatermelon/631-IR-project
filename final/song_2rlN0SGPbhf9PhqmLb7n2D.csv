i was standing downtown downtown
staring at the puddles on the ground
tryin to figure out a way up out of this town
and i know yeah im not the only one
so many people out there chase the sun
if youre looking for a free ride
you better run child
or you sure wont get too far oh
youd better dance a dance
to make the rain come down
if you want to be a star oh my life

my life brother you know
sure aint been too easy
my life sister you know
the life i wanna live
my life mama you know
youre gonna go through changes
my life im tellin you no
no turnin back

verse 2
every now and then i
wanna throw my hands up in the sky
cause one day i know ill be flyin high
and i know yeah i got to get down
on my knees and pray
cause in heart i know ill see that day

and they know who they are my life
