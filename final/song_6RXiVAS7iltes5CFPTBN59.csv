we are forced to fight
takes lives of my men
my kingdom falls this night

you conquer with your serpent
and its scales of molten steel

metal snake
metal snake
metal snake
metal snake

castles lay in ruin
carcasses ignite
bretherens heads on posts
but still i must fight

i conjure with my fury
a masterful decree

i will build a beast
that will conquer you
built of metal gears
spears to run you through

better metal snake
better metal snake
better metal snake

now go seek devour
inject your poison
and take their lives away

better metal snake
better metal snake
better metal snake
better metal snake
better metal snake
its gonna take your life tonight
better metal snake
mechanical reptilian might
better metal snake
shed its metal skin and destroy
better metal snake
its such a better metal snake

now go seek devour
inject your poison
and take their lives awayembed"
