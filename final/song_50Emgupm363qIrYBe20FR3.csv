this labor ive been doing aint got no reason or rhyme
and i cant hardly wait for it to finally be quittin time
and ive been pushing steel through a run down rust belt plant
and i cant wait to head on home so i can take my gal to dance
how ill take my gal to dance
oh ill take my gal to dance

instrumental break

verse 2
the desert sure is hot and weve been working through the days
i pray i get back to my loving ladys gaze
rifle in my hand and some brothers to my side
i cant hardly wait for it to finally be quittin time
oh i pray itll be quittin time
oh one day itll be quittin time

chorus
quittin times on my mind
but her kind eyes are on my heart
ive been swеatin for my wages
but shell cool me aftеr dark
how shell cool me after dark
i know shell cool me after dark

verse 3
and ive been roofing houses atop of homes i cant afford
but im saving all my pennies and im prayin to the lord
one day well make it through all this barely gettin by
im taking out my woman and were dancin barefoot tonight

chorus
quittin times on my mind
but her kind eyes are on my heart
ive been sweating for my wages
but shell cool me after dark
how shell cool me after dark
oh shell cool me after dark
