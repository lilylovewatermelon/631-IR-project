miracle people with marvelous hair
and the knack to do anything better than anyone
i got a home with electrical air
and i live in a world smaller than anyoneâ€™s
but i got a line on the new frontier
i got a line on the new america
all of the people are vanishing here
i could be huge if i could just get

from the outside of everything to the inside of you
from the outside of everything to the inside of you

purest aluminum people are walking the streets of london
so hysterical
nobody here gets a word that i say
and the problems im told are more than medical
but i got a friend from the new frontier
and galen she says this is not america
you need a girl with electrical hair
and the word that you wanted was aluminium

from the outside of everything to the inside of you
from the outside of everything to the inside
see counting crows liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likei was in bed with the girl at the end of the world
she says im going home
you should come home too
but im at the end of a new frontier
here at the edge of the flat earth ending
im getting off to get lost in the air
at the end of the world where the light is bending

from the outside of everything to the inside of youembed"
