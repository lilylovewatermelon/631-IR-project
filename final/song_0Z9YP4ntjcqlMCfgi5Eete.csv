ridin a pinto
tryin to chase the lone ranger down
im a little unravelled
but im still in the saddle
cryin your name out to the clouds
hey yaw hey yaw

why dont you meet me
back at the tepee
well lay down by the camp fire
there in the dark night
well smoke the peace pipe
forget about whos wrong or right
hey yaw hey yaw

yeah it was a big showdown
oh yeah we stood our ground
shot out the lights
it got a little crazy
i dont wanna see us go
the way of the buffalo
dont wanna have another wild west show
hey yaw hey yaw

only forgiveness
will finally end this
there wont be a witness if we both fall
theres never a hero
in a battle of egos
theres never a winner of the quick draw
hey yaw hey yaw

oh yeah we stood our ground
shot out the lights
it got a little crazy
dont wanna see us go
the way of the buffalo
dont wanna have another wild west show
hey yaw hey yaw

hey yaw hey yaw

its like a ghost town
without you around
why cant we just forget it
ride off in the sunset

it was a big showdown
oh yeah we stood our ground
shot out the lights
it got a little crazy
i dont wanna see us go
the way of the buffalo
dont wanna have another wild west show
hey yaw hey yaw
