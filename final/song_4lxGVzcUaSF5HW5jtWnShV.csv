have no fear
for when im alone
ill be better off
than i was before
ive got this life
ill be around to grow
who i was before
i cannot recall

chorus
long nights allow
me to feel im falling
i am falling
the lights go out
let me feel im falling
i am falling safely to
the ground
ah

verse 2
ill take this soul
thats inside me now
like a brand new friend
ill forever know
ive got this life
and the will to show
i will always be
better than before
