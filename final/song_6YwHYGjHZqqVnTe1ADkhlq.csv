look straight ahead in the distance oh yeah theres a nightcrawler
youd better move quick dont you know shes a night stalker
look straight ahead in the distance oh yeah theres a nightcrawler
yeah youd better move quick dont you know shes a night stalker

shell take away all the love that you feel shell want to suck up and steal
she wants to look around town with her wicked eye but well love and come real
shell try to cover herself in the underground she thinks shes got it locked down
but take it from me shes so lonely

prechorus
look straight ahead in the distance
yes theres a nightcrawler walking with her fist clenched but raise up
and feed her some happiness
and before you know it shell be smiling with some love
and yes alright now let me tell you what were trying to suggest
once again rebelution on a loving quest
tell her to look at the ocean when the sun sets
and then put out our hands for the unfortunate
alright pick up the slack from the wickedness
straight up clean up your manners and your etiquette

chorus

late night 3 in the morning yeah you can hear her footsteps one after the other and
nobody ever seen her talk back nobody ever seen her walking on the right track
tell me do you know where your soul is
you glitter but the golds up in the nights mist and its crawling up on ya
how many people in this house tonight feeling that sense of aggravation on a lonely night
see rebelution liveget tickets as low as 115you might also likeprechorus
