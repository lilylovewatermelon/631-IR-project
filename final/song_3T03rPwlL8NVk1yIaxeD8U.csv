one touch and you got me stoned
higher than ive ever known
you call the shots and i follow
sunrise but the nights still young
no words but we speak in tongues
if you let me i might say too much

prechorus
your touch blurred my vision
its your world and im just in it
even sober im not thinkin straight

chorus
cause im off my face in love with you
im out my head so into you
and i dont know how you do it
but im forever ruined by you oohoohooh

verse 2
cant sleep cause im way too buzzed
too late now youre in my blood
i dont hate the way you keep me up

prechorus
your touch blurred my vision
its your world and im just in it
even sober im not thinkin straight

cause im off my face in love with you
im out my head so into you
and i dont know how you do it
