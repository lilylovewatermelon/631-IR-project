if i ever get you back ima treat you like a queen

he looks like hes a real romancer
im just hoping and im praying that one day i hear you saying
that you gon give me that second chance and take me back
and we gon roll through life in a cadillac

chorus
if i ever get you back ima treat you like a queen
make a livin lovin you a lot of kissin in between

i aint gon ever have to get you back again
