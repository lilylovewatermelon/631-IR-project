verse 1
up to your neck in shit
like a plague words spread theres no getting over it

cover up your tracks you know youre down to get fucked

im a riot in the streets and youre a cheap little whore
i fucking hate you

putting words in their mouths
till they choke to death theres no getting over it
youre more deceiving than most
you tiptoe around like another ghost
