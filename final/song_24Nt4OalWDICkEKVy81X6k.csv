saturday night and the moon is out
just shinin over top of the pines
im headin on down to my babys house
gonna take her on a midnight ride
down them backroads winding up at kickapoo creek
dancin and singin to some good ol boys like me

chorus
baby theres a shooting star
that ones for me and you
so hold me tight and make that wish and pray that it comes true
i aint sure of much but this i know
i got a diamond in my pocket and my babys got a heart of gold

verse 2
i brought along a little courage and a coleman cooler
just to help me out
my hands are shaking like a canebrake rattler
nothings gonna save me now
might as well jump in head first lay it all on the line
what am i worrying about never gonna be a more perfect time

chorus
cause baby theres a shooting star
that ones for me and you
so hold me tight and make that wish and pray that it comes true
i aint sure of much but this i know
i got a diamond in my pocket and my babys got a heart of gold
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likebridge
well i didnt have money for a broadway show
but the crickets are singing to the radio
and we got tickets on the very front row

chorus
baby theres a shooting star
that ones for me and you
so hold me tight and make that wish and pray that it comes true
i aint sure of much but this i know
i got a diamond in my pocket and my babys got a heart of gold
i got a diamond in my pocket and my babys got a heart of gold1embed"
