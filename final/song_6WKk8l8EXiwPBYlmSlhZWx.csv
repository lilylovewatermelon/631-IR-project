yeah i got off stage like a month ago
i was talking to fans
and one of em pulled me aside and said
we never met but i swear that you know who i am
ive been through a lot
i dont know how to express it to people dont think that i can
but i got that mansion cd on rotation
thats real for me nate you do not understand
its crazy for me
kids hit me up say they slittin they wrists on the daily
this music is more than you think
dont book me for just entertainment its entertainin
hearin these parents they telling their kids
my music is violent—you gotta be kidding me
i guess that your definition of violence and mine
is something that we look at differently
how do you picture me huh
want me to smile you want me to laugh
you want me to walk on the stage with a smile on my face
when im mad and put on a mask for real though
i mean what you expect from me
im tryna do this respectfully
they say that life is a race
i knew my problems would prolly catch up eventually
i do my best to be calm
how you gon write me and tell me youd slaughter my family
thats just a glimpse to the stuff that gets sent to me
these are the parts of my life they dont never see woo
i am aware its aggressive
i am not here for acceptance
i dont know what you expected
but what you expect when you walk in a therapy session huh

verse 2
this girl at the show looked me in the face
and told me her lifes full of drama yeah
said her dad is abusive
apparently he likes to beat on her mama
i got so angry inside
i wanted to tell her to give me his number
but what you gon do with it right
you gon hit him up then hell start hittin her harder thats real
these kids they come to my shows
with tears in they eyes
magine someone looking at you
and sayin your musics the reason that they are alive
sometimes i dont know how to handle it
this type of life isnt glamorous
this aint an act for the cameras nah
you see me walk on these stages
but have no idea what im dealing with after it nah
i put it all in the open
this is the way that i cope with all my emotion
im taking pictures with thousands of people
but honestly i feel like nobody knows me
im tryin to deal with depression
im tryin to deal with the pressure
how you gon tell me my music does not have a message
when im lookin out at this crowd full of people i know i affected agh
i got some things in my life my life
i know i should let em go let em go
let me jot it down jot it down
let me take a mental note mental note
i put it all in this microphone microphone
think about that for a minute
what is the point of this song im just ventin
but what you expect from a therapy session huh
chorus
therapy therapy session
therapy therapy session

verse 3
what you think about me
—that doesnt worry me
i know i handle some things immaturely
i know that i need to grow in maturity
i aint gon walk on these stages in front of these people
and act like i live my life perfectly
that doesnt work for me
christian is not the definition of what perfect means woo
i aint the type to be quiet
i aint gon sit here in silence
if i wouldnt say what i say to your face
then i promise you i wouldnt say it in private
i am not lyin
people go off on my page and im tryin to quit the replyin
but this is ridiculous
im passionate man i really mean what im writing
you want me to keep it a hundred
okay ill keep it a hundred
i see a whole lot of talkin on socials
but honestly i dont see nothing in public
i kinda love it yeah
why dont you write us some happy raps
that would be awesome
all of your music is moody and dark nate
—dont get me started yeah
you wanna know what its like if you met me in person
listen to my verses
this music is not just for people
who sit in the pews and pray at the churches nah
i wont reject it
i dont expect everyone to respect it
i dont expect you to get my perspective
but what you expect from a therapy session
huh
outro
i mean i think sometimes people—they confuse what im doin
i write about life i write about things that im actually dealing with
something that im actually experiencing
this is real for me
like this is something that personally helps me as well
im not confused about who gave me the gift
god gave me the gift and he gave me the ability to—to do this
and he also gave me this as an outlet
and thats what music is for me
when i feel something whether its anger
um its a passion about something—or frustration
like this is where i go
this is—this is—thats the whole nf real music thing man
this is real for me—i need this
this is a therapy for me88embed"
