four long years
hiding from the world
punished by your peers

studied teachers words
staff appointed hearts
earned a piece of paper
no go forth and start

go forth be conquered go forth and die
go forth be conquered go forth and die

go forth be conquered
go forth and die

now youve graduated
mind is mutilated
thrust into the world
feeling segregated
move in with your parents
back into the dark
landed where you started
bachelor of arts
the learning starts now
open up your textbooks
and turn to the chapter concerning your deth
see dethklok liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likenight sky
bleeds red
black birds
bring deth

youll be eaten by the blackness
of your rotting mind thats dying
youre consumed with sharpened wings
that penetrate your frightened lying

go die
go die
go die go

now youre sad and frightened
want to go and hide
maybe get your masters
eight more years inside
dream of your own murder
strangled by the ivy
drown in student loans
better off just dying

go die
go die
youll be eaten by the blackness
of your rotting mind thats dying
youre consumed with sharpened wings
that penetrate your frightened lying

go forth be conquered
go forth and die
go forth be conquered
go forth and die
go forth and die
go forth and die
go forth and die
go forth and die1embed"
