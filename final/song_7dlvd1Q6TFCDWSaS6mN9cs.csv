the night my necklace fell off
you fluttered through my
capillaries like a stoned moth

chorus
i agree with your ideas but not your tactics
so look me in the eye and be practical
when practically theres nothing left for me to say or do
its only up to you

verse 2
a live ladybug trapped between my toes
keep it together man
were all connected now
stay composed

chorus
i agree with your ideas but not your tactics
so look me in the eye and be practical
when practically theres nothing left for me to say or do
its only up to you

bridge
the current picture the metronome
i dont know what this is but its not my home
i thought that we were falling in love
but we werent no only i was
you might also likechorus
i agree with your ideas but not your tactics
so look me in the eye and be practical
when practically theres nothing left for me to say or do
its only up to you

outro
its only up to youembed"
