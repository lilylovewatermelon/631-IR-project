you think id leave your side baby
you know me better than that
you think id leave you down
when youre down on your knees
i wouldnt do that
ill tell you youre right when you want
and if only you could see into me

chorus
oh when youre cold
ill be there
hold you tight to me

verse 2
when youre on the outside baby
and you cant get in
i will show you
youre so much better than you know
when youre lost and youre alone
and you cant get back again
i will find you
darling and ill bring you home

bridge
and if you want to cry
i am here to dry your eyes
and in no time youll be fine
