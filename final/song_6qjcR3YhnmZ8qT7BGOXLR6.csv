back in the good old days
they knew how to brawl
im talking real gunslingers
im talking real outlaws
theyd saddle up and ride on into town
when it was high noon in them old saloons
you knew what was going down

prechorus 1
when they took it outside
took it outside
when it was man to man
toe to toe
you know they had to go

chorus
where nobodys going to break it up
not until youve had enough
and if you think youve got the guts
then lets take it outside
if you think your man enough
you really want to knuckle up
if you want to shed a little blood then lets
take it outside
lets take it outside

these days things have changed
a lot of talk
lot of pushing and shoving
well if you want to walk the walk
lets have some respect
got girls in here
just pay your tab
and lay down your beer and lets take it outside

prechorus 2
take it outside
its man to man
toe to toe
you know we need to go

chorus
where nobodys going to break it up
not until youve had enough
and if you think youve got the guts
then lets take it outside
if you think your man enough
you really want to knuckle up
if you want to shed a little blood lets
take it outside
lets take it outside
were all here for a good time
but dont start no trouble
cause it wont be the first time
i put a scar on my knuckles
now brother i dont mind
ill be glad to stomp your ass
but if both of us walk out that door
one of us aint coming back

chorus
nobodys going to break it up
not until youve had enough
and if you think youve got the guts
then lets take it outside
if you think your man enough
you really want to knuckle up
if you want to shed a little blood lets
take it outside
lets take it outsideembed"
