verse 1 travis scott
take a sip drowning in this shit
coppers on my hip i hold my head
ive been taking risks to make that money flip shots to the head
i aint order it i cant afford this shit
go to war with this you overboard im over bored with shit
now its pay up player pay a nigga
gotta day to day to stack and still i pay accounts
twenty racks to show just a little allowance
only come to houston if the boy allow it
bow your head to a real one coming down with them main niggas
htown dont play with us them witit boys stay wit us
ive been grinding slaving over time since i was a fan
looking in the mirror like one day jacques you gon be the man
one skinny tatted nigga blunt flicker
young la flame hot spitter who cant hold his liquor yah

verse 2 juicy j
wake up and im on smoke me some weed
wake up my bitch ho get on your knees
get a taste of this life drugs liquor pills and lean
with one of the realest trillest mud niggas from the south than youve ever seen
legendary shit im faded im wasted im still at it
sleep walkin through life it aint never panic
its a blue dream that you cant imagine
ive been through some shit that your life couldnt handle
like runnin with the mob im blessed
i gotta thank god for the mafia
ima last ima breathe rob a nigga from the block with me
flyin g5 sellin yachts with me
180 in a rari til the squad get me
hustlers never sleep til a box fit me
its hard to stay sober with them thc
the hustle continues now vibe with me
the hustle continues get high with me
