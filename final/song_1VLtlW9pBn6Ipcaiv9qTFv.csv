ive been livin on truck stop coffee
cigarettes and vitamin c
its a wonder that the devil aint caught me
i guess hes tired of playing hidenseek
ive been drivin like im struck by lightning
i think about you and i start to speed
i might as well be playin with matches
in a truckload of gasoline

chorus
if its the last thing i do
if it takes me from tupelo to timbuktu
if its the last thing i do
im gonna dodge every roadblock speed trap and county cop
to get my hands on you
if its the last thing i do

verse 2
box of chicken and a dayold biscuit
aint nothing left but a few old bones
i oughta stop but im going to risk it
caffeine got me chewing styrofoam

from a filling station telephone
