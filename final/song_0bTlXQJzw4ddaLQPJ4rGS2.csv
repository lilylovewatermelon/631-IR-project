what a night for a dance you know im a dancing machine
with a fire in my bones and the sweet taste of kerosene
i get lost in the night so high i dont wanna come down
to face the loss of the good thing that ive found

bridge
woohoohoo
woohoohoo

verse 2
in the dark of the night i could hear you calling my name
with the hardest of hearts i still feel full of pain
so i drink and i smoke and i ask you if youre ever around
even though it was me who drove us right in the ground

chorus
see the time we shared it was precious to me
but all the while i was dreaming of revelry

verse 2
born to run baby run like a stream down a mountainside
with the wind in my back i dont ever even bat an eye
just know it was you all along who had a hold of my heart
but the demon and me were the best of friends from the start
see kings of leon liveget tickets as low as 117you might also likechorus
so the time we shared it was precious to me
all the while i was dreaming of revelry
dreaming of revelry

bridge
and i told myself boy away you go
it rained so hard it felt like snow
everything came tumbling down on me
in the back of the woods in the dark of the night
paleness of the old moonlight
everything just felt so incomplete

outro
dreaming of revelry
dreaming of revelry
dreaming of revelry
