my eyes are open wide
by the way i made it through the day
i watched the world outside
by the way im leaving out today

prechorus
well i just saw halleys comet she waved
said why you always runnin in place
even the man in the moon disappeared
somewhere in the stratosphere

chorus
tell my mother tell my father
ive done the best i can
to make them realize this is my life
i hope they understand

postchorus
im not angry im just saying
sometimes goodbye is a second chance

verse 2
