i had seven faces
thought i knew which one to wear
but im sick of spending these lonely nights
training myself not to care
the subway is a porno
pavements they are a mess
i know youve supported me for a long time
somehow im not impressed

chorus
but new york cares got to be some more change in my life
new york cares got to be some more change in my life
new york cares got to be some more change in my life
new york cares got to be some more change in my life

verse 2
subway she is a porno
and the pavements they are a mess
i know youve supported me for a long time
somehow im not impressed

instrumental interlude

bridge
its up to me now turn on the bright lights
oh its up to me now turn on the bright lights

new york cares got to be some more change in my life
new york cares got to be some more change in my life
new york cares got to be some more change in my life
new york cares got to be some more change in my life

outro
its up to me now turn on the bright lights got to be some more change in my life
got to be some more change in my life
oh its up to me now turn on the bright lights got to be some more change in my life
