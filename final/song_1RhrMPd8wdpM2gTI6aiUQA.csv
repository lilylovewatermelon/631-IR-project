i took a walk for the very first time on the dark side of the dance floor
lit a match just to heat things up but i got more than i bargained for
mixed drinks mixed feelings of elation
i should have known it was a one night invitation

chorus
dont sweat it forget it everything is aok
just let it go then its off to find another face
i make you come just to watch you leave
you walk around with my heart on your sleeve
dont sweat it its over now our time ran out

verse 2
i took an oath but im giving it up you didnt have to see things my way
nothing more than a casual fuck â€” isnt that just how we operate
lets drink to feelings of temptation
you and i were an overnight sensation

chorus
dont sweat it forget it everything is aok
just let it go then its off to find another face
i make you come just to watch you leave
you walk around with my heart on your sleeve
dont sweat it its over now our time ran out
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likebridge
outside the brake lights started to dim
i feel the tension thats been pulling us in
and then we do it again so we can feel alright
falling in love for the night

chorus
dont sweat it forget it everything is aok
just let it go then its off to find another face
i make you come just to watch you leave
you walk around with my heart on your sleeve
dont sweat it its over now our time ran out
our time ran out
our time ran out
our time ran out
our time ran out2embed"
