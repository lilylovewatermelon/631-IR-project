i dont want you thinking i love you cause i stay
girl i really like you and happy we got laid
i think about your windows like four times in a day
im a pervert with a purpose like priest who just got saved
kissing kissing im on a mission of licking
the holy grail of your body when you be pissin
this is a kid from africa you you are a kitchen
i come quicker than pitches from sammy sosa you hoping im joking but first

hook tyler the creator
ima eat your pussy til you tell me you cant take it
screaming stop it dont you fake it wanna tape it
grab my camera nine months later with a tyler baby face
but that wont happen til i blow my load
ima eat your pussy til you tell me you cant take it
screaming stop it dont you fake it wanna tape it
grab my camera nine months later with a tyler baby face
but that wont happen til i blow my load

verse 2 tyler the creator
your pussy tighter than door hinges i munch you like sandwiches
but not any more cause im on tour so
look facetime your clit i will jack off my dick
i go hard shit i might need ice pack on my wrist
we fucking im pumping you know its coming bust in a couple of seconds
im sweating i leave you slumped in the back of my truck butt naked
suck it out of me i leave you with nuttin get it
this is what you wanted this is what you came for

interlude syd  tyler the creator
theres something bout the way you pick your cherries  you blow me away
with your cherry cherry bomb
make me feel like 4th of july cant breathe
cherry you light my fireworks
theres something bout the way you pick your cherries  you blow me away
with your cherry bomb
