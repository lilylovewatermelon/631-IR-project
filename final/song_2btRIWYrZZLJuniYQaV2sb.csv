im still high as i ride in my 7 duece coupe deville
yall soldiers know my truth be ill
now with these visions and these bad thoughts runnin through my mind
cant stop the clock see im runnin out of time
and as i tell myself im a changed man
dressed in black out to jack me a game plan
situation critical its called creepy physical
hella cold im a bo put off in hella old
plus its hard to focus when you crooked and hopeless
i aint home but my mama dont notice
nationwide with thugs loccd out its just us
with the feds and the police out to bust us thats right
the most prominent see we stay dominate
and stay wicked and plus we keep it explicit
abducted by the streets see its hard to manage
end up on my block saying we the savage

chorus 1
so you made a little money oh wow what the fck yo punk a finna do now
so you roll on 24s oh wow what the fck yo punk a finna do now
so you pimped a few hos oh wow what the fck yo punk a finna do now
so you earned a few stripes oh wow what the fck yo punk a finna do now

i hear you rappin bout the streets talkin bout pushin deal
when most of yall never seen a triple beam scale
runnin from weed smell runnin from dank smoke
then you get on the mic talkin bout you been chokin
ya lame as mark buy some heart with yo chump change
dont make me start cold hearted droppin punk names
you run thangs maybe in yo back yard
you act hard round here you gonna get smacked hard
baby bash cross game thats a negative
with savage dreams on my mind so repetative
let it live let it go playa do or die
cuz fools on my side will tell the other fool to ride
down to do what i gotta do to satisfy the man in me
i pull illicit things my family aint understandin me
so while i have kids beatin up on the door
im gonna crack up and smoke with a corona

so you got a platinum grill oh wow what the fck yo punk a finna do now
so you got a record deal oh wow what the fck yo punk a finna do now

the day i wake up blaze up lace my js up
try to make a couple stacks fo the days up
hustle hard nia thats how i live
only fuckin with fans my nias and relatives
and i dress fly all clean and keep a fat knot
for supplying all the beats to the havenots

wont kill what you dont bitch or watch your grill hoe
ill have you iced out you beat grills with your mutha fckin lights out
lame nia we aint worried about yo salary
get off them pills and come back to reality
