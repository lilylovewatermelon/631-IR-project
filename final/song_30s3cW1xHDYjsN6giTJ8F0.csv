30s3cW1xHDYjsN6giTJ8F0,Against All Odds (Take a Look At Me Now) - Remastered,The Postal Service,5MoaDbFw4nrm2P7Om1on3b,"6 contributorschapter 6 detroit red lyricsevery day i would gamble all of my tips  as high as fifteen and twenty dollars  on the numbers and dream of what i would do when i hit

i saw people on their long wild spending sprees after big hits i dont mean just hustlers who always had some money i mean ordinary working people the kind that we otherwise almost never saw in a bar like smalls who with a good enough hit had quit their jobs working somewhere downtown for the white man often they had bought a cadillac and sometimes for three and four days they were setting up drinks and buying steaks for all their friends i would have to pull two tables together into one and they would be throwing me two and threedollar tips each time i came with my tray

hundreds of thousands of new york city negroes every day but sunday would play from a penny on up to large sums on threedigit numbers a hit meant duplicating the last three figures of the stock exchanges printed daily total of us domestic and foreign sales

with the odds at six hundred to one a penny hit won 6 a dollar won 600 and so on on 15 the hit would mean 9000 famous hits like that had bought controlling interests in lots of harlems bars and restaurants or even bought some of them outright the chances of hitting were a thousand to one many players practiced what was called combinating for example six cents would put one penny on each of the six possible combinations of three digits the number 840 combinated would include 840 804 048 084 408 and 480

practically everyone played every day in the povertyridden black ghetto of harlem every day someone you knew was likely to hit and of course it was neighborhood news if big enough a hit neighborhood excitement hits generally were small a nickel dime or a quarter most people tried to play a dollar a day but split it up among different numbers and combinated

harlems numbers industry hummed every morning and into the early afternoon with the runners jotting down peoples bets on slips of paper in apartment house hallways bars barbershops stores on the sidewalks the cops looked on no runner lasted long who didnt out of his pocket put in a free figger for his working areas foot cops and it was generally known that the numbers bankers paid off at higher levels of the police department

the daily small army of runners each got ten percent of the money they turned in along with the bet slips to their controllers and if you hit you gave the runner a ten percent tip a controller might have as many as fifty runners working for him and the controller got five percent of what he turned over to the banker who paid off the hit paid off the police and got rich off the balance

some people played one number all year many had lists of the daily hit numbers going back for years they figured reappearance odds and used other systems others played their hunches addresses license numbers of passing cars any numbers on letters telegrams laundry slips numbers from anywhere dream books that cost a dollar would say what number nearly any dream suggested evangelists who on sundays peddled jesus and mystics would pray a lucky number for you for a fee

recently the last three numbers of the post offices new zip code for a postal district of harlem hit and one banker almost went broke let this very book circulate widely in the black ghettoes of the country and  although im no longer a gambling person  id lay a small wager for your favorite charity that millions of dollars would be bet by my poor foolish black brothers and sisters upon say whatever happens to be the number of this page or whatever is the total of the whole books pages

every day in smalls paradise bar was fascinating to me and from a harlem point of view i couldnt have been in a more educational situation some of the ablest of new yorks black hustlers took a liking to me and knowing that i still was green by their terms soon began in a paternal way to straighten red out

their methods would be indirect a dark businessmanlooking west indian often would sit at one of my tables one day when i brought his beer he said red hold still a minute he went over me with one of those yellow tape measures and jotted figures in his notebook when i came to work the next afternoon one of the bartenders handed me a package in it was an expensive dark blue suit conservatively cut the gift was thoughtful and the message clear

the bartenders let me know that this customer was one of the top executives of the fabulous forty thieves gang that was the gang of organized boosters who would deliver to order in one day cod any kind of garment you desired you would pay about onethird of the stores price

i heard how they made mass hauls a welldressed member of the gang who wouldnt arouse suspicion by his manner would go into a selected store about closing time hide somewhere and get locked inside when the store closed the police patrols would have been timed beforehand after dark hed pack suits in bags then turn off the burglar alarm and use the telephone to call a waiting truck and crew when the truck came timed with the police patrols it would be loaded and gone within a few minutes i later got to know several members of the forty thieves
plainclothes detectives soon were quietly identified to me by a nod a wink knowing the law people in the area was elementary for the hustlers and like them in time i would learn to sense the presence of any police types in late 1942 each of the military services had their civiliandress eyes and ears picking up anything of interest to them such as hustles being used to avoid the draft or who hadnt registered or hustles that were being worked on servicemen

longshoremen or fences for them would come into the bars selling guns cameras perfumes watches and the like stolen from the shipping docks these negroes got what whitelongshoreman thievery left over merchant marine sailors often brought in foreign items bargains and the best marijuana cigarettes to be had were made of the gunja and kisca that merchant sailors smuggled in from africa and persia

in the daytime whites were given a guarded treatment whites who came at night got a better reception the several harlem nightclubs they patronized were geared to entertain and jive the night white crowd to get their money

and with so many law agencies guarding the morals of servicemen any of them that came in and a lot did were given what they asked for and were spoken to if they spoke and that was all unless someone knew them as natives of harlem

what i was learning was the hustling societys first rule that you never trusted anyone outside of your own closemouthed circle and that you selected with time and care before you made any intimates even among these

the bartenders would let me know which among the regular customers were mostly fronts and which really had something going which were really in the underworld with downtown police or political connections which really handled some money and which were making it from day to day which were the real gamblers and which had just hit a little luck and which ones never to run afoul of in any way

the latter were extremely well known about harlem and they were feared and respected it was known that if upset they would break open your head and think nothing of it these were oldtimers not to be confused with the various hotheaded wild young hustlers out trying to make a name for themselves for being crazy with a pistol trigger or a knife the old heads that im talking about were such as black sammy bub hewlett king padmore and west indian archie most of these tough ones had worked as strongarm men for dutch schultz back when he muscled into the harlem numbers industry after white gangsters had awakened to the fortunes being made in what they had previously considered nigger pennies and the numbers game was referred to by the white racketeers as nigger pool

those tough negroes heyday had been before the big 1931 seabury investigation that started dutch schultz on the way out until his career ended with his 1934 assassination i heard stories of how they had persuaded people with lead pipes wet cement baseball bats brass knuckles fists feet and blackjacks nearly every one of them had done some time and had come back on the scene and since had worked as top runners for the biggest bankers who specialized in large bettors

there seemed to be an understanding that these negroes and the tough black cops never clashed i guess both knew that someone would die they had some bad black cops in harlem too the four horsemen that worked sugar hill  i remember the worst one had freckles  there was a tough quartet the biggest blackest worst cop of them all in harlem was the west indian brisbane negroes crossed the street to avoid him when he walked his 125th street and seventh avenue beat when i was in prison someone brought me a story that brisbane had been shot to death by a scared nervous young kid who hadnt been up from the south long enough to realize how bad brisbane was

the worlds mostly unlikely pimp was cadillac drake he was shiny baldheaded built like a football he used to call his huge belly the chippies playground cadillac had a string of about a dozen of the stringiest scrawniest black and white street prostitutes in harlem afternoons around the bar the oldtimers who knew cadillac well enough would tease him about how women who looked like his made enough to feed themselves let alone him hed roar with laughter right along with us i can hear him now badlooking women work harder

just about the complete opposite of cadillac was the young smooth independentacting pimp sammy the pimp he could as i have mentioned pick out potential prostitutes by watching their expressions in dance halls sammy and i became in time each others closest friend sammy who was from kentucky was a cool collected expert in his business and his business was women like cadillac he too had both black and white women out making his living but sammys women  who would come into smalls sometimes looking for him to give him money and have him buy them a drink  were about as beautiful as any prostitutes who operated anywhere id imagine

one of his white women known as alabama peach a blonde could put everybody in stitches with her drawl even the several negro women numbers controllers around smalls really liked her what made a lot of negroes around the bar laugh the hardest was the way she would take three syllables to say nigger but what she usually was saying was ah jes luuv niuhguhs  give her two drinks and she would tell her life story in a minute how in whatever little alabama town it was she came from the first thing she remembered being conscious of was that she was supposed to hate niggers and then she started hearing older girls in grade school whispering the hushhush that niggers were such sexual giants and athletes and she started growing up secretly wanting to try one finally right in her own house with her family away she threatened a negro man who worked for her father that if he didnt take her she would swear he tried rape he had no choice except that he quit working for them and from then until she finished high school she managed it several times with other negroes  and she somehow came to new york and went straight to harlem later on sammy told me how he had happened to spot her in the savoy not even dancing with anybody just standing on the sidelines watching and he could tell and once she really went for negroes the more the better sammy said and wouldnt have a white man i have wondered what ever became of her

there was a big fat pimp we called dollarbill he loved to flash his kansas city roll probably fifty onedollar bills folded with a twenty on the inside and a onehundred dollar bill on the outside we always wondered what dollarbill would do if someone ever stole his hundreddollar cover
a man who in his prime could have stolen dollarbills whole roll blindfolded was threadbare comic old fewclothes fewclothes had been one of the best pickpockets in harlem back when the white people swarmed up every night in the 1920s but then during the depression he had contracted a bad case of arthritis in his hands his finger joints were knotted and gnarled so that it made people uncomfortable to look at them rain sleet or snow every afternoon about six fewclothes would be at smalls telling tall tales about the old days and it was one of the days rituals for one or another regular customer to ask the bartender to give him drinks and me to feed him

my heart goes out to all of us who in those afternoons at smalls enacted our scene with fewclothes i wish you could have seen him pleasantly high with drinks take his seat with dignity  no begging not on anybodys welfare  and open his napkin and study the days menu that i gave him and place his order id tell the cooks it was fewclothes and hed get the best in the house id go back and serve it as though he were a millionaire

many times since i have thought about it and what it really meant in one sense we were huddled in there bonded together in seeking security and warmth and comfort from each other and we didnt know it all of us  who might have probed space or cured cancer or built industries  were instead black victims of the white mans american social system in another sense the tragedy of the once master pickpocket made him for those brother oldtimer hustlers a there but for the grace of god symbol to wolves who still were able to catch some rabbits it had meaning that an old wolf who had lost his fangs was still eating

then there was the burglar jumpsteady in the ghettoes the white man has built for us he has forced us not to aspire to greater things but to view everyday living as survival  and in that kind of a community survival is what is respected in any average white neighborhood bar you couldnt imagine a known catman thief regularly exposing himself as one of the most popular people in there but if jumpsteady missed a few days running in smalls we would begin inquiring for him

jumpsteady was called that because it was said when he worked in white residential areas downtown he jumped from roof to roof and was so steady that he maneuvered along window ledges leaning balancing edging with his toes if he fell hed have been dead he got into apartments through windows it was said that he was so cool that he had stolen even with people in the next room i later found out that jumpsteady always keyed himself up high on dope when he worked he taught me some things that i was to employ in later years when hard times would force me to have my own burglary ring

i should stress that smalls wasnt any nest of criminals i dwell upon the hustlers because it was their world that fascinated me actually for the nightlife crowd smalls was one of harlems two or three most decorous night spots in fact the new york city police department recommended smalls to white people who would ask for a safe place in harlem

the first room i got after i left the railroad half of harlem roomed was in the 800 block of st nicholas avenue you could walk into one or another room in this house and get a hot fur coat a good camera fine perfume a gun anything from hot women to hot cars even hot ice i was one of the very few males in this rooming house this was during the war when you couldnt turn on the radio and not hear about guadalcanal or north africa in several of the apartments the women tenants were prostitutes the minority were in some other racket or hustle  boosters numbers runners or dopepeddlers  and id guess that everyone who lived in the house used dope of some kind this shouldnt reflect too badly on that particular building because almost everyone in harlem needed some kind of hustle to survive and needed to stay high in some way to forget what they had to do to survive

it was in this house that i learned more about women than i ever did in any other single place it was these working prostitutes who schooled me to things that every wife and every husband should know later on it was chiefly the women who werent prostitutes who taught me to be very distrustful of most women there seemed to be a higher code of ethics and sisterliness among those prostitutes than among numerous ladies of the church who have more men for kicks than the prostitutes have for pay and i am talking about both black and white many of the black ones in those wartime days were right in step with the white ones in having husbands fighting overseas while they were laying up with other men even giving them their husbands money and many women just faked as mothers and wives while playing the field as hard as prostitutes  with their husbands and children right there in new york

i got my first schooling about the cesspool morals of the white man from the best possible source from his own women and then as i got deeper into my own life of evil i saw the white mans morals with my own eyes i even made my living helping to guide him to the sick things he wanted

i was young working in the bar not bothering with these women probably i touched their kidbrother instincts something like that some would drop into my room when they werent busy and we would smoke reefers and talk it generally would be after their morning rush  but let me tell you about that rush

seeing the hallways and stairs busy any hour of the night with white and black men coming and going was no more than one would expect when one lived in a building out of which prostitutes were working but what astonished me was the fullhouse crowd that rushed in between say six and seventhirty in the morning then rushed away and by about nine i would be the only man in the house

it was husbands  who had left home in time to stop by this st nicholas avenue house before they went on to work of course not the same ones every day but always enough of them to make up the rush and it included white men who had come in cabs all the way up from downtown

domineering complaining demanding wives who had just about psychologically castrated their husbands were responsible for the early rush these wives were so disagreeable and had made their men so tense that they were robbed of the satisfaction of being men to escape this tension and the chance of being ridiculed by his own wife each of these men had gotten up early and come to a prostitute
the prostitutes had to make it their business to be students of men they said that after most men passed their virile twenties they went to bed mainly to satisfy their egos and because a lot of women dont understand it that way they damage and wreck a mans ego no matter how little virility a man has to offer prostitutes make him feel for a time that he is the greatest man in the world thats why these prostitutes had that morning rush of business more wives could keep their husbands if they realized their greatest urge is to be men

those women would tell me anything funny little stories about the bedroom differences they saw between white and black men the perversities i thought i had heard the whole range of perversities until i later became a steerer taking white men to what they wanted everyone in the house laughed about the little italian fellow whom they called the ten dollar a minute man he came without fail every noontime from his little basement restaurant up near the polo grounds the joke was he never lasted more than two minutes    but he always left twenty dollars

most men the prostitutes felt were too easy to push around every day these prostitutes heard their customers complaining that they never heard anything but griping from women who were being taken care of and given everything the prostitutes said that most men needed to know what the pimps knew a woman should occasionally be babied enough to show her the man had affection but beyond that she should be treated firmly these tough women said that it worked with them all women by their nature are fragile and weak they are attracted to the male in whom they see strength

from time to time sophia would come over to see me from boston even among harlem negroes her looks gave me status they were just like the negroes everywhere else that was why the white prostitutes made so much money it didnt make any difference if you were in lansing boston or new york  what the white racist said and still says was right in those days all you had to do was put a white girl anywhere close to the average black man and he would respond the black woman also made the white mans eyes light up  but he was slick enough to hide it

sophia would come in on a late afternoon train she would come to smalls and id introduce her around until i got off from work she was bothered about me living among the prostitutes until i introduced her to some of them and they talked and she thought they were great they would tell her they were keeping me straight for her we would go to the braddock hotel bar where we would meet some of the musicians who now would greet me like an old friend hey red  who have we got here they would make a big deal over her i couldnt even think about buying a drink no negroes in the world were more whitewomancrazy in those days than most of those musicians people in show business of course were less inhibited by social and racial taboos

the white racist wont tell you that it also works in reverse when it got late sophia and i would go to some of the afterhours places and speakeasies when the downtown nightclubs had closed most of these harlem places crawled with white people these whites were just mad for negro atmosphere especially some of the places which had what you might call negro soul sometimes negroes would talk about how a lot of whites seemed unable to have enough of being close around us and among us  in groups both white men and women it seemed would get almost mesmerized by negroes

i remember one really peculiar case of this  a white girl who never missed a single night in the savoy ballroom she fascinated my friend sammy he had watched her several times dancing only with negroes she seemed to go nearly into a trance if a white man asked her to dance she would refuse then when the place was ready to close early in the morning she would let a negro take her as far as the subway entrance and that was it she never would tell anyone her name let alone reveal where she lived

now ill tell you another peculiar case that worked out differently and which taught me something i have since learned in a thousand other ways this was my best early lesson in how most white mens hearts and guts will turn over inside of them whatever they may have you otherwise believe whenever they see a negro man on close terms with a white woman

a few of the white men around harlem younger ones whom we called hippies acted more negro than negroes this particular one talked more hip talk than we did he would have fought anyone who suggested he felt any race difference musicians around the braddock could hardly move without falling over him every time i saw him it was daddy come on lets get our heads tight sammy couldnt stand him he was underfoot wherever you went he even wore a wild zoot suit used a heavy grease in his hair to make it look like a conk and he wore the knobtoed shoes the long swinging chain  everything and he not only wouldnt be seen with any woman but a black one but in fact he lived with two of them in the same little apartment i never was sure how they worked that one out but i had my idea

about three or four oclock one morning we ran into this white boy in creole bills speakeasy he was high  in that marijuana glow where the world relaxes i introduced sophia i went away to say hello to someone else when i returned sophia looked peculiar  but she wouldnt tell me until we left he had asked her why is a white girl like you throwing yourself away with a spade

creole bill  naturally you know he was from new orleans  became another good friend of mine after smalls closed id bring fastspending white people who still wanted some drinking action to creole bills speakeasy that was my earliest experience at steering the speakeasy was only creole bills apartment i think a partition had been knocked out to make the living room larger but the atmosphere plus the food made the place one of harlems soul spots

a record player maintained the right soft music there was any kind of drink and bill sold plates of his spicy delicious creole dishes  gumbo jambalaya bills girl friend  a beautiful black girl  served the customers bill called her brown sugar and finally everyone else did if a good number of customers were to be served at one time creole bill would bring out some pots brown sugar would bring the plates and bill would serve everyone big platefuls and hed heap a plate for himself and eat with us it was a treat to watch him eat he loved his food so it was good bill could cook rice like the chinese  i mean rice that stood every grain on its own but i never knew the chinese to do what bill could with seafood and beans

bill made money enough in that apartment speakeasy to open up a creole restaurant famous in harlem he was a great baseball fan all over the walls were framed autographed photographs of major league stars and also some political and show business celebrities who would come there to eat bringing friends i wonder whats become of creole bill his place is sold and i havent heard anything of him i must remember to ask some of the seventh avenue oldtimers who would know

once when i called sophia in boston she said she couldnt get away until the following weekend she had just married some welltodo boston white fellow he was in the service he had been home on leave and he had just gone back she didnt mean it to change a thing between us i told her it made no difference i had of course introduced sophia to my friend sammy and we had gone out together some nights and sammy and i had thoroughly discussed the black man and white woman psychology i had sammy to thank that i was entirely prepared for sophias marriage

sammy said that white women were very practical he had heard so many of them express how they felt they knew that the black man had all the strikes against him that the white man kept the black man down under his heel unable to get anywhere really the white woman wanted to be comfortable she wanted to be looked upon with favor by her own kind but also she wanted to have her pleasure so some of them just married a white man for convenience and security and kept right on going with a negro it wasnt that they were necessarily in love with the negro but they were in love with lust  particularly taboo lust

a white man was not too unusual if he had a ten twenty thirty forty or fiftythousanddollarayear job a negro man who made even five thousand in the white mans world was unusual the white woman with a negro man would be with him for one of two reasons either extremely insane love or to satisfy her lust

when i had been around harlem long enough to show signs of permanence inevitably i got a nickname that would identify me beyond any confusion with two other redconked and wellknown reds who were around i had met them both in fact later on id work with them both one st louis red was a professional armed robber when i was sent to prison he was serving time for trying to stick up a dining car steward on a train between new york and philadelphia he was finally freed now i hear he is in prison for a new york city jewel robbery

the other was chicago red we became good buddies in a speakeasy where later on i was a waiter chicago red was the funniest dishwasher on this earth now hes making his living being funny as a nationally known stage and nightclub comedian i dont see any reason why old chicago red would mind me telling that he is redd foxx

anyway before long my nickname happened just when i dont know  but people knowing i was from michigan would ask me what city since most new yorkers had never heard of lansing i would name detroit gradually i began to be called detroit red  and it stuck

one afternoon in early 1943 before the regular six oclock crowd had gathered a black soldier sat drinking by himself at one of my tables he must have been there an hour or more he looked dumb and pitiful and just up from the deep south the fourth or fifth drink i served this soldier wiping the table i bent over close and asked him if he wanted a woman

i knew better it wasnt only smalls paradise law it was the law of every tavern that wanted to stay in business  never get involved with anything that could be interpreted as impairing the morals of servicemen or any kind of hustling off them this had caused trouble for dozens of places some had been put off limits by the military some had lost their state or city licenses

i played right into the hands of a military spy he sure would like a woman he acted so grateful he even put on an extreme southern accent and i gave him the phone number of one of my best friends among the prostitutes where i lived

but something felt wrong i gave the fellow a halfhour to get there and then i telephoned i expected the answer i got  that no soldier had been there

i didnt even bother to go back out to the bar i just went straight to charlie smalls office

i just did something charlie i said i dont know why i did it  and i told him

charlie looked at me i wish you hadnt done that red we both knew what he meant

when the west indian plainclothes detective joe baker came in i was waiting i didnt even ask him any questions when we got to the 135th street precinct it was busy with police in uniform and mps with soldiers in tow i was recognized by some other detectives who like joe baker sometimes dropped in at smalls

two things were in my favor id never given the police any trouble and when that black spy soldier had tried to tip me i had waved it away telling him i was just doing him a favor they must have agreed that joe baker should just scare me

i didnt know enough to be aware that i wasnt taken to the desk and booked joe baker took me back inside of the precinct building into a small room in the next room we could hear somebody getting whipped whop whop hed cry out please please dont beat my face thats how i make my living i knew from that it was some pimp whop whop please please

not much later i heard that joe baker had gotten trapped over in new jersey shaking down a negro pimp and his white prostitute he was discharged from the new york city police force the state of new jersey convicted him and he went off to do some time

more bitter than getting fired i was barred from smalls i could understand even if i wasnt actually what was called hot i was now going to be under surveillance  and the small brothers had to protect their business

sammy proved to be my friend in need he put the word on the wire for me to come over to his place i had never been there his place seemed to me a small palace his women really kept him in style while we talked about what kind of a hustle

i should get into sammy gave me some of the best marijuana id ever used

various numbers controllers smalls regulars had offered me jobs as a runner but that meant i would earn very little until i could build up a clientele pimping as sammy did was out i felt i had no abilities in that direction and that id certainly starve to death trying to recruit prostitutes

peddling reefers sammy and i pretty soon agreed was the best thing it was a relatively uninvolved lonewolf type of operation and one in which i could make money immediately for anyone with even a little brains no experience was needed especially if one had any knack at all with people

both sammy and i knew some merchant seamen and others who could supply me with loose marijuana and musicians among whom i had so many good contacts were the heaviest consistent market for reefers and then musicians also used the heavier narcotics if i later wanted to graduate to them that would be more risky but also more money handling heroin and cocaine could earn one hundreds of dollars a day but it required a lot of experience with the narcotics squad for one to be able to last long enough to make anything

i had been around long enough either to know or to spot instinctively most regular detectives and cops though not the narcotics people and among the smalls veteran hustler regulars i had a variety of potentially helpful contacts this was important because just as sammy could get me supplied with marijuana a large facet of any hustlers success was knowing where he could get help when he needed it the help could involve police and detectives  as well as higher ups but i hadnt yet reached that stage so sammy staked me about twenty dollars i think it was

later that same night i knocked at his door and gave him back his money and asked him if i could lend him some i had gone straight from sammys to a supplier he had mentioned i got just a small amount of marijuana and i got some of the paper to roll up my own sticks as they were only about the size of stick matches i was able to make enough of them so that after selling them to musicians i knew at the braddock hotel i could pay back sammy and have enough profit to be in business and those musicians when they saw their buddy and their fan in business my man crazy red

in every band at least half of the musicians smoked reefers im not going to list names id have to include some of those most prominent then in popular music even a number of them around today in one case every man in one of the bands which is still famous was on marijuana or again any number of musicians could tell you who i mean when i say that one of the most famous singers smoked his reefers through a chicken thighbone he had smoked so many through the bone that he could just light a match before the empty bone draw the heat through and get what he called a contact high

i kept turning over my profit increasing my supplies and i sold reefers like a wild man i scarcely slept i was wherever musicians congregated a roll of money was in my pocket every day i cleared at least fifty or sixty dollars in those days or for that matter these days this was a fortune to a seventeenyearold negro i felt for the first time in my life that great feeling of free suddenly now i was the peer of the other young hustlers i had admired

it was at this time that i discovered the movies sometimes i made as many as five in one day both downtown and in harlem i loved the tough guys the action humphrey bogart in casablanca and i loved all of that dancing and carrying on in such films as stormy weather and cabin in the sky after leaving the movies id make my connections for supplies then roll my sticks and about dark id start my rounds id give a couple of extra sticks when someone bought ten which was five dollars worth and i didnt sell and run because my customers were my friends often id smoke along with them none of them stayed any more high than i did

free now to do what i pleased upon an impulse i went to boston of course i saw ella i gave her some money it was just a token of appreciation i told her for helping me when i had come from lansing she wasnt the same old ella she still hadnt forgiven me for laura she never mentioned her nor did i but even so ella acted better than she had when i had left for new york we reviewed the family changes wilfred had proved so good at his trade they had asked him to stay on at wilberforce as an instructor and ella had gotten a card from reginald who had managed to get into the merchant marine

from shortys apartment i called sophia she met me at the apartment just about as shorty went off to work i would have liked to take her out to some of the roxbury clubs but shorty had told us that as in new york the boston cops used the war as an excuse to harass interracial couples stopping them and grilling the negro about his draft status of course sophias now being married made us more cautious too

when sophia caught a cab home i went to hear shortys band yes he had a band now he had succeeded in getting a 4f classification and i was pleased for him and happy to go his band was  well fair but shorty was making out well in boston playing in small clubs back in the apartment we talked into the next day homeboy youre something else shorty kept saying i told him some of the wild things id done in harlem and about the friends i had i told him the story of sammy the pimp

in sammys native paducah kentucky he had gotten a girl pregnant her parents made it so hot that sammy had come to harlem where he got a job as a restaurant waiter when a woman came in to eat alone and he found she really was alone not married or living with somebody it generally was not hard for smooth sammy to get invited to her apartment hed insist on going out to a nearby restaurant to bring back some dinner and while he was out he would have her key duplicated then when he knew she was away sammy would go in and clean out all her valuables sammy was then able to offer some little stake to help her back on her feet this could be the beginning of an emotional and financial dependency which sammy knew how to develop until she was his virtual slave

around harlem the narcotics squad detectives didnt take long to find out i was selling reefers and occasionally one of them would follow me many a peddler was in jail because he had been caught with the evidence on his person i figured a way to avoid that the law specified that if the evidence wasnt actually in your possession you couldnt be arrested hollowedout shoe heels fake hatlinings these things were old stuff to the detectives

i carried about fifty sticks in a small package inside my coat under my armpit keeping my arm flat against my side moving about i kept my eyes open if anybody looked suspicious id quickly cross the street or go through a door or turn a corner loosening my arm enough to let the package drop at night when i usually did my selling any suspicious person wouldnt be likely to see the trick if i decided i had been mistaken id go back and get my sticks

however i lost many a stick this way sometimes i knew i had frustrated a detective and i kept out of the courts

one morning though i came in and found signs that my room had been entered i knew it had been detectives id heard too many times how if they couldnt find any evidence they would plant some where you would never find it then theyd come back in and find it i didnt even have to think twice what to do i packed my few belongings and never looked back when i went to sleep again it was in another room

it was then that i began carrying a little 25 automatic i got it for some reefers from an addict who i knew had stolen it somewhere i carried it pressed under my belt right down the center of my back someone had told me that the cops never hit there in any routine pattingdown and unless i knew who i was with i never allowed myself to get caught in any crush of people the narcotics cops had been known to rush up and get their hands on you and plant evidence while searching i felt that as long as i kept on the go and in the open i had a good chance i dont know now what my real thoughts were about carrying the pistol but i imagine i felt that i wasnt going to get put away if somebody tried framing me in any situation that i could help

i sold less than before because having to be so careful consumed so much time every now and then on a hunch id move to another room i told nobody but sammy where i slept

finally it was on the wire that the harlem narcotics squad had me on its special list

now every other day or so usually in some public place they would flash the badge to search me but id tell them at once loud enough for others standing about to hear me that i had nothing on me and i didnt want to get anything planted on me then they wouldnt because harlem already thought little enough of the law and they did have to be careful that some crowd of negroes would not intervene roughly negroes were starting to get very tense in harlem one could almost smell trouble ready to break out  as it did very soon

but it was really tough on me then i was having to hide my sticks in various places near where i was selling id put five sticks in an empty cigarette pack and drop the emptylooking pack by a lamppost or behind a garbage can or a box and id first tell customers to pay me and then where to pick up

but my regular customers didnt go for that you couldnt expect a wellknown musician to go grubbing behind a garbage can so i began to pick up some of the street trade the people you could see looked high i collected a number of empty red cross bandage boxes and used them for drops that worked pretty good

but the middleharlem narcotics force found so many ways to harass me that i had to change my area i moved down to lower harlem around 110th street there were many more reefer smokers around there but these were a cheaper type this was the worst of the ghetto the poorest people the ones who in every ghetto keep themselves narcotized to keep from having to face their miserable existence i didnt last long down there either i lost too much of my product after i sold to some of those reefer smokers who had the instincts of animals they followed me and learned my pattern they would dart out of a doorway id drop my stuff and they would be on it like a chicken on corn when you become an animal a vulture in the ghetto as i had become you enter a world of animals and vultures it becomes truly the survival of only the fittest

soon i found myself borrowing little stakes from sammy from some of the musicians enough to buy supplies enough to keep high myself enough sometimes to just eat

then sammy gave me an idea

red you still got your old railroad identification i did have it they hadnt taken it back well why dont you use it to make a few runs until the heat cools

he was right

i found that if you walked up and showed a railroad lines employee identification card the conductor  even a real cracker if you approached him right not begging  would just wave you aboard and when he came around he would punch you one of those little coach seat slips to ride wherever the train went

the idea came to me that this way i could travel all over the east coast selling reefers among my friends who were on tour with their bands

i had the new haven identification i worked a couple of weeks for other railroads to get their identification and then i was set

in new york i rolled and packed a great quantity of sticks and sealed them into jars the identification card worked perfectly if you persuaded the conductor you were a fellow employee who had to go home on some family business he just did the favor for you without a second thought most whites dont give a negro credit for having sense enough to fool them  or nerve enough

id turn up in towns where my friends were playing red i was an old friend from home in the sticks i was somebody from the braddock hotel my man daddyo and i had big apple reefers nobody had ever heard of a traveling reefer peddler

i followed no particular band each bands musicians knew the other bands onenighter touring schedules when i ran out of supplies id return to new york and load up then hit the road again auditoriums or gymnasiums all lighted up the bands chartered bus outside the dressedup excited local dancers pouring in at the door id announce that i was some bandmans brother in most cases they thought i was one of the musicians throughout the dance id show the country folks some plain and fancy lindyhopping sometimes id stay overnight in a town sometimes id ride the bands bus to their next stop sometimes back in new york i would stay awhile things had cooled down word was around that i had left town and the narcotics squad was satisfied with that in some of the small towns people thinking i was with the band even mobbed me for autographs once in buffalo my suit was nearly torn off

my brother reginald was waiting for me one day when i pulled into new york the day before his merchant ship had put into port over in new jersey thinking i still worked at smalls reginald had gone there and the bartenders had directed him to sammy who put him up

it felt good to see my brother it was hard to believe that he was once the little kid who tagged after me reginald now was almost six feet tall but still a few inches shorter than me his complexion was darker than mine but he had greenish eyes and a white streak in his hair which was otherwise dark reddish something like mine

i took reginald everywhere introducing him studying my brother i liked him he was a lot more selfpossessed than i had been at sixteen

i didnt have a room right at the time but i had some money so did reginald and we checked into the st nicholas hotel on sugar hill it has since been torn down

reginald and i talked all night about the lansing years about our family i told him things about our father and mother that he couldnt remember then reginald filled me in on our brothers and sisters wilfred was still a trade instructor at wilberforce university hilda still in lansing was talking of getting married so was philbert

reginald and i were the next two in line and yvonne wesley and robert were still in lansing in school

reginald and i laughed about philbert who the last time i had seen him had gotten deeply religious he wore one of those round straw hats

reginalds ship was in for about a week getting some kind of repairs on its engines i was pleased to see that reginald though he said little about it admired my living by my wits reginald dressed a little too loudly i thought i got a reefer customer of mine to get him a more conservative overcoat and suit i told reginald what i had learned that in order to get something you had to look as though you already had something

before reginald left i urged him to leave the merchant marine and i would help him get started in harlem i must have felt that having my kid brother around me would be a good thing then there would be two people i could trust  sammy was the other

reginald was cool at his age i would have been willing to run behind the train to get to new york and to harlem but reginald when he left said ill think about it

not long after reginald left i dragged out the wildest zoot suit in new york this was 1943 the boston draft board had written me at ellas and when they had no results there had notified the new york draft board and in care of sammy i received uncle sams greetings

in those days only three things in the world scared me jail a job and the army i had about ten days before i was to show up at the induction center i went right to work the army intelligence soldiers those black spies in civilian clothes hung around in harlem with their ears open for the white man downtown i knew exactly where to start dropping the word i started noising around that i was frantic to join    the japanese army

when i sensed that i had the ears of the spies i would talk and act high and crazy a lot of harlem hustlers actually had reached that state  as i would later it was inevitable when one had gone long enough on heavier and heavier narcotics and under the steadily tightening vise of the hustling life id snatch out and read my greetings aloud to make certain they heard who i was and when id report downtown this was probably the only time my real name was ever heard in harlem in those days

the day i went down there i costumed like an actor with my wild zoot suit i wore the yellow knobtoe shoes and i frizzled my hair up into a reddish bush of conk

i went in skipping and tipping and i thrust my tattered greetings at that reception desks white soldier  crazyo daddyo get me moving i cant wait to get in that brown  very likely that soldier hasnt recovered from me yet

they had their wire on me from uptown all right but they still put me through the line in that big starting room were forty or fifty other prospective inductees the room had fallen vacuumquiet with me running my mouth a mile a minute talking nothing but slang i was going to fight on all fronts i was going to be a general man before i got done  such talk as that

most of them were white of course the tenderlooking ones appeared ready to run from me some others had that vinegary worst kind of nigger look and a few were amused seeing me as the harlem jigaboo archetype

also amused were some of the rooms ten or twelve negroes but the stonyfaced rest of them looked as if they were ready to sign up to go off killing somebody  they would have liked to start with me

the line moved along pretty soon stripped to my shorts i was making my eagertojoin comments in the medical examination rooms  and everybody in the white coats that i saw had 4f in his eyes

i stayed in the line longer than i expected before they siphoned me off one of the white coats accompanied me around a turning hallway i knew we were on the way to a headshrinker  the army psychiatrist

the receptionist there was a negro nurse i remember she was in her early twenties and not bad to look at she was one of those negro firsts

negroes know what im talking about back then the white man during the war was so pressed for personnel that he began letting some negroes put down their buckets and mops and dust rags and use a pencil or sit at some desk or hold some twentyfivecent title you couldnt read the negro press for the big pictures of smug black firsts

somebody was inside with the psychiatrist i didnt even have to put on any act for this black girl she was already sick of me

when finally a buzz came at her desk she didnt send me she went in i knew what she was doing she was going to make clear in advance what she thought of me this is still one of the black mans big troubles today so many of those socalled upperclass negroes are so busy trying to impress on the white man that they are different from those others that they cant see they are only helping the white man to keep his low opinion of all negroes

and then with her prestige in the clear she came out and nodded to me to go in

i must say this for that psychiatrist he tried to be objective and professional in his manner he sat there and doodled with his blue pencil on a tablet listening to me spiel to him for three or four minutes before he got a word in

his tack was quiet questions to get at why i was so anxious i didnt rush him i circled and hedged watching him closely to let him think he was pulling what he wanted out of me i kept jerking around backward as though somebody might be listening i knew i was going to send him back to the books to figure what kind of a case i was

suddenly i sprang up and peeped under both doors the one id entered and another that probably was a closet and then i bent and whispered fast in his ear daddyo now you and me were from up north here so dont you tell nobody    i want to get sent down south organize them nigger soldiers you dig steal us some guns and kill us crackers

that psychiatrists blue pencil dropped and his professional manner fell off in all directions he stared at me as if i were a snakes egg hatching fumbling for his red pencil i knew i had him i was going back out past miss first when he said that will be all

a 4f card came to me in the mail and i never heard from the army anymore and never bothered to ask why i was rejected2embed"
