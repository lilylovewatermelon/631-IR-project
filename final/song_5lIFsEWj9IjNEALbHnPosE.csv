the birds they sang
the break of day
start again i hear them say
its so hard to just walk away
the birds they sang
all a choir
start again a little higher
its a spark in a sea of grey

chorus 1
the sky is blue
dreamed that lie til its true
then taking back the punch i threw
my arms turn wings
oh those clumsy things
send me up to that wonderful world
and then im up with the birds

instrumental break

verse 2
might have to go where they dont know my name
float all over the world just to see her again
but i wont show or feel any pain
even though all my armor might rust in the rain
see coldplay liveget tickets as low as 113you might also likechorus 2
a simple plot
but i know one day
good things are coming our way
a simple plot
but i know one day
good things are coming our way
