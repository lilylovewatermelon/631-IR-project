boomin out the trap through the hallway
tell me what you niggas know about it
auntie sayin turn it down or she finna call the cops
we be plottin on the opps she the one who got the drop
just a free quick fix of the a and its okay
they gon take me back to my old ways
i was tryna chill poppin seals ever since i got a deal
kick it with my model chick sip cris fuck niggas wanna diss
now i gotta let em know whos really trill

chorus
lord pretty flacko jodye

on the side who gave em style nine times out of ten
