yeah yeah

verse
you believe that id just up and forget that shit
i mean at the start i thought about letting this go
adam and eve i know they wish they never did that shit
it was still in the garden but some things we just have to let go
jokes on me i gave up all this pussy cat thats in my lap
no looking back and watched you leave from me
but is the joke on me or you cause that new nigga that you got hes not flea
hes not flea hes not flea
and not only that hes not me
hes not me
you believe at times i mistaked what your worth is
i believe all i did was try to show you purpose
we believe ooh we believe
if we wouldve met different times in life then this shit wouldve been perfect
but its imperfect baby
and is it worth it baby
calling me perfect baby
and then just turning around and bringing me down like im worthless baby
then you got the nerve to snap at me when i bring it up to the surface baby
i mean the double standard it get crazy
the double standard it get wild
i wanted you to have my fuckin baby
now im standing with this crooked smile
does that other nigga make you smile
do that other nigga make you crazy
cause these other niggas they be hating yeah uh
i heard another nigga got your body
i heard another nigga got your soul
i know another nigga got it sewed up uh
its only your body shawty it be scrollin
beat the pussy til its swollen
give a fuck who i offend oh
sippin don p got us open
if youre horny bust it open
baby trust me im chosen uh
but i dont stress the odds
cause with all the odds against me i still thought that i was better than we thought
and i dont question god
but god why did you have to give her someone better than me
knife inside my heart and it keep stabbing
embarrassed of the times that i was bragging
through all the embarrassment i want you back in back in back in
oh no uh look
i know im toxic
you know im toxic
your momma know we toxic
she insist we stop this
but i insist that we hop on a jet go to the tropics
and just switch the topic
cause you know all i want is you to see see
cause all i want is you to see a half of me
and i know youll seeyou might also likeembed"
