youre so impossible
scream and moan it chills my soul
dont want to hear you got left behind
all those times you stayed up and cried
its no lie you did it to yourself
like chewedup gum under my shoe
dont look surprised you mustve known all along

chorus
its just another love song
another love song

verse 2
its never easy its not hard
when youve lost your mind
with you its sleazy
dont tell me your worries im sick ill leave you blind
now the time has come
to leave this love thats left you dry
no need to work this out now
cause you know theres no reason why

chorus
its just another love song
another love song
another love song
its just another love song
see queens of the stone age liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeguitar solo

verse 3
i never told you it would last forever
you cant hold this boy for long dig it
by the time you read my letter
baby ill be gone

chorus
youre just another love song
another love song
another love song
youre just another love song
youre just another love song
another love song
another love song
youre just another love song

outro natasha shneider
this is womb the womb
and if you my pets learn to listen
ill let you crawl back in
here is something you should drop to your knees for and worship
but you are too stupid to realize yourselves1embed"
