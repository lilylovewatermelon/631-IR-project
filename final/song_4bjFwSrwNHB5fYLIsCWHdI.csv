run away nowhere
to chicken shit two face
im gonna go there
the fear i cannot taste
you think you got me
youre gonna tumble down
keep coming for me
ill drop you on the ground
i fuck with no one
until you get into my face

chorus
break you down mercy i cannot allow
through your face my fist will plow
watching as your blood pours down
lets do this now
break you down mercy i cannot allow
through your face my fist will plow
watching as your blood pours down
lets do this now

verse 2
youre gonna feel how
i really am with you
youre going nowhere
dont really know what to do
its going to go on
until you run away
you cant control me
you best do it my way
i fuck with no one
until you get into my face
