verse 1
its cool if we aint got everything figured out
cause love aint got all the answers baby
this place we in they dont ever really told me bout it
but that dont mean we cant navigate it

prechorus
its unpredictable but i feel so good about it
a mountain but we can climb it
aint no way to get around it
take this open road
and i wanna get it right

are we gonna walk out when it rains
