him and her
life is turned
the day i knew you would leave
i can barely breathe
can you hear me scream

chorus
you thrown in all directions
you epitome of perfection
shes lost her will shes lost her will
time is standing still

verse 2
he walks her home
now he walks alone
the days they turn into years
the eyes they drown in tears
can you hear me scream

chorus
you thrown in all directions
you epitome of perfection
shes lost her will shes lost her will
time is standing still
see the allamerican rejects liveget tickets as low as 245you might also likebridge
the way we are the way we were
its just a shadow of whats wrong
the time with you the time is stirred
i love you for so long
the hearts they turn they turn away
she says to go please dont you cry
love lost was found night turns to day

chorus
you thrown in all directions
you epitome of perfection
shes lost her will shes lost her will
time is standing still
you thrown in all directions
you epitome of perfection
shes lost her will shes lost her will
time is standing still1embed"
