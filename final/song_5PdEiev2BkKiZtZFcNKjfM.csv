i dont see you like i should
you look so misunderstood
and i wish i could help
but its hard when i hate myself
pray to god with my arms open
if this is it then i feel hopeless
and i wish i could help
but its hard when i hate myself

verse 1
yeah late nights are the worst for me
they bring out the worst in me
mind runnin got me feelin like it hurts to think
if this is all that i wanted i dont want it gotta be more for me
all the core beliefs
and every mornin i wake up and feel like i am not worth it cause im at war with peace
i go to hell walk up to the corpse of me
look at the body like you aint nothin but poor and weak
its kinda weird
lately i been feelin like the only way for me to get away is if i poured a drink
thats more deceit more defeat
is this really what im born to be
thats what you get for thinkin youre unique
so poor but im so wealthy
need help but you cant help me
what else can the world sell me
tell me lies i still buy em like theyre goin outta stock
but its not healthy

i dont see you like i should
you look so misunderstood
and i wish i could help
but its hard when i hate myself
pray to god with my arms open
if this is it then i feel hopeless
and i wish i could help
but its hard when i hate myself

verse 2
yeah late nights get the best of me
they know how to get to me
suicide thoughts come and go like a guest to me
but i dont wanna die i just wanna get relief
so dont talk to me like you think im so successful
what is success when hope has left you
i am not a spokesman im a broken wreck
whos sick of doin interviews cause i hate myself agh
come across like its so easy
but i feel like you dont need me
when i feel like you dont need me
then i feel like you dont see me
and my life has no meaning dreaming
hands out tryna ask for love
but when i get it i just pass it up
throw it away and think about it later
diggin through the trash for drugs
wish i could give you what you needed but i cant
im scared because
chorus
i dont see you like i should
you look so misunderstood
and i wish i could help
but its hard when i hate myself
pray to god with my arms open
if this is it then i feel hopeless
and i wish i could help
but its hard when i hate myself

verse 3
i walk through the ashes of my passions
reminiscin with the baggage in my casket
get lost in the questions i cant answer
cant stand who i am but it dont matter
we scream to be free but i stay captured
kneedeep in defeat of my own actions
feel weak but the peace that i keep lacking
keeps speakin to me but i cant have it
but i cant have it
keeps speakin to me but i cant have it
but i cant have it
keeps speakin to me but i cant have it

chorus
i dont see you like i should
you look so misunderstood
and i wish i could help
but its hard when i hate myself
pray to god with my arms open
if this is it then i feel hopeless
and i wish i could help
but its hard when i hate myself
hate myself
but its hard when i hate myself
hate myself
but its hard when i hate myself
outro
when i hate myself
its kinda hard when i hate myself
i hate myself
its hard when i hate myself76embed"
