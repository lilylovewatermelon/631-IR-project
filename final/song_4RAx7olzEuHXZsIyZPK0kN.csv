six million cash in my stash i was waitin for this day to come
im on my tour bus right now on my way to another one
who got that brand new bentley truck im tryna order one
soon as i get me one ima rim it up and tint it up
tried to tell my mama she dont gotta work no job
but she the one who taught her baby boy to hustle hard
say dont you never put your trust in men believe in god
say its some shit from way back in the day that left her scarred
and these niggas love to hate theyd rather go blind than see me winnin
i just did the dash in a maserati engine
been all around the world i met all kind of women
took me to have my own kid to see it different
shout out to all my niggas trappin livin taxfree
these days its seven figures when they tax me
i cant complain i came straight off the back streets
cant explain how i feel im just happy im here
okay hard to tell a nigga not to shine yeah shine
when all he know was hard times
super futuristic coupe 2025
