the more that we take
the paler we get
i cant remember what it is
we try to forget
the tile on the floor
so cold it can sting
in your eyes is a place
worth remembering

bridge
for you to go and take this
and smash it apart
ive gone all this fuckin way
to wind up back at back at the start

chorus
hey the closer we think we are
well it only got us so far
now you got anything left to show
no no i didnt think so
hey the sooner we realize
we cover ourselves with lies
but underneath were not so tough
and love is not enough
see nine inch nails liveget tickets as low as 118you might also likeverse 2
well it hides in the dark
like the witherin vein
we didnt give it a mouth
so it cannot complain
it never really had a chance
we never really make it through
i never think id believe
i believed i could get better with you

chorus
hey the closer we think we are
well it never got us so far
now you got anything left to show
no no no no i didnt think so
hey the sooner we realize the sooner we realize
we cover ourselves with lies
but underneath were not so tough
oh and love is not enough

outro
love is not enough
love is not enough
love is not enough
oh love is not enough
