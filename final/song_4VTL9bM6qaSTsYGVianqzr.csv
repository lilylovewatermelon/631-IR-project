oh if you could see me now
oh if you could see me now

verse 1 danny odonoghue
it was february fourteen valentines day
the roses came but they took you away
tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
gotta keep myself calm but the truth is youre gone
and ill never get to show you these songs
dad you should see the tours that im on
i see you standing there next to mom
both singing along yeah arm in arm
and there are days when im losing my faith
because the man wasnt good he was great
hed say music was the home for your pain
and explain i was young he would say
take that rage put it on a page
take the page to the stage
blow the roof off the place
im tryna make you proud
do everything you did
i hope youre up there with god
saying thats my kid

chorus
i still look for your face in the crowd
oh if you could see me now
oh if you could see me now
would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
oh if you could see me now
oh if you could see me now
oh if you could see me now yeah

if you could see me now would you recognize me
would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me
would you follow every line on my tearstained face
put your hand on a heart that was cold as the day you were taken away
i know its been a while but i could see you clear as day
right now i wish i could hear you say
i drink too much and i smoke too much dutch
but if you cant see me now that shits a must
you used to say i wont know a winner til it crossed me
like i wont know real love till ive loved then ive lost it
so if youve lost a sister someones lost a mom
and if youve lost a dad then someones lost a son
and theyre all missing now and theyre all missing now
so if you get a second to look down at me now
mom dad im just missing you now

chorus
i still look for your face in the crowd
oh if you could see me now
oh if you could see me now
if you could see me now
would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
oh if you could see me now
oh if you could see me now woah
bridge
oh oh
ooh would you call me a saint or a sinner
would you love me a loser or a winner ooh
oh oh
when i see my face in the mirror
we look so alike that it makes me shiver

chorus
i still look for your face in the crowd
oh if you could see me now
oh if you could see me now
would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
oh if you could see me now
oh if you could see me now
yo im just missing you now

i still look for your face in the crowd
oh if you could see me now
oh if you could see me now
would you stand in disgrace or take a bow
oh if you could see me now
oh if you could see me now
oh oh oh
