oh my god i put my pants on insideout
i couldnt tell cause the lights were out
i beat the sunrise again ohohoh
neighbors stare i smile and wave cause i just dont care
theyre probably jealous of my sexy hair
and the heels in my hands

prechorus
well please dont judge it was mad late
i had a lot to drink
but i was only being safe
well

chorus
dont act like you havent been there
7 am with the bed head
everyone knows its the walk of shame but
my daddy knows im a good girl
we all make mistakes in the drunk world
everyone heres done the walk of shame

i might be walking but its only cause im out of breath
dont even try to act like you aint done the same yourself
and if youre gonna do the walk do it like a boss

a little bit of rum in my tummy yum yum
i shook it up and danced like a dummy dumb dumb
he kissed me and called me his bae asked me to stay
how could i turn that away

dont judge it was mad late
i had a lot to drink

7 am with the bed head
