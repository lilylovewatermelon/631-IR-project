i just cant believe youre gone
still waiting for morning to come
wanna see if the sun will rise even without you by my side
when we had so much in store tell me what is it im reaching for
when were through building memories ill hold yesterday in my heart
in my heart

chorus
they can take tomorrow and the plans we made plans we made
they can take the music that we never played
all the broken dreams take everything
just take it away
but they can never have yesterday
they can take the future that well never know
they can take the places that we said we would go
all the broken dreams take everything
just take it away
but they can never have yesterday

verse 2
you always used to say i should be thankful for every day
heaven knows what the future holds or at least how the story goes
but i never believed them til now
i know ill see you again im sure
no its not selfish to ask for more
one more night one more day
one more smile on your face but they cant take yesterday

they can take tomorrow and the plans we made plans we made
they can take the music that we never played
all the broken dreams take everything
just take it away
but they can never have yesterday
they can take the future that well never know
they can take the places that we said we would go
all the broken dreams take everything
just take it away
but they can never have yesterday

verse 3
i thought our days would last forever but it wasnt our destiny
cause in my mind we had so much time
but i was so wrong
now i can believe that i can still find the strength in the moments we made
im looking back on yesterday

chorus
they can take tomorrow and the plans we made plans we made
they can take the music that we never played
all the broken dreams take everything
just take it away
but they can never have yesterday yesterday
they can take the future that well never know
they can take the places that we said we would go
all the broken dreams take everything
just take it away take everything
but they can never have yesterday
outro
all the broken dreams take everything
but they can never have yesterday2embed"
