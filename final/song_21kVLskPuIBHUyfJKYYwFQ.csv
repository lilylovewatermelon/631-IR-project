there aint enough
bourbon in kentucky
for me to forget you
no there aint enough
matches i can strike
to set afire the memory of you
up goes down
rights gone left me behind
wheels spin round
reverse stuck in my mind

chorus
there aint enough
bourbon in kentucky
for me to forget you
no there aint enough
bottles i could break
to make em feel as broken as i do

verse 2
stack up every barrel
since the day it was made
satisfaction guaranteed to kill the pain
but there aint enough
kisses from a stranger
on a long wild night to ever make it alright
if it aint you
in my arms in my bed
yeah to hell with all the rest
once youve had the best nothing else will do
whats the use

there aint enough
bourbon in kentucky
for me to forget you
no there aint enough
bottles i could drink
to make em feel as empty as i do

bridge
with my mouth wide open
in a whiskey rain
i could stand there 24 hours a day

chorus
but there aint enough
bourbon in kentucky
for me to forget you
no there aint enough
bottles i could drink
to make em feel as empty as i do
no there aint enough
bourbon in kentucky
for me to forget you
so forget you1embed"
