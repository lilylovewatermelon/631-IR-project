the sea said goodbye to the shore
so the sun wouldnt notice
the seaweed that wrapped its
arms around you

verse 2 nanna bryndís hilmarsdóttir
the carpet on my cheek
feels like a forest
and i run through the tall trees
with your hand chasing me

verse 3 ragnar
the books that i keep by my bed
are full of your stories
that i drew up from a little dream of mine
a little nightmare of yours

verse 4 nanna  nanna  ragnar
to be us to take this plunge
to forgive and forget
and be the better man to be a better man
to be a better man

chorus nanna  ragnar
so love me mother
and love me father
and love my sister
as well

the cats silhouette
as big as a monster
in this concrete jungle
with street lights hanging their heads

verse 6 ragnar  nanna  ragnar
so make all your last demands
for i will forsake you
and ill meet your eyes for the very first time
for the very last

chorus nanna  ragnar
so love me mother
and love me father
and love my sister
as well

chorus nanna  ragnar
so love me mother
and love me father
and love my brother
as well

chorus nanna  ragnar
so love me mother
and love me father
and love my sister
as well
chorus nanna  ragnar
so love me mother
and love me father
and love my brother
as well

outro nanna  nanna  ragnar
i met a man today
and he smiled back at me
now there are thoughts like these
that keep me on my feet
that keep me on my feet9embed"
