ooh ooh ooh ooh
its a very popular song

verse 1
you liked me til you heard my shit on the radio
well i hate to say but pop aint going solo
you liked me til you heard my shit on the radio
but now im just too mainstream for you oh no
you liked me til you seen me on your tv
well if youre so low below then why you watching
you say good things come to those who wait
ive been waiting a long time for it

chorus
remember the days when i was so eager to satisfy you
be less then i was just to prove i could walk beside you
now that ive flown away i see youve chosen to stay behind me
and still you curse the day i decided to stay true to myself

verse 2
you say your quest is to bring it higher
well i never seen change without a fire
but from your mouth i have seen a lot of burning
but underneath i think its a lot of yearning
your face the colours change from green to yellow
to the point where you cant even say hello
you tell me youd kill me if i ever snob you out
like thats what youd expect from me like thats what im about

and remember the days when i was so eager to satisfy you
and be less then i was just to prove i could walk beside you
now that ive flown away i see youve chosen to stay behind me
and still you curse the day i decided to stay true to myself

bridge
its so much easier to stay down there guaranteeing youre cool
than to sit up here exposing myself trying to break through
than to burn in the spotlight open fire
turn in the spitfire open fire
scream without making a sound open fire
be up here and without looking down open fire
because were all afraid of heights bang bang

chorus
and remember the days when i was so eager to satisfy you
and be less then i was just to prove i could walk beside you
now that ive flown away i see youve chosen to stay behind me
and now you curse the day i decided to stay true to myself

why ya hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me so so myself myself
leave me down down down down low myself
leave me down da down down da down da down down down myself
now im comin at you on the radio tonight myself
because i like my shit really loud and clear over the radio myself
shit on the radio myself
shit on the radio myself
shit on the radio myself
shit on the radio myself
