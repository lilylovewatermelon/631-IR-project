i dont know what it is that youve done to me
but its caused me to act in such a crazy way
whatever it is that you do when you do what youre doing
its a feeling that i want to stay
cause my heart starts beating triple time
with thoughts of lovin you on my mind
i cant figure out just what to do
when the cause and cure is you you

chorus
i get so weak in the knees
i can hardly speak i lose all control
then somethin takes over me
in a daze your loves so amazing
its not a phase
i want you to stay with me by my side
i swallow my pride
your love is so sweet it knocks me right off of my feet
cant explain why your lovin makes me weak

verse 2
time after time after time ive tried to fight it
but your love is strong it keeps on holdin on
resistance is down when youre around prides fading
in my condition i dont want to be alone
cause my heart starts beating triple time
with thoughts of lovin you on my mind
i cant figure out just what to do
when the cause and cure is you you
