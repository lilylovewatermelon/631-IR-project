no pussyfootin or that look of surprise
cant hide the holes in your eyes or cover up that bitter smile
all the birds can see that youre heading south
that mirror deep in your mouth reflects you running on for miles

chorus
when you cut the lights out think of me
when you cut the lights out think of all the things you cant see
but are they real
that face will be revealed
revealed
revealed

verse 2
nobodys callin that payphone in your mind
i wonder just what they find but that lines busy all the time
i aint got nothing but your seed on my face
youll put them babies to waste without your finger in the pie

chorus
when you cut the lights out think of me
when you cut the lights out think of all the things you cant see
but are they real
that face will be revealed
revealed
revealed

my mama told me one thing ill remember till i die
the one you want the most will be the one that you defy
the times theyre gonna love you
like stitches in the scar
you can never run from trouble
cause there aint no place that far

chorus
when you cut the lights out think of me think of me
when you cut the lights out think of all the things you cant see
but are they real
that face will be revealed
revealed
