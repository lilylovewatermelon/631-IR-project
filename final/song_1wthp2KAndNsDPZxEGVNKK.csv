if im underneath the table
then pour me another drink
oh i dont want to remember
i dont even want to think

im a slave to my addiction
im a hazard to myself
on a fast track to perdition
oh im heading straight to hell

prechorus
when i throw up out your window
you should confiscate my key
i will drive you up the fucking wall
is it too late to believe

chorus
i tried so hard to change
but the devil locked my door
i wear these heavy chains around my neck
like a prisoner
i just want to love
but he wont let me go
loosen up my chains
or im a condemned prisoner
see james arthur liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likeverse 2
i was stood there in the spotlight
with this city at my feet
but i was a dead man walking
nothing ever comes for free

so i moved on down to london
where i traded in my soul
i could not fill my heart
with all those one night stands and gold

prechorus
so throw me out your moms house
ive been living there too long
well she never liked me anyway
cause she knows im northern scum

chorus
i tried so hard to change
but the devil locked my door
i wear these heavy chains around my neck
like a prisoner
i just wanna love
but he wont let me go
loosen up my chains
or im a condemned prisoner
bridge
i think my minds on the blink
so i get high so high and i drink
i suffered enough of the heart palps when i think
discovered it up at the bar 9 drinks in
now im at the disco convinced the girls think im the bizzo
course im on the brink
looking at me funny then course im gonna swing
karaoke course i wanna sing
or pour me another drink
it always ends the same
or im a condemned prisoner

chorus
i tried so hard to change
but the devil locked my door
i wear these heavy chains around my neck
like a prisoner
i just wanna love
but he wont let me go
loosen up my chains
or im a condemned prisoner4embed"
