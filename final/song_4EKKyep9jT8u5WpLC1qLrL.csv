a crude device a veil on our eyes
a simple plan wed be different from the rest
and never resign to a typical life

common fears start to multiply
we realize were paralyzed
whered it go all that precious time
did we even try to stem the tide
why should we waste it on
buying into the same old lies
the longer we wait around
the faster the years go by

bridge
its not too late
to feel a little more alive
make our escape
before we start to vaporize

doubtless weve been through this
so if you want to follow me you should know
i was lost then and im lost now
and i doubt ill ever know which way to goyou might also like1embed"
