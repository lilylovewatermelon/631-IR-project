its not simple to say
that most days i dont recognize me
that these shoes and this apron
that place and its patrons
have taken more than i gave them

its not easy to know
im not anything like i used to be although its true
i was never attentions sweet center
but i still remember that girl

shes imperfect but she tries
she is good but she lies
she is hard on herself
she is broken and wont ask for help
she is messy but shes kind
she is lonely most of the time
she is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
she is gone but she used to be mine

and its not what i asked for
sometimes life just slips in through a back door
and carves out a person
and makes you believe its all true
and now ive got you
you might also likeyoure not what i asked for
if im honest i know i would give it all back
for a chance to start over
and rewrite an ending or two
for that girl that i knew

who was reckless just enough
who gets hurt
but who learns how to toughen up when shes bruised
and gets used by a man who cant love
and then shell get stuck
and be scared of the life thats inside her
getting stronger each day
til it finally reminds her
to fight just a little
to bring back the fire in her eyes
thats been gone but used to be mine
oh used to be mine

she is messy but shes kind
she is lonely most of the time
she is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
she is gone but she used to be mine10embed"
