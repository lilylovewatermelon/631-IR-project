so man you think you want to run whiskey
roll with me hoss
you better listen good and clear
and if you got a badge
or a big mouth brother
you aint got no business here
boy this here is a moonshine still
cant you smell that whiskey burn
this is how the big dogs run
boy youre riding shotgun
buckle up and lets have some fun

chorus
riding 95 down the highway
sideways running from all john law
i got the booze and the boot
move it over bo duke
make room for a real outlaw
duct tape on that license plate
a six gun in the dash
is thunder in the hood
heaven from a still
lighting in a jar
and brother im hell on wheels
said im hell on wheels
see brantley gilbert liveget tickets as low as 38you might also likeverse 2
just nine more miles until the state line
were on time and we lost barneys blues
so you can open your eyes
you done fine
and dangers part of what we do
now when we make that drop
were going to pop a top
you got to lesson left to learn
it aint wine dont sip it
make it bubble when ya hit it
let it burn baby burn

chorus
riding 95 down the highway
sideways running from all john law
i got the booze and the boot
move it over bo duke
make room for a real outlaw
duct tape on that license plate
a six gun in the dash
is thunder in the hood
heaven from a still
lighting in a jar
and brother im hell on wheels
said im hell on wheels
chorus
riding 95 down the highway
sideways running from all john law
i got the booze and the boot
move it over bo duke
make room for a real outlaw
duct tape on that license plate
a six gun in the dash
is thunder in the hood
heaven from a still
lighting in a jar
and brother im hell on wheels
said im hell on wheels

chorus
riding 95 down the highway
sideways running from all john law
i got the booze and the boot
move it over bo duke
make room for a real outlaw
duct tape on that license plate
a six gun in the dash
is thunder in the hood
heaven from a still
lighting in a jar
and brother im hell on wheels
said im hell on wheels
outro
said im hell on wheels
brother im hell on wheels yeah3embed"
