trying to be funny and stuck in a room
there isnt much more to say about it
can one be funny when stuck in a room
being in trying to get something out of it

refrain
try making faces
try telling jokes making little sounds ooh

verse 2
i was a kid who was stuck in his room
there isnt much more to say about it
when youre a kid and youre stuck in your room
youll do any old shit to get out of it

refrain
try making faces
try telling jokes making little sounds
chorus
well well
look whos inside again
went out to look for a reason to hide again
well well
buddy you found it
now come out with your hands up
weve got you surrounded
