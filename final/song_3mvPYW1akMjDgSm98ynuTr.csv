serve god love me and mend
this is not the end
live unbruised we are friends
and im sorry im sorry

verse 2
sigh no more no more
one foot in sea one on shore
my heart was never pure
you know me you know me
bridge
but man is a giddy thing
oh man is a giddy thing
oh man is a giddy thing
oh man is a giddy thing
chorus
love it will not betray you
dismay or enslave you it will set you free
be more like the man you were made to be
there is a design an alignment
a cry of my heart to see
the beauty of love as it was made to be
you might also likelove it will not betray you
dismay or enslave you it will set you free
be more like the man you were made to be
there is a design an alignment
a cry of my heart to see
the beauty of love as it was made to be
love it will not betray you
dismay or enslave you it will set you free
be more like the man you were made to be
there is a design an alignment
a cry of my heart to see
the beauty of love as it was made to be8embed"
