mr misdemeanor
call me up and say youre needin my love
now you say youre leaving oh yeah
like you never even needed my love
then i dont even see you oohooh oohooh
not even for a weekend or a month
so much you left between us oohooh oohooh
but you dont ever think about us ooh

prechorus nick jonas
why do why do why do why do i want you
even though you make it hard and i dont want to
and now im out here catching feelings like i want you
but all you ever do is look a look away

chorus nick jonas  joe jonas
every single time i keep on coming back to you
youre always on my mind it doesnt matter what i do i do
every single time i keep on coming back to you
but keep me on the line if loving yous a crime
then i wont keep my love locked down for you
every single time

verse 2 joe jonas  nick jonas

like it was yesterday in amsterdam smoke it up
