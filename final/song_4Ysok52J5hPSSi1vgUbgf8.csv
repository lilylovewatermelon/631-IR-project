he never tells me that hes sick of this house
he never says why dont you get off that couch
he dont cost me nothing when he wants to go out
i want you to love me like my dog
he never says i need a new attitude
him and my sister aint always in a feud
when i leave the seat up he dont think that its rude
i want you to love me like my dog does baby

chorus
when i come home want you to just go crazy
he never looks at me like he might hate me
i want you to love me like my dog

verse 2
he never acts like he dont care for my friends
he never asks me where in the hell have you been
he dont play dead when i want to pet him
i want you to love me like my dog does honey
he never says i wish you made more money
he always thinks that pull my fingers funny
i want you to love me like my dog
he dont get mad at me and throw a major fit
when i say his sister is a bitch

when i come home want you to just go crazy
he never looks at me like he might hate me
i want you to love me like my dog
