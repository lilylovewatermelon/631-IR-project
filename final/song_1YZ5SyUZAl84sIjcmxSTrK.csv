i cant believe its come to this
two broken hearts one goodbye kiss
is this all thats left of me and you
you seem to take it all in stride
while im crumbling inside
letting go is hard for me to do
but if all my love is easy to refuse
then i guess you just dont have as much to lose

verse 2
cause im losing everything that ever meant anything
how can all of our yesterdays mean nothing to you
if all my loves so easy to refuse
then i guess you just dont have as much to lose

bridge
if all my loves so easy to refuse
then i guess you just dont have as much to lose

outro
i cant believe its come to this
