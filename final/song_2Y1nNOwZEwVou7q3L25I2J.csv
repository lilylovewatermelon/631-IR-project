yeah yeah
thats right

verse 1
we talk about your work how your boss is a jerk
we talk about your church and your head when it hurts
we talk about the troubles youve been having with your brother
about your daddy and your mother and your crazy exlover
we talk about your friends and the places that youve been
we talk about your skin and the dimples on your chin
the polish on your toes and the run in your hose
and god knows were gonna talk about your clothes
you know talking about you makes me smile
but every once in awhile

chorus
i wanna talk about me

oh my me my

i like talking about you you you you usually but occasionally
i wanna talk about me me me me me
i wanna talk about me me me me me

we talk about your dreams and we talk about your schemes
your high school team and your moisturizer cream
we talk about your nanna up in muncie indiana
we talk about your grandma down in alabama
we talk about your guys of every shape and size
the ones that you despise and the ones you idolize
we talk about your heart about your brains and your smarts
and your medical charts and when you start
you know talking about you makes me grin
but every now and then

chorus
i wanna talk about me
wanna talk about i
wanna talk about number one
oh my me my
what i think what i like what i know what i want what i see
i like talking about you you you you usually but occasionally
i wanna talk about me me me me me
i wanna talk about me me me me me
i wanna talk about me me me me me
i wanna talk about me me me me me
