keep on hanging on stuck here til im gone
boys still throwing stones running til im wrong
i never listened to tell the truth i never knew
but nobody misses what you did quite like i do

prechorus
got me thinking bout it

chorus
all day long til were dead and gone
all day long til were dead and gone
bangin my head against the wall
all day long
bangin my head against the wall
dead and gone

verse 2
but im seeing a pattern falling from a ladder
must be tripping like a cartoon slipping on a banana
left out in the sun burned out but i aint done
ice cream melting down dripping on the ground
young black and gifted never lose gotta be the shoes
that old money privilege got me confused what is it you do

prechours
got me thinking bout it

all day long
bangin my head against the wall
all day long
bangin my head against the wall
all day long and its all and its all and its all day long
bangin my head against the wall
all day long and its all and its all and its all day long
til were dead and gone

bridge
maybe im trippin to tell the truth dont have a clue
maybe youre not alone thats right
maybe i missed out on my youth playin it cool
man in the mirror like grow up be a winner
blow up be a winner

chorus
all day long til were dead and gone be a winner
all day long til were dead and gone grow up be a winner
all day long til were dead and gone
bangin my head against the wall
all day long and its all and its all and its all day long
bangin my head against the wall
til were dead and gone and its all day long til were dead and gone
bangin my head against the wall3embed"
