weve been through the storm
weve been through it all
we had some close calls
but never would fall
we climbed all the mountains
walked through all the valleys
and you never left me behind

i found my way through the clouds
no more runnin scared and closing my eyes oh
i will be true this love from my heart
im laying my life on the line

as long as its you by my side
im stronger stronger stronger stronger stronger stronger stronger

they said we wouldnt make it
but guess what we made it
and we got them wondering how

never been the one to hurt me
