didnt i give it all tried my best
gave you everything i had everything and no less
didnt i do it right did i let you down
maybe you got too used to well having me around
still how can you walk away from all my tears
its gonna be an empty road without me right here

chorus
but go on and take it take it
take it all with you
dont look back dont look back
at this crumbling fool
just take it all with my love
take it all with my love

verse 2
maybe i should leave to help you see
nothing gets better than this
and this is everything we need
so is it over is this really it
youre giving up so easily
i thought you loved me more than this

chorus
but go on go on and take it take it
take it all with you
dont look back dont look back
at this crumbling fool
just take it all with my love
take it all with my love
