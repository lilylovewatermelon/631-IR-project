cover me with love
i am blessed

youre burying your father
youre burying your son
you are dead
i know nothing of real pain
im a child and i am spoiled
i hate myself for my complaints
im pathetic and im bored
i cry simply at the thought
i crumble at the sight
if i ever had to
feel i fall to my knees
pray for god to save me
feel i fall to my knees
pray for god to save me

i have never been in love
i pretend to care
convince myself that its enough
i was never there
i am hiding in the dust
sweep me underneath the chair
you might also likei have never been in love
i keep on giving
i keep on giving up
i keep on giving up
i keep on giving up
i keep on giving
i keep on giving up
i keep on giving up
i keep on giving up
i keep on giving2embed"
