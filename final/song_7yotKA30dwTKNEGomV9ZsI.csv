the number one question is how
how does it feel now that you on
how much you worth how big is your home

tip of the iceberg that tipped the titanic
no tiptoein around it my shit is gigantic
as big as the fuckin atlantic im lit bitch

verse 2
how i grew up only few wouldve loved
member i got my first view of the blood
im hangin out and they shoot up the club
my homie got pharmaceutical plug
i smoke the drug and it run through my vein
i think its workin its numbin the pain
dont give a fuck and im somewhat insane
dont give a fuck and im somewhat insane
yeah at this shit daily sipped so much actavis
i convinced actavis that they should pay me
if practice made perfect im practices baby
if practice made perfect im practices baby
platinum wrist ridin in back like miss daisy
platinum disc and i own masters bitch pay me
yall niggas trappin so lacksicaldaisy
my nigga sell crack like its back in the 80s
know a young nigga he actin so crazy
he serve a few packs and he jack a mercedes
he shoot at the police he clap at old ladies
he dont give a fuck if them crackers gon hang him
bitches been askin what have you done lately
i stacked a few ms like my last name was shady
my life is too crazy no actor could play me
my life is too crazy no actor could play me
