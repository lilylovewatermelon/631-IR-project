i know a place
its somewhere i go when i need to remember your face
we get married in our heads
something to do while we try to recall how we met

chorus matty healy
do you think i have forgotten
do you think i have forgotten
do you think i have forgotten
about you

verse 2 matty healy carly holt
you and i dont let go
were alive dont let go
with nothing to do i could lay and just look in your eyes
wait dont let go
and pretend dont let go oh
hold on and hope that well find our way back in the end in the end

chorus matty healy
do you think i havе forgotten
do you think i have forgotten
do you think i havе forgotten
about you
do you think i have forgotten
do you think i have forgotten
do you think i have forgotten
about you

and there was something about you that now i cant remember
its the same damn thing that made my heart surrender
and ill miss you on a train ill miss you in the mornin
i never know what to think about
i think about you dont let go
about you dont let go

outro matty healy carly holt

about you
about you dont let go oh

do you think i have forgotten
about you
