verse 1
its a mystery to me
we have a greed with which we have agreed
you think you have to want more than you need
until you have it all you wont be free

chorus
society youre a crazy breed
i hope youre not lonely without me

verse 2
when you want more than you have you think you need
and when you think more than you want your thoughts begin to bleed
i think i need to find a bigger place
cause when you have more than you think you need more space

chorus
society youre a crazy breed
i hope youre not lonely without me
society crazy indeed
i hope youre not lonely without me

verse 3
theres those thinking more or less less is more
but if less is more how you keeping score
means for every point you make your level drops
kinda like youre starting from the top
and you cant do that

society youre a crazy breed
i hope youre not lonely without me

society have mercy on me
i hope youre not angry if i disagree
society crazy indeed
i hope youre not lonely without me18embed"
