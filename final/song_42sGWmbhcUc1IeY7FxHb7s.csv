verse 1
baby baby dont you ever let go
more and more until we both overflow
got a feeling that my hearts never known
i found love
tender kisses and im floating on air
you can have me anytime anywhere
when you need me i will always be there

and our love goes round and round
way up high a joy ride
we can touch the stars above
we found love
and our love was heaven sent
from the day we first met
weve got something they cant touch
