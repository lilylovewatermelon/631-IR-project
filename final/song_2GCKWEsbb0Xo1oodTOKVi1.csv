so what im really tryna say is
and what i hope you understand
is despite of all the imperfections of who i am
i still wanna be your man
i know it hasnt been easy for us to talk
with everyone being around but
its just personal this just for me and you
and i want you to know that i still love you girl you say that you dont wanna talk but its cool
and though the seasons may change
sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
im under this umbrella and im callin your name girl i know that i dont wanna lose your love
and you know i dont wanna lose that cause i still believe
