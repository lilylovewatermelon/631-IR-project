because theres something in the air
weve got to get together sooner or later
because the revolutions here
and you know its right
and you know that its right

we have got to get it together
we have got to get it together now

run through the fields and houses
because theres something in the air
weve got to get together sooner or later
because the revolutions here
and you know its right
and you know that its right

we have got to get it together
we have got to get it together now

call out the instigator
because theres something in the air
weve got to get together sooner or later
because the revolutions here
and you know its right
and you know that its right

we have got to get it together nowembed"
