been a lot of places ive been all around the world
seen a lot of faces never knowing where i was
on the horizon hmm but i know i know i know i know

living out of cases and packing up and taking off
made a lot of changes but not forgetting who i was
on the horizon ooh well i know i know i know i know
the moon will be rising back home
