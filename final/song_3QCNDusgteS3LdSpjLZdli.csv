i am outside and ive been waiting for the sun
with my wide eyes ive seen worlds that dont belong
my mouth is dry with words i cannot verbalize
tell me why we live like this

keep me safe inside
your arms like towers

what must we do to restore our innocence
and all the promise we adored
give us life again
cause we just wanna be whole

and under red lights ill show myself it wasnt forged

keep me safe inside
your arms like towers
tower over me
