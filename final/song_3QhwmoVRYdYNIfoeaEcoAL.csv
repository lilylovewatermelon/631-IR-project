you look indescribably good irrevocably grand
with you by my side is where i wanna stand
its inequivically great to be out here this late
with you on my arm oh god youve got charm

chorus
cause weve found ourselves in quite a situation
and when im by your side i feel elation
you kiss me slow but without hesitation
you threw me straight into inarticulation

verse 2
its undeniably swell and if you can tell
im sorry its weak the way i speak of this treat
and if tomorrows the same who cares if it rains
just please do not focus the way they approach us

chorus
cause weve found ourselves in quite a situation
and when im by your side i feel elation
you kiss me slow but without hesitation
you threw me straight into inarticulation

bridge
and are you pretty or handsome my words are on ransom
are you dashing or gorgeous my vocabs atrocious
are you god are you jesus this rhyme is egregious
whatever the words are i feel im on venus
you might also likeverse 3
and although im inept to truly speak to your depth
and im probably insane to even rack through my brain
further moreover my rhymes getting closer
whatever the words are youve won me right over

chorus
cause weve found ourselves in quite a situation
and when im by your side i feel elation
you kiss me slow but without hesitation
you threw me straight into inarticulation

outro
cause weve found ourselves in quite a situation
and when im by your side i feel elation
you kiss me slow but without hesitation
you threw me straight into inarticulationembed"
