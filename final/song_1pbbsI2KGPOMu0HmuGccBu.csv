ahem fuck yeah

verse 1
met you on a saturday knew it was somethin soon as you spoke it
eye fuckin across the table dont think anybody noticed
you asked me if i was comin to city you from
maybe we should kick it i was interested that would be dumb
if i denied long legs good ears great taste
smell good sense of humor obvious a good face
and we clicked we was at each others hips
i aint even wanna fuck cause your presence was enough
you and i make sense you stayed back at my telly
we was chattin til mornin the vibrations was heavy
i wasnt drownin or yawnin thats when i told you my feelings
you told me you felt the same but you got homie you dealin with
damn i didnt know thats a bit unexpected
but i get it its whatever least i can do is respect it
we still gon kick it and checkin like nothin could ever stop it
the problem is he my friend but if im honest im really hopin you drop him
its morals i really have its lines i could never cross
but you got somethin that make all them good intentions get lost
i try to keep it together never felt this way
we spent bout two weeks together only skipped one day
and they say bros over hoes im like mm nah hey
i would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake
but whatever we still could be friends it could still be chance
ima play it cool we got somethin we cannot pretend uh uh
see tyler the creator liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likeinterlude
its its like starting a race
and then when you take off they like no no its not a end ha
it was too late and shit

verse 2
facetimin it aint bout nothin you laughin packin your luggage
its nothin incriminatin but please delete our discussions
you hit me with the look and replied like duh bitch
dont want your man to think that we creepin behind his back
cross the line cross the line cross the— nah we never did that
though i havent seen him in months shit is rare he never hit back
anyway convince him to bring you to me so we could kick it
right in front of his lenses nothing here is malicious
you sat by me in that movie we went outside for them doobies
we walkin off when we talk man that nigga not fuckin stupid
he see it he know its somethin we frontin like hahaha
whenever we hahaha we subtly press his buttons
not on purpose but man i found my purpose
if i fucked our friendship up for you i think its worth it
but nah i cant do that that nigga dont deserve it
and plus yall got depth im just the nigga on the surface for real
surface

interlude
i said surface like cause they got roots
like im the new nigga
but you know they be fuckin haha
yeah yeah
verse 3
didnt see you a couple weeks think he want you away from me
know yall argued bout if you mad you met him before you met me
i feel guilty but not as much as i should
i tried to have that selfcontrol but not as much as i could
i been down for days you in my city and i cant see your face
i cant eat knowin you with him and not at my place
i never been jealous of another man
especially when i have everything i want at hand
except you you

interlude
you know i got every damn car multiple cribs
but its like no i want that ha

verse 4
he left for some days i cleared out my sched i cleared out my head
you dropped off at mine i say that we fled no you pick a place
we could tulum or we could capri or die right here
as long as you with me ill be at peace huh
you was supposed to go back home to see your bestie
i told you i cant hit that zone too busy next week
you was like hmm ill stay a week shell get over that
seven days with me your nigga like where the fuck you at
dirtyin my bakin pots tennis at my mama spot
chauffeured in the rolls the back entrance for them restaurants
parks playin chess games givin wigs pet names
manicures night swims jerrod providin methane
shoppin til we droppin what you coppin
see the price is not a option
its investments cause your smile is the profit to me
i know around him you gotta act like you not into me
i know your answer but you gotta keep it honest with me
said you cant fully be into me cause you with him
then why the fuck when we link its like he doesnt exist
they all know that we friends but we both aware that its more
everything i got if you say the word then its yours
the only thing im missin in life i know you could be it
and everyone around me that care about me can see it
i could fuck a trillion bitches every country i done been in
men or women it dont matter if i seen em then i had em
but with you its a feeling cause we twinnin and we matchin
you stayed in the car when i went on date with that actress
whole time im eatin i couldnt wait to get back
in the back of the car with you and talk about who we are
you told me when you with me its like heroin
told me that your confidence went up since we befriended and
told me that you didnt wanna hurt him why we doin this
told me this a awkward situation and you just wanna be through with it
told me every time you not with him it started problems and
told me every time you not with me you always ponder
what type of sweater im wearin what music have i been finding
girl you know that ima play it whenever thats what we bonded over
you said you told him the truth and you never lied
now he lookin at you with them eyes
we never crossed the line but he got every right to be a lil pissed off
he picked you up yall got an argument he got his shit off
my energy like get lost your energy just want peace
i couldnt even tell you his energy cause he dont speak
he aint even call you his bitch
until he see me make you smile that nigga threatened as shit
im in the wrong though
i picked you up your energy off
your lips really dry something is off
you ask if i gotta i ask if you gotta
we trip on our words nobody is lyin hakuna matata
we sat in the car and cried for a hour
my shirt look like a showerhead got it we called it off
ill skip the details but that night i seen hell
you was in a room i was payin for i took three ls
no i didnt sleep well woke up and my knees fell
they buckled to the ground i cannot walk shit i need vill
next day im drivin round the city with no destination backup
water in my eyes kept falling like niagara
vill right beside me makin sure i didnt crash or
do something heinous cause im emotionally jabbed up
you checked every box i thought it was it
felt like i got led on and pushed off a cliff
no im in the wrong that was a friend
no fuck that the energy we had never again will find it
you in the wrong gotta remind you bout the times that you stepped
gotta rewind it— aw fuck
we talkin bout our kinks real cautious with the links
you dont do that type of shit when you in relationship
and you a hundred with your mate so dont go actin like no saint
cause its a twoway street and shit you knew what i was on
and while that nigga out and gone shit you was loungin in my home
shit i even let you meet my mama and yall got along
but shit ill take my l though its not fun
you still got your nigga and still had your fun
shit i cant even look at you and think about bad words
thats why i called and said we couldnt end this on bad terms
we straight like a bad perm well always be good friends
and laugh about it on a sandy beach while our back burns huh
this my perspective this how i feel
i aint fabricate nothin i kept it real
i told you i love you and always will
and if he ever put his hands on you promise ill get him killed true
true true true yeah
outro
on god i love that girl f— mhm
im a sh— im a bad person like im in the wrong im a bad person
i had no ill intentions though
shit everybody got hurt
i got hurt bruh
its a shit situation
all the morals and power you have just vanish when a certain energy is nearing
and those feelings got so much gravity and its out of your control
that made me realize adults dont know what they doin either
were all just children
i aint mean to fuck nobodys shit up man
i thought i was bulletproof
she proved me wrong man
i felt two hundred percent with her
it was beautiful
i was able to feel
but it was it was bad timing
and im mad private with this side of my life cause people are weirdos and
i just try to keep anyone i care about in the shadows
safe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts
cause its just a story for the people outside of it
but i guess youre just another chapter in the book31embed"
