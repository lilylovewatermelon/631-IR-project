weve been out all night
tearing up this town
its time to bring it all home
start the second round
cause when you get turned on
i cant turn you down
you stop to slip it off grab my hand

chorus
and start dancing around the bedroom
moonlight through the window
country on the radio silhouette beautiful
come a little closer give me some of that
baby you look so good
in nothing but my cowboy hat
nothing but my cowboy hat

verse 2
we shouldve just stayed in
left that truck in the drive
the way youre looking now
gonna be up all night
love how you throw it down
over those angel eyes
baby keep on driving me wild

and start dancing around the bedroom
moonlight through the window
country on the radio silhouette beautiful
come a little closer give me some of that
baby you look so good
in nothing but my cowboy hat yeah

cant resist you in that resistol
thats one thing you dont have to take off

chorus
when youre dancing around the bedroom
moonlight through the window
country on the radio silhouette beautiful
come a little closer give me some of that
baby you look so good
in nothing but my cowboy hat
nothing but my cowboy hat

so come a little closer give me some of that
you look so good in nothing but my cowboy hat
