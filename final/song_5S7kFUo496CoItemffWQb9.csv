you walk around in other towns
ive seen you out just hangin round
its what you chose and i suppose
youll meet me one day meet me one day
you throw away every other dream
taking nova baby to the dollar machine
that party dress is such a mess
youll need me one day need me one day soon

chorus
all your enemies
smile when you fall
you take it cause you
dont know what you want
you dont know what you want
all this love of mine
all my precious time
you waste it cause you
dont know what you want
you dont know what you want

verse 2
there go the kids the havenots
elevator ladies in the parking lots
you saw it all and i recall
the dream you told me dream you told me
this empty heart you left me with
the ribbon on my parting gift
im falling hard for every yard
of the dream you sold me dream you sold me oh

all your enemies
smile when you fall
you take it cause you
dont know what you want
you dont know what you want
all this love of mine
all my precious time
