to what do i owe this gift my friend
my life my love my soul
ive been dancing with the devil
way too long
and its making me grow old

lets leave all this and get away
get lost in time
where theres no reason left to hide
lets leave all this and get away
run in fields of time
where theres no reason left to hide
no reason left to hide

verse 2

youre gift dear child
give life give love give soul
divided is the one who dances
for the soul is so exposed
so exposed
