baby im a firefighter trapped in a burning house in a silent picture
and there is no way out except to watch the love between us die

verse 2
thats called the falling angel
its an amusement park ride
some sort of rollercoaster
it takes you up and when it brings you down
it gives you butterflies

verse 3
and now im longing for your kiss
bet you could read it on my lips
ohh
waterfalls im jumping down

instrumental break

verse 4
i know youre leaving baby
the birds are flying south
and theres nothing to say
i need you here
i need your love inside of mine like i could die
i need your love inside of mine like i could dieyou might also like8embed"
