whoa

chorus big sean
mona lisa lisa moanin
got some drinks and some motherfucking reefer blowing
i tell her fuck with me and you could be something
yo girl so bad i want the threesome
threesome trying to have a threesome
look at my watch bout three somethin
threesome trying to have a threesome
fuck with me and you could be something

verse 1 big sean
i believe in god and rubbers
even if we sex you are not my lover
hit you on the couch and not the covers
and if you bring you friend then we got to fuck her
thats what im down for no convo my condo
and if i answer this phone call dont make a sound ho
my life is my odyssey my dogs to the right of me
i got the girl you cant lay a finger on right here massaging me
like yeahim the nigga i know it im the nigga i know it
my momma say im a poet you hating praying i blow it
but this the life i made though

verse 2 big sean
im eating lobster with my shrimp hand
feeling on her with my pimp hand
im talking to her like her daddy do
and bet she give me everything but attitude
mathematical radical
twist my fingers up and rep my avenue
penthouse altitude being broke is not compatible
get a fine girl patron that
get a finer one and then clone that
you cuff your wife like i want that
when i got freaky women tongue kissing
marijuana lung lifting
give long dick then im long distance
you in the club bromancing
i got her homancing
face in my lap nose dancing
no pants screaming
