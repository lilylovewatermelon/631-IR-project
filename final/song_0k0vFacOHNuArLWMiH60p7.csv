i took a chance i took a shot
and you might think im bulletproof but im not
you took a swing i took it hard
and down here from the ground i see who you are

chorus
im sick and tired of your attitude
im feelin like i dont know you
you tell me that you love me then cut me down
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover when youre around
heres to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what youre doing to me
tell me why

verse 2
well you could write a book on
how to ruin someones perfеct day
well i get so confused and frustratеd
forget what im trying to say ohoh

chorus
im sick and tired of your reasons
i got no one to believe in
you tell me that you want me then push me around
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover when youre around
heres to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what youre doing to me
tell me why

so you can feel whole inside
why do you have to put down my dreams
so youre the only thing on my mind
