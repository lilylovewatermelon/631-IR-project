all the lights in miami begin to gleam
ruby blue and green neon too
everything looks better from above my king
like aquamarine oceans blue

verse 2
all the lights are sparkling for you it seems
on the downtown scenes shady blue
beatboxing and rapping in the summer rain
like a boss you sang jazz and blues

the summers wild and ive been waiting for you all this time
i adore you cant you see youre meant for me
the summers hot but ive been cold without you
i was so wrong not to doubt your medellín tangerine dreams

bridge
catch me if you can working on my tan
salvatore
dying by the hand of a foreign man happily
calling out my name in the summer rain
ciao amore
salvatore can wait
now its time to eat soft ice cream
