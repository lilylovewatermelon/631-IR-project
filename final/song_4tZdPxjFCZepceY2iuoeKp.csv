this ones called stella was a diver and shes always down

verse 1
when she walks down the street
she knows theres people watching
the building fronts are just fronts
to hide the people watching her

verse 2
but she once fell through the street
down a manhole in that bad way
the underground drip
was just like her scuba days

prechorus 1

at the bottom of the ocean she dwells
at the bottom of the ocean she dwells
from crevices caressed by fingers
and fat blue serpent swells

prechorus 2
stella stella oh stella
stella i love you stella i love you stella i love you

chorus
she was all right cause the sea was so airtight she broke away

theres something thats invisible
theres some things you cant hide
trying to detect you when im sleeping
in a wave you say goodbye
theres something thats invisible
theres some things you cant hide
trying to detect you when im sleeping
in a wave you say goodbye15embed"
