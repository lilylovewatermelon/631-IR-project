high dive into frozen waves
where the past comes back to life
fight fear for the selfish pain
it was worth it every time
hold still right before we crash
cause we both know how this ends
our clock ticks till it breaks your glass
and i drown in you again

prechorus
cause you are the piece of me
i wish i didnt need
chasing relentlessly
still fight and i dont know why

chorus
if our love is tragedy
why are you my remedy
if our loves insanity
why are you my clarity

drop

chorus
if our love is tragedy
why are you my remedy
if our loves insanity
why are you my clarity
see zedd liveget tickets as low as 196you might also likeverse 2
walk on through a red parade
and refuse to make amends
it cuts deep through our ground
and makes us forget all common sense
dont speak as i try to leave
cause we both know what well choose
if you pull then ill push too deep
and ill fall right back to you

prechorus
cause you are the piece of me
i wish i didnt need
chasing relentlessly
still fight and i dont know why

chorus
if our love is tragedy
why are you my remedy
if our loves insanity
why are you my clarity

build

drop
why are you my clarity
why are you my remedy
why are you my clarity
why are you my remedy
chorus
if our love is tragedy
why are you my remedy
if our loves insanity
why are you my clarity
