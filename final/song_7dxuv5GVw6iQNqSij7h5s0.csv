when the room is quiet
the daylight almost gone
it seems theres something i should know
i ought to leave but the rain it never stops
and ive no particular place to go

chorus
just when i think im winning
when ive broken every door
the ghosts of my life grow wilder than before
just when i thought i could not be stopped
when my chance came to be king
the ghosts of my life blew wilder than the wind

verse 2
well im feeling nervous
and now i find myself alone
the simple life is no longer there
once i was so sure
not a doubt inside my mind
it comes and goes but leads nowhere

chorus
just when i think im winning
when ive broken every door
the ghosts of my life grow wilder than before
just when i thought i could not be stopped
when my chance came to be king
the ghosts of my life blew wilder than the windyou might also like2embed"
