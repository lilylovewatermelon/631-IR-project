oh hello fellas

say minnie have you ever heard the story of daisy bo peep

i dont think so
how does it go

oh well i should hope so

daisy bo peep fell fast asleep
and dreamed her flock had strayed
and when she awoke it was no joke
her sheep had gone away

oh goodness what happened next

then up she took her little crook
and started out to find them
she found them fast but what a gasp
their tails were not behind them

they were missing their tales

then one day as daisy did stray
a wondrous sight to see
you might also likeoh what was it

up in the air the tails were there
all hanging on an oak tree

on an oak tree

daisy bo peep has lost her sheep
and doesnt know where to find them
leave them alone and theyll come home
wagging their tails behind them

but goofy how did she get the tails back on the sheep

gosh that part was easy

you see daisy bo peep go to her sheep
who were all failing blue

she didnt fail she took each tail
and stuck it on with sticky glue

daisy bo peep has lost her sheep
and doesnt know where to find them
leave them alone and theyll come home
wagging their tails behind themembed"
