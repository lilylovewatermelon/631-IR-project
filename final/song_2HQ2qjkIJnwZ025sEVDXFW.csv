passed out in our school clothes
so wed wake up in our sundays best
i never asked for your opinion
i just got it and i get it
you move slow like daytime drama
and im boring like his songs
so while im taking you for granted
well be humming along

chorus adam lazzara fred mascherino both
well cross my heart and hope to…
im lying just to keep you here
so reckless so reckless so
so thoughtless so thoughtless oh
so careless but i could care less
cross my heart and hope to…
im lying just to keep you here
so reckless i’ll keep you here
so heartless
but i could care less

verse 2 adam lazzara fred mascherino
so paint your face up something elegant
and this town maybe a darker shade of red
‘cause a long night means a fist fight
against your pillow and my pearly whites
i want to hear you scream
you like me better on my knees
we dont believe in
so let us pray
second chances
so let us pray

chorus adam lazzara fred mascherino both
cross my heart and hope to…
im lying just to keep you here
so reckless so reckless so
so thoughtless so thoughtless oh
so careless but i could care less
cross my heart and hope to…
im lying just to keep you here
so reckless i’ll keep you here
so heartless
but i could care less

postchorus adam lazzara fred mascherino
well cross my heart and hope to
im lying just to keep you here
ill keep you here

bridge adam lazzara fred mascherino both
what i ever did before they’re takin’ it all
well cross my heart and hope to
pretend it was ever modest that you’d wanted in on
im lying just to keep you here
and “never” always sounded better when she said it
this all— all not hope and knowin’
this glass house is burning down all this hope not knowin’
you light the match ill stick around all this hope not knowin’
ill give you everything you want all this hope not knowin’
and wish the worst on what i was all this hope not knowin’
this glass house is burning down all this hope not knowin’
tonight wont make a difference
you light the match ill stick around all this hope not knowin’
tonight wont make a difference
ill give you everything you want all this hope not knowin’
tonight wont make a difference
and wish the worst on what i was all this hope not knowin’
tonight wont make a difference
outro adam lazzara and fred mascherino
tonight wont make a difference
tonight wont make a difference
tonight wont make a difference
well tonight wont make a difference
well tonight wont make a difference
tonight wont make a difference
tonight wont make a difference
well tonight wont make a differenceembed"
