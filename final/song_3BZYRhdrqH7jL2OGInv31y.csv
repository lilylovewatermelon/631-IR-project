remember my clean shave
back in our old days
we were just kids
i had my six string
and you had your own thing
though i dont remember what it is

i wrote you love songs
and you liked that sad one
so i played it all the time
what was that one line
something bout sunshine
i sang it every night

where the sun dont shine
spoken
no that canâ€™t be it
sung
when the sun wont shine
spoken
what was it baby

jenna
til the sun dont shine
you will still be mine
you might also likeearl
thats right
man what a whirlwind
so much is happening
and mostly to me
weve come such a long way
no turning back now babe
youre my family
now promise me
to the end of time
these are ties that bind
sing it honey

jenna
til the sun dont shine

jenna  earl
you will still be mine

earl
