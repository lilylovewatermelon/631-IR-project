i hope i don’t make you mad with what i’m ‘bout to say boy
here we are once again and i’m havin second thoughts boy
i’m not messin with your head but i changed my mind boy
i don’t know why i’m here the same time i want you near
if you want me to leave i will understand
see i will just have to respect your wishes boy
cause if i stay aint no tellin what may happen boy
although you look so good to me its best that i leave

chorus ciara
i’m scared of being next to you because of what i think i might do
boy youre turnin me on right now
i can’t get down like that right now
i don’t want to disturb the flow but this is not my mo
hold up wait a minute we’re movin too fast
i want somethin like this here to last

postchorus r kelly
don’t say no baby not right now baby
i want you to be my lady you got me goin’ crazy

verse 2 ciara
well i guess i’ll stay for a minute then i have to go boy
this moment is so temptin’
right now it’s not what i want boy
maybe if we just embrace with a simple kiss boy
but thatll only make things worse
hope i’m not gettin’ on your nerves boy
i just wanted to be right for the both of us
when you don’t have to say a thing to make me comfortable
boy you make me so weak when you look at me
right now i’m a little confused i think its best that i refuse
