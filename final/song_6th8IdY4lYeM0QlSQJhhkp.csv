tell me are you feeling down
are you happy do your dreams still seem inbound
tell me are we finished now
cause every time you leave you find a way to come back around

chorus
i need time to get up and get off the floor
i need time to realize that i cant be yours
i need time to give up just like before
i love it how you know id only come right back for more

verse 1
my god youre an angel
i only see you in your halo
i was hopin we could stay close
but we no longer sing the same notes

prechorus
i rеmember when i mеt you
thought the universe sent you
thought you were someone i could vent to
so i hit your line what you getting into

chorus
i need time to get up and get off the floor
i need time to realize that i cant be yours
i need time to give up just like before
i love it how you know id only come right back for more

why i thought it was forever
i only see you maybe never
why i thought wed be together
when you treat it like whatever yeah yeah yeah
my love for falling down
playing the victim when all my envisionings
come slowly tumblin down
putting me back on the ground

prechorus
i remember when i met you
thought the universe sent you
thought you were someone i could vent to
so i hit your line what you getting into

chorus
i need time to get up and get off the floor
i need time to realize that i cant be yours
i need time to give up just like before
i love it how you know id only come right back for more

outro
tell me are you feeling down
are you happy do your dreams still seem inbound
tell me are we finished now
cause every time you leave you find a way to come back around21embed"
