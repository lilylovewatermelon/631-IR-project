ooh ooh
ooh ooh

verse 1
hollywoods bleeding vampires feedin
darkness turns to dust
everyones gone but no ones leavin
nobody left but us
tryna chase a feelin but well never feel it
ridin on the last train home
dyin in our sleep were livin out a dream
we only make it out alone

chorus
i just keep on hopin that you call me
you say you wanna see me but you cant right now
you never took the time to get to know me
were scared of losin somethin that we never found
were runnin out of reasons but we cant let go
yeah hollywood is bleedin but we call it home

verse 2
outside the winter sky turnin grey
city up in smoke its only ash when it rains
howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
love for everybody til the drugs fade away
in the mornin blocking out the sun with the shades
she gotta check her pulse to tell herself that she okay
it seem like dyin young is an honor
but whod be at my funeral i wonder
i go out and all they eyes on me
i show out do you like what you see
and now they closin in on me
let em sharpen all they teeth
this is more than i can handle blood in my lambo
wish i could go oh im losin hoope
i light a candle some palo santo
for all these demons wish i could just go home
see post malone liveget tickets as low as 186you might also likechorus
i just keep on hopin that you call me
you say you wanna see me but you cant right now
you never took the time to get to know me
were scared of losin somethin that we never found
were runnin out of reasons but we cant let go
yeah hollywood is bleedin but we call it home129embed"
