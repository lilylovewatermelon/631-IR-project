like a blade of grass wants sunlight i just want that ass
you the type of girl i wouldve flirted with in class
copied every test be the reason that i passed
i know we could have a blast
we could have a kid am i movin too fast
know im not your first but i could be your last
you cant even get gas without bein harrassed mm
some of these girls in the mix more than engineers
but i think youd rather disappear
you dont know where you gon end up but you know it probably isnt here
i gotta put you in a different tier
ig private spend hеr own money on the whip that she drivin
thick thighs and i can tеll its warm baby can i please dive in
in her prime shes thrivin

chorus
met you in the dark tryna put that light on you
could buy you anything let me spend some time on you
cause i want you mm
i think i want you too i think i want you too

verse 2
i think i want you too
truthfully i only give it up to very few
truthfully my body count is low its only two
i know that you probably dont believe me but its true
had a boyfriend i dated for like five years in school
then another one i dated for like two
til he moved since then i been cool
focused on myself what bout you
i mean shit i been chillin
we just got off tour and we sold out every building
you probably had hella bitches on you not really
boy stop lyin ha you silly
anyway when you free im down to take you out any day
gotta duck the cameras they gon treat us like we kim and ye
i aint tryna keep you low but this is high stakes
life like this sure is sweet tell me how it taste taste taste taste

met you in the dark tryna put that light on you
could buy you anything let me spend some time on you
cause i want you mm
i think i want you too i think i want you too4embed"
