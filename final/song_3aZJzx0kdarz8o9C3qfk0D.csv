i thought that i could always count on you
i thought that nothing would become between us two
we said as long as we would stick together
we’d be alright we’d be ok
but i was stupid
and you broke me down
i’ll never be the same again

chorus
so thank you for showing me
that best friends cannot be trusted
and thank you for lying to me
your friendship and good times we had you can have them back

verse 2
i wonder why it always has to hurt
for every lesson that you have to learn
i won’t forget what you did to me
how you showed me things i wish i’d never seen
but i was stupid
and you broke me down
i’ll never be the same again

chorus
so thank you for showing me
that best friends cannot be trusted
and thank you for lying to me
your friendship and good times we had you can have them back
see simple plan liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likebridge
when the tables turn again
you’ll remember me my friend
you’ll be wishing i was there
for you
i’ll be the one you’ll miss the most
but you’ll only find my ghost
as time goes by
you’ll wonder why
you’re all alone

chorus
so thank you for showing me
that best friends cannot be trusted
and thank you for lying to me
your friendship and good times we had you can have them back

outro
so thank you for lying to me
so thank you for all the times you let me down
so thank you for lying to me
so thank you your friendship you can have it back2embed"
