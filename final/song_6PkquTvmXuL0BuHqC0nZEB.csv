im cold and broken

verse 1
its over—i didnt want to see it come to this
i wonder if i will ever see your face again
and i know that i will find a way to shed the skin
its simple—i know that i will suffer in the end

chorus
fast i fade away—its almost over
hold on
slow i suffocate—im cold and broken
alone

verse 2
its hopeless—the end will come and wash it all away
forsaken—i live for those i lost along the way
and i cant remember how it all began to break
we suffer—i live to fight and die another day

chorus
fast i fade away—its almost over
hold on
slow i suffocate—im cold and broken
alone
