whoa oh oh oh
whoa oh oh oh

verse 1
shes got brazilian leather boots on the pedal of her german car
listening to the beatles singing back in the ussr
yeah shes going around the world tonight
but she aint leaving here
shes just going to meet her boyfriend
down at the street fair

chorus
and its a french kiss italian ice
spanish moss in the moonlight whoa oh oh oh
just another american saturday night

verse 2
theres a big toga party tonight down at delta chi
they got canadian bacon on their pizza pie
they got a cooler full of cold coronas and amstel light
its like were all living in a big old cup
just fire up the blender mix it all up

chorus
its a french kiss italian ice
margaritas in the moonlight whoa oh oh oh
just another american saturday night
