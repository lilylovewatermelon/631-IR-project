if i could have a beer with jesus
heaven knows id sip it nice and slow
i’d try to pick a place that ain’t too crowded
or gladly go wherever he wants to go
you can bet i’d order up a couple tall ones
and tell the waitress to put em on my tab
yeah i’d be sure to let him do the talkin’
careful when i got the chance to ask

chorus
tell me how’d you turn the other cheek
to save a sorry soul like me
do you hear the prayers i send
and what happens when life ends
and when you think youre comin back again
yeah i’d tell everyone but no one would believe it
if i could have a beer with jesus

verse 2
if i could have a beer with jesus
yeah i’d put my whole paycheck in that jukebox
and id fill it up with nothing but the good stuff
and sit somewhere and we couldn’t see a clock

chorus
and ask him how’d you turn the other cheek
to save a sorry soul like me
have you been there from the start
how’d you change a sinner’s heart
and is heaven really just beyond the stars
yeah i’d tell everyone but no one would believe it
if i could have a beer with jesus
see thomas rhett liveget tickets as low as 37you might also likebridge
now he can probably only stay for just a couple rounds
but i hope and pray he’s stayin till we shut the whole place down

chorus
ask him how’d you turn the other cheek
to save a sorry soul like me
what’s on the other side
is mom and daddy alright
and if it ain’t no trouble tell them i said hi
yeah i’d tell everyone but no one would believe it
if i could have a beer with jesus
yeah i’d tell everyone but no one would believe it
if i could have a beer with jesus1embed"
