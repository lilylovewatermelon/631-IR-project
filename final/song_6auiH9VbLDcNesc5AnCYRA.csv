there you are standing strong
im a leaf holding on
you believe like a child
in this fire running wild
oh i love how you see
right to the heart of me

chorus
youre a waterfall washing over me
im a thirsty man let me drink you in
well i am on my way
youre a mountain top
when i reach for you your love lifts me up
all that i want is to be
where you are

verse 2
im the frozen ground youre the warm sunlight
shining down on me
baby just in time
well i have never been in a love like this
oh you move my soul every time we kiss
and i love how you heal
i cant believe how alive i feel
