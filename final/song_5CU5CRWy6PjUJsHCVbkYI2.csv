verse 3
reading pornhubs terms of service going for a drive
and obeying all the traffic laws in grand theft auto v
full agoraphobic losing focus cover blown
a book on getting better handdelivered by a drone
total disassociation fully out your mind
googling derealization hating what you find
that unapparent summer air in early fall
the quiet comprehending of the ending of it all

chorus
there it is again
that funny feeling
that funny feeling
there it is again
that funny feeling
that funny feeling
