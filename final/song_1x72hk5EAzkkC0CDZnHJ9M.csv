they call her mississippi
but she dont flow to me
spends her light on the bayou
but she dont come to see

chorus
shes the one that makes my dreams
they call her mississippi
but she dont flow to me

verse 2
the shape of her horizon
makes the morning sun
when she puts her eyes on
each and anyone

refrain
shes the one that makes me fall
midnight moon shines through it all

instrumental break

shes the one that makes my dreams
they call her mississippi
but she dont flow to me
they call her mississippi
but she dont flow to me
