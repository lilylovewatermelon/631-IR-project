when the sun had left and the winter came
and the sky fall to only bring the rain
i sat in darkness
all brokenhearted
i couldnt find a day i didnt feel alone
i never meant to cry started losin hope
but somehow baby
you broke through and saved me

prechorus
youre an angel tell me youre never leavin
cause youre the first thing i know i can believe in

chorus
youre holy holy
holy holy
im high on lovin you
high on lovin you
youre holy holy
holy holy
im high on lovin you
high on lovin you

verse 2
you made the brightest days from the darkest nights
youre the river bank where i was baptized
cleansed from the demons
that were killin my freedom
let me lay you down give me to ya
get you singin babe hallelujah
well be touchin
well be touchin heaven
