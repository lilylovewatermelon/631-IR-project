verse 1 rihanna
tell me that you love me when you know you dont love me
but i guess i guess i guess its all good
you can play the game ima still do my thing
aint no better way for it to be put
when you fuck them other girls
i bet they be wondering why you always call my name
you think im gonna wait around i aint got all day

prechorus rihanna
you dont need another lover
dont you let it go
i already got it covered
let the others know

chorus rihanna

ride it my pony
my saddle is waiting
come and jump on it
if you want it lets do it
ride it my pony
my saddle is waiting
come and jump on it

my saddle is waiting

bridge kevin cossom
you say its my fault
okay i get it
you aint pick up your calls
im like forget it
see you put up your wall
you know you did it
the rise and the fall
just admit it
you say its my fault
okay i get it
you aint answer your calls
im like forget it
its the the rise and the fall
its the the rise and the fall
and you could have had it all
chorus rihanna
if you want it lets do it
ride it my pony
my saddle is waiting
come and jump on it

my saddle is waiting
come and jump on it
