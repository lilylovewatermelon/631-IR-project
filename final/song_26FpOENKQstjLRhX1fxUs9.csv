they wanna see the day i turn a rapper nigga
let this money make me soft so they can bash a nigga

and a nigga still thuggin with this prada on
hundred thousand dollar watch you know what time im on
i be lookin in the mirror im a fuckin g

my street cred on fleek and im still intact
this how i am this how i was this how im finna act
