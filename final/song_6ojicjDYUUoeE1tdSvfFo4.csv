just pick yourself up dust yourself off they say it aint that hard
but just puttin one foot in front of the other aint gettin me too far
this movin on aint comin along the way they said it would

chorus
i guess whoever said the grass is greener mustve never seen the other side
and what dont kill you makes you stronger sure sounds like a lie
and whoever said that time heals everything and everything will be alright
whoever said it aint the end of the world and youll find somebody new”
mustve never met you

verse 2
mustve never heard you say youd never leave me then watch you walk away
mustve never fell as hard as i did cause then they wouldnt say
maybe it wasnt meant to be yeah maybe youre better off alone

chorus
i guess whoever said the grass is greener mustve never seen the other side
and what dont kill you makes you stronger sure sounds like a lie
and whoever said that time heals everything and everything will be alright
whoever said it aint the end of the world and youll find somebody new
mustve never met you
mustve never met you

whoever said the grass is greener
