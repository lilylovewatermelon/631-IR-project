twentyone years she figured it out
she started a job shes feeling it out
and for once it feels right
was feeling like the prime of her life
but all of that is just a dream
shattered now and everythings changed
with one car and one night
was driving through the prime of your life

prechorus 1
took your freedom
theres no reason just keep breathing
time doesnt hear if you ask it to wait

chorus
ladadadada ladadadada
so own all your tears and just roll with the waves
ladadadada ladadadada
life it could change it could change in a day
ladadadada ladadadada
so cherish your years and just roll with the waves
ladadadada ladadadada
time doesnt hear so roll with the waves

cause this breath could fade fast
and this day could be your last
