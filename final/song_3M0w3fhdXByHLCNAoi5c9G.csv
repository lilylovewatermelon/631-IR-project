you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
its the mornin of your very first day
you say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
try and stay out of everybodys way
its your freshman year and youre gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
hopin one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
you know i havent seen you around before

chorus
cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
youre gonna believe them
and when youre fifteen feelin like theres nothin to figure out
well count to ten take it in
this is life before you know who youre gonna be
fifteen

verse 2
you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough youre best friends
laughin at the other girls who think theyre so cool
well be outta here as soon as we can
and then youre on your very first date and hes got a car
and youre feelin like flyin
and your mamas waitin up and youre thinkin hes the one
and youre dancin round your room when the night ends
when the night ends

cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
youre gonna believe them
and when youre fifteen and your first kiss
makes your head spin round
but in your life youll do things greater than
dating the boy on the football team
but i didnt know it at fifteen

bridge
when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then i swore i was gonna marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had
to a boy who changed his mind
and we both cried

chorus
cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
youre gonna believe them
and when youre fifteen dont forget to look before you fall
ive found time can heal most anything
and you just might find who youre supposed to be
i didnt know who i was supposed to be
at fifteen

your very first day
