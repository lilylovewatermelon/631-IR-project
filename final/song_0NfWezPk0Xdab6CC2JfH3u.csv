to help a drowning starving soulless man
whos eyes are blind and feelings all but numb
whos ears are all so deaf and mouth is dumb

this is the way is the way
i fill your spaces now
its the way its the way
cause all thats been left for me
is to fight to fill these empty spaces now

night is day and day is night again
and all thats eating bites bites with toothy grins
the pages of my memory torn in twain
where reconstructing lies cannot contain

this is the way is the way
i fill your spaces now
its the way its the way
cause all thats been left for me
is to fight to fill these empty spaces now

now
now

this is a way is a way i fill your spaces
now theres a way theres a way i fill your spaces
now theres a way theres a way i fill your spaces
now theres a way theres a way
cuz all thats been left for me
is the fight to fill these empty spaces
