henny – heh classic
verse 3 royce da 5’9”
it’s eminem and him again my sentiments exactly
i told that bitch to get at me then the bitch attacked me
kid you not i’m lit up as fuck
tablecloth tucked in my pants til im hearing dishes drop
as i walk away from my dinner with schmucks

verse 4 eminem and royce da 5’9”
then i enter the front of the kmart shopping center
with a coupon book and a hundred and ten bucks
and a bunch of change and a wife beater with a mustard stain
i’ll crush your brain like i’m crushin pills
what the fuck’s the mothafuckin deal
this shit’s making me feel like
i’m tryna do a mothafuckin cartwheel up a hill
how many bars how many tabs of acid yes
cause im sniffin my ex fuckd up and it’s obvious
smoke and henny in my chest i’m bananas
i’m a coconut put this cd in then you’ll see
the sequel to scary movie
bad is to evil a roofie to roethlisberger
you dont wanna wind up six feet deep under that shits creek
so i hope that you bought preservers
you could put a turd on the plate
silverware and a tablecloth to serve us
you don’t bring shit to the table
im in your grill like a seville when the moth gets murdered
youre pushin the envelope
when i’m shovin’ that whole post office further
right off the surface of this earth
into the darkest and the farthest corners
verse 5 royce da 5’9”  eminem
how many bars how many bars maui wowie sour diesel
how many jars to all my people i’ll be to mars mommy come on
she can actually wrap my nutsack
round the back of her neck in a bathroom stall
or she could just puke from sippin this piss
from my 24inch catheter cord
i’m the type that’ll take a bath with a whore
drown her bang her head on the passenger door
while i’m stashing her in the back smacking her forehead
on the dash til its accidentally blowin the benz jeep horn
my friends be knowin that when i’m on a binge i’m stingy
even when i’m ten deep in a room at the mgm
with lindsay lohan and she on
