look theres a lollipop on the holly
and theres a toy that pulls
look theres a jingle bell in a dolly
its time i saw the miracles
do you know that mistletoe
comes from the holly trees
and do you know twelve below
can make the snowman freeze
do you know an eskimo
has ice upon his chin
do you know that tippytoe
is santa creeping in
la la la la
look theres a choochoo train and a rocket
and theres a bell that rings
look theres a candy cane in your pocket
and so many wondrous things
do you know so long ago
that christmas had its start yeah
even though theres ice and snow
it melts the coldest heart
for when we pray on christmas day
a miracle was born yeah
as we behold the ground is cold
but everyone is warm
everyone is warmyou might also likeembed"
