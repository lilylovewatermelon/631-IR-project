seed gotta let it grow
why ya gotta watch when i let it feed
better look into the mirror
for the face you hide away every day
but i dont give a fuck
i let it roll i smoke the old
gotta run gotta rend gotta maim
gotta make it through another maze stay away

prechorus
please wring the blood from my hands
dont pretend that you understand me
i dont even want you looking at me
motherfucker get inside

chorus
get inside get inside

get inside get inside

get inside get inside
motherfucker
get inside get inside

verse 2
christ have you seen this guy
make ya sick gonna peel away all the impurities
cause all you wanna do is keep curin me
but i dont give a fuck i kill everyone
youll be mopping up blood and guts
and all the shit when im done
isnt this fun give me a gun
and ill tell you all the secrets i hide before i run
