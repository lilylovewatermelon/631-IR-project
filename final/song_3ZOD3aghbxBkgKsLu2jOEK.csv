we found our place
on the branch of an old gum tree
our feet would sway
to a voice in the breeze
and birds would sing
on the banks of a narrow stream
these memories will stay with me ooh

verse 2
we made our way
to a hill beside the sea
with salt in the air
and sand on our feet
we felt the sun
as it burned upon our skin
these memories will stay with me
now i am far away
these memories still remain
now im far away
you stay with me the same ooh
now im far away
these memories still remain
now im far away
you stay with me the same oohsee hollow coves liveget tickets as low as 471embed"
