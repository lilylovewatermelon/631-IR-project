oh my life is changing everyday
every possible way
though my dreams its never quite as it seems
never quite as it seems

verse 1
i know i felt like this before
but now im feeling it even more
because it came from you

then i open up and see
the person falling here is me
a different way to be

verse 2
i want more impossible to ignore
impossible to ignore
theyll come true impossible not to do
impossible not to do

verse 3
now i tell you openly
you have my heart so dont hurt me
for what i couldnt find
totall me amazing mind
so understanding and so kind
youre everything to me
