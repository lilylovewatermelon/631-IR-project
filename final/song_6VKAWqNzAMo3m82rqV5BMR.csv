ive got a hunger twisting my stomach into knots
that my tongue has tied off
my brains repeating if youve got an impulse let it out
but they never make it past my mouth

chorus
bop bah this is the sound of settling
bop bah bop bah bop bah
bop bah bop bah this is the sound of settling
bop bah bop bah bop bah

verse 2
our youth is fleeting old age is just around the bend
and i cant wait to go grey
and ill sit and wonder of every love that couldve been
if id only thought of something charming to say

chorus
bop bah bop bah this is the sound of settling
bop bah bop bah bop bah
bop bah this is the sound of settling
bop bah bop bah bop bah
bop bah this is the sound of settling
bop bah bop bah bop bah
bop bah bop bah this is the sound of settling
bop bah bop bah bop bah
