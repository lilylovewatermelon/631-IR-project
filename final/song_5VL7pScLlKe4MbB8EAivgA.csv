when the world gets too heavy
put it on my back ill be your levee
you are taking me apart
like bad glue on a get well card

chorus
it was always you falling for me
now theres always time calling for me
im the light blinking at the end of the road
blink back to let me know

verse 2
im a fly thats trapped in a web
but im thinking that my spiders dead
lonely lonely little life
i could kid myself in thinking that im fine

chorus
it was always you falling for me
now theres always time calling for me
im the light blinking at the end of the road
blink back to let me know

bridge
that im skin and bone
just a cane and a rusty throne
oh the castles under siege
but the sign outside says leave me alone
you might also likechorus
it was always you falling for me
now theres always time calling for me
im the light blinking at the end of the road
blink back to let me know

outro
it was always you
blink back to let me know
it was always you26embed"
