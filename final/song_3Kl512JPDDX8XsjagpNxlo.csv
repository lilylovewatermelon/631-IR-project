all is on the room all is on the room
all is on the room and i cant say
and it fills up the dark
and it fills up the dark
and it fills up the dark like a new day
all is on the room all is on the room
all is on the room and i cant say
and it fills up the dark
and it fills up the dark
and it fills up the dark like a new day

outro
close your eyes and tell me what you see
hold on to me
theres something glowing and my blood is bubbling
and it fills up the dark like a new day3embed"
