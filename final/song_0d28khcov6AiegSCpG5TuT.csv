verse 1 2d
citys breaking down on a camels back
they just have to go cause they dont know wack
so while you fill the streets its appealing to see
and you wont get out the county cause youre damned and free
you got a new horizon its ephemeral style
a melancholy town where we never smile
and all i wanna hear is the message beep
my dreams theyve got to kiss me cause i dont get to sleep no
beep

chorus 2d
windmill windmill for the land
turn forever hand in hand
take it all in on your stride
it is ticking falling down
love forever love is free
lets turn forever you and me
windmill windmill for the land
is everybody in
