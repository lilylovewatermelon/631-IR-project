headed down south to the land of the pines
im thumbin my way to north caroline
starin up the road
and pray to god i see headlights
i made it down the coast in seventeen hours
pickin me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
and im ahopin for raleigh
i can see my baby tonight

chorus
so rock me mama like a wagon wheel
rock me mama any way you feel
hey mama rock me
rock me mama like the wind and the rain
rock me mama like a southbound train
hey mama rock me

verse 2
runnin from the cold up in new england
i was born to be a fiddler in an oldtime string band
my baby plays the guitar
i pick a banjo now
ah the north country winters keep agettin me
and i lost my money playin poker so i had to up and leave
but i aint aturnin back
to livin that old life no more

so rock me mama like a wagon wheel
rock me mama any way you feel
hey mama rock me
rock me mama like the wind and the rain
rock me mama like a southbound train
hey mama rock me

verse 3
walkin due south out of roanoke
i caught a trucker out of philly
had a nice long toke
but hes aheaded west from the cumberland gap
to johnson city tennessee
and i gotta get a move on before the sun
i hear my baby callin my name
and i know that shes the only one
and if i die in raleigh
at least i will die free

chorus
so rock me mama like a wagon wheel
rock me mama any way you feel
hey mama rock me
rock me mama like the wind and the rain
rock me mama like a southbound train
hey mama rock me10embed"
