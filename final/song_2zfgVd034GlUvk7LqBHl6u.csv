verse 1
you stand with your hand on my waistline
its a scene and were out here in plain sight
i can hear them whisper as we pass by
its a bad sign bad sign
somethin happens when everybody finds out
see the vultures circling dark clouds
loves a fragile little flame it could burn out
it could burn out

prechorus
cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns
they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run

chorus
baby i know places we wont be found
and theyll be chasing their tails tryin to track us down
cause i i know places we can hide
i know places i know places

verse 2
lights flash and well run for the fences
let them say what they want we wont hear it
loose lips sink ships all the damn time
not this time
