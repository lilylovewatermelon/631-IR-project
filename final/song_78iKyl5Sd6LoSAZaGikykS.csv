i was born in a place where they killed themselves before they raised
their own children their own little them
all of the flaws wrapped into one
you made me are you proud of what you made

chorus
all i need
all i need
its sad cause you cant
call for me no more i just cant
let it all just go
let it all just go
let it all just go
let it all just goyou might also like9embed"
