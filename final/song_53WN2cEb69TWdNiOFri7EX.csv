in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell in hell
time is all i have anymore

verse 1 violent j
i tried to visit shaggy i stepped up off of my porch
and it was dark as fuck i couldnt see not even with a torch
i hear the streets talkin and they aware of my moves
they whisperin and swingin from the trees above i hear the loons
i try to jog a little crow eyes glow like cats
demonic zombies runnin up on me i slap em with the bat
but my eyes keep bleedin from the rays of the darkness
they powerful and burn you somethin heartless uh
i hear a giant thumpin some kind of ogre or somethin
i see the phantom screamin as this giant behemoth is comin
and it swung at me i felt a rip my head went spinnin
and flippin and rollin and finally landed in position
i could see my body still standin headless as fuck
it finally fell but what the hell still got my nugget but im stuck
i cant move fuck im only a face why even try
on top of that its a centipede crawlin in my eye
i wanna die

verse 2 shaggy 2 dope
i tried to visit j i walked out into the cold
i see they dont collect they dead they all up over the road
and some are fully rotted and some they mustve just spotted
i seen a headless body that resembles js but i doubt it
i seen a centaur i threw a pitch fork at it above
i watch it fall into a bloody patch of bodies and blood
im fuckin bout to hurl i close my eyes and walk on
as giant crows swoopin at me got me carry me on
i cut its claws with the hatchet that i keep in my hand
even in hell you best believe i keep the hatchet in my hand
and as im fallin now i see the witch is ridin my chest
with its claws on my neck screamin i shouldve confessed
i slammed down into an iron gate a demon statue near me
four points stickin out my chest im hangin there dearly
and the hungry goblins they got a fire beneath me
theyre cookin my legs to make myself eat me
i wanna die
