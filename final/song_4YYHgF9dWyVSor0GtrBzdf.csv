te amo te amo
she says to me
i hear the pain in her voice
then we danced underneath the candelabra
she takes the lead
thats when i saw it in her eyes its over

chorus
then she said te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
i told her no
she cried te amo
i told her im not gonna run away
but let me go
my soul is awry
without asking why
i said te amo
wish somebodyd tell me what she said
dont it mean i love you
think it means i love you
dont it mean i love you

verse 2
te amo te amo
shes scared to breathe
i hold her hand i got no choice uh
pulled me out on the beach danced in the water
i start to leave
shes begging me and asking why its over

listen we can dance
but you gotta watch your hands
watch me all night
iâ€™m moving through the light
because i understand
that we all need love
and im not afraid
to feel the love but i dont feel that way
