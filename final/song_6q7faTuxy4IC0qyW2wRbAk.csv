usually im the one thats in control
i meet em freak em leave em
move on to the next man
he aint my man
i must admit i like to have some fun
i be in love for like a minute
then im on the run
on the run on the run for like a minute then im on the run
until the day that he caught my eyes
i knew i didnt wanna play him like them other guys
other guys other guys didnt wanna play him like them other guys

chorus
night stand he was supposed to be a one night stand
you are my kryptonite you take my powers away
and if i spend the night you probably drive me insane
one night stand one night stand he was supposed to be a one night stand

verse 2
when he looked in my eyes
i knew something was different
he wasnt no beginner
i could tell i couldnt win
couldnt win couldnt win hes no beginner and i couldnt win
i shoulda walked away
dont know what made me stay
i know i played this game
im probably gonna pay
gonna pay gonna pay i played this game so probably gonna pay

i would do it so good
id have em making me pancakes in the morning
making me pancakes in the morning
and so i tried to beat em
i mean i went to tell em
he pulled the switch and
it was me making pancakes in the morning
me making pancakes in the morning
