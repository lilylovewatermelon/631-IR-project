same old shit dog just a different day
it is not a fuckin game you know how niggas do when we play how we play
a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do
if its fuck me nigga you know its fuck you

verse 1
i kick it to shorty to try to help him understand uh
hit him with work cause yo thats my little man uhhuh
he asked a few questions bout the game and i told him yeah
so when he made a bad move it was my place to scold him aight
never told him nothin wrong kept it fair
didnt listen so i might as well have been talkin to the air damn
everybody makes mistakes a mistake is aight
but if it aint ima tell you straight time to say goodnight
nobody likes to be played regardless of the relationship
but shortys fuckin up big time i hate this shit
im caught in the middle of havin love for a lil nigga
and knowin whats expected of me as a real nigga damn
my next move is crucial what do i do
how do i keep it real with shorty and my crew
didnt wanna kill him so instead of puttin the mac on him
i did the only thing i could do turn my back on him

chorus
here we go again
same old shit dog just a different day
here we go again

here we go again
a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do
here we go again
so if its fuck me nigga then you know its fuck you

niggas that i fuck with wanna get him dead
but im cool with shortys peoples so i let him live
under normal circumstances he would be a marked man
but i hit him with a grand just didnt shake his hand ooh

be what you gon be i wash my hands im through aight
i can forgive i just cant forget
youre on your own little man dont ask me for shit no
if you paid attention to what i taught you then you good uh
if i see you again get it understood
go head before i change my mind cause you know you should be dead
i just wanted to sayâ€” ah go ahead
instinct told me to kill him but the savior is
im a good nigga plus i owed his peeps a favor mmm
but i also knew the decision i just made yeah
went against the rules of the game that we play damn

verse 3
i shouldve followed my first instinct cause i knew right
sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do true

ungrateful motherfucker shouldve got him missin what
this nigga got the nerve to take my kindness for a weakness
gots to get back on some street shit so i can creep this

wasnt hard for me to get him where i wanted him confronted him
bzzt click there was a bullet in one of them
feelin lucky click looks like you are

what you did was put on another pair of shoes
and they just happened to be too big

threw it back in my fuckin face so fuck you too aight
