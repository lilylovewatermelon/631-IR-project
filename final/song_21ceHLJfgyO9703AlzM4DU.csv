stay low
soft dark and dreamless
far beneath my nightmares and loneliness
i hate me for breathing
without you
i dont want to feel anymore
for you

verse 2
grieving for you
im not grieving for you
nothing real love cant undo

chorus
and though i may have lost my way
all paths lead straight to you
i long to be like you
lie cold in the ground like you
mmmm

verse 3
halo
blinding wall between us
melt away and leave us alone again
humming haunted somewhere out there
i believe our love can see us through in death

i long to be like you
lie cold in the ground like you
theres room inside for two
and im not grieving for you
im coming for you

bridge
youre not alone
no matter what they told you youre not alone
ill be right beside you forevermore

chorus
i long to be like you sis
lie cold in the ground like you did
theres room inside for two
and im not grieving for you
and as we lay in silent bliss
i know you remember me
i long to be like you
lie cold in the ground like you
theres room inside for two
and im not grieving for you
im coming for you2embed"
