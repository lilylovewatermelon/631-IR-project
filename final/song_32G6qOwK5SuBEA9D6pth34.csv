never feel too good in crowds
with folks around when theyre playing
the anthems of rape culture loud
crude and proud creatures baying
all ive ever done is hide
from our times when youre near me
honey when you kill the lights and kiss my eyes
i feel like a person for a moment of my life

prechorus
but you dont know what hell you put me through
to have someone kiss the skin that crawls from you
to feel your weight in arms id never use
its the god that heroin prays to

chorus
it feels good girl it feels good
it feels good girl it feels good
it feels good girl it feels good
oh to be alone with you

refrain
woah oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
woah oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

there are questions i cant ask
now at last the worst is over
see the way you hold yourself
reel against your bodys borders
i know that you hate this place
not a trace of me would argue
honey we should run away oh someday
our baby and her momma and the damaged love she made

prechorus
but i dont know what else that i would do
than to try to kiss the skin that crawls from you
than feel your weight in arms id never use
its the god that heroin prays to

chorus
it feels good girl it feels good
it feels good girl it feels good
it feels good girl it feels good
oh to be alone with you

refrain
woah oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
woah oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
woah oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
woah oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
chorus
feels good girl it feels good
feels good girl it feels good
it feels good girl it feels good
oh to be alone with you36embed"
