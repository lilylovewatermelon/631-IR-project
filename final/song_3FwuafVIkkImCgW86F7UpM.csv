cant fight this feeling of death
when it wraps its hands around your neck
like the pill thats underneath your tongue
swallow it with a soft regret
and all the things that make you cry
remembering youll watch your parents die
and all the people that you love in your life
find their way above the irem shrine

chorus
skipping tombstones
heavy and slow

verse 2
so fall asleep with open eyes
with bad dreams to occupy my time
were on a strict death schedule
it keeps us all in line
theres things that im avoiding now
dreams about all my teeth falling out
any floralgreen color scheme
try but you cant make a sound

bridge
and the clock keeps spinning around
and the clock keeps spinning around

skipping tombstones
heavy and slow
hope that they float
no one knows how deep the bottom goes3embed"
