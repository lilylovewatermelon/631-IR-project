i am unwritten
cant read my mind
im undefined
im just beginning
the pens in my hand
ending unplanned

prechorus
staring at the blank page before you
open up the dirty window
let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
reaching for something in the distance
so close you can almost taste it
release your inhibitions

chorus
feel the rain on your skin
no one else can feel it for you
only you can let it in
no one else no one else
can speak the words on your lips
drench yourself in words unspoken
live your life with arms wide open
today is where your book begins
the rest is still unwritten
