its over look out below
and im wasted i still taste it
yeah its so hard to let go
so breathe in now
and breathe it out
the forecast a car crash
its looking like another

prechorus
breakdown rebound
this could be my last goodbye
you cross your heart i hope to die and

chorus
i cant deny your eyes
you know i tried to read between the lines
i saw a warning sign
and then you threw me up against the wall
who said that its better to have loved and lost
i wish that i had never loved at all

verse 2
no rewinds no second times
and i wont break i wont waste everything you left behind
so dont follow
just let it go
the weathers been better
dont let it be another
see boys like girls liveget tickets as low as 77you might also likeprechorus
breakdown rebound
this could be my last goodbye
you crossed your heart i hope to die and

chorus
i cant deny your eyes
you know i tried to read between the lines
i saw a warning sign
and then you threw me up against the wall
who said that its better to have loved and lost
i wish that i had never loved at all

bridge
all the nights i spent sitting at home while you were out there on your own
all the nights i waited by the phone when you were going in alone
and all your different faces and all your different ways of making everything a mess
and all im saying is that all the different places and all the compilations laid to rest and

chorus
i cant deny your eyes
you know i tried to read between the lines
i saw a warning sign
and then you threw me up against the wall
who said that its better to have loved and lost
i wish that i had never loved
and i cant deny your eyes
you know i tried to read between the lines
i saw a warning sign
and then you threw me up against the wall
who said that its better to have loved and lost
i wish that i had never loved at all
never loved at allembed"
