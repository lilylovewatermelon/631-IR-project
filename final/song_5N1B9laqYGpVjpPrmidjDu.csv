why am i so afraid of the night
my silhouette it taunts me
my lack of faith in this beautiful life
my knowing of it haunts me

prechorus
im haunted and know i should be afraid

chorus
lay awake at night
cry you know its not alright
to feel like youre falling into nothing
you can learn to fly
just call his name
just call his name

verse 2
suddenly i wonder why i feel so alone
i know theres something out there
thought id suck it up and do it all on my own
wish id known he does care

bridge
where do we go call out his name
lift up our hands completely ashamed
give it all up dropping our pride
rip us apart change us on the inside
now change us now we cry out to you we fall on our knees

chorus
lay awake at night
cry you know its not alright
you can learn to flyembed"
