its 5 o clock in the morning

verse 3 wisin
dame un poco de eso de lo que me sostiene
cuando en ropa interior pa encima de mi viene y se detiene
hace que el tiempo se frene en un viaje me mantiene
la cara es hermosa perfecta su ingiene
se calienta y su sudor me salpica
entre besos abrazos gemidos ella conmigo practica
me dice tigre lento lento lento
si lo quiere rapido el codigo se le aplica
its 5 oclock in the morning
5 de la mañana tu y yo solos en un drama
salgo de la disco te cai y me llama
me dice que le caiga que esta prendida en llamas
yo le caigole hago el truco y se derrama
chorus tpain  lily allen
its 5 o clock in the morning
the conversation got boring
you said youd go in to bed soon
so i snuck off to your bedroom
and i thought id just wait there
until i heard you come up the stairs
