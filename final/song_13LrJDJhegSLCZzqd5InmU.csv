verse 1
i just left the hospital might need another liver
kidney failures i tell you this shit couldnt be no realer
my body and drugs too familiar so its hard to clear my system
this shit get hard on a nigga i hardly show my feelings
look up to see stars but im realizing god in the ceiling
i been getting high inconsistent but you tryna show me different
judging me for trying the whippets im tired of the critics
but i cant cap i aint feel it but this time i done did it
the doc didnt care who thе richest i need to be admitted

chorus

wanna know why the reason on why i have my reasons
reason why they aint tell me it was pneumonia season
these police wont never save us thats why i run with heathens
god say you want me to say it you gotta take it easy
im tryna stack it like layers and keep it extra cheesy
i had stepped back from these rappers these niggas actin greedy
im gon say no i dont owe you dont care if you really need it
sometimes you gotta show you aint no ho aint talking bout no bob and weavin
niggas know i got love for po and debo must i repeat it
niggas know i got love for po and debo must i repeat it
wake up hit the yo spit a flow say lets go then i repeat it
take a look at my bro and i know we gotta eat
you a rockstar lil soldier i hope you dont never leave me
codeine all in your colon you got that shit and squeeze
fucked up cant control it you steady rollin weed
everyone said they told you and you aint takin heed

chorus
why why me baby
