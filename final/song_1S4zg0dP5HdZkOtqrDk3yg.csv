neighbor got a brand new cadillac
still got my old ford truck but it runs
got a sweet saltwater pool in the ground
we got a threefooter sittin above splish splash
got a new john deere just ridin around
with a cold beer in his hand hell yeah
while im still pull start push
hell but it gets the job done amen

chorus jake owen
were always gonna want a little more than we got
yeah thats just the way the big world turns
rideriding that stock market rocket with holes in your pocket
yeah theres just one thing ive learned
if youre mad at the man or youre mad at the hand
you were dealt well then youre missing the point
grass is always greener in somebody elses joint

hey man whats it looking like over there on your side of the fence

verse 2 kid rock
if you wanna live a little give a little take a little
but dont be so brittle my friends stand up
just wiggle and giggle stay tickled and whistle
and give more when you got it to hand give it up
dont spend your life chasing rainbows baby
just deal with the weather at hand deal with it
and live life free and i guarantee
you can make it to the promise land
