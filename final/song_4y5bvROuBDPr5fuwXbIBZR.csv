the moon is high
like your friends were the night that we first met
went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
now ive read all of the books beside your bed
the wine is cold
like the shoulder that i gave you in the street
cat and mouse for a month or two or three
now i wake up in the night and watch you breathe

prechorus
ayy
kiss me once cause you know i had a long night oh
kiss me twice cause its gonna be alright uh
three times cause i waited my whole life one two one two three four

chorus
i like shiny things but id marry you with paper rings
uhhuh thats right

i hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
uhhuh thats right
darling youre the one i want
in paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams
oh youre the one i want

we wouldnt be standing here so tall so
