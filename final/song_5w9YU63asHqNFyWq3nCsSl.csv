it was early last week you said we didnt really have that much in common common
but what did you really gain from it from it
we split in two now you dont want me
now its the start of july
you thought that you broke my heart and now every time that you see me you vanish vanish
cause you assumed you really mattered really mattered
but i was sound i had it patterned
now youre a burden of mine

verse 2
ddddid you notice i cried but only just a little bit yeah
tell you i lied then split down in the middle
cause youre taking one side not the side that i like
because you know i cant lie when youre in my mind
yyyoure too cruel to be kind and i know that from experience
i can hear your replies but its maybe that im hearin things
and i heard all your lies theres no lies that i like
so ill take that as a sign youre a burden of mine hey
