you bow your head in shame of all the things youve said and done
i bow my head to feel his grace and to embrace his son
i am far so very far from worthy of his love
they try to break me but through him i can always rise above and breathe

chorus
keep your head above the water
these waves are getting taller
pulling you down down

verse 
your heart it likes the feeling of indifference fills your mind
you cant rely recall the life of faith youve left behind
who it hides you could almost cry

chorus
keep your head above the water
these waves are getting taller
pulling you down down
dont deny your father
hes your way out of this water
thats pulling you down down

bridge
tell him to wait hes waiting for you
tell him to wait hes waiting for you to call
hell catch you and lift your head up and breathe
on solid ground hes there and waiting
you might also likechorus
keep your head above the water
these waves are getting taller
pulling you down down
he will never leave you
dont let this world decieve you
and bring you down down
your heads above the water
keep your head above the water
and everything seems smaller
youre not going down
these waves are getting so much strongerembed"
