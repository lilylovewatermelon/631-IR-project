my hands have got no gloves
wish to my soul that i could have
the boy im dreaming of

dont you remember me babe
i remember you quite well
you caused me to leave all of new york town
with a high sheriff on my tail

a high sheriff on my tail boys
high sheriff on my trail
all because id fallen for
a curlyheaded darkeyed boy

whos gonna stroke your coal black hair
and your sandycolored skin
whos gonna walk you side by side
and tell you everything is all right

whos gonna look you straight in the eye
and hold your bad luck hand
whos gonna walk you whos gonna talk to you
and whos gonna be your woman

the winter wind is blowing so strong
my hands have got no gloves
dont you remember me babe
i remember you quite wellsee cat power liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeembed"
