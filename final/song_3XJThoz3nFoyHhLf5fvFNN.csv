please please be my light filter
shine make me a shelter to hide
cause love makes you lose your sight
now the search partys on its way
and the flood lights on my face
all the shadows that i walk in
are just my volatile second skin

chorus
my reflections are protections
they will keep me from destruction
my directions are distractions
when youre ready come into the light

verse 2
lines design a pathway
shine cut out the dark shapes
to find although i really tried
only time is a lovers guide
and now the railings fall away
and the stencils draw a face
our outlines in the sunset
are just a fragile silhouette

chorus
my reflections are protections
they will keep me from destruction
my directions are distractions
when youre ready come into the light
my reflections are protections
they will keep me from destruction
my directions are distractions
if you leave me ill go back to hide

chorus
my reflections are protections
they will keep me from destruction
my directions are distractions
when youre ready come into the light
my reflections are protections
they will keep me from destruction
my directions are distractions
if you leave me ill go back to hideembed"
