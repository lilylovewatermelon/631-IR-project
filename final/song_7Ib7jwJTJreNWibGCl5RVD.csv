now tell them bitches anyway
cause we dont care what none of them gyal affi say

on my property now watch how we operate

so if you gettin money just throw it up in the air
yeah hands in the air like i was your puppeteer

okay now this right here could get me in trouble
cause when i say i ball i dont mean in a huddle
im always in the lime i never do nothin subtle
cause its pink friday ho thats their rebuttal
my two guns up lets blaze it lets go
i keep a lot of money up in the escrow
and when im at the game im in the best row
i am the baddest bitch up in the pet store
cause i i i i am onika
and these shoes here mean fashionista
cause these dont come out til its easter
im vip bound with leighton meester
