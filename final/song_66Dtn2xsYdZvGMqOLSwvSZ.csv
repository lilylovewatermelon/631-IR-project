christmas was saved though there wasnt much time
but after that night things were never the same
each holiday now knew the other ones name

and though that one christmas things got out of hand
im still rather fond of that skeleton man

so many years later i thought id drop in
and there was old jack still looking quite thin
with four or five skeleton children at hand
playing strange little tunes in their xylophone band

and i asked old jack do you remember the night
when the sky was so dark and the moon shone so bright
when a million small children pretending to sleep
nearly didnt have christmas at all so to speak

and would if you could turn that mighty clock back
to that long fateful night now think carefully jack
would you do the whole thing all over again
knowing what you know now knowing what you knew then

and he smiled like the old pumpkin king that i knew
then turned and asked softly to me wouldnt youyou might also likeembed"
