somehow my songs always apply to my real life right now
i be predicting the future
i think im good at that shit

chorus
every day i keep it real and get that bag ho
cause that shit up for grabs ho put that on my tab ho
jimmy neutron i told that bitch to have a blast ho
yes im a asshole bitch why you mad for
they say that im mad dope
ballin on a budget with my cousins moving mad dope
to eat and see that cash flow
niggas always hating but aint got no fucking bag bro
i just keep it pushing i aint worried bout the mad folks

verse
if a nigga test me ima reach up in this bag though
and put on my ski mask ho
and let off hella shots and do twohundred on the dash bro
i cant go out sad bro
got a family and i still wanna pop some tags more
used to want a jag ho now im in a bentley
still want the monte ss 14s on the side its trippie
i dont think they get me
build a legacy and hope my niggas be up with me
if not then you is against me
leave your body soulless empty
used to feel so empty
now the chips is stacking up i need like every fucking penny
and everyone thats with me
i used to feel alone but i know my brothers soul is with me
i know oompas soul is with me
