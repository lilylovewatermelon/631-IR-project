speed it up slow it down
need control need it now
i need to live a thousand times
i cannot stop i cannot cry
i will not fret i will not die
i am machine i stay alive
sometimes i think sometimes i think
sometimes i think sometimes i ooh
ive got no aim a million rounds is nothing real
a hundred pounds of heavy steel it feels so loud
tied to my chest it feels so loud
ill take a peek to across the peaks
this grass is neat and im quite unique
but id like to be but id like to be

chorus
and i hope this is the hardest part
we try we try
and when they say theyre satisfied
theyre lying theyre lying
do forgive me ive seen the treasures in the bloom
but right now im just not strong enough for you

verse 2
sorry you can see it in my retina
focus in and out im doing better
artificial ghost with no perception
i wanna be a chevy not a sentra uh yeah yeah yeah
i dont feel the way they programmed me to feel today
some pieces falling from the waist up
im so sorry for delays
just need one moment to erase
that burning pain before the rage
i feel good i feel good i feel good i fixed it

and i hope this is the hardest part
we try we try
and when they say theyre satisfied
theyre lying theyre lying
do forgive me ive seen the treasures in the bloom
but right now im just not strong enough for you
and i hope this is the hardest part
we try we try
and when they say theyre satisfied
theyre lying theyre lying
do forgive me ive seen the treasures in the bloom
but right now im just not strong enough for you59embed"
