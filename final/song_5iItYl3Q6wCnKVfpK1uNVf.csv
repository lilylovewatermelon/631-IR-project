in the suburbs i
i learned to drive
and you told me wed never survive
grab your mothers keys were leaving
you always seemed so sure
that one day wed be fighting in a suburban war
your part of town against mine
i saw you standing on the opposite shore
but by the time the first bombs fell
we were already bored
we were already already bored

chorus
sometimes i cant believe it
im moving past the feeling
sometimes i cant believe it
im moving past the feeling again

verse 2
the kids want to be so hard
but in my dreams were still screaming
and running through the yard
and all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
and all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
meant nothing at all
meant nothing at all it meant nothing

sometimes i cant believe it
im moving past the feeling
sometimes i cant believe it
im moving past the feeling and into the night

verse 3
so can you understand
that i want a daughter while im still young
i want to hold her hand
and show her some beauty before this damage is done
but if its too much to ask if its too much to ask
then send me a son
under the overpass
in the parking lot were still waiting its already passed
so move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
cause its already passed
its already already passed

chorus
sometimes i cant believe it
im moving past the feeling
sometimes i cant believe it
im moving past the feeling again
im moving past the feeling
im moving past the feeling
outro
in my dreams were still screaming
were still screaming
were still screaming53embed"
