verse 1
im hanging out with me
and youre a vacant chair
a chosen compromise
this space we rarely share

and if you lived here youd be home now

so what you givin up for me
and what shall i give up for you
aimless expectations passing by

prechorus
if you lived here youd be home now
if you lived here youd be home now

chorus
and to make it real
i need to have you here
i need to have you
i need to hold you

verse 2
barren wasted heart
neglect of normalcy
see no doubt liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likeprechorus
and if you lived here youd be home now
oh if you lived here youd be home now

chorus
and to make it real
i need to have you here
i need to have you
it cant be sincere
unless you spend time here
i need to see you

bridge
supervision is what i need
some consistence tangibility
some casual light days
part of the furniture
i want to take you for granted
and see you regular

so what you givin up for me
and what shall i give up for you
the separations tired its been too long

chorus
and to make it real
i need to have you here
i need to have you
it cant be sincere
unless you spend time here
i need to see you
i need you
come home nowembed"
