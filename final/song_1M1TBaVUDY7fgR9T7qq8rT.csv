all this talkin to you
i dont know what im to do
i dont know where you stand
whats inside of your head
all this thinkin of you
is that what youre doin too
youre always on my mind
i talk about you all of the time

dont waste another day
dont waste another minute
i cant wait to see your face
just to show you how much im in it
so open up your heart
help me understand
please tell me who you are
so i can show you who i am

verse 2
youre just standin by
