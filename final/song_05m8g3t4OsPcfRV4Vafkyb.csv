have a little love on a little honeymoon
you got a little dish and you got a little spoon
a little bitty house and a little bitty yard
a little bitty dog and a little bitty car

chorus
well its alright to be little bitty
a little hometown or a big old city
might as well share might as well smile
life goes on for a little bitty while

verse 2
a little bitty baby in a little bitty gown
itll grow up in a little bitty town
big yellow bus and little bitty books
it all started with a little bitty look

chorus
well its alright to be little bitty
a little hometown or a big old city
might as well share might as well smile
life goes on for a little bitty while

you know you got a job and a little bitty cheque
a six pack of beer and television set
little bitty world goes around and around
little bit of silence and a little bit of sound

bridge
a good ole boy and a pretty little girl
start all over in a little bitty world
little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
its all part of a little bitty scheme

chorus
its alright to be little bitty
a little hometown or a big old city
might as well share might as well smile
life goes on for a little bitty while

its alright to be little bitty
a little hometown or a big old city
might as well share might as well smile
life goes on for a little bitty while2embed"
