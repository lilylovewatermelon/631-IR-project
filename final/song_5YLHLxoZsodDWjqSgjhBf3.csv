i think im losing my mind
trying to stay inside the lines
its like im running in place
how you keep staying the same
baby i i guess im something different
and im okay with that
i cant fake no more smiles
that shit gon drive me mad
im focused on the future
dont care bout nothin else

chorus
im better by myself
im better by myself
i dont need no one else
im better by myself
myself

verse 2
dont wanna answer questions
just want your company
its all good on the surface
show me whats underneath
im not concerned with drama
i left that shit in school
im more concerned with commas
than keeping up with you
keep that away from me
i put the heisman up to bad energy
no empathy especially when the kid off hennessy
fake friends to me make my mood go south like tennessee
make the fool come out like who is he
i mean im trying to tell yall
you might also likechorus
im better by myself
im better by myself
i dont need no one else
im better by myself
myself

outro
i dont know who to trust
these days everyones shady

please no yes no maybes
