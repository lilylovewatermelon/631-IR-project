im a longgone waylon song on vinyl
im a back row sinner at a tent revival
but she believes in me like she believes her bible
and loves me like jesus does

verse 2
im a lead foot leaning on a soupedup chevy
im a good old boy drinking whiskey and rye on the levee
but she carries me when my sins make me heavy
and loves me like jesus does

chorus
all the crazy in my dreams
both my broken wings
every single piece of everything i am
yeah she knows the man i aint
she forgives me when i cant
the devil man no he dont stand a chance
cause she loves me like jesus does

verse 3
i always thought shed give up on me one day
wash her hands of me leave me staring down some runway
but i thank god each night and twice on sunday
that she loves me like jesus does

cause she loves me like jesus does
