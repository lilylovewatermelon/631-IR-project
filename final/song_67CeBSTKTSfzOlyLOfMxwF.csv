alone again
i could see somebody coming a mile in
ive lost so much more than ill admit
so im just sitting here alone again

verse 2
alone again
maybe ill visit my dad this weekend
we havent been that close since you stepped in
but now ive got so much time alone again

verse 3
alone again
my minds empty as the room im sleeping in
i covered my window now my plants are dead
so they know how i feel alone again

verse 4
alone again
im tying my shoes for the fun of it
im talking to my dog just crying
but the more i speak the more i feel alone again

outro
what am i doing alone again
how could you leave me alone again
alone again
