dear diary
today i saw a boy
and i wondered if he noticed me
he took my breath away

verse 1
dear diary
i cant get him off my mind
and it scares me cause ive never felt this way
no one in this world
knows me better than you do
so diary ill confide in you

chorus
dear diary
today i saw that boy
as he walked by i thought he smiled at me

verse 2
and i wondered
does he know whats in my heart
i tried to smile but i could hardly breathe
should i tell him how i feel
or would that scare him away
diary tell me what to do
please tell me what to say

dear diary
one touch of his hand
now i cant wait to see that boy again
he smiled
and i thought my heart could fly

ive got a feeling well be so much more than friendsembed"
