go on

verse 1
innocence sunk the glow and drowned in covers
send for all your absent lovers things
sheepish wolves looking livedin eating buttons
wink just dont put your teeth on me
go on

verse 2
accidents let the evening in the back door
filled the room ceiling to the floor
beat backbones grazed the poem and made it strange
i wasnt born to be a skeleton
go on

chorus
go on grab your hat and fetch a camera
go on film the world before it happens
go on grab your hat and fetch a camera
go on film the world before it happens
go on

verse 3
jealous orchard the sky is falling off the ceiling
while im tucking fibs into a cookie jar
reverie its useless searching in the cupboards
when everything you have is on your back
go on

go on grab your hat and fetch a camera
go on film the world before it happens
go on go on grab your hat and fetch a camera
go on film the world before it happens
go on grab your hat and fetch a camera
go on film the world before it happens
go on film the world before it happens
film the world before it happens
go on film the world before it happens6embed"
