looking down on the cars on the highway
the stream of tail lights
everybody advancing together
do so willingly sacrifice rights
when people accept theyre cogs in the system
give up free will conform
individual pieces of dust swirl together
become a full storm

verse 2
looking down on the burgeoning city
the skyscrapers rise
even men with the greatest intentions
start believing their own lies
we can borrow from the future
but eventually someones got to pay
the only way out of the cycle
is to strike out and pave your own way yeah

interlude
yeah
yeah
yeah

verse 3
we all fight our own fight
will you fuel the desire to win
always struggling with the truth
of the life that might have been
but no matter how jagged your path is
youll always come back to the road
when the dust of battle settles
the war still rages withinyou might also likeembed"
