im alright i feel real fine
i dont live a life thats uptight
when theres a fight theres struggling
i cant roll through the world without offering
questions whats my direction
break in the grip of depression
it comes in the day when you let things go
there comes a time to rock a show

prechorus 1
you know the time that you feel
that nothing else really matters
here on this spot in the world
that you belong
thats where i am when the lights going down
ill find a way to make some fun
i know there is a leak of energy
through someone

chorus
how do you feel
cause i couldnt ask for a single thing more
how do you feel
the moment you know just what you were for

im on a quest with a vision
ive got love and tradition
ill wear a mask that grins and laughs
so remember what ive done
im a vibe under the sun
i penetrate all dimensions
ive come again rejuvenate within
im future animation

prechorus 2
i feel the fuel rushing through my veins
in sunburn and flames
you can take on the world
its all in your brain

chorus
how do you feel
cause i couldnt ask for a single thing more
how do you feel
the moment you know just what you were for

chorus
how do you feel
cause i couldnt ask for a single thing more
how do you feel
the moment you know just what you were for
outro
how do you feel
cause i couldnt ask for a single thing more
how do you feel
the moment you know just what you were forembed"
