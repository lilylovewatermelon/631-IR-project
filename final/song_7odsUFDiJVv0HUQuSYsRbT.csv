intro
im sorry for everything oh everything ive done

verse 1
am i out of touch am i out of my place
when i keep sayin that im lookin for an empty space
oh im wishin youre here
but im wishin youre gone
i cant have you and im only gonna do you wrong

refrain
oh im gonna mess this up
oh this is just my luck
over and over and over again

chorus
im sorry for everything oh everything ive done
from the second that i was born it seems i had a loaded gun
and then i shot shot shot a hole
through everything i loved
oh i shot shot shot a hole
through every single thing that i loved

verse 2
am i out of luck am i waiting to break
when i keep sayin that im lookin for a way to escape

in the meantime we let it go
at the roadside we used to know
we can let this drift away
oh we let this drift away
at the bay side where you used to show
in the moonlight where we let it go
we can let this drift away
oh we let this drift away
and theres always time to change your mind
oh theres always time to change your mind
oh love can you hear me
oh let it drift away
chorus
im sorry for everything oh everything ive done
from the second that i was born it seems i had a loaded gun
and then i shot shot shot a hole
through everything i loved
oh i shot shot shot a hole oh let me make it up to you
through every single thing that i loved
let me make it up to you

outro
in the meantime we let it go
at the roadside we used to know
we can let this drift away
oh we let this drift away
at the bay side where you used to show
in the moonlight where we let it go
we can let this drift away
oh we let this drift away let me make it up to you
cause youve always got to change your mind
cause youve always got to change your mind
oh love can you hear me
oh let it drift away
