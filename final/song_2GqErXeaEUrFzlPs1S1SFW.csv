and we both go down together
wed stay there forever
just try to get up
and im sorry this wasnt easy
when i asked you believe me
and never let go

verse 1
well im thinking of the worst things
that i could say to you
but a promise doesnt mean a thing anymore

bridge 1
and this never will be right with me
and now youre trying desperately
but im tongue tied and terrified of what ill say

verse 1
and then we both go down together
we may stay there forever
ill just try to get up
and im sorry that this wasnt easy
when i asked you believe me
you never let go
but i let go
see mayday parade liveget tickets as low as 96you might also likeverse 2
i could only sing you sad songs
and you could sing along
and you could see the melody
has been calling out your wrongs

bridge 1
and this never will be right with me
and now youre trying to desperately
but im tongue tied and terrified of what ill say

bridge 2
but i never told you everything
im losing hope and fading dreams
and every single memory along the way

chorus
and then we both go down together
we may stay there forever
ill just try to get up
and im sorry that this wasnt easy
when i asked you believe me
you never let go
but i let go

and we both go down together
and stay there forever
just try to get up
and then we both go down together
we may stay there forever
ill just try to get up
and im sorry that this wasnt easy
when i asked you
believe me
you never let go
but i let goembed"
