he was the congregations vagrant
with an unrequited love
when your passions exaltation
then finding refuge is not enough
she was the youngest of the family
and the last to be let go
when they decided they would try
and make it on their own

chorus
oh memories whered you go
you were all ive ever known
how i miss yesterday
and how i let it fade away
whered you go
oh ohohoh oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh ohohoh oh oh oh oh oh oh

verse 2
when july became december
their affection fought the cold
but they couldnt quite remember
what inspired them to go
and it was beautifully depressing
like a streetcar named desire
they were fighting for their love
that had started growing tired tired

oh memories whered you go
you were all ive ever known
how i miss yesterday
and how i let it fade away
dont fade away

verse 3
when money lost momentum
and the bills were piling high
then the smile had finally faded
from the apple of their eye
they were young and independent
and they thought they had it planned
shouldve known right from the start
you cant predict the end

chorus
oh memories whered you go
you were all ive ever known
how i miss yesterday
and how i let it fade away
oh memories whered you go oh ohohoh oh
you were all ive ever known oh oh oh oh oh
how i miss yesterday oh ohohoh oh
and how i let it fade away oh oh oh oh oh
dont fade away
