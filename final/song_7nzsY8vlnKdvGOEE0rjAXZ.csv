arabellas got some interstellargator skin boots
and a helter skelter round her little finger
and i ride it endlessly
shes got a barbarella silver swimsuit
and when she needs to shelter from reality
she takes a dip in my daydreams

chorus
my days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
that little lady sittin on the passenger side
its much less picturesque without her catchin the light
the horizon tries but its just not as kind on the eyes
as arabella oh
as arabella

postchorus
just mightve tapped into your mind and soul
you cant be sure

verse 2
arabellas got a 70s head
but shes a modern lover its an exploration
shes made of outer space
and her lips are like the galaxys edge
and her kiss the colour of a constellation
fallin into place

my days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
that little lady sittin on the passenger side
its much less picturesque without her catchin the light
the horizon tries but its just not as kind on the eyes
as arabella oh
as arabella

postchorus
just mightve tapped into your mind and soul
you cant be sure

bridge
thats magic in a cheetah print coat
just a slip underneath it i hope
asking if i can have one of those
organic cigarettes that she smokes
wraps her lips round a mexican coke
makes you wish that you were the bottle
takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like

outro
just mightve tapped into your mind and soul
you cant be sure192embed"
