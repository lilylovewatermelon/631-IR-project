i wish we were stuck up a tree
then wed know that its nicer below
i dont know any lullabyes
i dont know how to make you mine
but i can learn
in lonely days long ago
i saw lovers put on a show
well now its my turn

verse 2
drive you home then wait by the phone
for that call for a walk in the fall
no harm will come of this
one little midnight kiss
it will not burn
so many lonely days
i feel like a throw away
well now its my turn

outro
falling down is no longer around
feeling sun im no longer one
well isnt this funyou might also like2embed"
