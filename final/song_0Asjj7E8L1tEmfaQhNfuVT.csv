intro
now get the fuck up off me nigga

verse big boi
as i struggle to keep my balance and composure
im posed to propose a toast to players on every coasta
the lyrical roller coaster mindbender
stead of watchin these sucker mcs
im seein just how they lyin to the general population
dont be patient get up and stand up for your life
dont you agree or understand we lost some rights at 119
come dumb come young come blind unwind confined
to the situation we facin cause in time tick tick boom

verse 1 big boi
when will we all awake up out this dream
come here and smell the folgers the soldiers are human beings
man actin as if he was the supreme being
clockin the souls of men out like he was god and
warah therell be no tomorrow but sorrow
and horror will follow the hollow hearts battle for dollars
politicians modernday magicians
physicians of death more health care for poor health
who makin us ill they makin us kill
thats makin me spill my guts chill big lay in the cut
for what i refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled
like i do nothin all day but sit around watch the cartoon channel
i rap about the presidential election and the scandal
that followed and we all watched the nation as it swallowed
and chalked it up basically america you got fucked
the media shucked and jived now we stuck damn

verse 2 big boi
operation anaconda ask yourself
was it full of bleeps and blunders did they ever find osama
and why in the fuck did daniel pearl have to pay the price
for his life and his wife plead twice
see alamin got life and fred got dead hampton
to dampen the dream of all the panthers
they got they answer for ransom
as we read together as we dream together
count your blessings whenever you feel that things wont be no better
but it got to you gave me this microphone so i must rock you
your brainwaves airwaves energized and shocked you
yall got me well i got yall long as i know yall listenin
ima always bring food for thought to the table in the kitchen
now eat niggaembed"
