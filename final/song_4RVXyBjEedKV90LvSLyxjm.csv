outro
do we have enough
uh what did i say
ima just write down shit and then
i know for a fact you said warmth and unconditional love
alright okay so what if
in the beginning im saying
in my eyes youre a combination of
the kindness and compassion of my mother
and the warmth and—what did i say
warmth and unconditional love of my father
and when were together this and that and i feel this
and the way that you treat me is this
and i feel i feel i it takes me back to this
and and that feeling is good but are you really good to me
and then its
who are you when im not around is it the same
thats fire
are you basically like if we could say it in a cool way
like do you act like youre single when its not us two
you know like that kind of thing you know what im saying
like really kind of dig in and make this story like set up in a way thats like oh shit
do i get that im recording right do i
is it is it deceit you know or is it is it real but only when
is it real is it real around me and to the world you you fake something
you know
right
and cause some people some people arent really
some people arent really um bad people
but they feel like they have to be you know
right
to get even deeper into it
like i think some men were raised a certain way
but they get around other kind of men and get insecure
and feel like they have to be that way
you know what im saying
like they have to be that way or they feel like
okay this is how im gonna
this is the way its supposed to be because my boys told me that
you know
so i think its kind of like the other perspective of not like
coming from a woman whos with a man thats no good
but its a man that is good to me
but you have be good to me when im not around
and you have to think of who you really want to be
right
ah la la la you got to be good to me
yeah anyway
had to dig into it real quick
what did i say4embed"
