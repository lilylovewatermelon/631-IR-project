everywhere that i go everywhere that i be
if you were not surrounding me with your energy
i dont wanna be there dont wanna be anywhere
anyplace that i cant feel you i just wanna be near you

chorus
and yes im a mess but im blessed
to be stuck with you
sometimes it gets unhealthy
we cant be by ourselves we
will always need each other
and yes im a mess but im blessed
to be stuck with you
i just want you to know that
if i could i swear id go back
make everything all better whoa

verse 2
its the things that you say
its the way that you prey
prey on my insecurities
i know youre feelin me
i know sometimes i do wrong
but hear the words of this song
when i go i dont stay gone for long
dont know whats going on
