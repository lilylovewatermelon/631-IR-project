it was not what you wanted
now the walls say your name
and the pictures are haunted

does my ring burn your finger
did my love weigh you down
was a promise too much to keep around

i remember your words
and i cant keep from crying
i could never believe
that your kisses were lying

was there something from the past
buried in a shallow grave
did you think that it was too far gone to save

please tell me baby
please tell me now
you say that i should just go on
now please tell me how

now its just me and the night
and im so broken hearted
i just wait in the dark here
for my dearly departed
