how is she how is she

verse 1
i aint gonna lie when i saw you show up here tonight
i thought to hell with that closed my tab
yellow cab take me back home
cause runnin into you sure aint what i was tryna do
no but here we are at the bar catchin up hows that job goin
best friends talk and i know yall go way back
answers gonna hurt but i still gotta ask

chorus
how is she likin that life out in colorado
how is she wearin red round all them denver broncos
how is she makin friends makin rent i gotta know
how is she doin fine smilin in all her pictures
how is she gettin drunk and not sendin one damn i miss ya
i aint been bouncin back i aint been gettin sleep
i aint been gеttin over us how is she

verse 2
does shе miss her hometown
does she wish she woulda turned around
does she ask about the folks she used to know
used to hold on a night like this
is she better than shes ever been
heart to brokenhearted
if you talk to her tomorrow dont say you saw me like this but

how is she likin that life out in colorado
how is she wearin red round all them denver broncos
