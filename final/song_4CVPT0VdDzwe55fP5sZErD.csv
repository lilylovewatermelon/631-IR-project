strange now to think of you gone without corsets  eyes while i walk on
the sunny pavement of greenwich village
downtown manhattan clear winter noon and ive been up all night talking
talking reading the kaddish aloud listening to ray charles blues
shout blind on the phonograph
the rhythm the rhythmand your memory in my head three years after
and read adonais last triumphant stanzas aloudwept realizing
how we suffer
and how death is that remedy all singers dream of sing remember
prophesy as in the hebrew anthem or the buddhist book of an
swersand my own imagination of a withered leafat dawn
dreaming back thru life your timeand mine accelerating toward apoca
lypse
the final momentthe flower burning in the dayand what comes after
looking back on the mind itself that saw an american city
a flash away and the great dream of me or china or you and a phantom
russia or a crumpled bed that never existed
like a poem in the darkescaped back to oblivion
no more to say and nothing to weep for but the beings in the dream
trapped in its disappearance
sighing screaming with it buying and selling pieces of phantom worship
ping each other
worshipping the god included in it alllonging or inevitabilitywhile it
lasts a visionanything more
it leaps about me as i go out and walk the street look back over my shoulder
seventh avenue the battlements of window office buildings shoul
dering each other high under a cloud tall as the sky an instantand
the sky abovean old blue place
or down the avenue to the south toas i walk toward the lower east side
where you walked 50 years ago little girlfrom russia eating the
first poisonous tomatoes of america frightened on the dock
then struggling in the crowds of orchard street toward whattoward
newark
toward candy store first homemade sodas of the century handchurned ice
cream in backroom on musty brownfloor boards
toward education marriage nervous breakdown operation teaching school
and learning to be mad in a dreamwhat is this life
toward the key in the windowand the great key lays its head of light
on top of manhattan and over the floor and lays down on the
sidewalkin a single vast beam moving as i walk down first toward
the yiddish theaterand the place of poverty
you knew and i know but without caring nowstrange to have moved
thru paterson and the west and europe and here again
with the cries of spaniards now in the doorstops doors and dark boys on
the street fire escapes old as you
tho youre not old now thats left here with me
myself anyhow maybe as old as the universeand i guess that dies with
usenough to cancel all that comeswhat came is gone forever
every time
thats good that leaves it open for no regretno fear radiators lacklove
torture even toothache in the end
though while it comes it is a lion that eats the souland the lamb the soul
in us alas offering itself in sacrifice to changes fierce hungerhair
and teethand the roar of bonepain skull bare break rib rotskin
braintricked implacability
ai ai we do worse we are in a fix and youre out death let you out
death had the mercy youre done with your century done with
god done with the path thru itdone with yourself at lastpure
back to the babe dark before your father before us allbefore the
world
there rest no more suffering for you i know where youve gone its good
no more flowers in the summer fields of new york no joy now no more
fear of louis
and no more of his sweetness and glasses his high school decades debts
loves frightened telephone calls conception beds relatives hands
no more of sister elanorshe gone before youwe kept it secret you
killed heror she killed herself to bear with youan arthritic heart
but deaths killed you bothno matter
nor your memory of your mother 1915 tears in silent movies weeks and
weeksforgetting agrieve watching marie dressler address human
ity chaplin dance in youth
or boris godunov chaliapins at the met halling his voice of a weeping czar
by standing room with elanor  maxwatching also the capital
ists take seats in orchestra white furs diamonds
with the ypsls hitchhiking thru pennsylvania in black baggy gym skirts
pants photograph of 4 girls holding each other round the waste and
laughing eye too coy virginal solitude of 1920
all girls grown old or dead now and that long hair in the gravelucky to
have husbands later
you made iti came tooeugene my brother before still grieving now and
will gream on to his last stiff hand as he goes thru his canceror kill
later perhapssoon he will think
and its the last moment i remember which i see them all thru myself now
tho not you
i didnt foresee what you feltwhat more hideous gape of bad mouth came
firstto youand were you prepared
to go where in that darkthatin that god a radiance a lord in the
void like an eye in the black cloud in a dream adonoi at last with
you
beyond my remembrance incapable to guess not merely the yellow skull
in the grave or a box of worm dust and a stained ribbondeaths
head with halo can you believe it
is it only the sun that shines once for the mind only the flash of existence
than none ever was
nothing beyond what we havewhat you hadthat so pitifulyet tri
umph
to have been here and changed like a tree broken or flowerfed to the
groundbut made with its petals colored thinking great universe
shaken cut in the head leaf stript hid in an egg crate hospital cloth
wrapped sorefreaked in the moon brain naughtless
no flower like that flower which knew itself in the garden and fought the
knifelost
cut down by an idiot snowmans icyeven in the springstrange ghost

rosesa dog for his eyescock of a sweatshopheart of electric
irons

hospitals
you once kicked elanor in the leg she died of heart failure later you of
stroke asleep within a year the two of you sisters in death is

midnight accountings not sure his life passesas he seesand
what does he doubt now still dream of making money or that might
have made money hired nurse had children found even your im
mortality naomi

ii
over and overrefrainof the hospitalsstill havent written your
historyleave it abstracta few images
run thru the mindlike the saxophone chorus of houses and years
remembrance of electrical shocks
by long nites as a child in paterson apartment watching over your
nervousnessyou were fatyour next move
by that afternoon i stayed home from school to take care of you
once and for allwhen i vowed forever that once man disagreed with my
opinion of the cosmos i was lost
by my later burdenvow to illuminate mankindthis is release of
particularsmad as yousanity a trick of agreement
but you stared out the window on the broadway church corner and
spied a mystical assassin from newark
so phoned the doctorok go way for a restso i put on my coat
and walked you downstreeton the way a grammarschool boy screamed
unaccountablywhere you goin lady to death i shuddered
and you covered your nose with motheaten fur collar gas mask
against poison sneaked into downtown atmosphere sprayed by grandma
and was the driver of the cheesebox public service bus a member of
the gang you shuddered at his face i could hardly get you onto new
york very times square to grab another greyhound
where we hung around 2 hours fighting invisible bugs and jewish sickness—breeze poisoned by roosevelt—
out to get you—and me tagging along hoping it would end in a quiet room in a victorian house by a lake
ride 3 hours thru tunnels past all american industry bayonne preparing for world war ii tanks gas fields soda factories diners locomotive roundhouse fortress—into piney woods new jersey indians—calm towns—long roads thru sandy tree fields—
bridges by deerless creeks old wampum loading the streambeddown there a tomahawk or pocahontas bone—and a million old ladies voting for roosevelt in brown small houses roads off the madness highway—
perhaps a hawk in a tree or a hermit looking for an owlfilled branch—
all the time arguing—afraid of strangers in the forward double seat snoring regardless—what busride they snore on now
‘allen you don’t understand—it’s—ever since those 3 big sticks up my back—they did something to me in hospital they poisoned me they want to see me dead—3 big sticks 3 big sticks—
‘the bitch old grandma last week i saw her dressed in pants like an old man with a sack on her back climbing up the brick side of the apartment
‘on the fire escape with poison germs to throw on me—at night—maybe louis is helping her—he’s under her power—
‘i’m your mother take me to lakewood’ near where graf zeppelin had crashed before all hitler in explosion ‘where i can hide’
we got there—dr whatzis rest home—she hid behind a closet—demanded a blood transfusion
we were kicked out—tramping with valise to unknown shady lawn houses—dusk pine trees after dark—long dead street filled with crickets and poison ivy—
i shut her up by now—big house rest home rooms—gave the landlady her money for the week—carried up the iron valise—sat on bed waiting to escape—
neat room in attic with friendly bedcover—lace curtains—spinning wheel rug—stained wallpaper old as naomi we were home
i left on the next bus to new york—laid my head back in the last seat depressed—the worst yet to come—abandoning her rode in torpor—i was only 12
would she hide in her room and come out cheerful for breakfast or lock her door and stare thru the window for sidestreet spies listen at keyholes for hitlerian invisible gas dream in a chair—or mock me by—in front of a mirror alone
12 riding the bus at nite thru new jersey have left naomi to parcae in lakewood’s haunted house—left to my own fate bus—sunk in a seat—all violins broken—my heart sore in my ribs—mind was empty—would she were safe in her coffin—
or back at normal school in newark studying up on america in a black skirt—winter on the street without lunch—a penny a pickle—home at night to take care of elanor in the bedroom—
first nervous breakdown was 1919—she stayed home from school and lay in a dark room for three weeks—something bad—never said what—every noise hurt—dreams of the creaks of wall street—
before the gray depression—went upstate new york—recovered—lou took photo of her sitting crossleg on the grass—her long hair wound with flowers—smiling—playing lullabies on mandolin—poison ivy smoke in leftwing summer camps and me in infancy saw trees—
or back teaching school laughing with idiots the backward classes—her russian specialty—morons with dreamy lips great eyes thin feet  sicky fingers swaybacked rachitic—
great heads pendulous over alice in wonderland a blackboard full of c a t
naomi reading patiently story out of a communist fairy book—tale of the sudden sweetness of the dictator—forgiveness of warlocks—armies kissing—
deathsheads around the green table—the king  the workers—paterson press printed them up in the ’30s till she went mad or they folded both
o paterson i got home late that nite louis was worried how could i be so—didn’t i think i shouldn’t have left her mad in lakewood call the doctor phone the home in the pines too late
went to bed exhausted wanting to leave the world probably that year newly in love with r         my high school mind hero jewish boy who came a doctor later—then silent neat kid—
i later laying down life for him moved to manhattan—followed him to college—prayed on ferry to help mankind if admitted—vowed the day i journeyed to entrance exam—
by being honest revolutionary labor lawyer—would train for that—inspired by sacco vanzetti norman thomas debs altgeld sandburg poe—little blue books i wanted to be president or senator
ignorant woe—later dreams of kneeling by r’s shocked knees declaring my love of 1941—what sweetness he’d have shown me tho that i’d wished him  despaired—first love—a crush—
later a mortal avalanche whole mountains of homosexuality matterhorns of cock grand canyons of asshole—weight on my melancholy head—
meanwhile i walked on broadway imagining infinity like a rubber ball without space beyond—what’s outside—coming home to graham avenue still melancholy passing the lone green hedges across the street dreaming after the movies—
the telephone rang at 2 am—emergency—she’d gone mad—naomi hiding under the bed screaming bugs of mussolini—help louis buba fascists death—the landlady frightened—old fag attendant screaming back at her—
terror that woke the neighbors—old ladies on the second floor recovering from menopause—all those rags between thighs clean sheets sorry over lost babies—husbands ashen—children sneering at yale or putting oil in hair at ccny—or trembling in montclair state teachers college like eugene—
her big leg crouched to her breast hand outstretched keep away wool dress on her thighs fur coat dragged under the bed—she barricaded herself under bedspring with suitcases
louis in pajamas listening to phone frightened—do now—who could know—my fault delivering her to solitude—sitting in the dark room on the sofa trembling to figure out—
he took the morning train to lakewood naomi still under bed—thought he brought poison cops—naomi screaming—louis what happened to your heart then have you been killed by naomi’s ecstasy
dragged her out around the corner a cab forced her in with valise but the driver left them off at drugstore bus stop two hours’ wait
i lay in bed nervous in the 4room apartment the big bed in living room next to louis’ desk—shaking—he came home that nite late told me what happened
naomi at the prescription counter defending herself from the enemy—racks of children’s books douche bags aspirins pots blood—‘don’t come near me—murderers keep away promise not to kill me’
louis in horror at the soda fountain—with lakewood girlscouts—coke addicts—nurses—busmen hung on schedule—police from country precinct dumbed—and a priest dreaming of pigs on an ancient cliff
smelling the air—louis pointing to emptiness—customers vomiting their cokes—or staring—louis humiliated—naomi triumphant—the announcement of the plot bus arrives the drivers won’t have them on trip to new york
phonecalls to dr whatzis ‘she needs a rest’ the mental hospital—state greystone doctors—‘bring her here mr ginsberg’
naomi naomi—sweating bulgeeyed fat the dress unbuttoned at one side—hair over brow her stocking hanging evilly on her legs—screaming for a blood transfusion—one righteous hand upraised—a shoe in it—barefoot in the pharmacy—
the enemies approach—what poisons tape recorders fbi zhdanov hiding behind the counter trotsky mixing rat bacteria in the back of the store uncle sam in newark plotting deathly perfumes in the negro district uncle ephraim drunk with murder in the politician’s bar scheming of hague aunt rose passing water thru the needles of the spanish civil war
till the hired 35 ambulance came from red bank——grabbed her arms—strapped her on the stretcher—moaning poisoned by imaginaries vomiting chemicals thru jersey begging mercy from essex county to morristown—
and back to greystone where she lay three years—that was the last breakthrough delivered her to madhouse again—
on what wards—i walked there later oft—old catatonic ladies gray as cloud or ash or walls—sit crooning over floorspace—chairs—and the wrinkled hags acreep accusing—begging my 13yearold mercy—
‘take me home’—i went alone sometimes looking for the lost naomi taking shock—and i’d say ‘no you’re crazy mama—trust the drs’—
and eugene my brother her elder son away studying law in a furnished room in newark—
came patersonward next day—and he sat on the brokendown couch in the living room—‘we had to send her back to greystone’—
—his face perplexed so young then eyes with tears—then crept weeping all over his face—‘what for’ wail vibrating in his cheekbones eyes closed up high voice—eugene’s face of pain
him faraway escaped to an elevator in the newark library his bottle daily milk on windowsill of 5 week furn room downtown at trolley tracks—
he worked 8 hrs a day for 20wk—thru law school years—stayed by himself innocent near negro whorehouses
unlaid poor virgin—writing poems about ideals and politics letters to the editor pat eve news—we both wrote denouncing senator borah and isolationists—and felt mysterious toward paterson city hall—
i sneaked inside it once—local moloch tower with phallus spire  cap o’ ornament strange gothic poetry that stood on market street—replica lyons’ hotel de ville—
wings balcony  scrollwork portals gateway to the giant city clock secret map room full of hawthorne—dark debs in the board of tax—rembrandt smoking in the gloom—
silent polished desks in the great committee room—aldermen bd of finance mosca the hairdresser aplot—crapp the gangster issuing orders from the john—the madmen struggling over zone fire cops  backroom metaphysics—we’re all dead—outside by the bus stop eugene stared thru childhood—
where the evangelist preached madly for 3 decades hardhaired cracked  true to his mean bible—chalked prepare to meet thy god on civic pave—
or god is love on the railroad overpass concrete—he raved like i would rave the lone evangelist—death on city hall—
but gene young—been montclair teachers college 4 years—taught half year  quit to go ahead in life—afraid of discipline problems—dark sex italian students raw girls getting laid no english sonnets disregarded—and he did not know much—just that he lost—
so broke his life in two and paid for law—read huge blue books and rode the ancient elevator 13 miles away in newark  studied up hard for the future
just found the scream of naomi on his failure doorstep for the final time naomi gone us lonely—home—him sitting there—
then have some chicken soup eugene the man of evangel wails in front of city hall and this year lou has poetic loves of suburb middle age—in secret—music from his 1937 book—sincere—he longs for beauty—
no love since naomi screamed—since 1923—now lost in greystone ward—new shock for her—electricity following the 40 insulin
and metrazol had made her fat

so that a few years later she came home again—we’d much advanced and planned—i waited for that day—my mother again to cook  —play the piano—sing at mandolin—lung stew  stenka razin  the communist line on the war with finland—and louis in debt—uspected to he poisoned money—mysterious capitalisms
— walked down the long front hall  looked at the furniture she
never remembered it all some amnesia examined the doilies—and the dining room set was sold—
the mahogany table—20 years love—gone to the junk man—we still had the piano—and the book of poe—and the mandolin tho needed some string dusty—
she went to the backroom to lie down in bed and ruminate or nap hide—i went in with her not leave her by herself—lay in bed next to her—shades pulled dusky late afternoon—louis in front room at desk waiting—perhaps boiling chicken for supper—
‘don’t be afraid of me because i’m just coming back home from the mental hospital—i’m your mother—’
poor love lost—a fear—i lay there—said ‘i love you naomi’—stiff next to her arm i would have cried was this the comfortless lone union—nervous and she got up soon
was she ever satisfied and—by herself sat on the new couch by the front windows uneasy—cheek leaning on her hand—narrowing eye—at what fate that day—
picking her tooth with her nail lips formed an o suspicion—thought’s old worn vagina—absent sideglance of eye—some evil debt written in the wall unpaid— the aged breasts of newark come near—
may have heard radio gossip thru the wires in her head controlled by 3 big sticks left in her back by gangsters in amnesia thru the hospital—caused pain between her shoulders—
into her head—roosevelt should know her case she told me—afraid to kill her now that the government knew their names—traced back to hitler—wanted to leave louis’ house forever
one night sudden attack—her noise in the bathroom—like croaking up her soul—convulsions and red vomit coming out of her mouth—diarrhea water exploding from her behind—on all fours in front of the toilet—urine running between her legs—left retching on the tile floor smeared with her black feces—unfainted—
at forty varicosed nude fat doomed hiding outside the apartment door near the elevator calling police yelling for her girlfriend rose to help—
once locked herself in with razor or iodine—could hear her cough in tears at sink—lou broke through glass greenpainted door we pulled her out to the bedroom
then quiet for months that winter—walks alone nearby on broadway read daily worker—broke her arm fell on icy street—
began to scheme escape from cosmic financial murderplots—later she ran away to the bronx to her sister elanor and there’s another saga of late naomi in new york
or thru elanor or the workmen’s circle where she worked addressing envelopes she made out—went shopping for campbell’s tomato soup—saved money louis mailed her—
later she found a boyfriend and he was a doctor—dr isaac worked for national maritime union—now italian bald and pudgy old doll—who was himself an orphan—but they kicked him out—old cruelties—
sloppier sat around on bed or chair in corset dreaming to herself—‘i’m hot—i’m getting fat—i used to have such a beautiful figure before i went to the hospital—you should have seen me in woodbine—’ this in a furnished room around the nmu hall 1943
looking at naked baby pictures in the magazine—baby powder advertisements strained lamb carrots—‘i will think nothing but beautiful thoughts’
revolving her head round and round on her neck at window light in summertime in hypnotize in dovendream recall—
‘i touch his cheek i touch his cheek he touches my lips with his hand i think beautiful thoughts the baby has a beautiful hand’—
or a noshake of her body disgust—some thought of buchenwald—some insulin passes thru her head—a grimace nerve shudder at involuntary as shudder when i piss—bad chemical in her cortex—‘no don’t think of that he’s a rat’
naomi ‘and when we die we become an onion a cabbage a carrot or a squash a vegetable’ i come downtown from columbia and agree she reads the bible thinks beautiful thoughts all day
‘yesterday i saw god what did he look like well in the afternoon i climbed up a ladder—he has a cheap cabin in the country like monroe ny the chicken farms in the wood he was a lonely old man with a white beard
‘i cooked supper for him i made him a nice supper—lentil soup vegetables bread  butter—miltz—he sat down at the table and ate he was sad
‘i told him look at all those fightings and killings down there what’s the matter why don’t you put a stop to it
‘i try he said—that’s all he could do he looked tired he’s a bachelor so long and he likes lentil soup’
serving me meanwhile a plate of cold fish—chopped raw cabbage dript with tapwater—smelly tomatoes—weekold health food—grated beets  carrots with leaky juice warm—more and more disconsolate food—i can’t eat it for nausea sometimes—the charity of her hands stinking with manhattan madness desire to please me cold undercooked fish—pale red near the bones her smells—and oft naked in the room so that i stare ahead or turn a book ignoring her
one time i thought she was trying to make me come lay her—flirting to herself at sink—lay back on huge bed that filled most of the room dress up round her hips big slash of hair scars of operations pancreas belly wounds abortions appendix stitching of incisions pulling down in the fat like hideous thick zippers—ragged long lips between her legs—what even smell of asshole i was cold—later revolted a little not much—seemed perhaps a good idea to try—know the monster of the beginning womb—perhaps—that way would she care she needs a lover
yisborach v’yistabach v’yispoar v’yisroman v’yisnaseh v’yishador v’yishalleh v’yishallol sh’meh d’kudsho b’rich hu
and louis reestablishing himself in paterson grimy apartment in negro district—living in dark rooms—but found himself a girl he later married falling in love again—tho sere  shy—hurt with 20 years naomi’s mad idealism
once i came home after longtime in ny he’s lonely—sitting in the bedroom he at desk chair turned round to face me—weeps tears in red eyes under his glasses—
that we’d left him—gene gone strangely into army—she out on her own in ny almost childish in her furnished room so louis walked downtown to postoffice to get mail taught in highschool—stayed at poetry desk forlorn—ate grief at bickford’s all these years—are gone
eugene got out of the army came home changed and lone—cut off his nose in jewish operation—for years stopped girls on broadway for cups of coffee to get laid—went to nyu serious there to finish law—
and gene lived with her ate naked fishcakes cheap while she got crazier—he got thin or felt helpless naomi striking 1920 poses at the moon halfnaked in the next bed
bit his nails and studied—was the weird nurseson—next year he moved to a room near columbia—though she wanted to live with her children—
‘listen to your mother’s plea i beg you’—louis still sending her checks—i was in bughouse that year 8 months—my own visions unmentioned in this here lament—
but then went half mad—hitler in her room she saw his mustache in the sink—afraid of dr isaac now suspecting that he was in on the newark plot—went up to bronx to live near elanor’s rheumatic heart—
and uncle max never got up before noon tho naomi at 6 am was listening to the radio for spies—or searching the windowsill
for in the empty lot downstairs an old man creeps with his bag stuffing packages of garbage in his hanging black overcoat
max’s sister edie works—17 years bookkeeper at gimbels—lived downstairs in apartment house divorced—so edie took in naomi on rochambeau ave—
woodlawn cemetery across the street vast dale of graves where poe once—last stop on bronx subway—lots of communists in that area
who enrolled for painting classes at night in bronx adult high school—walked alone under van cortlandt elevated line to class—paints naomiisms—
humans sitting on the grass in some camp noworry summers yore—saints with droopy faces and longillfitting pants from hospital—
brides in front of lower east side with short grooms—lost el trains running over the babylonian apartment rooftops in the bronx—
sad paintings—but she expressed herself her mandolin gone all strings broke in her head she tried toward beauty or some old life message
but started kicking elanor and elanor had heart trouble—came upstairs and asked her about spydom for hours—elanor frazzled max away at office accounting for cigar stores till at night
‘i am a great woman—am truly a beautiful soul—and because of that they hitler grandma hearst the capitalists franco daily news the ’20s mussolini the living dead want to shut me up—buba’s the head of a spider network—’
kicking the girls edie  elanor—woke edie at midnite to tell her she was a spy and elanor a rat edie worked all day and couldn’t take it—she was organizing the union—and elanor began dying upstairs in bed
the relatives call me up she’s getting worse—i was the only one left—went on the subway with eugene to see her ate stale fish—
‘my sister whispers in the radio—louis must be in the apartment—his mother tells him what to say—liars—i cooked for my two children—i played the mandolin—’
last night the nightingale woke me  last night when all was still  it sang in the golden moonlight  from on the wintry hill she did
i pushed her against the door and shouted ‘don’t kick elanor’—she stared at me—contempt—die—disbelief her sons are so naive so dumb—‘elanor is the worst spy she’s taking orders’
‘—no wires in the room’—i’m yelling at her—last ditch eugene listening on the bed—what can he do to escape that fatal mama—‘you’ve been away from louis years already—grandma’s too old to walk—’
we’re all alive at once then—even me  gene  naomi in one mythological cousinesque room—screaming at each other in the forever—i in columbia jacket she half undressed
i banging against her head which saw radios sticks hitlers—the gamut of hallucinations—for real—her own universe—no road that goes elsewhere—to my own—no america not even a world—
that you go as all men as van gogh as mad hannah all the same—to the last doom—thunder spirits lightning
i’ve seen your grave o strange naomi my own—cracked grave shema y’israel—i am svul avrum—you—in death

your last night in the darkness of the bronx—i phonecalled—thru hospital to secret police
that came when you and i were alone shrieking at elanor in my ear—who breathed hard in her own bed got thin—
nor will forget the doorknock at your fright of spies—law advancing on my honor—eternity entering the room—you running to the bathroom undressed hiding in protest from the last heroic fate—
staring at my eyes betrayed—the final cops of madness rescuing me—from your foot against the broken heart of elanor
your voice at edie weary of gimbels coming home to broken radio—and louis needing a poor divorce he wants to get married soon—eugene dreaming hiding at 125 st suing negroes for money on crud furniture defending black girls—
protests from the bathroom—said you were sane—dressing in a cotton robe your shoes then new your purse and newspaper clippingsno—your honesty—
as you vainly made your lips more real with lipstick looking in the mirror to see if the insanity was me or a earful of police
or grandma spying at 78—your vision—her climbing over the walls of the cemetery with political kidnapper’s bag—or what you saw on the walls of the bronx in pink nightgown at midnight staring out the window on the empty lot—
ah rochambeau ave—playground of phantoms—last apartment in the bronx for spies—last home for elanor or naomi here these communist sisters lost their revolution—
‘all right—put on your coat mrs—let’s go—we have the wagon downstairs—you want to come with her to the station’
the ride then—held naomi’s hand and held her head to my breast i’m taller—kissed her and said i did it for the best—elanor sick—and max with heart condition—needs—
to me—‘why did you do this’—‘yes mrs your son will have to leave you in an hour’—the ambulance
came in a few hours—drove off at 4 am to some bellevue in the night downtown—gone to the hospital forever i saw her led away—she waved tears in her eyes

two years after a trip to mexico—bleak in the flat plain near brentwood scrub brush and grass around the unused rr train track to the crazyhouse—
new brick 20 story central building—lost on the vast lawns of madtown on long island—huge cities of the moon
asylum spreads out giant wings above the path to a minute black hole—the door—entrance thru crotch—
i went in—smelt funny—the halls again—up elevator—to a glass door on a women’s ward—to naomi—two nurses buxom white—they led her out naomi stared—and i gaspt—she’d had a stroke—
too thin shrunk on her bones—age come to naomi—now broken into white hair—loose dress on her skeleton—face sunk old withered—cheek of crone—
one hand stiff—heaviness of forties  menopause reduced by one heart stroke lame now—wrinkles—a scar on her head the lobotomy—ruin the hand dipping downwards to death—

o russian faced woman on the grass your long black hair is crowned with flowers the mandolin is on your knees—
communist beauty sit here married in the summer among daisies promised happiness at hand—
holy mother now you smile on your love your world is born anew children run naked in the field spotted with dandelions
they eat in the plum tree grove at the end of the meadow and find a cabin where a whitehaired negro teaches the mystery of his rainbarrel—
blessed daughter come to america i long to hear your voice again remembering your mother’s music in the song of the natural front—
o glorious muse that bore me from the womb gave suck first mystic life  taught me talk and music from whose pained head i first took vision—
tortured and beaten in the skull—what mad hallucinations of the damned that drive me out of my own skull to seek eternity till i find peace for thee o poetry—and for all humankind call on the origin
death which is the mother of the universe—now wear your nakedness forever white flowers in your hair your marriage sealed behind the sky—no revolution might destroy that maidenhood—
o beautiful garbo of my karma—all photographs from 1920 in camp nichtgedeiget here unchanged—with all the teachers from vewark—nor elanor be gone nor max await his specter—nor louis retire from this high school—

back you naomi skull on you gaunt immortality and revolution come—small broken woman—the ashen indoor eyes of hospitals ward grayness on skin—
‘are you a spy’ i sat at the sour table eyes filling with tears—‘who are you did louis send you—the wires—’
in her hair as she beat on her head—‘i’m not a bad girl—don’t murder me—i hear the ceiling—i raised two children—’
two years since i’d been there—i started to cry—she stared—nurse broke up the meeting a moment—i went into the bathroom to hide against the toilet white walls
‘the horror’ i weeping—to see her again—‘the horror’—as if she were dead thru funeral rot in—‘the horror’
i came back she yelled more—they led her away—‘you’re not allen—’ i watched her face—but she passed by me not looking—
opened the door to the ward—she went thru without a glance back quiet suddenly—i stared out—she looked old—the verge of the grave—‘all the horror’

another year i left ny—on west coast in berkeley cottage dreamed of her soul—that thru life in what form it stood in that body ashen or manic gone beyond joy—
near its death—with eyes—was my own love in its form the naomi my mother on earth still—sent her long letter— wrote hymns to the mad—work of the merciful lord of poetry
that causes the broken grass to be green or the rock to break in grass—or the sun to be constant to earth—sun of all sunflowers and days on bright iron bridges—what shines on old hospitals—as on my yard—
returning from san francisco one night orlovsky in my room—whalen in his peaceful chair—a telegram from gene naomi dead—
outside i bent my head to the ground under the bushes near the garage—knew she was better—
at last—not left to look on earth alone—2 years of solitude—no one at age nearing 60—old woman of skulls—once longtressed naomi of bible—
or ruth who wept in america—rebecca aged in newark—david remembering his harp now lawyer at yale
or srul avrum—israel abraham—myself—to sing in the wilderness toward god—o elohim—so to the end—2 days after her death i got her letter—
strange prophecies anew she wrote—‘the key is in the window the key is in the sunlight at the window—i have the key—get married allen don’t take drugs—the key is in the bars in the sunlight in the window
love
your mother’
which is naomi—2embed"
