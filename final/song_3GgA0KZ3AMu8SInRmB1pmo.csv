i used to write
i used to write letters i used to sign my name
i used to sleep at night
before the flashing lights settled deep in my brain
but by the time we met
by the time we met the times had already changed
so i never wrote a letter
i never took my true heart i never wrote it down
so when the lights cut out
i was lost standing in the wilderness downtown

prechorus win butler  régine chassagne
now our lives are changing fast
now our lives are changing fast
hope that something pure can last
hope that something pure can last

verse 2 win butler
and it seems strange
how we used to wait for letters to arrive
but whats stranger still
is how something so small can keep you alive
we used to wait
we used to waste hours just walking around
we used to wait
all those wasted lives in the wilderness downtown
