today i write to you about our sons
the boys start school today
theyre the spitting image of you in every way

hey son its dad
i hope this letter finds you well out of harms way
we saw the news today it frightened your mom
now all she does is pray

if i lead will you follow
will you follow if i lead

hey melissa its me dont be afraid
im in good hands im gonna be home soon
its time to watch the children grow up
i wanna be more than a voice on the phone

thanks ma i got your package today
i love the fields of athenry
i swear i want em to play that song on the pipes
at my funeral when i die

if i lead will you follow
will you follow if i lead
see dropkick murphys liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likei stand alone in the distance
and the foreground slowly moves

if i lead will you follow
will you follow if i lead

we regret to inform you that on january 28th
sgt andrew farrar died while serving his country
in the alanbar province of iraq
words cannot convey our sorrow

if i lead will you follow
will you follow if i lead

when theres nothing on the horizon
youve got nothing left to prove

if i lead will you followembed"
