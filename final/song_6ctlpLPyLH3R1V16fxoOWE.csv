id be the voice that urged orpheus
when her body was found hey yeah
id be the choiceless hope in grief
that drove him underground hey yeah
id be the dreadful need in the devotee
that made him turn around hey yeah
and id be the immediate forgiveness in eurydice
imagine being loved by me

chorus
i wont deny ive got in my mind now hey yeah
all the things i would do
so i try to talk refined for fear that you find out  hey yeah
how im imaginin you

verse 2
id be the last shred of truth
in the lost myth of true love hey yeah
id be the sweet feeling of release
mankind now dreams of hey yeah
thats found in the last witness
before the wave hits marvelling at god hey yeah
before he feels alone one final time and marries the sea
imagine being loved by me
