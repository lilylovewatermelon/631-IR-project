i woke up to a bitter storm bitter year
and noahs ark came washed up on the shore
the riot gear has lined the dawn bitter year
like dogs that shit on your neighbors lawn

prechorus
let freedom ring with all the crazies on parade
let them eat poison and it tastes like lemonade

chorus
back in the usa
for a small town serenade
with fireworks on display
tonight its a heros welcome home
and theres no place else to go
and im takin it to the grave
back in the usa

verse 2
the saddest story ever told bitter year
is feelin safe in our suburban homes
the soldiers of an endless war bitter year
and every church can have a liquor store

prechorus
let freedom ring with all the crazies on parade
let them eat poison and it tastes like lemonade
see green day liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likechorus
back in the usa
for a small town serenade
with fireworks on display
tonight its a heros welcome home
and theres no place else to go
and im takin it to the grave
