hey good girl hey good girl
with your head in the clouds
i bet you i can tell you what you’re thinking about
youll see a good boy youll see a good boy
gonna give you the world
but he’s gonna leave you crying with your heart in the dirt
his lips are dripping honey but he’ll sting you like a bee
so lock up all your love and go and throw away the key
hey good girl hey good girl
get out while you can
i know you think you got a good man

you got a heart of gold
you want a white wedding and a hand you can hold

yeah he’ll leave you in the dust
cause when he says forever
