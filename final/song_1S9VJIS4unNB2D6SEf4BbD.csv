i have thought that you have come back lately
to tear my soul away from me
cause when i see you
you rip my heart out
but all the same youre not to blame
baby baby i love you still

chorus 1
but i need your heart beating next to my heart
in love i am
i need your heart beating next to my heart
in love i am

verse 2
do you remember how i met you child
i was down and i fell for you completely
when i wanted your heart and
you didnt want me but now you do
but now you do

chorus 2
but i need your heart beating next to my heart
in love i am
i need your heart dancing next to my heart
in love i am
