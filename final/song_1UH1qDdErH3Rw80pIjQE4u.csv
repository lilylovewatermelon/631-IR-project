i dont love anyone but myself and marty
cause he holds my money
i wanna be anything on tv i wanna be famous
do you think they want me

bridge
ill clean up while youre at work
matching socks and ironed shirts
sarah shows me how you want it
verse 2
i took my favorite pill on monday it made me go backwards
do you wanna feel good
i made a special drink for myself and im gonna drink it
all by myselfyou might also likeembed"
