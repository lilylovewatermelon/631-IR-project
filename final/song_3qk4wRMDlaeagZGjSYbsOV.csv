oh i know that ill regret this when im sober
but every shot im getting closer getting closer
is it true that eighty proof is the reason im with you
oh i know that ill regret this when its over

postchorus charlie puth  geazy
oohooh ooh ooh you know
oohooh ooh story of my fucking life haha
i just know that ill regret this when its over

verse 1 geazy
eazy
uh yeah i might regret this when tomorrow comes
but them drunk nights are more fun than sober ones
with every shot theyre like aw here kobe comes
but i got this bad bitch tryna throw me buns
if i listened to my uncs all them older ones
they all talk about karma how it slowly comes uh
but life is short enjoy it while youre young
spend my bank account tonight and have to borrow funds
it all started with a light glass
now im asking how long could tonight last
man she had the eeh face with a tight ass
if i had a shot less then i might pass
but im faded and i got a little sedated
i cant believe we made it every night we celebrate it
i live like jim morrison no telling where ill take it
i take her to my room and i tell her get naked

verse 2 geazy
i slipped up with my ex and i smashed again
stayed over now shes bout to get attached again
walls built up around they come crashing in
passed out at 6 am but shes up at ten
doing this was not in my plans
she got up and saw rubbers in the trash can
hoop earrings some bitch left on my nightstand
cussed me out and stormed off like alright then uh
on both sides that was bad for em
why do people do things that be bad for em
say we done with these things then we ask for em
when the sun comes down then we transform
yeah you can probably bet this
by this time tomorrow ill probably regret this
try but it all falls down like tetris
no telling where an eighty proof gets us yeah
