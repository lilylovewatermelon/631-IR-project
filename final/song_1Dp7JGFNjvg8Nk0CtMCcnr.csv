intro
go back and tell it

verse 1
please could you be tender
and i will sit close to you
lets give it a minute before we admit that were through
guess this is the winter
our bodies are young and blue
im at jungle city its late and this song is for you

prechorus
cause i remember the rush when forever was us
before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
well i guess i should go yeah i guess i should go

chorus
hard feelings
these are what they call hard feelings of love
when sweet words and fevers
all leave us right here in the cold oh oh
alone with the hard feelings of love
god i wish i believed ya
when you told me this was my home oh oh
you might also likeverse 2
i light all the candles
cut flowers for all my rooms
i care for myself the way i used to care about you
these days we kiss and we keep busy
the waves come after midnight
i call from underwater
why even try to get right
when youve outgrown a lover oh
the whole world knows but you oh
its time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

chorus
hard feelings
these are what they call hard feelings of love
when sweet words and fevers
all leave us right here in the cold oh oh
alone with the hard feelings of love
god i wish i believed ya
when you told me this was my home oh oh
