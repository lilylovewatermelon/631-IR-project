just sit back
and tell me
im a liar for this
dont roll your eyes
rewind
this happens
way too many times

so sit back
and tell me that youre
tired of this
i know
ill grow up someday
but its 2am
and im too high and dry
and i wont come down soon

chorus
so when i come back
i wont say a word
i know
ive said this before
dont speak liar

no we wont talk
we wont say a word
i know
youve heard this before
dont speak liar

sit back
and tell me why
im so prone to this
do you think im fond of
getting you and letting you down
and ill get mine soon

chorus

bridge
and if the story ends here
i cant be surprised to find
your eyes are open wide
and that i have inspired you

outro
and when you come back
dont say a word
i know
youve said this before
dont speak liar

no we wont talk
we wont say a word
i know
weve heard this before
dont speak liar
dont speak liar
whoaoh
dont speak liarembed"
