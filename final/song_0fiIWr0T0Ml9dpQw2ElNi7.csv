verse 1 ramirez
pull up to your mammy house i put yo family straight to sleep
ridin with the duster by my side im bout to sweep the streets
tell them hoes the score was murder when i hit their fuckin town
tato tip all on that bitch so that they dont make no sound
its the grey59 step inside the columbine
where you witness your demise and this throne will still be mine
grey gorilla mac9 make your heart flatline
