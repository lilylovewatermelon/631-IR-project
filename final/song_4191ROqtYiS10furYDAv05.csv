im sick of smiling
and so is my jaw
cant you see my front is crumbling down
im sick of being someone im not
please get me out of this slump
im sick of clapping
when i know i can do it better for myself
im sick of waiting
sick of all these words that will never matter

hoping for a chance to think on time
and im tracing over your letter
to see if your intentions are as good as mine

but youre getting worse
i swear it
its hard to prove youre an understatement
youre getting worse and i know
that youll be calling calling calling me again

verse 2
im done with everything
that had to do with you
dont worry your pictures are already burned
im done with new friends
dont sell yourself short
youll lose it in the end
