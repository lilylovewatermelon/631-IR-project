theres a tree
outside my home
the sidewalks cracked
out where its roots have grown
someday came
and then left me alone
i should have known back then
that i stayed too long

chorus
i should have known betterx4
but i dont believe i can

verse 2
if my feet
could carve stone
theyd mark a monument
that is never wrong
i was a man
i turned to bone
i never moved and now my
my will is gone

chorus
i should have known betterx4
but i dont believe
no i dont believe
i dont believe i cansee dr dog liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likeembed"
