verse 1
i respect a man raisin his kids all on his own
i respect a man who makes sure he takes care of home

no matter how strong she is for a woman
a man should never attempt to lay his hands on her

i respect the type of girl that tries to love a man
with many flaws and broken laws but still he stands
