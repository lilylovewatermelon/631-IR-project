im running for the edge on top of this bullshit
i dont want to hear it
i found my way again
its hard to explain it i know that i hate it
i dont feel this could be real
i find so hard im falling apart
so much so much for what for what we said

chorus
no matter what i say
you turn your back away
its never going to break you
its never going to make you fall
no matter what i say
you turn your back away
its never going to break you
its never going to make you fall

verse 2
this fake reality
i never can make up the time that you take up
its my worst enemy
im on a mission to feed my addiction
so sick of thoughts so empty
its well overflowed im bound to explode
so much so much for what for what we said
see sum 41 liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likechorus
no matter what i say
you turn your back away
its never going to break you
its never going to make you fall
no matter what i say
you turn your back away
its never going to break you
its never going to make you fall

bridge
somehow between the lines its clearer
locked down and chained up to the mirror
somehow between the lines its clearer
locked down it takes apart of me
