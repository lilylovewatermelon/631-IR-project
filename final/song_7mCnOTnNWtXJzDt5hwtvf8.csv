walked away heard them say
poisoned hearts will never change walked away again
turned away in disgrace
felt the chill upon my face cooling from within

chorus
hard to notice gleaming from the sky
when youre staring at the cracks
hard to notice what is passing by with eyes lowered
you walked away heard them say
poisoned hearts will never change walked away again

bridge
all the cracks they lead right to me
and all the cracks will crawl right through me
all the cracks they lead right to me
and all the cracks will crawl right through me and i fell apart

verse 1
as i walked away heard them say
poisoned hearts will never change walked away again
turned away in disgrace
felt the chill upon my face cooling from withinyou might also like2embed"
