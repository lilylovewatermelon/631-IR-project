if you walk away ill walk away
first tell me which road you will take
i dont want to risk our paths crossing some day
so you walk that way ill walk this way

verse 2
and the future hangs over our heads
and it moves with each current event
until it falls all around like a cold steady rain
just stay in when its looking this way

verse 3
and the moons laying low in the sky
forcing everything metal to shine
and the sidewalk holds diamonds like the jewelry store case
they argue walk this way no walk this way

verse 4
and lauras asleep in my bed
as im leaving she wakes up and says
i dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
baby dont go away come here

verse 5
and theres kids playing guns in the street
and ones pointing his tree branch at me
so i put my hands up i say enough is enough
if you walk away ill walk away
and he shot me dead

i found a liquid cure
from my landlocked blues
itll pass away like a slow parade
its leaving but i dont know how soon

guitar solo

verse 6
and the worlds got me dizzy again
youd think after 22 years id be used to the spin
and it only feels worse when i stay in one place
so im always pacing around or walking away

verse 7
i keep drinking the ink from my pen
and im balancing history books up on my head
but it all boils down to one quotable phrase
if you love something give it away

verse 8
a good woman will pick you apart
a box full of suggestions for your possible heart
but you may be offended and you may be afraid
but dont walk away dont walk away
verse 9
we made love on the living room floor
with the noise in the background of a televised war
and in the deafening pleasure i thought i heard someone say
if we walk away theyll walk away

verse 10
but greed is a bottomless pit
and our freedoms a joke were just taking a piss
and the whole world must watch the sad comic display
if youre still free start running away
cause were coming for you

instrumental

verse 11
ive grown tired of holding this pose
i feel more like a stranger each time i come home
so im making a deal with the devils of fame
saying let me walk away please

verse 12
youll be free child once you have died
from the shackles of language and measurable time
and then we can trade places play musical graves
till then walk away walk away
chorus 2
so im up at dawn putting on my shoes
i just want to make a clean escape
im leaving but i dont know where to
i know im leaving but i dont know where to9embed"
