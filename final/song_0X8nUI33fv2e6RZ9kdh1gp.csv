aint it all too good
looks like lady luck has woken up on the right side

i keep waking up afraid to look on the bright side

i get nervous cause what comes up must come down
i get nervous when im happy
i get nervous cause what comes up must come down

i get nervous when im happy
i get nervous cause what comes up must come down
