when the lights go down
and youre stuck here in this town
with nowhere to go
so you escape through the radio

and you worked all week
to barely make ends meet
well i gotta a little cash burning holes in my pocket
foot on the gas taking off like a rocket

chorus
so come on come on baby im buying
i got enough to last us all night and
you got the kiss that tastes like honey
and i got a little beer money
tonight tonight baby were drinking
lets wake the town that never stops sleeping
you got the kiss that tastes like honey
and i got a little beer money

verse 2
we can dance in the dark
blow the speakers out of this car
light it up burn it down
until the morning rolls around
see kip moore liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likein a field where we can scream
get away with almost anything
yeah every now and then you gotta raise a little hell
hope we get lucky and stay out of jail

chorus
so come on come on baby im buying
i got enough to last us all night and
you got the kiss that tastes like honey
and i got a little beer money
tonight tonight baby were drinking
lets wake the town that never stops sleeping
you got the kiss that tastes like honey
and i got a little beer money

chorus
so come on come on baby im buying
i got enough to last us all night and
you got the kiss that tastes like honey
and i got a little beer money
tonight tonight baby were drinking
lets wake the town that never stops sleeping
you got the kiss that tastes like honey
and i got a little beer money

outro
so come on come on
yeah come on come onembed"
