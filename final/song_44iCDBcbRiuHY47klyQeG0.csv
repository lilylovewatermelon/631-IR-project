i only slept for a couple of hours
in the back of my buddys truck
i must be running on solar power
cause im ready to crank back up

chorus
and the boys are all banging on cheap guitars
and the girls are all rocking their bikini tops
and that big balls way up in the sky
my baby says hey i think i want to get wet
so we hots and hop into the waters edge
hey its so good to be alive
swimming in sunshine
swimming in sunshine

verse 2
theres a hole in my beach towel
theres a hole in the atmosphere
but we got the shade of the lifeguard tower
yeah thats where we keep the beer

chorus
and the boys are all banging on cheap guitars
and the girls are all rocking their bikini tops
and that big balls way up in the sky
my baby says hey i think i want to get wet
so we hots and hop into the waters edge
hey its so good to be alive
swimming in sunshine
swimming in sunshine

chorus
and the boys are all banging on cheap guitars
and the girls are all rocking their bikini tops
and that big balls way up in the sky
my baby says hey i think i want to get wet
so we hots and hop into the waters edge
hey its so good to be alive
swimming in sunshine
swimming in sunshine
