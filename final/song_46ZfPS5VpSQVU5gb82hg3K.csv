verse 1
big stars breakin out through the indigo
chevy wind comin in in stereo
taillights disappear in bout a mile or so
down the county road
phone blowin up where you is
baby sayin baby lets do this
rocket in a bottle with the fuse lit
bout to lift it off im bout to twist it off

chorus
lime on the rim of that dixie silver
smokin up a faded out 4x4
girls headin off to the river yeah
victorias secret aint a secret no more
i brought the songs and who brought the party
only one way to do it up right
everybody goes where everybody knows
that anything goes on a friday night
get your party right its a friday night
get your party right its a friday night
