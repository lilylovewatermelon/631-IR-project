i was walking was living
my melody was acapella
theres a beat i was missing
no tune or a scale i could play
no sound in the distance
no orchestra playing together
like a boat out to sea
the silence was too deafening

prechorus
so come and revive me
i cant feel my heartbeat
its just me surviving alone

chorus
before you
my whole life was acapella
now a symphonys
the only song to sing
before you
my whole life was acapella
now a symphonys
the only song to sing

verse 2
everything was the same
one color was just like the others
an assembly routine
my memories were all black and white
till i stopped overthinking
decided to draw back the curtains
and i cleared all the cobwebs
and began to let in the light

so come and revive me
i cant feel my heartbeat
its just me surviving alone

chorus
before you
my whole life was acapella
now a symphonys
the only song to sing
before you
my whole life was acapella
now a symphonys
the only song to sing

bridge
you got the drum in my heart beat
bass and guitar lead
stuck on the notes you play
my heart that you play on
red like a crayon
i cant walk away
you got the drum in my heart beat
bass and guitar lead
stuck on the notes you play
my heart that you play on
red like a crayon
i cant walk away
you got the drum in my heart beat
bass and guitar lead
stuck on the notes you play
my heart that you play on
red like a crayon
i cant walk away
chorus
before you
my whole life was acapella
now a symphonys
the only song to sing
before you
my whole life was acapella
now a symphonys
the only song to sing
before you
my whole life was acapella
now a symphonys
the only song to sing
before you
my whole life was acapella
now a symphonys
the only song to sing1embed"
