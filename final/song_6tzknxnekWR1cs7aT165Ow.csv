when the world gets too heavy
got no wind in your sails
lifes just a hammer and youre the nail
a whole lot of work and not enough pay
sometimes this ol cowboys gotta get away

chorus
thats why im smokin a doobie on the guadalupe
wastin away to the end of the day
pickin my guitar sippin on lonestar
watchin my worries just float away
and its adios trabajo uno más cerveza
watchin my worries just float away

verse 2
lay back watchin them cypress trees
the way theyre swayin feels like me
got a pretty señorita oh right by my side
might just go dancin in the moonlight tonight

chorus
thats why im smokin a doobie on the guadalupe
wastin away to the end of the day
pickin my guitar sippin on lonestar
watchin my worries just float away
and its adios trabajo uno más cerveza
watchin my worries just float away
see jon pardi liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likebridge
toes in the water
more than a feelin
every now and then i need some hill country feelin

chorus
so im smokin a doobie on the guadalupe
wastin away to the end of the day
pickin my guitar sippin on lonestar
watchin my worries just float away
and its adios trabajo uno más cerveza
watchin our worries just float awayembed"
