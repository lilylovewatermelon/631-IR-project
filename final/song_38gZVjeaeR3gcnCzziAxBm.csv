baby it just took one look at you
for me to change my one drink order to two
like we already knew each other
like weve been talking all night
about a minute into our first dance
we got blindsided by your friends
all in a hurry like you had to go
didnt they know you cant leave someone
girl you cant leave someone

chorus 1
in the middle of a dance floor all alone
in the middle of an old school country song
right when i was just about to lean on in
whyd you have to go then
baby in the middle of the glow of the neon light
it shoulda coulda woulda been the night of our lives
girl it aint right no
how you gonna leave me right in the middle of a memory

verse 2
we were gonna dance till they shut it down
peopled be staring while i spin you round
thinking we were so in love yeah
they wouldnt know we hadnt even hooked up
id get your number and id give you mine
and wed be hanging out tomorrow night
but now i dont know where you are
im under these lights right here in the dark

tore the back half out of a book
