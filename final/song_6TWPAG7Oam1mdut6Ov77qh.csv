i believe submarines
underneath deep blue sea
saw the flags japanese
no one will believe me

hook 1
ran back to the town bar and
i told the people how
i had seen a submarine
and everyone laughed aloud

verse 2
i did spy a periscope
dead of night on the eastern coast
the police made them jokes
told me id seen a ghost

hook 2
everyone thinks im a liar
no one knows the truth
if it was a bigger fire
i would be on the roof

verse 3
ships will rust in baldwin bay let me go
no one trusts what i say i dont know
oh my god no one paid attention
overnight my hair turned gray oh oh oh
you might also likehook 3
in the end it boils down
to credibility
i had none so i will die
with the secrets of the sea

outro
submarine
cant find me
submarine
