right now now now now now
there’s no past and there’s future
all we’ve got is now
right now
there’s no past there’s no future
all we’ve got is now
right now
there’s no past and there’s no future
all we’ve got is now
nobody knows what tomorrow brings
everything done is done
brother wake up there’s a song to sing
sister the time has come
all we’ve got is now right now is all we’ve ever had
there’s no past and there’s no future
all we’ve got is now
you’ve been working hard tryin’ to make the bills
all your best laid plans never let you get ahead
and you forget that life is not an accident
yeah you get caught up in the hustle you’ve been fed
well every second here it is a miracle
you gotta step right up and harness all you power
just forget about where you’ve been before
there’s no past and there’s no future
cause the past is dead and the future happens now
all we’ve got is now
nobody knows what tomorrow brings
everything done is done
brother wake up there’s a song to sing
sister the time has come
all we’ve got is now right now is all we’ve ever hadyou might also likeembed"
