in this life like weeds youre just a rock to me
youre just a rock to me youre just a rock to me
and in this life like weeds youre just a rock to me
in this life like weeds and in this life like weeds

verse 2
i could have told you all that i love you
and in the places you go youll see the place where youre from
i could have told you all that i love you
and in the faces you meet youll see the place where youll die
i could have told you all that i love you
and on the day that you die youll see the people you met
i could have told you all that i love you
and in the faces you see youll see just who youve been
i wish i could have told you all

chorus
in this life like weeds
in this life like weeds
eyes need us to see
hearts need us to bleed
in this life like weeds
youre a rock to me
i know where youre from
but where do you belong
in this life like weeds
youre the dirt i breathe
in this life like weeds
youre a rock to me

chorus
in this life like weeds
in this life like weeds
i know where youre from
but where do you belong
in this life like weeds
eyes need us to see
hearts need us to bleed
in this life like weeds
in this life like weeds
youre the dirt i breathe

verse 3
all this talkin all the time and the air fills up
up up until theres nothin left to breathe
and you think you feel almost everything
and we know in there that our hearts
are just made out of strings to be pulled
strings to be pulled
so you think youve figured out everything
but we know in there that our minds
are just made out of strings to be pulled
strings to be pulled
all this talkin all the time and the air fills up
up up until theres nothin left to breathe
up until theres nothin left to speak
up until the better parts of space
