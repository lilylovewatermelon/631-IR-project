pretty pink baby blue
why dont why dont you teach me something new
were all were all just babies in my view
so crawl baby crawl baby
pretty pink baby blue

so crawl baby crawl baby

verse 1 andré 3000
miss lady you could have been born a little later—but i dont care
so what if your head sports a couple of grey hairs
same here and actually i think thats funky
in a claire huxtabletype of way
miss lady—it looks to me like you need a little juice in your life
call me when that big ol house gets lonelyfied
and ill teleport from here to there
you show me how its supposed to be done
ill make sure you have young fun
