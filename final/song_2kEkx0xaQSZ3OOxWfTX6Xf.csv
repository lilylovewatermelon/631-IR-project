you cant be like me
but be happy that you cant
i see pain but i dont feel it
i am like the old tin man
im as worn as a stone
i keep it steady as i can
i see pain but i dont feel it
i am like the old tin man

chorus
i miss it
i miss it
oh i miss that feeling of feeling

verse 2
i used to fill the sky around
with happiness and joy
i had news to give the wind
to keep myself and heart employed
i felt people move around me
i felt loneliness and shame
back then every day was different
now each moment is the same

chorus
i miss it
i miss it
oh i miss that feeling of feeling
i miss it
i miss it
oh i miss that feeling of feeling
see the avett brothers liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likebridge
the feeling of feeling
the wind upon my face
and caring what it brings this way
the feeling of feeling
the minutes pass away
and caring what i do with them
maybe bring me love or something else

verse 3
and so it goes a man grows cold
some would say a man grows strong
they say life only grows short
i say the road only grows long
but as long as theres a road
my feet will never touch the ground
and if you wont give my heart back
ive no need to stick around

chorus
i miss it
i miss it
oh i miss that feeling of feeling
i miss it
i miss it
oh i miss that feeling of feelingembed"
