verse 1 matt morgan  sufjan stevens
our step mom we did everything to hate her
she took us down to the edge of decatur
we saw the lion and the kangaroo take her
down to the river where they caught a wild alligator

verse 2 matt morgan  sufjan stevens
sangamon river it overflowed
it caused a mudslide on the banks of the operator
civil war skeletons in their graves
they came up clapping in the spirit of the aviator

verse 3 matt morgan  sufjan stevens
the sound of the engines and the smell of the grain
we go riding on the abolition grain train
stephen a douglas was a great debater
but abraham lincoln was the great emancipator

verse 4 matt morgan  sufjan stevens
chickenmobile with your rooster tail
i had my fill and i know how bad it feels
stay awake and watch for the data
no small caterpillar go congratulate her
