i catch my buzz in the black of night
where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
if i lose my cool in the open and it shows
that i’m down and i aint alright

chorus
i search my soul where there is no moon
the trees all cross and are covered in moss
if the crickets want to know then i’ll tell them what i lost
oh i got the tailgate blues

verse 1
i aint sure where it all began
somewhere round here i know
this bridge was a little more crowded then
i was playing her a tailgate show
and now i’m just sitting here alone

prechorus
to catch my buzz in the black of night
where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
if i lose my cool in the open and it shows
that i’m down and i aint alright

chorus
i search my soul where there is no moon
the trees all cross and are covered in moss
if the crickets want to know then i’ll tell them what i lost
oh i got the tailgate blues

damn that am radio
for playing more than a song
my heart won’t beat if the strings are broke
the melody’s hitting me wrong
right here where she belongs

prechorus
i catch my buzz in the black of night
where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
if i lose my cool in the open and it shows
that i’m down and i aint alright

chorus
i search my soul where there is no moon
the trees all cross and are covered in moss
if the crickets want to know then i’ll tell them what i lost
oh i got the tailgate blues

verse 3
the crickets heard my story and i listened to them sing
i guess i’ll close the tailgate up
there aren’t no telling what tomorrow might bring
maybe me and a dixie cup
but that won’t be enough
prechorus
yes i catch my buzz in the black of night
where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
if i lose my cool in the open and it shows
that i’m down and i aint alright

chorus
i search my soul where there is no moon
the trees all cross and are covered in moss
if the crickets want to know then i’ll tell them what i lost
oh i got the tailgate blues

prechorus
i catch my buzz in the black of night
where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
if i lose my cool in the open and it shows
that i’m down and i aint alrightembed"
