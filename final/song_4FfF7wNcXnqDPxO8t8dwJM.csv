stuck between the wrong and the right thing
cant make up my mind its got a mind of its own
felt a spark but there was no lightning
couldve walked away but still im coming back for more

prechorus 1
oh i am loving your butterfly kisses
but its like something is missing
gonna save quittin you for another day

chorus
i got the feeling that its not gonna work out
i got the feeling that youre not my type
maybe the reason all this shit keeps on happening
happening cause i like the feeling
no its not for life but its alright right now
right now i got the feeling right now
its alright right now

verse 2
stuck between the green and the red light
cant make up my mind should i stop or should i go
find it hard to leave after midnight
using the excuse that its too late to walk me home
