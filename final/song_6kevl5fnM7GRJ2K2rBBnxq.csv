sunlight opened up my eyes
to see for the first time it opened them up
and tonight rivers will run dry
not for the first time rivers will run

instrumental break

verse 2
hundreds of years in the future
there could be computers lookin for life on earth
dont fight for the wrong side
say what you feel like
say how you feel

instrumental break

chorus
youll go backwards but then
youll go forwards again
youll go backwards but then
youll go

verse 3
created then drilled and invaded
if somebody made it someone will mess it up
and you are not wrong to ask “who does this belong to”
it belongs to all of us

youll go backwards but then
youll go forwards again
youll go backwards but then
youll go forwards
youll go backwards but then
youll go forwards again
youll go backwards but then
