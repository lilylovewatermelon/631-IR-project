if youre working for the weekend
got mud to drive your jeep in
your baby’s name is inked in
your heart on your sleeve

verse 2
if you play a stratocaster
your dads a baptist pastor
you rock a leather jacket
then you know what i mean

chorus
yeah its ferris wheels and firecrackers
red corvettes and big green tractors
happy ever after in american style
rock and roll and peace and love
and breaking in your baseball glove
ain’t ever gonna go out of american style
american style i got
american style you got
were never gonna go out of american style

verse 3
you got your friday throw down
and your sunday slow down
