it was a strange place and a tender age
i was just a babe in school
saw them roll their eyes at me every time that i thought that i was cool
well god knows i was no chosen one
that just wasnt my prime
yeah its just a matter of time honey
its just a matter of time

chorus
and i will work this body
i will burn this flame
oh in the dead of night and in the pouring rain
yeah im a workaholic and i swear i swear
yeah one day i will beat you fair and square

show me what you got
work this body on the floor
who do you think you are
cmon meet me on the court
que feraistu
putain je ne sais pas

verse 2
it aint no matter of “if” honey
its just a matter of “when”
oh some sunday when its my face in the newspaper again
all the rag magazines black limousines theyll be getting in line
yeah its just a matter of time honey
its just a matter of time
