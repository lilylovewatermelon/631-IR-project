ive dreamed about this sixteen days away
now youre here and my head lays
beside your body pillowed under mine
you were poison spinning round my mind

chorus
welcome to my world she said
do you feel alive she said
its all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head
welcome to my world she said
separated world she stayed separated
down poison down poison

verse 2
body withered body died
time to take away this life
bad enough to die from one not to mention four or five

chorus
welcome to my world she said
do you feel alive she said
its all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head
welcome to my world she said
separated world she stayed separated
down poison down poison

down poison you werent there for me i was there for you

down poison you wouldnt die for me ive already died for you
down poison you wouldnt die for me ive already died for you
down you wouldnt die you wouldnt die you wouldnt die no

chorus
welcome to my world she said
do you feel alive she said
its all a bad dream spinning in your lonely head
welcome to my world she said
separated world she stayed separated
down poison down poison
down poison down poison downembed"
