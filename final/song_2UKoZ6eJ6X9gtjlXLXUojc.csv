this is the final come and go
i keep fighting faith cause i don’t wanna know
on this eve in fall lights shining over
she’s colder than she would show
i guess i’ll just take the pill
and fall into the meadow
this isn’t who i am i’m a soldier with a medal

chorus 1
all my gold turned to glass
and now i’m breathing fast
i need someone to help these hard times pass
all my gold turned to glass
and now i’m breathing fast
i need someone to help these hard times pass

verse 1
find someone to help these hard times pass
so let me put my costume on
i’ve gone a million miles
with the same crooked smile
and i always give you all you need

verse 2
but i can see that you’re dancing with the devil
so i hope you brought your shovel
you won’t get what you need
if you’re not down on his level
and it’s okay just a little mischief
hotel rooms were made for this
i’ve got you open like a butterfly
inside you made my soul cry
all day all night for my lifetime
just a little mischief mischief

chorus 3
all my gold turned to glass
and now i’m breathing fast
i need someone to help these hard times pass
all my gold turned to glass
and now i’m breathing fast

verse 3
below my feet were steaming coals
and now i’m filled with holes
i need someone to help these hard times pass
if all your gold turns to glass
they find you breathing fast
i am someone to help your hard times pass
