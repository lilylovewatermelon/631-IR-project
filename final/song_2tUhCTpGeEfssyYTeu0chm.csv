im gonna ride this plane out of your life again
i wish that i could stay but you argued
more than this i wish you couldve seen my face
in backseat staring out the window
ill do anything for you
kill anyone for you

prechorus
so leave yourself intact cause i will be coming back
in a phrase to cut these lips i love you

chorus
the morning will come
in the press of every kiss with your head upon my chest
where i will annoy you
with every waking breath until you decide to wake up

verse 2
ive earned through hope and faith
oh the curves around your face
that im the one youll hold forever
if morning never comes for either one of us
then this i pray to you wherever
ill do anything for you
this story is for you
cause id do
ill do anything for you
anything you want me to for you
kill anyone for you

so leave yourself intact cause i wont be coming back
in a phrase to cut these lips i loved you

chorus
the morning will come
in the press of every kiss with your head upon my chest
where i will annoy you
with every waking breath until you decide to wake up
the morning will come
in the press of every kiss with your head upon my chest
where i will annoy you
with every waking breath til you decide to wake upembed"
