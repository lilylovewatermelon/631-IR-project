everywhere that i go people know me by the way i flow
i keep it movin in the right direction
and everyday you know thats how im livin
its alright

round round get around i get around its alright
downtown boogie down i get around its alright
round round get around i get around its alright
downtown boogie down i get around

round round we go when we lookin for hoes
we line em up and knock em down its like tic tac toe
we on a roll spittin flows every day of the week
we might not got a lotta dough but we get paid by the freak
we movin east different cities different girls different titties
and we get em by the dozens call em groupie committees
we gettin busy like bone all up in college dorms
if you aint takin us home then you can leave us alone

everywhere that i go people know me by the way i flow
i keep it movin in the right direction
and everyday you know thats how im livin
its alright

downtown boogie down i get around its alright
round round get around i get around
we go round round round round

two kids at the ocean shore diggin for change
savin up to buy an aeroplane and take us away
my crew has been around the block so all the girls know my game
plus my milk money is sssour way past the date
so if you know where we can grow a pound of grow we can roll
rock a show in tokyo and kick a foot ohio
put the o wit oreo we go the power of soul
round and round we go but where we stop nobody knows

its alright
round round get around i get around its alright
downtown boogie down i get around its alright
round round get around i get around its alright
downtown boogie down i get it around

yo come and get it come and check it see what we got
we about to set it bout to wreck it makin you hop
out ya shoes out ya socks gettin hot off the pot
so stay in tune please dont move and keep the station on lock
cause we fly around the world so hold it down while we gone
havent been home in a minute and my hairs gettin low
ill be back but gone tomorrow with the wind in the blows
im gonna rock the microphone til im a hundred years old
everywhere that i go people know me by the way i flow
i keep it movin in the right direction
and everyday you know thats how im livin
its alright

round round get around i get around its alright
downtown boogie down i get around its alright
round round get around i get around
we go round round round round

its alright its alright
its alright its alright
its alright its alright
