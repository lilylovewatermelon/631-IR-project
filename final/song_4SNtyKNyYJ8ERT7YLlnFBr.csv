so young just begun
dont need to live to know what ive become
when ya wake up still in your make up
youll make it home just fine without breaking down
man thats so young thats so young
stay calm well all just get along
sit around pretending like nothings wrong
so long love letter letter
but you and i are gonna live forever

chorus john gourley  zoe manville
i dont need to make amends but im done going undercover
i just wanna find a friend i dont need another lover
one day the world may end but theres still plenty to discover
til then ill just pretend i dont need another lover

verse 2 john gourley zoe manville  aap rocky
so young loaded gun
oblivious to what the trigger does
when ya wake up never gonna make up
got ammunition on a mission were gonna shoot you down
man thats so young thats so young
knocked out with the midas touch
a champion wearing golden gloves
got ya punch drunk seeing stars
little birdies singing whyd ya fall so hard

outro john gourley zoe manville  aap rocky
ooh its troubling when the belly of the beast starts rumbling
ooh its getting too hot like its summer in the city that were living in
