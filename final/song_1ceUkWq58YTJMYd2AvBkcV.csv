i like the way you talk to me
your words are as sweet as gold
and if you were ever to leave my world
my life would seem so cold
and i know you have someone
and ill be patient
cause one day you will be mine
take your time

cause your my destiny
one day ill hold you in my arms
and you will you give it to me

and if you wanted to be with me
