its true were all a little insane
but its so clear
now that im unchained

prechorus
fear is only in our minds
taking over all the time
fear is only in our minds
but its taking over all the time oh

chorus 1
you poor sweet innocent thing
dry your eyes and testify
you know you live to break me
dont deny sweet sacrifice

verse 2
one day im gonna forget your name
and one sweet day youre gonna drown in my lost pain

prechorus
fear is only in our minds
taking over all the time
fear is only in our minds
but its taking over all the time

you poor sweet innocent thing
dry your eyes and testify
and oh you love to hate me
dont you honey
im your sacrifice

bridge
i dream in darkness
i sleep to die
erase the silence
erase my life
do you wonder why you hate
our burning ashes
blacken the day
are you still too weak to survive your mistakes
a world of nothingness
blow me away

outro
you poor sweet innocent thing
dry your eyes and testify
you know you live to break me
dont deny
