i would please believe me
and i know that i should throw the towel in
but baby its not not that easy
you treat me so much better than him
and if i was sane thered be no competition
but but im in love with someone else
and im so sorry
im in love with another man
and i know it aint right

you should go and find someone else
who can treat you right
give you the world
someone who understands the man you are
cause baby you shine so bright
and i would just dim your star
a girl wholl treat you like you treat them
boy i know theres plenty women
who would love to have a man like you
but im in love with someone else
im so sorry baby
i know i aint right no no no no no no
for what i did to you baby

i cant explain why its him and not you
but at the end of the day baby i just dont want to
cause he aint no doctor
and we always seem to fight he aint got the perfect body
and sometimes he dont even treat me right
oh but when im with him but when im with him
when im with him aint nobody else like it
im so sorry baby that i have to do this to you
but i cant go on pretending
cause i love him i love him
and im so sorry do you hear me
im so sorry but i love that man
i love that man
he aint always right but hes just right for me
im in love with another man and im so sorry
but i love someone elseyou might also like21embed"
