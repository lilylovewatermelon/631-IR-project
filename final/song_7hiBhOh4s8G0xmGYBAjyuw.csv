i can feel the heat risin
everything is on fire
todays a painful re
minder of why
it can only get brighter
the further you put it behind ya
but right now im on the
inside lookin out ‘cause—

chorus sia
im standin in the flames
and it’s a beautiful kind of pain
settin fire to yesterday
to find the light find the light find the light
standin in the flames
and it’s a beautiful kind of pain
settin fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

verse 1 eminem
yesterday was the tornado warning todays like the morning after
your world is torn in half you wake in its wake
to start the mourning process and rebuilding youre still a work in progress
todays a whole new chapter its like an enormous asthma
thunderstorm has passed ya you weathered it and poked its
eye out with the thornbush that ya used to smell the roses
stopped to inhale cant even tell your nose is stuffed
so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
and hit the corner faster more assertive never looking back
may hit the curb but every days a new learning curve as ya
steer through life sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to
to avert a disaster lucky no permanent damage
‘cause they hurt you so bad its like they murdered your ass
and threw dirt on your casket but youve returned from the ashes
and that hurt that you have you just converted to gasoline
and while youre burning the past standing at inferno and chantin

im standin in the flames
and it’s a beautiful kind of pain
settin fire to yesterday
to find the light find the light find the light
standin in the flames
and it’s a beautiful kind of pain
settin fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

verse 2 eminem
youre so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
it happens all the time they take your heart and steal your life
and its as though you feel youve died cause youve been killed inside
but yet youre still alive which means you will survive
although today you may weep ‘cause youre weak and
everything seems so bleak and hopeless the light that youre seekin
it begins to seep in thats the only thing keepin
you from leapin off the motherfreakin deep end
and im pullin for you to push through this feeling
and with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow
you may even feel so good that youre willing to forgive em
even after all the shit youve been put through this feeling of resilience is building
and the flames are burnin quick as fire would through this building
youre sealed in but youre fireproof flame retardant you withstood it
and as you climb up to the roof youre just chillin you look down ‘cause youre so over em
you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
bridge eminem
as time passes things change every day
but wounds wounds heal but scars still remaining the same
but tomorrow todays going down in flames
throw the match set the past ablaze

verse 3 eminem
so feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even
perspire from the heat exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
and as you say goodbye to the grief its like watching the walls melt
in your prison cell but youve extinguished this livin hell
still a little piece of you dies as you scream—

chorus sia
im standin in the flames
and it’s a beautiful kind of pain
settin fire to yesterday
to find the light find the light find the light
standin in the flames
and it’s a beautiful kind of pain
settin fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light

bridge sia
i feel the burn
watch the smoke as i turn rising
a phoenix from the flames
i have learned
from fighting fights that werent mine
its not with fists
but with wings that i will fly
chorus sia
and im standin in the flames
and it’s a beautiful kind of pain
settin fire to yesterday
to find the light find the light find the light
standin in the flames
and it’s a beautiful kind of pain
settin fire to yesterday
find the light find the light find the light239embed"
