for our brothers and sisters whove died
over four hundred years has washed away our fears
and strengthened our pride now we turn back the tide

we will seize the control from your hand
we will fan the flame of our anger and pain
and youll feel the shame for what you do in gods name

when the ancient drum rhythms ring
the voice of our forefathers sings

for me and for you amandla awethu
