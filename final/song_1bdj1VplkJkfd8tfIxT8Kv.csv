like a cloud across the moon
there is a devil on my shoulder
spreading his light into my room

broken head and empty heart
shattered mind thats torn apart
i fall i stumble into the night
i cant leave your love alone
i cant leave your love alone

a wicked wind beats at my window
telling me that im no good
theres no life in this bleak desert
theres no life without you

broken head and empty heart
shattered mind thats torn apart
i fall i stumble into the night
i cant leave your love alone
i cant leave your love alone

broken head and empty heart
shattered mind thats torn apart
i fall i stumble into the night
i cant leave your love alone
i cant leave your love alone

i cant leave your love alone
i cant leave your love alone
i cant leave your love alone
i cant leave your love aloneembed"
