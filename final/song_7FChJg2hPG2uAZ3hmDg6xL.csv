this is wartime this is our time
we wont be denied
feed the fire that is raging inside
this is go time this is showtime
we will fight til their wills are broken
this is game time an insane time
let the madness fly
show them strength that just cant be defied
find the power to devour
let the beast inside now be woken

prechorus 1
in this world only the strong will survive
hear the roar and you will know youre alive
feel the energy build in your soul
cause its time

chorus
oh in the calm before the storm
another legend will be born
another battle will be won
we will rise
oh so heed the call of confrontation
today we feed on domination
secure a legacy that will never die
be immortalized

raw emotion pure devotion
they will testify
and our memory will endure for all time
never hiding no dividing
let them witness us move as one now
show no mercy let the world see
weâ€™re invincible
show them nothing is beyond our control
take it higher our desire
will determine what we become now

prechorus 2
are you ready for the test of your life
see the fear bleeding right through their eyes
feel the energy build in your soul
cause its time

chorus
oh in the calm before the storm
another legend will be born
another battle will be won
we will rise
oh so heed the call of confrontation
today we feed on domination
secure a legacy that will never die
be immortalized
bridge
feel it
take no prisoners now
take it
there it is standing in front of us
hear it
our deliverance now
own it
give them all an image of us that will last for all time

chorus
oh in the calm before the storm
another legend will be born
another battle will be won
we will rise
oh so heed the call of confrontation
today we feed on domination
secure a legacy that will never die never die
be immortalized11embed"
