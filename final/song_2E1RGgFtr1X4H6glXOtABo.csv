i came to win to fight
to conquer to thrive
i came to win jr to survive
to prosper to rise
to fly

verse 1 nicki minaj
uh yo yo
i wish today it would rain all day
maybe thatd kinda make the pain go away
tryna forgive you for abandoning me
prayin but i think im still an angel away
angel away yeah its strange in a way
maybe that is why i chase strangers away
they got they guns out aimin at me
but i become neo when they aimin at me
me me me against them
me against enemies me against friends
somehow they both seem to become one
a sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
they start comin and i start risin
must be surprisin im just surmisin
i win thrive soar higher
higher higher more fire

verse 2 nicki minaj
uh yo yo
everybody wanna try to box me in
suffocatin every time it locks me in
paintin they own pictures then they crop me in
but i will remain where the top begins
cause i am not a word i am not a line
i am not a girl that could ever be defined
i am not fly i am levitation
i represent an entire generation
i hear the criticism loud and clear
that is how i know that the time is near
see we become alive in the time of fear
and i aint got no motherfuckin time to spare
cry my eyes out for days upon days
such a heavy burden placed upon me
but when you go hard your nays become yays
yankee stadium with jays and kanyes
chorus rihanna
i came to win to fight
to conquer to thrive
i came to win to survive
to prosper to rise

get ready for it
get ready for it
get ready for it
i came to win
get ready for it
get ready for it
get ready for it
