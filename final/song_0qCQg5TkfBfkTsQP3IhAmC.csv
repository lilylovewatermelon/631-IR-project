wont you send it southbound
give it a cool bluesman name
ive been lost on them back roads
so many times ive gone blind
losing faith in my family
had driven me out of my damn mind

but on the south side of heaven
wont you take me home
cause ive been broke down for so long
and lord its getting cold

ive been a desperado in west texas
for so long lord i need a change
for ten long years this old place aint seen a drop of rain
and that wind blows everyday lord all like a desert snow
like a lost bound train running on cocaine and outta control

but on the south side of heaven wont you take me home
cause ive been broke down for so long a
nd lord its getting cold

long down the louisiana byways
lonesome highways roll on
wont you take me where the poor man lives
its where i call my home
and cant you see that a breeze nothin but a change in pace
money cant buy my soul cause it comes from a hard earned place
see ryan bingham liveget tickets as low as 142you might also likebut on the south side of heaven wont you take me home
cause ive been broke down for so long and lord its getting cold1embed"
