when she got back to echo courts she found miles dean serge and leonard arranged around and on the diving board at the end of the swimming pool with all their instruments so composed and motionless that some photographer hidden from oedipa might have been shooting them for an album illustration
whats happening said oedipayour young man replied miles metzger really put it to serge our countertenor the lad is crackers with grief hes right missus said serge i even wrote a song about it whose arrangement features none other than me and it goes like this

serges song

what chance has a lonely surfer boy for the love of a surfer chick with all these humbert humbert cats coming on so big and sick for me my baby was a woman for him shes just another nymphet why did they run around why did she put me down and get me so upset well as long as shes gone awayyay ive had to find somebody new and the older generation has taught me what to do i had a date last night with an eightyearold and shes a swinger just like me so you can find us any night up on the football field in back of ps 33 oh yeah and its as groovy as it can be youre trying to tell me something said oedipa they gave it to her then in prose metzger and serges chick had run off to nevada to get married serge on close questioning admitted the bit about the eightyearold was so far only imaginary but that he was hanging diligently around playgrounds and should have some news for them any day on top of the tv set in her room metzger had left a note telling her not to worry about the estate that hed turned over his executorship to somebody at warpe wistfull kubitschek and mcmingus and they should be in touch with her and it was all squared with the probate court also no word to recall that oedipa and metzger had ever been more than coexecutors

which must mean thought oedipa that thats all we were she should have felt more classically scorned but had other things on her mind first thing after unpacking she was on the horn to randolph driblette the director after about ten rings an elderly lady answered im sorry weve nothing to saywell whos this oedipa said sigh this is his mother therell be a statement at noon tomorrow our lawyer will read it she hung up now what the hell oedipa wondered what had happened to driblette she decided to call later she found professor emory bortzs number in the book and had better luck a wife named grace answered backed by a group of children hes pouring a patio she told oedipa its a highly organized joke thats been going on since about april he sits in the sun drinks beer with students lobs beer bottles at seagulls youd better talk to him before it gets that far maxine why dont you throw that at your brother hes more mobile than i am did you know emorys done a new edition of wharfinger itll be out but the date was obliterated by a great crash maniacal childish laughter highpitched squeals oh god have you ever met an infanticide come on over it may be your only chanceoedipa showered put on a sweater skirt and sneakers wrapped her hair in a student like twist went easy on the makeup recognizing with a vague sense of dread that it was not a matter of bortzs response or graces but of the trysteros

driving over she passed by zapfs used books and was alarmed to find a pile of charred rubble where the bookstore only a week ago had stood there was still the smell of burnt leather she stopped and went into the government surplus outlet next door the owner informed her that zapf the damn fool has set fire to his own store for the insurance any kind of a wind snarled this worthy it would have taken me with it they only put up this complex here to last five years anyway but could zapf wait books you had the feeling that it was only his good upbringing kept him from spitting you want to sell something used he advised oedipa find out what theres a demand for this season now its your rifles fella was in just this forenoon bought two hundred for his drill team i couldve sold him two hundred of the swastika armbands too only i was short dammit

government surplus swastikas oedipa said hell no he gave her an insiders wink got this little factory down outside of san diego he told her got a dozen of your niggers say they can sure turn them old armbands out youd be amazed how that little numbers selling i took some space in a couple of the girlie magazines and i had to hire two extra niggers last week just to take care of the mail whats your name oedipa said winthrop tremaine replied the spirited entrepreneur winner for short listen now were getting up an arrangement with one of the big readytowear outfits in la to see how ss uniforms go for the fall were working it in with the backtoschool campaign lot of 37 longs you know teenage kid sizes next season we may go all the way and get out a modified version for the ladies how would that strike youill let you know oedipa said ill keep you in mind she left wondering if she shouldve called him something or tried to hit him with any of a dozen surplus heavy blunt objects in easy reach there had been no witnesses why hadnt she

youre chicken she told herself snapping her seat belt this is america you live in it you let it happen let it unfurl she drove savagely along the freeway hunting for volkswagens by the time shed pulled into bortzs subdivision a riparian settlement in the style of fangoso lagoons she was only shaking and a little nauseous in the stomach she was greeted by a small fat girl with some blue substance smeared all over her face hi said oedipa you must be maxine maxines in bed she threw one of daddys beer bottles at charles and it went through the window and mama spanked her good if she was mine id drown hernever thought of doing it that way said grace bortz materializing from the dim living room come on in with a wet washcloth she started to clean off her childs face how did you manage to get away from yours today i dont have any said oedipa following her into the kitchen
grace looked surprised theres a certain harassed style she said you get to recognize i thought only kids caused it i guess not

emory bortz lay half in a hammock surrounded by three graduate students two male one female all sodden with drink and an astounding accumulation of empty beer bottles oedipa located a full one and seated herself on the grass i would like to find out she presently plunged something about the historical wharfinger not so much the verbal one the historical shakespeare growled one of the grad students through a full beard uncapping another bottle the historical marx the historical jesus hes rightshrugged bortz theyre dead whats left words pick some words said bortz them we can talk about no hallowed skein of stars can ward i tow quoted oedipa  whos once been set his tryst with trystero couriers tragedy act iv scene 8 bortz blinked at her and how he said did you get into the vatican library oedipa showed him the paperback with the line in it bortz squinting at the page groped for another beer

my god he announced ive been pirated me and wharfinger weve been bowdlerized in reverse or something he flipped to the front to see whod reedited his edition of wharfinger ashamed to sign it damn ill have to write the publishers k da chingado and company you ever heard of them new york he looked at the sun through a page or two offset brought his nose close to the text misprints gah corrupt he dropped the book on the grass and looked at it with loathing how did they get into the vatican then whats in the vatican asked oedipa a pornographic couriers tragedy i didnt get to see it till 61 or i wouldve given it a note in my old edition what i saw out at the tank theatre wasnt pornographic

randy driblettes production no i thought it was typically virtuous he looked sadly past her toward a stretch of sky he was a peculiarly moral man felt hardly any responsibility toward the word really but to the invisible field surrounding the play its spirit he was always intensely faithful if anyone could have called up for you that historical wharfinger you want itdve been randy nobody else i ever knew was so close to the author to the microcosm of that play as it must have surrounded wharfingers living mind but youre using the past tense oedipa said her heart pounding remembering the old lady on the phone hadnt you heard they all looked at her death glided by shadowless among the empties on the grassrandy walked into the pacific two nights ago the girl told her finally her eyes had been red all along in his gennaro suit hes dead and this is a wake i tried to call him this morning was all oedipa could think of to say it was right after they struck the set of the couriers tragedy bortz said even a month ago oedipas next question would have been why but now she kept a silence waiting as if to be illuminated

they are stripping from me she said subvocally feeling like a fluttering curtain in a very high window moving up to then out over the abyss they are stripping away one by one my men my shrink pursued by israelis has gone mad my husband on lsd gropes like a child further and further into the rooms and endless rooms of the elaborate candy house of himself and away hopelessly away from what has passed i was hoping forever for love my one extra fella has eloped with a depraved 15yearold my best guide back to the trystero has taken a brody where am i im sorry bortz had also said watching her oedipa stayed with it did he use only that pointing to the paperback for his script no frowning he used the hardcover my edition but the night you saw the play too much sunlight shone on the bottles silent all around them how did he end the fourth act what were his lines driblettes gennaros when theyre all standing around at the lake after the miracle he that we last as thurn and taxis knew recited bortz  now recks no lord but the stilettos thornand tacit lies the gold onceknotted horn  right agreed the grad students yeah thats all what about the rest the other couplet
in the text i go along with personally said bortz that other couplet has the last line suppressed the book in the vatican is only an obscene parody the ending who once has crossed the lusts of angelo was put in by the printer of the 1687 quarto the whitechapel version is corrupt so randy did the best thing left the doubtful part out altogetherbut the night i was there said oedipa driblette did use the vatican lines he said the word trystero
bortzs face stayed neutral it was up to him he was both director and actor right but would it be just she gestured in circles with her hands just some whim to use another couple lines like that without telling anybody randy recalled the third grad student a stocky kid with horn rims what was bugging him inside usually somehow or other would have to come outside on stage he might have looked at a lot of versions to develop a feel for the spirit of the play not necessarily the words and thats how he came across your paperback there with the variation in itthen oedipa concluded something must have happened in his personal life something must have changed for him drastically that night and thats what made him put the lines in maybe said bortz maybe not you think a mans mind is a pool tablei hope not come in and see some dirty pictures bortz invited rolling off the hammock they left the students drinking beer illicit microfilms of the illustrations in that vatican edition smuggled out in 61 grace and i were there on a grant

they entered a combination workroom and study far away in the house children screamed a vacuum whined bortz drew shades riffled through a box of slides selected a handful switched on a projector and aimed it at a wall the illustrations were woodcuts executed with that crude haste to see the finished product that marks the amateur true pornography is given us by vastly patient professionals the artist is anonymous bortz said so is the poetaster who rewrote the play here pasquale remember one of the bad guys actually does marry his mother and theres a whole scene on their wedding night he changed slides you get the general idea notice how often the figure of death hovers in the background the moral rage its a throwback its mediaeval no puritan ever got that violent except possibly the scurvhamites damico thinks this edition was a scurvhamite project scurvhamite robert scurvham had founded during the reign of charles i a sect of most pure puritans

their central hangup had to do with predestination there were two kinds nothing for a scurvhamite ever happened by accident creation was a vast intricate machine but one part of it the scurvhamite part ran off the will of god its prime mover the rest ran off some opposite principle something blind soulless a brute automatism that led to eternal death the idea was to woo converts into the godly and purposeful sodality of the scurvhamite but somehow those few saved scurvhamites found themselves looking out into the gaudy clockwork of the doomed with a certain sick and fascinated horror and this was to prove fatal one by one the glamorous prospect of annihilation coaxed them over until there was no one left in the sect not even robert scurvham who like a ships master had been last to gowhat did richard wharfinger have to do with them asked oedipa why should they do a dirty version of his play

as a moral example they were not fond of the theatre it was their way of putting the play entirely away from them into hell what better way to damn it eternally than to change the actual words remember that puritans were utterly devoted like literary critics to the word but the line about trystero isnt dirtyhe scratched his head it fits surely the hallowed skein of stars is gods will but even that cant ward or guard somebody who has an appointment with trystero i mean say you only talked about crossing the lusts of angelo hell thered be any number of ways to get out of that leave the country angelos only a man but the brute other that kept the non scurvhamite universe running like clockwork that was something else again evidently they felt trystero would symbolize the other quite well

she had nothing more than to put it off with again with the light vertiginous sense of fluttering out over an abyss she asked what shed come there to ask what was trystero one of several brand new areas said bortz that opened up after i did that edition in 57 weve since come across some interesting old source material my updated edition ought to be out they tell me next year sometime meanwhile he went looking in a glass case full of ancient books here producing one with a dark brown peeling calf coveri keep my wharfingeriana locked in here so the kids cant get at it charles could ask no end of questions im too young to cope with yet the book was titled an account of the singular peregrinations of dr diocletian blobb among the italians illuminated with exemplary tales from the true history of that outlandish and fantastical race lucky for me said bortz wharfinger like milton kept a commonplace book where he jotted down quotes and things from his reading thats how we know about blobbs peregrinations

it was full of words ending in es ss that looked like fs capitalized nouns ys where is shouldve been i cant read this oedipa said
try said bortz i have to see those kids off i think its around chapter seven and disappeared to leave oedipa before the tabernacle as it turned out it was chapter eight she wanted a report of the authors own encounter with the trystero brigands diocletian blobb had chosen to traverse a stretch of desolate mountain country in a mail coach belonging to the torre and tassis system which oedipa figured must be italian for thurn and taxis without warning by the shores of what blobb called the lake of piety they were set upon by a score of blackcloaked riders who engaged them in a fierce silent struggle in the icy wind blowing in from the lake the marauders used cudgels harquebuses swords stilettos at the end silk kerchiefs to dispatch those still breathing

all except for dr blobb and his servant who had dissociated themselves from the hassle at the very outset proclaimed in loud voices that they were british subjects and even from time to time ventured to sing certain of the more improving of our church hymns their escape surprised oedipa in view of what seemed to be trysteros passion for security was trystero trying to set up shop in england bortz suggested days later oedipa didnt know but why spare an insufferable ass like diocletian blobbyou can spot a mouth like that a mile off bortz said even in the cold even with your bloodlust up if i wanted word to get to england to sort of pave the way i should think hed be perfect trystero enjoyed counterrevolution in those days look at england the king about to lose his head a setup the leader of the brigands after collecting the mail sacks had pulled blobb from the coach and addressed him in perfect english messer you have witnessed the wrath of trystero know that we are not without mercy tell your king and parliament what we have done tell them that we prevail that neither tempest nor strife nor fierce beasts nor the loneliness of the desert nor yet the illegitimate usurpers of our rightful estate can deter our couriers and leaving them and their purses intact the highwaymen in a cracking of cloaks like black sails vanished back into their twilit mountains

blobb inquired around about the trystero organization running into zipped mouths nearly every way he turned but he was able to collect a few fragments so in the days following was oedipa from obscure philatelic journals furnished her by genghis cohen an ambiguous footnote in motleys rise of the dutch republic an 8oyearold pamphlet on the roots of modern anarchism a book of sermons by blobbs brother augustine also among bortzs wharfingeriana along with blobbs original clues oedipa was able to fit together this account of how the organization beganin 1577 the northern provinces of the low countries led by the protestant noble william of orange had been struggling nine years for independence from catholic spain and a catholic holy roman emperor in late december orange de facto master of the low countries entered brussels in triumph having been invited there by a committee of eighteen this was a junta of calvinist fanatics who felt that the estates general controlled by the privileged classes no longer represented the skilled workers had lost touch entirely with the people the committee set up a kind of brussels commune

they controlled the police dictated all decisions of the estatesgeneral and threw out many holders of high position in brussels among these was leonard i baron of taxis gentleman of the emperors privy chamber and baron of buysinghen the hereditary grand master of the post for the low countries and executor of the thurn and taxis monopoly he was replaced by one jan hinckart lord of ohain a loyal adherent of orange at this point the founding figure enters the scene hernando joaquin de tristero y calavera perhaps a madman perhaps an honest rebel according to some only a con artist tristero claimed to be jan hinckarts cousin from the spanish and legitimate branch of the family and true lord of ohainrightful heir to everything jan hinckart then possessed including his recent appointment as grand master

from 1578 until alexander farnese took brussels back again for the emperor in march 1585 tristero kept up what amounted to a guerrilla war against his cousinif hinckart was his cousin being spanish he got little support most of the time from one quarter or another his life was in danger still he tried four times to assassinate oranges postmaster though without success jan hinckart was dispossessed by farnese and leonard i the thurn and taxis grand master reinstated but it had been a time of great instability for the thurn and taxis monopoly leery of strong protestant leanings in the bohemian branch of the family the emperor rudolph ii had for a time withdrawn his patronage the postal operation plunged deeply into the red

it may have been some vision of the continentwide power structure hinckart could have taken over now momentarily weakened and tottering that inspired tristero to set up his own system he seems to have been highly unstable apt at any time to appear at a public function and begin a speech his constant theme disinheritance the postal monopoly belonged to ohain by right of conquest and ohain belonged to tristero by right of blood he styled himself el desheredado the disinherited and fashioned a livery of black for his followers black to symbolize the only thing that truly belonged to them in their exile the night soon he had added to his iconography the muted post horn and a dead badger with its four feet in the air some said that the name taxis came from the italian tasso badger referring to hats of badger fur the early bergamascan couriers wore he began a sub rosa campaign of obstruction terror and depredation along the thurn and taxis mail routes

oedipa spent the next several days in and out of libraries and earnest discussions with emory bortz and genghis cohen she feared a little for their security in view of what was happening to everyone else she knew the day after reading blobbs peregrinations she with bortz grace and the graduate students attended randolph driblettes burial listened to a younger brothers helpless stricken eulogy watched the mother spectral in afternoon smog cry and came back at night to sit on the grave and drink napa valley muscatel which driblette in his time had put away barrels of there was no moon smog covered the stars all black as a tristero rider oedipa sat on the earth ass getting cold wondering whether as driblette had suggested that night from the shower some version of herself hadnt vanished with him perhaps her mind would go on flexing psychic muscles that no longer existed would be betrayed and mocked by a phantom self as the amputee is by a phantom limb someday she might replace whatever of her had gone away by some prosthetic device a dress of a certain color a phrase in a  letter another lover
she tried to reach out to whatever coded tenacity of protein might improbably have held on six feet below still resisting decayany stubborn quiescence perhaps gathering itself for some last burst some last scramble up through earth justglimmering holding together with its final strength a transient winged shape needing to settle at once in the warm host or dissipate forever into the dark if you come to me prayed oedipa bring your memories of the last night or if you have to keep down your payload the last five minutes that may be enough but so ill know if your walk into the sea had anything to do with tristero if they got rid of you for the reason they got rid of hilarius and mucho and metzgermaybe because they thought i no longer needed you they were wrong i needed you only bring me that memory and you can live with me for whatever time ive got she remembered his head floating in the shower saying you could fall in love with me but could she have saved him she looked over at the girl whod given her the news of his death had they been in love did she know why driblette had put in those two extra lines that night had he even known why no one could begin to trace it

a hundred hangups permuted combinedsex money illness despair with the history of his time and place who knew changing the script had no clearer motive than his suicide there was the same whimsy to both perhapsshe felt briefly penetrated as if the bright winged thing had actually made it to the sanctuary of her heartperhaps springing from the same slick labyrinth adding those two lines had even in a way never to be explained served him as a rehearsal for his nights walk away into that vast sink of the primal blood the pacific she waited for the winged brightness to announce its safe arrival but there was silence driblette she called the signal echoing down twisted miles of brain circuitry driblette but as with maxwells demon so now either she could not communicate or he did not exist beyond its origins the libraries told her nothing more about tristero for all they knew it had never survived the struggle for dutch independence to find the rest she had to approach from the thum and taxis side this had its perils for emory bortz it seemed to turn into a species of cute game he held for instance to a mirrorimage theory by which any period of instability for thum and taxis must have its reflection in tristeros shadowstate he applied this to the mystery of why the dread name should have appeared in print only around the middle of the 17th century how had the author of the pun on this trystero dies irae overcome his reluctance how had half the vatican couplet with its suppression of the trystero line found its way into the folio

whence had the daring of even hinting at a thurn and taxis rival come bortz maintained there must have been some crisis inside tristero grave enough to keep them from retaliating perhaps the same that kept them from taking the life of dr blobb but should bortz have exfoliated the mere words so lushly into such unnatural roses under which in whose red scented dusk dark history slithered unseen when leonard iifrancis count of thum and taxis died in 1628 his wife alexandrine of rye succeeded him in name as postmaster though her tenure was never considered official she retired in 1645 the actual locus of power in the monopoly remained uncertain until 1650 when the next male heir lamoral iiclaudefrancis took over meanwhile in brussels and antwerp signs of decay in the system had appeared private local posts had encroached so far on the imperial licenses that the two cities shut down their thurn and taxis offices how bortz asked would tristero have responded postulating then some militant faction proclaiming the great moment finally at hand advocating a takeover by force while their enemy was vulnerable but conservative opinion would care only to continue in opposition exactly as the tristero had these seventy years there might also be say a few visionaries men above the immediacy of their time who could think historically at least one among them hip enough to foresee the end of the thirty years war the peace of westphalia the breakup of the empire the coming descent into particularism

he looks like kirk douglas cried bortz hes wearing this sword his name is something gutsy like konrad theyre meeting in the back room of a tavern all these broads in peasant blouses carrying steins around everybody juiced and yelling suddenly konrad jumps up on a table the crowd hushes the salvation of europe konrad says depends on communication right we face this anarchy of jealous german princes hundreds of them scheming counter scheming infighting dissipating all of the empires strength in their useless bickering but whoever could control the lines of communication among all these princes would control them that network someday could unify the continent so i propose that we merge with our old enemy thurn and taxis cries of no never throw the traitor out till this barmaid little starlet sweet on konrad coldconks with a stein his loudest antagonist together konrad is saying our two systems could be invincible we could refuse service on any but an imperial basis nobody could move troops farm produce anything without us any prince tries to start his own courier system we suppress it we who have so long been disinherited could be the heirs of europe prolonged cheering

but they didnt keep the empire from falling apart oedipa pointed out so bortz backing off the militants and the conservatives fight to a standstill konrad and his little group of visionaries being nice guys try to mediate  the hassle by the time they all get squared away again everybodys played out the empires had it thurn and taxis wants no deals and with the end of the holy roman empire the fountainhead of thurn and taxis legitimacy is lost forever among the other splendid delusions possibilities for paranoia become abundant if tristero has managed to maintain even partial secrecy if thurn and taxis have no clear idea who their adversary is or how far its influence extends then many of them must come to believe in something very like the scurvhamites blind automatic antigod whatever it is it has the power to murder their riders send landslides thundering across their roads by extension bring into being new local competition and presently even state postal monopolies disintegrate their empire it is their times ghost out to put the thurn and taxis ass in a sling

but over the next century and a half the paranoia recedes as they come to discover the secular tristero power omniscience implacable malice attributes of what theyd thought to be a historical principle a zeitgeist are carried over to the now human enemy so much that by 1795 it is even suggested that tristero has staged the entire french revolution just for an excuse to issue the proclamation of gth frimaire an iii ratifying the end of the thurn and taxis postal monopoly in france and the lowlands suggested by who though said oedipa did you read that someplace wouldnt somebody have brought it up bortz said maybe not she didnt press the argument having begun to feel reluctant about following up anything she hadnt asked genghis cohen for example if his expert committee had ever reported back on the stamps hed sent them she knew that if she went back to vesperhaven house to talk again to old mr thoth about his grandfather she would find that he too had died she knew she ought to write to k da chingado publisher of the unaccountable paperback couriers tragedy but she didnt and never asked bortz if he had either worst of all she found herself going often to absurd lengths to avoid talking about randolph driblette whenever the girl showed up the one whod been at the wakes oedipa found excuses to leave the gathering she felt she was betraying driblette and herself but left it alone anxious that her revelation not expand beyond a certain point lest possibly it grow larger than she and assume her to itself when bortz asked her one evening if he could bring in damico who was at nyu oedipa told him no too fast too nervous he didnt mention it again and neither of course did she

she did go back to the scope though one night restless alone leery of what she might find she found mike fallopian a couple weeks into raising a beard wearing buttondown olive shirt creased fatigue pants minus cuffs and belt loops twobutton fatigue jacket no hat he was surrounded by broads drinking champagne cocktails and bellowing low songs when he spotted oedipa he gave her the wide grin and waved her over you look she said wow like youre all on the move training rebels up in the mountains hostile looks from the girls twined around what parts of fallopian were accessibleits a revolutionary secret he laughed throwing up his arms and flinging off a couple of campfollowers go on now all of you i want to talk to this one when they were out of earshot he swiveled on her a look sympathetic annoyed perhaps also a little erotic hows your questshe gave him a quick status report he kept quiet while she talked his expression slowly changing to something she couldnt recognize it bothered her to jog him a little she said im surprised you people arent using the system too

are we an underground he came back mild enough are we rejects i didnt mean maybe we havent found them yet said fallopian or maybe they havent approached us or maybe we are using waste only its a secret then as electronic music began to percolate into the room but theres another angle too she sensed what he was going to say and began reflexively to grind together her back molars a nervous habit shed developed in the last few days has it ever occurred to you oedipa that  somebodys putting you on that this is all a hoax maybe something inverarity set up before he died it had occurred to her but like the thought that someday she would have to die oedipa had been steadfastly refusing to look at that possibility directly 01 in any but the most accidental of lights no she said thats ridiculous fallopian watched her nothing if not compassionate you ought quietly really you ought to think about it write down what you cant deny your hard intelligence but then write down what youve only speculated assumed see what youve got at least that go ahead she said cold at least that what else after that he smiled perhaps now trying to salvage whatever was going soundlessly smash its net of invisible cracks propagating leisurely though the air between them please dont be mad verify my sources i suppose oedipa kept on pleasantly right he didnt say any more

she stood up wondering if her hair was in place if she looked rejected or hysterical if theyd been causing a scene i knew youd be different she said mike because everybodys been changing on me but it hadnt gone as far as hating me hating you he shook his head and laughed if you need any armbands or more weapons do try winthrop tremaine over by the freeway tremaines swastika shoppe mention my name were already in touch thanks she left him in his modified cuban ensemble watching the floor waiting for his broads to come back well what about her sources she was avoiding the question yes one day genghis cohen called sounding excited and asked her to come see something hed just got in the mail the u s mail it turned out to be an old american stamp bearing the device of the muted post horn bellyup badger and the motto we await silent tristeros empire so thats what it stands for said oedipa where did you get this a friend cohen said leafing through a battered scott catalogue in san francisco as usual she did not go on to ask for any name or address odd he said he couldnt find the stamp listed but here it is an addendum look in the front of the book a slip of paper had been pasted in the stamp designated 163111 was reproduced under the title tristero rapid post san francisco california and should have been inserted between local listings 139 the third avenue post office of new york and 140 union post also of new york oedipa off on a kind of intuitive high went immediately to the endpaper in back and found the sticker of zapfs used books

sure cohen protested i drove out there one day to see mr metzger while you were up north this is the scott specialized you see for american stamps a catalogue i dont generally keep up on my field being european and colonial but my curiosity had been aroused so sure oedipa said anybody could paste in an addendum she drove back to san narciso to have another look at the list of inveraritys assets sure enough the whole shopping center that housed zapfs used books and tremaines surplus place had been owned by pierce not only that but the tank theatre alsook oedipa told herself stalking around the room her viscera hollow waiting on something truly terrible ok its unavoidable isnt it every access route to the tristero could be traced also back to the inverarity estate even emory bortz with his copy of blobbs peregrinations bought she had no doubt hed tell her in the event she asked also at zapfs taught now at san narciso college heavily endowed by the dead man

meaning what that bortz along with metzger cohen driblette koteks the tattooed sailor in san francisco the waste carriers shed seen that all of them were pierce inveraritys men bought or loyal for free for fun to some grandiose practical joke hed cooked up all for her embarrassment or terrorizing or moral improvement change your name to miles dean serge and or leonard baby she advised her reflection in the hall light of that afternoons vanity mirror either way theyll call it paranoia they either you have stumbled indeed without the aid of lsd or other in dole alkaloids onto a secret richness and concealed density of dream onto a network by which x number of americans are truly communicating whilst reserving their lies recitations of routine arid betrayals of spiritual poverty for the official government delivery system maybe even onto a real alternative to the exitlessness to the absence of surprise to life that harrows the head of everybody american you know and you too sweetie or you are hallucinating it or a plot has been mounted against you so expensive and elaborate involving items like the forging of stamps and ancient books constant surveillance of your movements planting of post horn images all over san francisco bribing of librarians hiring of professional actors and pierce inverarity only knows whatall besides all financed out of the estate in a way either too secret or too involved for your nonlegal mind to know about even though you are coexecutor so labyrinthine that it must have meaning beyond just a practical joke or you are fantasying some such plot in which case you are a nut oedipa out of your skull

those now that she was looking at them she saw to be the alternatives those symmetrical four she didnt like any of them but hoped she was mentally ill that thats all it was that night she sat for hours too numb even to drink teaching herself to breathe in a vacuum for this oh god was the void there was nobody who could help her nobody in the world they were all on something mad possible enemies dead old fillings in her teeth began to bother her she would spend nights staring at a ceiling lit by the pink glow of san franciscos sky other nights she could sleep for eighteen drugged hours and wake enervated hardly able to stand in conferences with the keen fasttalking old man who was new counsel for the estate her attention span could often be measured in seconds and she laughed nervously more than she spoke waves of nausea lasting five to ten minutes would strike her at random cause her deep misery then vanish as if they had never been there were headaches nightmares menstrual pains one day she drove into la picked a doctor at random from the phone book went to her told her she thought she was pregnant they arranged for tests oedipa gave her name as grace bortz and didnt show up for her next appointment

genghis cohen once so shy now seemed to come up with new goodies every other daya listing in an outdated zumstein catalogue a friend in the royal philatelic societys dim memory of some muted post horn spied in the catalogue of an auction held at dresden in 1923 one day a typescript sent him by another friend in new york it was supposed to be a translation of an article from an 1865 issue of the famous bibliotheque des timbrophiles of jeanbaptiste moens reading like another of bortzs costume dramas it told of a great schism in the tristero ranks during the french revolution according to the recently discovered and decrypted journals of the comte raoul antoine de vouziers marquis de tour et tassis one element among the tristero had never accepted the passing of the holy roman empire and saw the revolution as a temporary madness feeling obliged as fellow aristocrats to help thurn and taxis weather its troubles they put out probes to see if the house was interested at all in being subsidized this move split the tristero wide open at a convention held in milan arguments raged for a week lifelong enmities were created families divided blood spilt
at the end of it a resolution to subsidize thurn and taxis failed many conservatives taking this as a millennial judgement against them ended their association with the tristero thus the article smugly concluded did the organization enter the penumbra of historical eclipse from the battle of austerlitz until the difficulties of 1848 the tristero drifted on deprived of nearly all the noble patronage that had sustained them now reduced to handling anarchist correspondence only peripherally engaged in germany with the illfated frankfurt assembly in budapesth at the barricades perhaps even among the watchmakers of the jura preparing them for the coming of m bakunin by far the greatest number however fled to america during 184950 where they are no doubt at present rendering their services to those who seek to extinguish the flame of revolution

less excited than she might have been even a week ago oedipa showed the piece to emory bortz all the tristero refugees from the 1849 reaction arrive in america it seemed to him full of high hopes only what do they find not really asking it was part of his game trouble around 1845 the u s government had carried out a great postal reform cutting their rates putting most independent mail routes out of business by the yos and 8os any independent carrier that tried to compete with the government was immediately squashed 184950 was no time for any immigrating tristero to get ideas about picking up where theyd left off back in europe

so they simply stay on bortz said in the context of conspiracy other immigrants come to america looking for freedom from tyranny acceptance by the culture assimilation into it this melting pot civil war comes along most of them being liberals sign up to fight to preserve the union but clearly not the tristero all theyve done is to change oppositions by 1861 theyre well established not about to be suppressed while the pony express is defying deserts savages and sidewinders tristeros giving its employees crash courses in siouan and athapascan dialects disguised as indians their messengers mosey westward reach the coast every time zero attrition rate not a scratch on them their entire emphasis now toward silence impersonation opposition masquerading as allegiance

what about that stamp of cohens we await silent tristeros empire they were more open in their youth later as the feds cracked down they went over to stamps that were almost kosherlooking but not quite oedipa knew them by heart in the 15 dark green from the 1893 columbian exposition issue columbus announcing his discovery the faces of three courtiers receiving the news at the righthand side of the stamp had been subtly altered to express uncontrollable fright in the 03 mothers of america issue put out on mothers day 1934 the flowers to the lower left of whistlers mother had been replaced by venussflytrap belladonna poison sumac and a few others oedipa had never seen in the 1947 postage stamp centenary issue commemorating the great postal reform that had meant the beginning of the end for private carriers the head of a pony express rider at the lower left was set at a disturbing angle unknown among the living

the deep violet 03 regular issue of 1954 had a faint menacing smile on the face of the statue of liberty the brussels exhibition issue of 1958 included in its aerial view of the u s pavilion at brussels and set slightly off from the other tiny fairgoers the unmistakable silhouette of a horse and rider there were also the pony express stamp cohen had showed her on her first visit the lincoln 04 with u s potsage the sinister 08 airmail shed seen on the tattooed sailors letter in san franciscowell its interesting she said if the articles legitimate that ought to be easy enough to check out bortz gazing straight into her eyes why dont you the toothaches got worse she dreamed of disembodied voices from whose malignance there was no appeal the soft dusk of mirrors out of which something was about to walk and empty rooms that waited for her your gynecologist has no test for what she was pregnant with one day cohen called to tell her that the final arrangements had been made to auction off inveraritys stamp collection the tristero forgeries were to be sold as lot 49 and something rather disturbing miss maas a new book bidder has appeared on the scene whom neither i nor any of the firms in the area have heard of before that hardly ever happens a what

cohen explained how there were floor bidders who would attend the auction in person and book bidders who would send in their bids by mail these bids would be entered in a special book by the auction firm hence the name there would be as was customary no public disclosure of persons for whom the book would be biddingthen how do you know hes a stranger word gets around hes being supersecretive working through an agent c morris schrift a very reputable good man morris was in touch with the auctioneers yesterday to tell them his client wanted to examine our forgeries lot 49 in advance normally theres no objection if they know who wants to see the lot and if hes willing to pay all the postage and insurance and get everything back inside of 24 hours but morris got quite mysterious about the whole thing wouldnt tell his clients name or anything else about him except that as far as morris knew he was an outsider so being a conservative house naturally they apologized and said no

what do you think said oedipa already knowing pretty muchthat our mysterious bidder may be from tristero cohen said and saw the description of the lot in the auction catalogue and wants to keep evidence that tristero exists out of unauthorized hands i wonder what kind of a price theyll offer
oedipa went back to echo courts to drink bourbon until the sun went down and it was as dark as it would ever get then she went out and drove on the freeway for a while with her lights out to see what would happen but angels were watching shortly after midnight she found herself in a phone booth in a desolate unfamiliar unlit district of san francisco she put in a station call to the greek way in san francisco gave the musical voice that answered a description of the acned fuzzheaded inamorato anonymous shed talked to there and waited inexplicable tears beginning to build up pressure around her eyes half a minute of clinking glasses bursts of laughter sounds of a juke box then he came on

this is arnold snarb she said choking upi was in the little boys room he said the mens room was full she told him quickly using up no more than a minute what shed learned about the tristero what had happened to hilarius mucho metzger driblette fallopian so you are she said the only one i have i dont know your name dont want to but i have to know whether they arranged it with you to run into me by accident and tell me your story about the post horn because it may be a practical joke for you but it stopped being one for me a few hours ago i got drunk and went driving on these freeways next time i may be more deliberate for the love of god human life whatever you respect please help me

arnold he said there was a long stretch of bar noise its over she said theyve saturated me from here on ill only close them out youre free released you can tell me its too late he said for mefor me before she could ask what he meant hed hung up she had no more coins by the time she could get somewhere to break a bill hed be gone she stood between the public booth and the rented car in the night her isolation complete and tried to face toward the sea but shed lost her bearings she turned pivoting on one stacked heel could find no mountains either as if there could be no barriers between herself and the rest of the land san francisco at that moment lost the loss pure instant spherical the sound of a stainless orchestral chime held among the stars and struck lightly gave up its residue of uniqueness for her became a name again was assumed back into the american continuity of crust and mantle

pierce inveracity was really dead she walked down a stretch of railroad track next the highway spurs ran off here and there into factory property pierce may have owned these factories too but did it matter now if hed owned all of san francisco san francisco was a name an incident among our climatic records of dreams and what dreams became among our accumulated daylight a moments squallline or tornados touchdown among the higher more continental solemnities stormsystems of group suffering and need prevailing winds of affluence there was the true continuity san francisco had no boundaries no one knew yet how to draw them she had dedicated herself weeks ago to making sense of what inveracity had left behind never suspecting that the legacy was america

might oedipa maas yet be his heiress had that been in the will in code perhaps without pierce really knowing having been by then too seized by some headlong expansion of himself some visit some lucid instruction though she could never again call back any image of the dead man to dress up pose talk to and make answer neither would she lose a new compassion for the culdesac hed tried to find a way out of for the enigma his efforts had created
though he had never talked business with her she had known it to be a fraction of him that couldnt come out even would carry forever beyond any decimal place she might name her love such as it had been remaining incommensurate with his need to possess to alter the land to bring new skylines personal antagonisms growth rates into being keep it bouncing hed told her once thats all the secret keep it bouncing he must have known writing the will facing the specter how the bouncing would stop he might have written the testament only to harass a onetime mistress so cynically sure of being wiped out he could throw away all hope of anything more bitterness could have run that deep in him she just didnt know

he might himself have discovered the tristero and encrypted that in the will buying into just enough to be sure shed find it or he might even have tried to survive death as a paranoia as a pure conspiracy against someone he loved would that breed of perversity prove at last too keen to be stunned even by death had a plot finally been devised too elaborate for the dark angel to hold at once in his humorless vicepresidents head all the possibilities of had something slipped through and inveracity by that much beaten death yet she knew head down stumbling along over the cinder bed and its old sleepers there was still that other chance that it was all true that inverarity had only died nothing else suppose god there really was a tristero then and that she had come on it by accident if san francisco and the estate were really no different from any other town any other estate then by that continuity she might have found the tristero anywhere in her republic through any of a hundred lightlyconcealed entranceways a hundred alienations if only shed looked she stopped a minute between the steel rails raising her head as if to sniff the air becoming conscious of the hard strung presence she stood on knowing as if maps had been flashed for her on the sky how these tracks ran on into others others knowing they laced deepened authenticated the great night around her

if only shed looked she remembered now old pullman cars left where the moneyed run out or the customers vanished amid green farm flat nesses where clothes hung smoke lazed out of jointed pipeswere the squatters there in touch with others through tristero were they helping carry forward that 300 years of the houses disinheritance surely theyd forgotten by now what it was the tristero were to have inherited as perhaps oedipa one day might have what was left to inherit that america coded in inveracity’s testament whose was that she thought of other immobilized freight cars where the kids sat on the floor planking and sang back happy as fat whatever came over the mothers pocket radio of other squatters who stretched canvas for leantos behind smiling billboards along all the highways or slept in junkyards in the stripped shells of wrecked plymouths or even daring spent the night up some pole in a linemans tent like caterpillars swung among a web of telephone wires living in the very copper rigging and secular miracle of communication untroubled by the dumb voltages flickering their miles the night long in the thousands of unheard messages

she remembered drifters she had listened to americans speaking their language carefully scholarly as if they were in exile from somewhere else invisible yet congruent with the cheered land she lived in and walkers along the roads at night zooming in and out of your headlights without looking up too far from any town to have a real destination and the voices before and after the dead mans that had phoned at random during the darkest slowest hours searching ceaseless among the dials ten million possibilities for that magical other who would reveal herself out of the roar of relays monotone litanies of insult filth fantasy love whose brute repetition must someday call into being the trigger for the unnameable act the recognition the word how many shared tristeros secret as well as its exile what would the probate judge have to say about spreading some kind of a legacy among them all all those nameless maybe as a first installment oboy hed be on her ass in a microsecond revoke her letters testamentary theyd call her names proclaim her through all orange county as a redistribution and pinko slip the old man from warpe wistfull kubitschek and mcmingus in as administrator de bonis non and so much baby for code constellations shadowlegatees who knew perhaps shed be hounded someday as far as joining tristero itself if it existed in its twilight its aloofness its waiting

the waiting above all if not for another set of possibilities to replace those that had conditioned the land to accept any san francisco among its most tender flesh without a reflex or a cry then at least at the very least waiting for a symmetry of choices to break down to go skew she had heard all about excluded middles they were bad shit to be avoided and how had it ever happened here with the chances once so good for diversity for it was now like walking among matrices of a great digital computer the zeroes and ones twinned above hanging like balanced mobiles right and left ahead thick maybe endless behind the hieroglyphic streets there would either be a transcendent meaning or only the earth in the songs miles dean serge and leonard sang was either some fraction of the truths numinous beauty as mucho now believed or only a power spectrum tremaine the swastika salesmans reprieve from holocaust was either an injustice or the absence of a wind the bones of the gis at the bottom of lake inverarity were there either for a reason that mattered to the world or for skin divers and cigarette smokers ones and zeroes so did the couples arrange themselves at vesperhaven house either an accommodation reached in some kind of dignity with the angel of death or only death and the daily tedious preparations for it another mode of meaning behind the obvious or none either oedipa in the orbiting ecstasy of a true paranoia or a real tristero for there either was some tristero beyond the appearance of the legacy america or there was just america and if there was just america then it seemed the only way she could continue and manage to be at all relevant to it was as an alien unfurrow assumed full circle into some paranoia

next day with the courage you find you have when there is nothing more to lose she got in touch with c morris schrift and inquired after his mysterious client he decided to attend the auction in person was all schrift would tell her you might run into him there she might the auction was duly held on a sunday afternoon in perhaps the oldest building in san narciso dating from before world war ii oedipa arrived a few minutes early alone and in a cold lobby of gleaming redwood floorboards and the smell of wax and paper she met genghis cohen who looked genuinely embarrassed please dont call it a conflict of interests he drawled earnestly there were some lovely mozambique triangles i couldnt quite resist may i ask if youve come to bid miss maas no said oedipa im only being a busybodywere in luck loren passerine the finest auctioneer in the west will be crying today will be what we say an auctioneer cries a sale cohen said
your fly is open whispered oedipa she was not sure what shed do when the bidder revealed himself she had only some vague idea about causing a scene violent enough to bring the cops into it and find out that way who the man really was she stood in a patch of sun among brilliant rising and falling points of dust trying to get a little warm wondering if shed go through with it

its time to start said genghis cohen offering his arm the men inside the auction room wore black mohair and had pale cruel faces they watched her come in trying each to conceal his thoughts loren passerine on his podium hovered like a puppetmaster his eyes bright his smile practiced and relentless he stared at her smiling as if saying im surprised you actually came oedipa sat alone toward the back of the room looking at the napes of necks trying to guess which one was her target her enemy perhaps her proof an assistant closed the heavy door on the lobby windows and the sun she heard a lock snap shut the sound echoed a moment passerine spread his arms in a gesture that seemed to belong to the priesthood of some remote culture perhaps to a descending angel the auctioneer cleared his throat oedipa settled back to await the crying of lot 49embed"
