verse 1 big sean
coming from a city where bullets turn bros into souls
who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
good girls stopped being good when i turned em into hoes
dreams stopped being dreams when i turned em into goals
big was the first one that had it
then i saw nas chain man that was illmatic
then i saw kanyes hanging from his gold necklace
then ye gave me mine that show you my work ethic
mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
used to pick me up from school man right after work
now she rolling up in that caddy like she coming to church
she asked why i rock all this gold cause im coming in first
got the streets behind me like i was staring in the rearview
used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
now im in the penthouse look at what a mill do
looking in the mirror and im still you im still you

hook big sean
got my first chain
feeling like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain

big was the first one that had it
now jacob the jeweler benefit from my habits
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain

verse 2 nas
whats the noise all about with this rap stuff
i can say i never been punked robbed or smacked up
i can say i never been chased jumped or backed up
i learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up
cause its a mental game
i learned that when i got my first initial chain
i didnt fake it it was gold plated i was posing relatin
to those dealing with blow had the big gold bold anchors it was those gangsters
that bonus that culture those projects
shiny shit on their necks making both of my eyes squint
they got in my bones now im copping stones
sorry sierra leone one day well right the wrongs
18 karat gold cuban on
not too short not too wide not too long
my pendant offensive in the truest form
platinum gold rose gold what you want

hook big sean
got my first chain
feeling like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain
bridge big sean
big was the first one that had it
then i saw nas chain man that was illmatic
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain

verse 3 big sean
on a highway to heaven look at all the tolls i paid
i done gave my city drive all the roads i paved
no matter what way i turn things go my way
im rocking chains everyday so you know i slave
even when im just walking round the crib nigga
to remind me of everything that we did nigga
look up in the mirror chain only thing lyin
no heroes where im from bullets only thing flyin
i know the higher the goal the harder the climb
but after that the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
police only work 12hour shifts
cause in detroit thats cheaper than the bailout bitch
trap house built brick by brick paid dues on dues
ff good you know im reppin crew on crews
stack bills on bills til my backyards got pools on pools
girls on girls lingerie and moulin rouge
god damn i think im gon od
off this asparagus and bread and pasta
need a doctor ive been dodging shady hoes and rainy days
its like i got a builtin doppler
and its a shame a fuckin shame
i dont remember my first love or my first time prayin
but remember my first ass and the first time she came
it almost felt as good as when i got my first chain
hook big sean
got my first chain
feeling like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain

bridge big sean
jayz taught me money aint a thing
came from the streets headed to the hall of fame
and i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain
i be stunting stunting like i got my first chain

verse 4 kid cudi
its such a wonderful thing to see the end of all things
niggas and bitches are with you cuz where you at
i got my mind is on me a couple others and dreams
wouldve seen me and my niggas in this bitch
about two months in a weeks time
went from feelin hellish to godly with lemonlime shine
now how the fuck can i chill now kanye think im dope
see this piece that i own now how sick is the rope
taking life for what it is the troublesome chick
who throws fists sometimes its the weather
things switch up people trip up
the money come down then climb up but when it come again
the most creepin deceivin men are schemeschemin
saying that you love me i surely hope and if you dont
motherfuck that sometimes so dead it
shred it young nigga lost to the night
im so ready to let it go my life is fucking awesome
i could be fuckin dead right now but im awesome
so fuck whoever has a bad thought dont know the god
cause when i leave this bitch you all gon wish you knew the god
it might be too late but the songs will live on
just know this fact you were all wrong
now watch me do my silly dance not really a dance
more like a prance im signing off with a crotch grab

outro kid cudi
thank you man for letting me get on this record sean
you the coolest
good music nigga forever
understand yahm43embed"
