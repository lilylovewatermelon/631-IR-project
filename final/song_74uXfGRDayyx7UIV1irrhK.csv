rollin round wound up in the middle of bfe
spinnin these wheels down a road that we aint ever seen

who knows where we are

i get a little more lost every time i look in her eyes
its hard to keep my hands on the wheel when shes looking so fine
i ride down any back road that she wants me to drive
with the

seat laid back running
fingers through my hair
watching miles go by
like she just dont care
looking at me with
one thing on her mind

woah

i guess im making all the right wrong turns tonight

something about the sound of the gravel setting the mood
has got me thinking i should park this thing underneath the moon
and wrap ourselves all around each other like a vine of kudzu
with the
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeseat laid back running
fingers through my hair
watching miles go by
like she just dont care
looking at me with
one thing on her mind

woah

i guess im making all the right wrong turns tonight

who knows where this is winding up
i dont mind if its getting late
lucky stars are lining up
shes loving every move i make

with the

seat laid back running
fingers through my hair
watching miles go by
like she just dont care
looking at me with
one thing on her mind

woah
i guess im making all the right wrong turns tonight
woah
i guess im making all the right wrong turns tonight
