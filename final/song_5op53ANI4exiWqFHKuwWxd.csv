ice age heat wave cant complain
if the worlds at large why should i remain
walked away to another plan
gonna find another place maybe one i can stand
i move on to another day
to a whole new town with a whole new way
went to the porch to have a thought
got to the door and again i couldnt stop
you dont know where and you dont know when
but youve still got your words and youve got your friends
walk along to another day
work a little harder work another way
well uhuh baby i aint got no plan
well i float on maybe would you understand
gonna float on maybe would you understand
well i float on maybe would you understand

verse 2
the days get shorter and the nights get cold
i like the autumn but this place is getting old
i pack up my belongings and i head for the coast
it might not be a lot but i feel like im making the most
the days get longer and the nights smell green
i guess its not surprising but its spring and i should leave
i like songs about drifters books about the same
they both seem to make me feel a little less insane
walked on off to another spot
i still havent gotten anywhere that i want
did i want love did i need to know
why does it always feel like im caught in an undertow

the moths beat themselves to death against the lights
adding their breeze to the summer nights
outside water like air was gray
i didnt know what i had that day
walk a little farther to another plan
you said that you did but you didnt understand
i know that starting overs not what lifes about
but my thoughts were so loud i couldnt hear my mouth
my thoughts were so loud i couldnt hear my mouth
my thoughts were so loud32embed"
