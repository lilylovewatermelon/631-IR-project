mind over matter
does it matter to any of us
dont change the subject
im heavy on your love
i missed that train
new york city it rains
fly to east la in big jet planes
you know youre on my mind

chorus
and if the world dont break
ill be shakin it
cause im a young man after all
and when the seasons change
will you stand by me
cause im a young man built to fall

verse 2
mind over matter
im in tatters thinkin about her
taste my disaster
its heavy on my tongue
all the lights aglow
tokyo snows
go to watch the show
curtains closed
im watching you this time
you might also likechorus
and if the world dont break
ill be shakin it
cause im a young man after all
and when the seasons change
will you stand by me
cause im a young man built to fall

i missed that train
new york city it rains
fly to east la in big jet planes
you know youre on my mind
all the lights aglow
tokyo snows
go to watch the show
curtains closed
im watching you this time

bridge
mind over matter
mind over matter
you know youre on my mind

chorus
and if the world dont break
ill be shakin it
cause im a young man after all
i missed that train and when the seasons change
will you stand by me
fly to east la
cause im a young man built to fall
and if the world dont break
all the lights aglow
tokyo snows
go to watch the show
curtains closed
and when the seasons change
will you stand by me
cause im a young man built to fall27embed"
