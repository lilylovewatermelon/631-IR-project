i feel weak weve been here before
cause i feel we keep going back and forth
maybe its over maybe were through
but i honestly can say i still love you

prechorus
maybe we reached the mountain peak
and theres no more left to climb
and maybe we lost the magic piece
and were both too blind to find

chorus
lets start over
lets give love their wings
lets start over
stop fighting bout the same old thing
lets start over
we cant let our good love die
maybe we can start all over
give love another life
