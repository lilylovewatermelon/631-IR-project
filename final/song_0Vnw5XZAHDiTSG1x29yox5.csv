is it getting better
or do you feel the same
will it make it easier on you now
you got someone to blame

chorus
you said one love one life
when its one need in the night
one love we get to share it
it leaves you baby if you dont care for it

verse 2
did i disappoint you
or leave a bad taste in your mouth
you act like you never had love
and you want me to go without

chorus
well its too late tonight
to drag the past out into the light
were one but were not the same
we get to carry each other carry each other
one

verse 3
have you come here for forgiveness
have you come to raise the dead
have you come here to play jesus
to the lepers in your head
you might also likechorus
did i ask too much more than a lot
you gave me nothing now its all i got
were one but were not the same
well we hurt each other and were doing it again

bridge
you say love is a temple love the higher law
love is a temple love the higher law
you ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
and i cant be holding on to what youve got
when all youve got is hurt

final chorus
one love one blood
one life youve got to do what you should
one life with each other
sisters brothers
one life but were not the same
we get to carry each other carry each other
one
