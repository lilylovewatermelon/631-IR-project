maria’s on the hill
she was all “side of her eyes”
a fivedollar wine as a blanket inside
lay up the pages on a traveling bed
watch the blood of christ mountains oh they all turn red

chorus
howl at the half moon radio queen
she’s all smoke she’s all nicotine
the songs in my pocket just crumble apart
won’t you sing me something for the dark

verse 2
maria’s got wings she’s got legs for the sea
a captain’s coat and a note for me
wake up marie fore the season turns
set your dash for the coast watch the sangres burn

chorus
howl at the half moon radio queen
she’s all smoke she’s all nicotine
the songs in my pocket just crumble apart
won’t you sing me something for the dark dark dark

outro
oooh oooh
oooh oooh
won’t you sing me something for the dark dark dark
won’t you sing me something for the dark dark dark
won’t you sing me something for the dark dark dark
won’t you sing me something for the dark
won’t you sing me something for the dark dark darksee gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeembed"
