onetwo onetwo
i said ahonetwo onetwo
right about now is the time
i kick a nursery rhyme uhh

verse 1 joell ortiz
goddamn it he did it again didnt he
hickory dickory dock the mouse ran up the clock
so its time to get the cheese yall be rhymin like yo please
i got that second vowel flow im rhymin with the ease
you never see me on lists inside these magazines
but im the source of rap discussions they vibein with ortiz
in my xxl shirt lion over my jeans
its like im fightin in europe im fire overseas
hiphops messiah bring your sire to his knees
im nevaeh in reverse paradise in the ps
im iron mike in the 80s in the black trunks
act pump ya lyin on your back slump all my lions pack punch
who wan be rap lunch me make your snack chump
ya likkle pistol pack pack pump me mac dump
fast munch i reckon you stay away from the wreckin ball
if i swing in your direction ill level you all like a measured wall

interlude joell ortiz
the itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout
down came the rain and washed the spider out
you might also likeverse 2 joell ortiz
im the definition of ill jack and jill went up the hill
to fetch a pail of water i took jacks crown and pushed him down
i manslaughter all around the damn border
optimus in his prime a fuckin transformer
walk in any club im the subject of camcorders
so im slidin out the back ery night with a mans daughter
puttin my youknowwhat you know where
no not down there in between both ears
leave my seeds on they nose hairs oh yeah i go there
what the fuck you expect i fuck necks til they throat tears
embody the projects symbolize the struggle
where the kids pawn my object to minimize the trouble
i been in rides with duffle bags stuffed with the crack
few years later i put them same drugs on the track
got the globe hot from coca in a flow you cant toca
so listen close chocha cllate la boca

interlude 2 joell ortiz
twinkle twinkle little star
how i wonder what you are

verse 3 joell ortiz
goddamn im the man mary had a little lamb
whose fleece was white as snow
i skinned him and rocked that lil nigga to my show
i be dipper than an o reo cookie imma milk em for this dough
im a pilgrim with the hoes  i could rock a plymouth sundance
in dumb pants and still thank her for givin me a blow job
no prob they go home i go hard
and find another broad to hump freehumphrey bogart
john rambo got ammo for whole squads
i rhyme over a banjo and handle yo bars
im high and wont fall like a dope nod
im outta here every rhymes a postdated postcard
dont mention my name just keep playin yo part
cause i got a gang of wolves amadeus mozarts
i dont smile aint gon set it
see you in the hospital spellin yaowa yo ass on wild anesthetics
outro joell ortiz
old macdonald had a farm eieio
and on this farm he had you ducks garbage with your flow
yall cant fuck with joell
that niggas nice
yall just be sayin stuff that only he can understand
haha the little kids heheembed"
