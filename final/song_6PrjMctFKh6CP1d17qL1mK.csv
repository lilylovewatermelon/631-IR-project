she make a train take a dirt road
or make it stop on a dime
make em wonder which way to go
make a man change his mind
shes a lawyers queen a truckers dream
with a baseball hat fit for a queen
a genuine a different kind of fine

verse 1
cadillacs and caviar
well that aint how she rolls
implants and tummy tucks
she sure dont need those
shes a cool drink of water when the summers mean
poured into those levis jeans
shes country as the day is long

chorus
she make a train take a dirt road
or make it stop on a dime
make em wonder which way to go
make a man change his mind
shes a lawyers queen and a truckers dream
with a baseball hat fit for a queen
a genuine a different kind of fine

tan and lean like a longneck bottle
in the passenger seat got her hand on the throttle
shell get you there right on time
lord take you down to tijuana
make you wanna slap your mama
got you all tore up and made you spill your dip cup
bona fide a different kind of fine

chorus
make a train take a dirt road
or make it stop on a dime
make em wonder which way to go
make a man change his mind
shes a lawyers queen and a truckers dream
with a baseball hat fit for a queen
a genuine a different kind of fine
she make a train take a dirt road
make it stop on a dime
she make em wonder which way to go
make a man change his mind
a lawyers queen a truckers dream
a baseball hat fit for a queen
genuine a different kind of fine
