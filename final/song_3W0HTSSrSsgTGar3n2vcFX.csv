keep tryin for you keep cryin for you

keep tryin for you keep cryin for you
keep flyin for you keep flyin and im fallin

verse 1 ramirez
twist me up a blunt im smokin on a ghetty green
the grey gorilla comin out the amazon ill cause a murder scene
psycho schizo boy im just a maniac
poppin pills to calm me down but i just dont know how to act
floatin down the bayou with two corpses sleepin with the fishes
dishin out the game that i was taught that shit is cold pimpin
never lackin always packin shit is gettin hectic mane
niggas tryna take my life cause jealousy is in their vein
call my mama let her know her son is doin little better
still depressed but i been doin alright since i got some cheddar
didnt have no pot to piss in but i kept on with my mission
tryna get my franks up and live my life with disposition

chorus sade
keep tryin for you keep cryin for you
keep flyin for you keep flyin and im fallin
keep tryin for you keep cryin for you
keep flyin for you keep flyin and im fallin
keep tryin for you keep cryin for you
keep flyin for you keep flyin and im fallin
keep tryin for you keep cryin for you
keep flyin for you keep flyin and im fallin

glock cocked glock popped now a nigga dead and gone
deep inside of hell is where i lay my head and call my home
make sure you call yo reverend when i pull up to yo fuckin place
grab the gauge and shoot that motherfucker straight up in his face
killin a busta strike the name up out my fuckin blacklist
redrum carved up in my mind a new blade just to slit my wrist
lay beneath the dirt i reappear up in the dark at night
stand inside the pentagram i read the scriptures then recite
god cant save me i came to fuckin die
sacrifice an unknown body then become immortalized
burn a church quench my thirst in the burnin flames is where i lurk
when you look inside my fuckin eyes you see the hate and hurt
comin out the crazy house i creep up better lock yo door
suck the barrel like a dick up on this magnum 44
you talkin to the devils son with three 6 on the stereo
lookin down straight at the floor with blood up on the fuckin snow11embed"
