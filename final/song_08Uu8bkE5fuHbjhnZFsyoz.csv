dee you poppin your shit nigga
i been tryna figure out like
why a motherfucker want you to be loyal to them
and they aint loyal to you i dont i dont really get that

they done told people they dont fuck with you in public and shit

i dont be understandin that shit niggas be feelin
slick way about bitches and
come on man if we aint about no money what we doin speak

verse 1
i done overplayed my part they forgot about me amnesia its cool though
i done hit yours you done hit mine why you still mad we even i aint on that
the blogs put up anything shit made up and the crazy part they believe em for 
nigga caught a charge and got locked up only reason dude still breathin i swear
i never make a hoe feel like i cant do no better than her who
heard that she got a new nigga my bag the biggest
she said he dont fuck how i fuck haha
bitch lied on god and her kids
threw me off damn that fucked up my trust
i know a niggall cross you to win
where you at with it yeah i come from the bluff
lil bro dont go through there spinnin cant do it myself why
cause my position
im peepin niggas in slick competition
really some bitches sit down when they pissin
they get some fame off me if i mention
but its a shame on me if i did it
i know you obsessed with me and i get it
stay in your lane and stay out my business over there
see moneybagg yo liveget tickets as low as 48you might also likebridge 1
yall running off with all these rumors and shit
quick and shit makin assumptions
next thing you know you judgin a nigga damn
what about the truth
its two sides to this shit
ive been that nigga
ive been lit ive been the shit
before i ever went public with a bitch
yall just catchin on late
speakin on my personal life
my real life talking bout how its fake nigga
you aint me you aint in my shoes
you aint pay dues speak

verse 2
he aint no gangsta never did nothin gangsta thats what they said that what they hollerin
i done seen so many niggas end up dead cause they got misled facts
aint got no time for no baby mouth ass nigga tryna get spoonfed nah
all that he say she say code red numb to it brain dead dont wanna hear it
without yall i wouldnt be shit
hope the haters hear me loud and clear im makin sure
unc told me a scary man a dead man you cant live you life in fear
so im takin risks yeah
you cant get a fair bond last time i checked
how them charges disappear hol up
lack of communication with my bitch what
got her actin all insecure mane
i come from the struggle like you did nigga
why the fuck you tryna down me huh
if i gotta coach a nigga on how to be real i dont need em around me at all
you cant fix your mouth to say i aint fuck with you
at least one time well two times nah three times
couldnt see the envy i was too blind
bridge 2
see they probably thought i was runnin out
whole time i was holdin back shit an infinity clip
im whats goin on so im already knowin my name gon be in your mouth but
when you have them conversations
make sure you mention he gettin six figures for a show
eleven whips paid for house sittin on four acres
take care of his kids treat all of em equally
momma put up she can wiggle her toes at night peacefully
shit like that what i do it for thats goals nigga speak

verse 3
hope for the best prepare for the worse
however it come just know that im ready thats it
you know a lie dont give a fuck who tell it huh
i know they mad but they never admit it who
it be your own people blood
they gon try to take advantage of you if you let em
they get a thrill off turnin you down
but never gossip but how you help em
i heard its niggas out hear wanna touch me
but i cant tell i be where they at
watch you draw the line so stay over there
dont come round the gang dont throw up the set
you not what i rep
why do some shit you gone regret answer that
think smart with it this shit chess ha
just cause yall related dont mean nothin
niggas unc ice about they check i aint meech
all that you love me shit aint genuine
and i felt the vibe when i walked in
shit slick hurt me thinkin you solid then i saw you bend
even after they true colors show kept it real on my end
that wasnt my beef at first i made it mine
cause me and bruh lockedin for life and after
outro
when i say we la familia we la familia we locked in for life
shit loyalty over love
we gon keep it real first
like you not gon see me fuckin with my nigga opp
i dont give a fuck if i knew his opp longer than him
niggasll hate you so much they can know youll opp a rat
and still hang with em
dont that make them the same nigga
shit let me know i need clarification
what part of the game is that
see i know what need to be done
nigga need to start pullin straight up checkin these niggas
these niggas cant stand no pressure
you aint gotta feel how im comin where im comin from
if pain was a person
