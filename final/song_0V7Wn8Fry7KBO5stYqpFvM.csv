never found out why you left him but this answer begs a question
too blind to see tomorrow too broke to beg or borrow
young and stupid left wide open
hearts are wasted lives are broken

verse 2 mark hoppus tom delonge
one more point of contention i need some intervention
approached with vague intentions betray my short attention
span the distance bridge the border
beg forgiveness round the corner

chorus mark hoppus
every time i look for you the sun goes down
and i stumble when this whole thing runs aground
i left another message you are never around
but every time i look for you the sun goes down once more

postchorus mark hoppus
will the last one out please shut the door

verse 3 mark hoppus tom delonge
more time apart will give you a few more months to argue
is this too much to live through it always seems too far to
drive the point home send more letters
pray tomorrow ends up better

i never did do anything that she asked
i never let what happened stay in the past
i never did quite understand what she meant
in spite of everything in spite of everything

chorus mark hoppus
every time i look for you the sun goes down
and i stumble when this whole thing runs aground
i left another message you are never around
but every time i look for you the sun goes down
