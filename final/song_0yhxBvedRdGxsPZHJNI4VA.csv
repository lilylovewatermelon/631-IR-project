i know i know i know i know know
i know i know i know i know know
i i know it i know it

spoken word kanye west
the most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
today i seriously thought about killing you
i contemplated premeditated murder
and i think about killing myself
and i love myself way more than i love you so…
today i thought about killing you premeditated murder
youd only care enough to kill somebody you love
the most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm
just say it out loud to see how it feels
people say dont say this dont say that
just say it out loud just to see how it feels
weigh all the options nothings off the table
today i thought about killing you premeditated murder
i think about killing myself
and i i love myself way more than i love you
the most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm
i think this is the part where im supposed to say somethin good to compensate it so it doesnt come off bad
but sometimes i think really bad things
really really really bad things
and i love myself way more than i love you
see if i was tryin to relate it to more people
id probably say im struggling with loving myself
because that seems like a common theme
but thats not the case here
i love myself way more than i love you
and i think about killing myself
so best believe i thought about killing you today
premeditated murder

i called up my loved ones i called up my cousins
i called up the muslims said im bout to go dumb
get so bright its no sun get so loud i hear none
screamed so loud got no lungs hurt so bad i go numb
time to bring in the drums that prrapapapum
set the newtone on em set the nuke off on em
i need coke with no rum i taste coke on her tongue
i dont joke with no one theyll say he died so young
i done had a bad case of too many bad days
got too many bad traits used the floor for ashtrays
i dont do shit halfway ima clear the cache
ima make my name last put that on my last name
its a different type of rules that we obey
ye ye ye season nigga we old bay
we was all born to die nigga doa
niggas say they hero mm i dont see no cape
mm i dont see no mm yeah i dont see no mm mm
if i wasnt shinin so hard wouldnt be no shade
buckwheatass nigga its gon be otay
sorry but i chose not to be no slave
young nigga shit nigga we dont age
i thought i was past my deebo ways
even when i went broke i aint break
how you gon hate nigga we go way back
to when i had the braids and you had the wave cap
drop a pin for the fade and im on my way asap
dont get socked in the mouth you know homie dont play that
pay the fire marshal bill cause this shit done got way packed
they wanna see me go ape ape ape
all you gotta do is speak on ye
all you gotta do is speak on ye
dont get your tooth chipped like fritolay119embed"
