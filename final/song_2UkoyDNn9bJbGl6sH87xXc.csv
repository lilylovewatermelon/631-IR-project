i’ve been waiting for so long
waiting for you
maybe you’ll give up and come home
i just want you

verse
all these letters that you wrote
they remind me
you’re not far when you leave home
that’s the best part

chorus
is it too much to ask you to never let me go
is it too much to ask you to hold me even close
is it too much to ask you to never let me go
is it too much to ask

verse
it’s the road that takes you away
that’s the worst part
cause once it takes you makes you stay
there’s no way out

chorus
is it too much to ask you to never let me go
is it too much to ask you to hold me even close
is it too much to ask you
is it too much to ask you
is it too much to ask you to never let me go
is it too much to asksee faye webster liveget tickets as low as 47you might also like1embed"
