i want a normal life just like a newborn child
i am a loverhater i am an instigator
you are an oversight dont try to compromise
i learn to love to hate it i am not integrated

prechorus
just call my name youll be okay
your scream is burning through my veins

chorus
sooner or later youre gonna hate it
go ahead and throw your life away
driving me under leaving me out there
go ahead and throw your life away

verse 2
youre like an infantile i knew it all the while
you sit and try to play me just like you see on tv
i am an oversight just like a parasite
why am i so pathetic i know you wont forget

prechorus
just call my name youll be okay
your scream is burning through my veins

sooner or later youre gonna hate it
go ahead and throw my life away
driving me under leaving me out there
go ahead and throw my life away
sooner or later youre gonna hate it
go ahead and throw our life away
driving me under leaving me out there
go ahead and throw our life away

throw our life away
throw our life away3embed"
