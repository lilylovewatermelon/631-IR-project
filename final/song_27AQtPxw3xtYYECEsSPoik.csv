my life served on a plate
for all of you to eat
take my love and hate
but what is this inside of me

chorus
pity me pity me dont you pity me
pity me pity me dont you pity me
dont you pity me
dont you pity me

verse 2
under everything
is something that you cant see
i cant even believe
something is wrong with me

chorus
pity me pity me dont you pity me
pity me pity me dont you pity me
dont you pity me
dont you pity me

postchorus
you swear that all of this is real
but sometimes i cant seem to feel
nothing ever satisfies
one day i will realize

pity me pity me dont you pity me
dont you pity me
dont you pity me

postchorus
you swear that all of this is real
but sometimes i cant seem to feel
nothing ever satisfies
one day i will realize
