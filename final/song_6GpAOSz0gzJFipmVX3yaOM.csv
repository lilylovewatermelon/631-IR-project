whatll it be he asked what do you need tonight
something cold to drown the fire something hot to stir one up
ill make it simple i said just two things ill request
that bottle by your shoulder and some quarters for these dollars

chorus
cause if you want to make me happy pour me bourbon on the rocks
and play every sad song on the jukebox
songs of loving and leaving lying and cheating
songs of hurting and crying and even songs of dying
if you want to make me happy pour me bourbon on the rocks
and play every sad song on the jukebox

verse 2
a woman he asked
she left you i bet ive seen that look thats in your eyes
on a many other face thats right i said i deserved it i guess
but it still hurts me all alone at night there by myself

chorus
so if you want to make me happy pour me bourbon on the rocks
and play every sad song on the jukebox
songs of loving and leaving lying and cheating
songs of hurting and crying and even songs of dying
if you want to make me happy pour me bourbon on the rocks
and play every sad song on the jukebox
if you want to make me happy pour me bourbon on the rocks
and play every sad song on the jukeboxsee alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeembed"
