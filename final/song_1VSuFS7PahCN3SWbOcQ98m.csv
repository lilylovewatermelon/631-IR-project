verse 1 machine gun kelly
damn
i saw you walk in the room and i tried my best
not to panic while im lookin for the back door
i smelled the perfume and its obvious
im gonna stay and put my key in the bag more
i cant i cant i cant pretend to forget
youre the reason i punched a hole in the wall back home
and then and then and then a couple hours later
were in room 29 at the chateau
