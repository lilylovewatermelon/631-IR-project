mother i am flipping through the past
turning pages of a book to find you
mother i am lost
mother i am scared
mother i dont know what to do
what were you trying to say
mustve written it down for a reason
mustve thought id find it someday
i feel this power surging through me every minute
like a horse thats gone wild
mother you were here
mother you are gone
and you left behind a scared child
cant sit around and cry
theres too much to lose
and i think that ive been given this power for a reason
and i need to know why

chorus 1 elsa
i seek the truth
what are you telling me
im ready to hear
cant go forward this way
with questions growing day by day
i seek the truth
what are you showing me
im ready to see
i need to know who you are
to know who i am meant to be
you might also likeverse 2 elsa
mother you were everyones queen
i watched you closely and you taught me well
how do i be you
how do i be good
how do i be me in arendelle
how do i go in this land with a power inside
that i cant command
its growing and speaking a language
that i dont understand

chorus 2 elsa
and i seek the truth
what are you teaching me
im ready to learn
cant retreat once again
and so i turn to you back then
i seek the truth
you left me messages
and they hold the key
i need to know what they mean
to know who you want me to be

verse 3 anna
another secret
and another and another
at least you were consistent
hello father hello mother
but i wont let that pull us back to what we were before
i wont let her close that door
no more doors anymore
bridge elsa anna
where the north wind meets the sea
no more secrets
theres a river
stay together
full of memory
youre my family
come my darling homeward bound
i just found you
homeward bound
youll stay found

chorus 3 elsa anna
i seek the truth
you drew a map for me you left me a clue
you didnt leave me alone
youre with me guiding what i do
i seek the truth
elsa
they say that it can hurt but even so
elsa
i need to know who you were
so i can know who i am

outro elsa anna both
and i wont let it
i wont let you
go
i wont let you
