id had enough of heartbreak
i told myself that i could never fall again
then sure as fate she came i
just had to get to her and
she gave me all her numbers gave me all her names

cold and lonely without you
dont know if i can make it through
maybe youll hear this song
you been gone way too long
too good to let it go too good to be true

we left and we went home
unbelievable
i looked into her eyes thunder in my heart
and we were joined forever
our bodies slick together
i told her everything confessions in the dark

cold and lonely without you
dont know if i can make it through
maybe youll hear this song
you been gone way too long
too good to let it go too good to be true
you might also likeshe painted inspiration
onto my fractured soul i
was never sure she knew how much she meant to me
she never trusted me i know she didnt see
the night she left she killed the heart inside of me

cold and lonely without you
dont know if i can make it through
maybe youll hear this song
you been gone way too long
too good to let it go too good to be true

cold and lonely without you
dont know if i can make it through
maybe youll hear this song
you been gone way too long
too good to let it go too good to be trueembed"
