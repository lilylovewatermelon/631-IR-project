she said im tired of those boots being dirty all the time
all your huntin’ stuff and your threeday scruff you know i dont like
and then she started on all my friends and all my drinkin
well speaking of my friends and speaking of my drinkin’
one two three four

chorus
i cut her loose and tied one on
closed down my favorite honky tonk
dont know why i waited so damn long
i cut her loose and tied one on

verse 2
yeah i was drinking like george jones dancing like elvis
told my friends what happened and they all said hell yeah
a lotta highfives and a lotta beer went down
ask me where she is now i dont give a damn now
one two three four

chorus
i cut her loose and tied one on
closed down my favorite honky tonk
dont know why i waited so damn long
i cut her loose and tied one on
see jon pardi liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeverse 3
saw a blonde at the jukebox punchin up some haggard
used to be tied down now it doesnt matter
we were spinnin and atwirlin all up in them curves when
she said wait do you have a girlfriend
nope

chorus
i cut her loose and tied one on
closed down my favorite honky tonk
don’t know why i waited so damn long
i cut her loose and tied one on
i cut her loose and tied one on
closed down my favorite honky tonk
don’t know why i waited so damn long
i cut her loose and tied one on yeahembed"
