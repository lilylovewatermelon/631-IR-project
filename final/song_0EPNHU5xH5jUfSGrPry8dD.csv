i drank your pleasure slow
i stumbled out from your veil
but still ill come for you tonight
choke my faith and stab my pride
tell myself that

this is the last time
this is the last time
this is the last time now
i bleed for you
i bleed for you

preservation or predation
as im reeling i dont know
crumbled i spill out of your hand
i want to fall
and you see it all
and you just laugh when i say

this is the last time
this is the last time
this is the last time now
ill bleed for you
ill bleed for you
you might also likeand everything i feel i know you know
and everything that heals i know you know
and everything that steals i know you know
and everything that kills you know

and tell myself that
this is the last time
this is the last time
this is the last time now

this is the last time
this is the last time
this is the last time now
now now now nowembed"
