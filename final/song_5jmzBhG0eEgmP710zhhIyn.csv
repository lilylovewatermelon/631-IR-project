verse
its hard to maintain this soldier life mentality
it would be a tragedy them white folks come and hassle me
throw me down and wrestle me just to put on handcuffs
try me with resisting when they told me throw my hands up
for tryna get my bands up to feed the fam
they want me nine to five working as a pizza man
instead im nine to five serving going gram for gram
cause fore you know it the bills gonna be due again
they look at us as hooligans but they dont understand the hand that i was dealt
all the dreams that i watched melt all the pain that i done felt
all the storms that i survived and all the rain that i done felt
look me in my eyes youll see i got no choice but to grind
