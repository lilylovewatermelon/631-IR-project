i remember wasting time
watching as the planes fly by
i remember hearing the engines echoing through the sky

prechorus
and they used to say
that someday youll forget it
you wont hear them
and they used to say
that time goes by
that nothing changes

chorus
i wont miss my flight again
im not where i belong
so give me just one chance
and one by one ill prove you wrong
one by one ill prove you wrong

verse 2
i remember every night
sitting by the runway side
i remember waiting for a reason to say goodbye

prechorus
and they used to say
that someday youll forget it
you wont hear them
and they used to say
the day goes by but you cant change it

i wont miss my flight again
im not where i belong
so give me just one chance
and one by one ill prove you wrong
one by one ill prove you wrong

bridge
sometimes i think ive been wrong
but this is the place that i think i belong
and every time i speak my mind im leaving you behind
and i wont miss my flight again
im not where i belong
so give me just one chance
and one by one ill prove you wrong

chorus
i wont miss my flight again
im not where i belong
so give me just one chance
and one by one ill prove you wrong
one by one ill prove you wrong
one by one ill prove you wrong
one by one ill prove you wrongembed"
