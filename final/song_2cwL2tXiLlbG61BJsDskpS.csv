i like the treetops
cause theyre reaching just like me
and im tied up in knots
like the brambles and the weeds
i am the rooster in the morning
you can hear me cockadoodling
yeah

verse 2
i like the people
standing on the street
cause they are dumbfaced
dumbfaced just like me
theyre asking what we supposed to do
we got our left foot in our right shoe
oh what to do yeah

chorus
and i wear my ball cap to hide my big eyes
and you wear your black dress to hide your big thighs
oh baby baby ill lose my ball cap
well only if you expose your loose fat

bridge
oh dont you know that beauty is only skin deep
well baby baby come on and skin me
i like the biggins
only cause they make me look real thin
