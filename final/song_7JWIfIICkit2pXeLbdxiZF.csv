early sunday morning in the spring of 96
im chilling on my couch watching the bulls against the knicks
my honey marches in and ask if i think im slick
it seem she found my shirt with lipstick
i thought i could explain but then my story wouldnt stick
incriminating pictures show me with some other chick
it happened once before and she was tired of the tricks
she ask me if i can spell the word evict

chorus

why me lord i lost the best girl i ever had
why me lord im homeless and im feeling kinda sad
why me why me why me why me
why me lord how you member massa god so quick
why me lord when trouble tek you pickney shirt a fit
why me lord is just because you dont know when to quit
why me why me why me why me

postchorus

just the other day when i was rolling with my crew
made a little flex around by flatbush avenue
im calling to some honeys and sipping on my brew
thats when i saw the boys in blue
they pulled me to the side why i dont even have a clue
looking for a reason and they finally found a few
a case of ammunition and a loaded 32
i cant believe what im going through

chorus
why me lord here i am i gotta face the time
why me lord though the evidence aint even mine
why me lord i swear i aint guilty of the crime
why me why me why me why me
why me lord how you member massa god so quick
why me lord when trouble tek you pickney shirt a fit
why me lord is just because you dont know when to quit
why me why me why me why me

verse 3
take heed never take advantage of the things you need
never let yourself be over come by greed
walk the straight and narrow and you shall succeed
get you act up to speed
and try no matter what it takes to give a next man a blye
everybody else deserve a piece a the pie
honesty the best policy no sell no samfie
and if ya need me ask why

why me why me why me
why me why me lord why me
why me why me lord why me
why me why me lord why me
why me why me why meembed"
