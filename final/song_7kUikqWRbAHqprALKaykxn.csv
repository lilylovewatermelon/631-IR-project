first verse dawn
where is the money honey
i swear ive asked that question a thousand times
they use ya rip through your soul
while they funk with your mind anxious
for the fame that you dream all about
fool ya
fame is gone aint no one to be found

chorus

what you want me to be hollywood

what you want me to be hollywood
i dont agree
what you want me to be hollywood
i dont agree
what you want me to be hollywood
you might also likesecond verse
like a cheating mans mission
they take you out commission
suck you dry and then move onto the next
fill your head with stardom promises
make their money then they leave you for dead
still believing the ones who are deceiving
got ya starvin while they already ate
sign your life on the dotted line
stead of giving all the money they make

chorus
hollywood
i dont agree
what you want me to be hollywood
i dont agree
what you want me to be hollywood
i dont agree
what you want me to be hollywood
i dont agree
what you want me to be hollywoodembed"
