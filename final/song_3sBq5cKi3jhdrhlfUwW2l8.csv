next to another dog
theyre eating mud and
starting to smell me
two babies
dangerous and free

when i got home i told my baby
the story
she said to me
i think youre funny you saw
what you wanted to see
and i said

i am not the boy you knew
i am not the boy you knew
i am not the boy you knew
i am not the boy

feel like a million eyes on me
feel like a cannon ball i see
a tree it loses all its leaves
and you are dead to me
you watch someone you know
grow into static company
and now you see
do you wish you were
you might also likei am not the boy you knewembed"
