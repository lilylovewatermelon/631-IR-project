she turns to water she goes slippin through the cracks
and all that you gave her you’ll never win back
you circled the sun you wore your wings in all black
see i been down down down down down down down down
but now i’m back

verse 2
those bright crooked stars man they’re howlin out
thought you read them all right had them all figured out
learned every constellation just to find where you’re at
yeah i been gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone
but now i’m back

verse 3
hope was a word just a glimmer of the blade
man how it sang like an old serenade
fill it up fill it up this cups so clear
see i’ve been down down down down down down down down down down down down down
i’ve been down down down down down down down down down down down down
but now im heresee gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeembed"
