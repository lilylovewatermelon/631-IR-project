i call just to say hope youre having a nice day
youre special id get into you oops i mean im into you
every chance i get i find time to spend with you
jet could bring you to me just to watch a movie
better yet to watch you climb in the jacuzzi
yeah bubbles in a bath dom in a glass
funny how time flies when you full of laughs
its fun but before long a nigga gotta dash
for the lifestyle i live a nigga need cash to come quick
so i dont fuck with the stash
i know you like pumps and boots i like jeeps and coupes
so i grind all the time to stay with some loot
i put a spell on ya i like to call it a spell
in the bedroom working it well
i dont kiss and tell but i dont care if you kiss and tell
you can tell your girlfriend the details
