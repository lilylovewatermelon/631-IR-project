i really think youre cute
when youre workin in your garden
and you think im handsome
when i play the guitar
and i know everything about you
i think you know me through and through
i couldnt live without you
dont know what id do oh no

chorus
you think youre fallin for me
but you do not know
you think youre fallin for me

verse 2
i really think youre cute
when youre workin in your garden
smart mouth like your daddy
soft hands like your mama
you like to stay up late
and watch indie movies
and when the credits roll
i hear you say so sweet oh no

outro
you think youre fallin for me
but you do not know
you think youre fallin for me
oh but you do not know
think youre fallin for me
but you do not know
you think youre fallin for meyou might also likeembed"
