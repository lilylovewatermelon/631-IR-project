intro jayz
uhh this feel right right here quik
its like its supposed to happen this one right here
young god damn
let me justify my thug on this one right here

verse 1 jayz
it goes one oclock two oclock three oclock roc
five six seven oclock eight oclock roc
11 oclock 12 oclock the party bout to pop
then rocafella yall its your boy s dot
and i aint never been to jail i aint never pay a nigga
to do no dirt for me i was scared to do myself
i will never tell even if it means sittin in a cell
i aint never ran never will
i aint never been smacked a nigga better keep his hands
to himself or get clapped for whats under that mans belt
i never asked for nothin i dont demand of myself
honesty loyalty friends and then wealth
death before dishonor and i tell you what else
i tighten my belt fore i beg for help
foolish pride is what held me together through the years
i wasnt felt which is why i aint never played myself
i just play the hand im dealt i cant say ive never knelt
before god and asked for better cards at times to no avail
but i never sat back feelin sorry for myself
if you dont give me heaven ill raise hell
til its heaven

verse 2 jayz
now if you shoot my dog ima kill yo cat
just the unwritten laws in rap know that
for every action theres a reaction dont have me relapsin
relaxins what im about but about mine
dont be actin like you cant see street action
take me back to reasonable doubt time
you see my minds on the finish line facin the wreck
i put my muhfuckin faith in the tec tell satan not yet
you understand i am chasin my breath
i am narrowly escapin my death oh yes
i am the michael schumacher of the roc roster
travellin mach 5 barrel in my apparel can stop god
god forgive me but i cant let them deliver me to you
until i won this race then eventually
my engine gon burn out i get whatever is meant for me
however it turns out fine red line
chorus sharlotte gibson

verse 3 jayz
they say an eye for an eye we both lose our sight
and two wrongs dont make a right
but when you been wronged and you know all along that its just one life
at what point does one fight good question right
fore you knock the war try to put your dogs in his
tenandahalfs for a minuteandahalf
bet that stops all the grinnin and the laughs
when you play the game of life and the win aint in the bag
when your options is none and the pen is all you have
or the block niggas standin tight as lemons on the ave
tryin to cop a shop  call theyself cleansin in the cash
but cant put they name on paper cause then you on blast
mr president theres drugs in our residence
tell me what you want me to do come break bread with us
mr governor i swear theres a cover up
every other corner theres a liquor store fuck is up
chorus sharlotte gibson
