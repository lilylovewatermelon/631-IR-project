you could have been the real one
you could have been the one enough for me
you could have been the free one
the broken down and sick one
the remnant of a vacant life

prechorus
you come around when you find me faithless
you come around when you find me faceless

chorus
fuck me like you hate me
dig it up and tear it down
dig it up and whore me out
fuck me like you hate me
dig it up and tear it down
i love the sound when you come undone

verse 2
you could have been the next one god only knows
you could have been the one to comprehend me
you could have been the only one
the broken down and sick one
you could have been the one who i lie with

you come around when you find me faithless
you come around when you find me faceless

chorus
fuck me like you hate me
dig it up and tear it down
dig it up and whore me out
fuck me like you hate me
dig it up and tear it down
dont make a sound until i come undone

youll never break me
youll never break me
youll never break me

verse 3
you could have been the real one
you could have been the last one i lie with
you could have been the only one
i should have been the one who died

youll come around when you find me faceless
