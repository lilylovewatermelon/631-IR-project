verse 1
i feel like a million bucks
but my money dont really feel like i do
and from the ground i built my own damn buzz
people was amazed i was still in high school
but now im out and money what im bout
tryna get so much that i cant keep count
new kicks give me cushion like whoopie
keep a smile like an eatn park cookie
everything good im white boy awesome
up all night johnny carson
i aint got a benz no just a honda
but tryna get my money like an anaconda
real real long cross the country
smoke joints in the whip no cop can bust me
drive into the stage they applaud and scream
all them pretty little girls come and flock with me
