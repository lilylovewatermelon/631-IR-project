she hates goin anywhere in my old truck
she says its always muddy and it rides so rough
and there aint no graceful way to climb up in a dress
yeah im about as country as she gets

verse 2
i might get her on the lake to fish with me
if the waters smooth and the sky is blue with a nice cool breeze
but anything we catch ill have to clean myself
cause im about as country as she gets

chorus
shell slip off a pair of heels
walk barefoot across the field
climb up on a fence just to be near me
sometimes i think that horse still scares her halftodeath
yeah im about as country as she gets

verse 4
she likes being within spendin distance of a mall
havin enough bars to make a cell phone call
put her in a crowd and shes right in her element
yeah im about as country as she gets

chorus
but shell slip out on the porch sometimes
when that suns low in the sky
pull up a rockin chair just to be with me
until that first big june bug buzzes by her head
see im about as country as she gets
yeah im about as country as she gets
see joe nichols liveget tickets as low as 57you might also liketag
she hates goin anywhere in my old truckembed"
