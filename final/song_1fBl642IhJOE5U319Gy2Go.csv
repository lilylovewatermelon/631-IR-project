here we go again
i kinda wanna be more than friends
so take it easy on me
im afraid youre never satisfied

verse 2
here we go again
were sick like animals we play pretend
youre just a cannibal
and im afraid i wont get out alive
no i wont sleep tonight

chorus
ohoh i want some more
ohoh what are you waiting for
take a bite of my heart tonight
ohoh i want some more
ohoh what are you waiting for
what are you waiting for
say goodbye to my heart tonight

verse 2
here we are again
i feel the chemicals kickin in
its getting heavy and i wanna run and hide
i wanna run and hide
i do it every time
youre killin me now
and i wont be denied by you
the animal inside of you
