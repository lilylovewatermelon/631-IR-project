please understand im just a fan
and god it sounds bad when i put it like that
reach in my chest and do your best
to locate a heart in this pitiful mess

chorus
lettering in bold on a bloodstained note
im just a lonely soul
everybody knows when you suck it shows
and thats just how it goes
but im lucky to be here
cause i know its good
that we fit just like we should

verse 2
i guess that im the suffering kind
scaring away anyone who might find
one rotten piece not often seen
locked in a van and unable to scream

chorus
lettering in bold on a bloodstained note
my love is not a joke
everybody knows when you suck it shows
and thats just how it goes
but im lucky to be here
cause i know its good
that we fit just like we should
you might also likeoutro
nothing much has come from simple guys like me
and i am not the type who likes to brag
but if this world could ever separate you and me
id miss you eternally10embed"
