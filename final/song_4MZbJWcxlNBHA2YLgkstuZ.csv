i wish that my grandad was still here today
cause id love to hear what hed have to say
about three dollars and fiftynine cents for a gallon of gas
and id show him my wife and what ive done with my life
and see if he liked all these songs that i write
oh i wish i knew what he would think about the fact that
if youre sixteen and pregnant youll get on tv
but yet were laying off school teachers fast as can be
oh i wish i knew what hed think about us now

chorus
hed probably ask me why the good ol usofa
is so damn tied up in our foreign aid
when the american farmers got to sell all the cows
to keep the bank from taking the house
i wish i could write him in on my ballot for the next president cause theres men like john wayne augustus mccrae
the lone ranger and his indian friend
but there will never be another man like him

verse 2
im glad that im not some big hollywood star
who thinks they have the right to go as far
as bitching about the hundred million dollars they make a year cause theres scars on my knuckles and sweat on my brow
and i know that grandpa hed sure be proud
of my little part that ive made to our family tree
hed probably ask me why
people like casey anthony can get off scotfree
and why our taxes are still killing folks just like you and me
oh i wish i knew what hed think about us now
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likechorus
hed probably ask me why the good ol usofa
is so damn tied up in our foreign aid
when the american farmers got to sell all the cows
to keep the bank from taking the house
i wish i could write him in on my ballot for the next president cause theres men like john wayne augustus mccrae
the lone ranger and his indian friend
but there will never be another man like him
yeah theres men like john wayne augustus mccrae
the lone ranger and his indian friend
but there will never be another man like himembed"
