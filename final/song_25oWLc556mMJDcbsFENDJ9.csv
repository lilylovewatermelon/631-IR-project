you dont walk through that door
without landing your lips on mine
aint just there when its easy
youre there all the time

prechorus
living to the rhythm of your heartbeat
beats everything ive ever felt
yeah i know that i got it good
and so would everybody else

chorus
if love had a hall of fame
for a summer kiss in the rain
for making me wanna stay wrapped in your arms all night all day
for the way you look at me
it should all go down in history
theyd hang your picture on the wall and write your name
if love had a hall of fame ooh ooh ooh
if love had a hall of fame mmm ooh ooh ooh

verse 2
youd be up there on that stage
shining brighter than them lights
and id be out there in the crowd
telling everybody that youre mine

if love had a hall of fame
for a summer kiss in the rain
for making me wanna stay wrapped in your arms all night all day
for the way you look at me

theyd hang your picture on the wall and write your name
if love had a hall of fame ooh ooh ooh
if love had a hall of fame mmm ooh ooh ooh

bridge
you try to tell me youre the one thats lucky
that theres nothing bout me you would ever change
but if everyone could see the man that i see
the whole world would know your name mmm

chorus
if love had a hall of fame
baby youd be up there with the greats
for making me wanna stay wrapped in your arms all night all day
for the way you look at me
it should all go down in history
theyd hang your picture on the wall and write your name
if love had a hall of fame ooh ooh ooh
