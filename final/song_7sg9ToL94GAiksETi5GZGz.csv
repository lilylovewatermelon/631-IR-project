verse 1
clarity is a state of mind
freedom aint real whos sold you that lie
i aint buying it
no matter what the price one more time im sorry
so give it up give it up mama
undo your pants and your bra
i see you liking that you must need a slice
type a personality
extrovert introvert commonalities
a type a personality
just dumb enough to lie to me

chorus
you are you are you are you are
you are you are you are you are we are
you are you are you are you are we are
you are you are you are you are

verse 2
superficial superwoman
aint you tired of that wind in your face
your skin taste likes brussell sprouts i swear
cant seem to remember your face
so give it up give it up papa
make it make sense to me
i can not go any further
than 2 steps infront of me im lost here
