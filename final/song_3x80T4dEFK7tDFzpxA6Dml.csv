shadows fill an empty heart
as love is fading
from all the things that we are
and are not saying
can we see beyond the scars
and make it to the dawn

verse 2
change the colors of the sky
and open up to
the ways you made me feel alive
the ways i loved you
for all the things that never died
to make it through the night
love will find you

chorus
what about now what about today
what if youre makin me all that i was meant to be
what if our love never went away
what if its lost behind words we could never find
baby before its too late
what about now

verse 3
the sun is breakin in your eyes
to start a new day
this broken heart can still survive
with a touch of your grace
as shadows fade into the light
i am by your side
where love will find you
