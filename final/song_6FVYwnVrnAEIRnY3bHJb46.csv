this shining city built of gold
a far cry from innocence
theres more than meets the eye round here
look to the waters of the deep

a city of evil

there sat a sevenheaded beast
ten horns raised from his head
symbolic woman sits on his throne
but hatred strips her and leaves her naked
the beast and the harlot

chorus
shes a dwelling place for demons
shes a cage for every unclean spirit every filthy bird
and makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great

verse 2
the city dressed in jewels and gold
fine linen myrrh and pearls
her plagues will come all at once
as her mourners watch her burn
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likedestroyed in an hour
merchants and captains of the world sailors navigators too
will weep and mourn this loss
with her sins piled to the sky
the beast and the harlot

chorus
shes a dwelling place for demons
shes a cage for every unclean spirit every filthy bird
and makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great

bridge
the day has come for all us sinners
if youre not a servant youll be struck to the ground
flee the burning greedy city
looking back on her to see theres nothing around

i dont believe in fairy tales and no one wants to go to hell
youve made the wrong decision and its easy to see
now if you wanna serve above or be a king below with us
youre welcome to the city where your future is set forever

chorus
shes a dwelling place for demons
shes a cage for every unclean spirit every filthy bird
and makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great
chorus
shes a dwelling place for demons
shes a cage for every unclean spirit every filthy bird
and makes us drink the poisoned wine to fornicating with our kings
fallen now is babylon the great19embed"
