you can only move as fast as
whos in front of you
and if you assume
just like them
what good will it do
so find out for yourself
so your ignorance
will stop bleeding through

prechorus
you can breathe today

chorus
so many lies swirling
all around you
youre suffocating
the empty shape in you
steals your breath
youre suffocating

verse 2
logic forces me to believe in this
and i have learned to see
and i can only say what ive seen and heard
and only you can choose
and every choice you make will affect you
suit your own self
