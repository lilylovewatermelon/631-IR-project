when the speed kicks in
i go to the store for nothing
and walk right by
the house where you lived with snow white
i wonder if she ever thought
the storybook tiles on the roof were too much
but from the window its not a bad show
if your favorite things dianetics or stucco

prechorus
the drugstores are open all night
the only real reason i moved to the east side
i love a good place to hide in plain sight

chorus
what if i told you
i feel like i know you
but we never met

verse 2
and here everyone knows youre the way to my heart
hear so many stories of you at the bar
most times alone and some looking your worst
but never not sweet to the trust funds and punishers
you might also likeprechorus
man i wish that i could say the same
i swear im not angry thats just my face
a copycat killer with a chemical cut
either im careless or i wanna get caught
who im not

chorus
what if i told you
i feel like i know you
but we never met
its for the best

outro
i cant open my mouth and forget how to talk
cause even if i could
wouldnt know where to start
wouldnt know when to stop19embed"
