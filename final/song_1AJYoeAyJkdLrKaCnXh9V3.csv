a brave new world rising
i i cant believe my eyes
weve fallen down
were blinded by dark skies
its in the way we all exploit the weak
the justice that we seek
accept the truth to be free

verse 2
times have changed
dont let fate remain the same

prechorus
life so fleeting ah

chorus
the futures ours to take when we doubt everything
no no turning back now
now find find your own path
but dont dont give in to wrath
ahyou might also likeembed"
