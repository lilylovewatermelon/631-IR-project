verse 1
you wont believe what i tell you
white coats and clever minds will choose
you get a lot from this loose tongue and arrogance
its not appropriate dont think that this is it

chorus
now i can talk no one gets off
i know how youd like to
now i can talk no one gets off
now i can talk no one gets off
i know how youd like to
now i can talk no one gets off

verse 2
a longer sentence brings no more
than one that i had said before
its hard to compromise when i see through your eyes
its just a common view i guess its lost on you
