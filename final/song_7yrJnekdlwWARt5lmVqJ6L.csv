watchin cigarettes burn out
til all the neon gets turned out
i was so on fire for you it hurts how
fast a cigarette can burn out

verse 1
just watchin rivers run
down the side of my bottle
almost like its cryin my tears
had the world on a string
and then i lost everything
and thats how i wound up here

chorus
watchin cigarettes burn out
til all the neon gets turned out
theres nothing left but empty glasses now
its all flashes now
smokin memory that aint nothin but ashes
in the low lights
these donemewrong songs hit me so right
i was so on fire for you it hurts how
fast a cigarette can burn out

verse 2
if you put your hands on the flame
youve got no right to complain
cause you know its gonna leave a mark
when the glow comes to an end
like scattered embers in the wind
leaves you lookin for a brand new spark
watchin cigarettes burn out
see midland liveget tickets as low as 58you might also likebridge
now with every hit
im gonna quit
but who am i kiddin
i just cant put you down
so i keep hangin around

chorus
watchin cigarettes burn out
til all the neon gets turned out
theres nothing left but empty glasses now
its all flashes now
smokin memory that aint nothin but ashes
in the low lights
these donemewrong songs hit me so right
i was so on fire for you it hurts how
fast a cigarette can burn out
i was so on fire for you it hurts how
fast a cigarette can burn outembed"
