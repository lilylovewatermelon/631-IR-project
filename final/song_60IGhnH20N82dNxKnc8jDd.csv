going to put the the world away for a minute
pretend i dont live in it
sunshine going to wash my blues away
had sweet love but i lost it
she got too close so i fought it
now im lost in the world trying to find me a better way

chorus
wishing i was knee deep in the water somewhere
got the blue sky breeze and it dont seem fair
only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
sunrise theres a fire in the sky
never been so happy
never felt so high
and i think i might have found me my own kind of paradise

verse 2 jimmy buffett
wrote a note said be back in a minute
bought a boat and i sailed off in it
dont think anybodys going to miss me anyway
mind on a permanent vacation
the ocean is my only medication
wishing my condition aint ever going to go away

chorus
now im knee deep in the water somewhere
got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
sunrise theres a fire in the sky
never been so happy
never felt so high
and i think i might have found me my own kind of paradise
see zac brown band liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likebridge
this champagne shore washing over me
its a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
one day you could be as lost as me
change your geography
maybe you might be

chorus
knee deep in the water somewhere
got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
sunrise theres a fire in the sky
never been so happy
never felt so high
and i think i might have found me my own kind of paradise

outro
come on in the waters nice
find yourself a little slice
grab a back pack it light
you never know until you try
when you lose yourself
you find the key to paradise10embed"
