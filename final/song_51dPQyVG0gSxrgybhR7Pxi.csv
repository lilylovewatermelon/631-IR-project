uh take a vivid picture no photos
implement that shit into your mind just so you know though
sucker free living ima say that thats the motto
so for any nigga on that sucker shit im no ho bro
might just have to drop a bomb han solo
got me bickin back being bool quasimoto
all about my paper gotta get my fucking dough ho
always on the fucking gogo you a bitch like tony romo
niggas came around now they extinct like dodos
meanwhile im in new york fucking up soho
just bagged a new chick caroline nickname coco
took her to the telly now lil baby going loco
she just give me face aint no fucking thats a nono
and she going thirty early dirty no soap though
i laugh at the haters everything they say a joke though
and im screaming fuck 12 all these foul ass popo yeah uh
chorus
but nowadays i really miss my fucking idols so thats the title
i grab a bible pray for my rivals
dead on arrival i swear this shit to me like a cycle
bodies in piles blood rivers resemble niles
they need survival they need to rehearse a recital
i just sit back and listen to old wayne songs
and get dome from a bitch while i brainstorm
and spit flames while also making it rain storm
see trippie redd liveget tickets as low as 61you might also likeverse 2
you see i cant ignore it
and you niggas dont see its in your brain to snore
and you sleep on me until you cant no more
and dont fake on me and try to play the boy
i dont know why i feel like nobody loves me
or why they feel like my intentions something ugly
or why i feel like everyone needs something from me
or why i feel like everyone just saying fuck me
or why i feel like the opposition gon buss me
if i gave you my heart would you still love me
lately baby i feel like nobody trust me
is it just me
haha yeah hold up

chorus
but nowadays i really miss my fucking idols so thats the title
i grab a bible pray for my rivals
dead on arrival i swear this shit to me like a cycle
bodies in piles blood rivers resemble niles
they need survival they need to rehearse a recital
i just sit back and listen to old wayne songs
and get dome from a bitch while i brainstorm
and spit flames while also making it rain storm13embed"
