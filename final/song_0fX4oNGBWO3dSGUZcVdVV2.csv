verse 1
take off the foofoo take off the clout chase take off the wifi
take off the money phone take off the car loan take off the flex and the white lies
take off the weirdass jewelry ima take ten steps then im taking off top five
take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes its a real world outside take that shit off
take off your idols take off the runway i take off to cairo take that shit off
take off to sainttropez fiveday stay take a quarter mill hell if i know take that shit off
take off the front flag take off perception take off the cop with the eye patch take that shit off
take off the unloyal take off the unsure take off decisions i lack take it off
take off the fake deep take off the fake woke take off the im broke i care take it off
take off the gossip take off the new logic that if im rich im rare take it off
take off the chanel take off the dolce take off the birkin bag
