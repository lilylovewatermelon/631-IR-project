verse 1
i cant believe its over
i watched the whole thing fall
and i never saw the writing that was on the wall
if id only knew
the days were slipping past
that the good things never last
that you were crying

verse 2
summer turned to winter
and the snow it turned to rain
and the rain turned into tears upon your face
i hardly recognized the girl you are today
and god i hope its not too late
hmmm its not too late

chorus
cause you are not alone
im always there with you
and well get lost together
til the light comes pouring through
cause when you feel like youre done
and the darkness has won
babe youre not lost
when your worlds crashing down
and you cant bear the thought
i said babe youre not lost

life can show no mercy
it can tear your soul apart
it can make you feel like youve gone crazy
but youre not
things have seemed to change
theres one thing thats still the same
in my heart you have remained
and we can fly fly fly away

chorus
cause you are not alone
and i am there with you
and well get lost together
til the light comes pouring through
cause when you feel like youre done
and the darkness has won
babe youre not lost
when the worlds crashing down
and you can not bear to crawl
i said baby youre not lost

outro
yeah yeah yeah yeah
i said baby youre not lost
i said baby youre not lost
oh yeah yeah
i said baby youre not lost1embed"
