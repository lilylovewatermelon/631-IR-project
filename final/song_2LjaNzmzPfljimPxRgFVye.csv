verse 1 chester bennington  mike shinoda
you say youre not gonna fight cause no one will fight for you
and you think theres not enough love and no one to give it to
and youre sure youve hurt for so long youve got nothing left to lose
so you say youre not gonna fight cause no one will fight for you

verse 2 chester bennington  mike shinoda
you say the weight of the world has kept you from letting go oohoohoohoohooh
and you think compassions a flaw and youll never let it show oohoohoohoohooh
and youre sure youve hurt in a way that no one will ever know oohoohoohoohooh
but someday the weight of the world will give you the strength to go oohoohoohoohooh
