they roll the sidewalks in this town all up after the sun goes down
they say nothin good happens here when midnight rolls around
but layin down would be in vain i cant sleep with you on my brain
and i aint anywhere close to tired
your kiss has got me wired

chorus
girl you got the beat right killin in your levis
high on your love has got me buzzin like a streetlight
its still early out in cali baby dont you wanna rally again
well find a road with no name lay back in the slow lane
the sky is dropping jupiter around us like some old train
well be rolling down the windows i bet you were catchin our second wind
we dont have to go home we can leave the night on
we can leave the night on

verse 2
now all the stars are turnin blue just kissed the clock 222
baby i know what youre wishin for im wishin for it too
now all the lights are flashin gold nobody cares how fast we go
our soundtracks in the stereo
the djs on a roll

chorus
girl you got the beat right killin in your levis
high on your love has got me buzzin like a streetlight
its still early out in cali baby dont you wanna rally again
well find a road with no name lay back in the slow lane
the sky is dropping jupiter around us like some old train
well be rolling down the windows i bet you were catchin our second wind
we dont have to go home we can leave the night on
we can leave the night on

chorus 2
girl you got the beat right killin in your levis
high on your love has got me buzzin like a streetlight
its still early out in cali baby dont you wanna rally
well find a road with no name lay back in the slow lane
the sky is dropping jupiter all around us like some old train
well be rolling down the windows i bet you were catchin our second wind
we dont have to go home we can leave the night on
we can leave the night on
we can leave the night on
