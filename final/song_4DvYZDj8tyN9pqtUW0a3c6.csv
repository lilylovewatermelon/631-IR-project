chorus danny
shut your eyes let darkness lead the fight say goodnight
the rest will watch their future die buried alive say goodnight
its time to let now the dead dead come alive
we wave the flag for the rest of our lives
so shut your eyes let darkness lead the fight
say goodnight say goodnight

verse 2 jdog
you know its hard to breathe with the knife up to your throat
and its impossible to see down the barrel of smoke
and now youre starting to choke you hope its all in your mind
its time to hit the deck like its a fucking driveby
it aint possible to manage all the carnage and the damage
and an animal like me can use it all to my advantage
youre the first to hit the floor cause you know that we stay lit
were kicking in your door cause we aint nothing to fuck with
youre the first to hit the floor cause you know that we stay lit
were kicking in your door cause we aint nothing to fuck with
