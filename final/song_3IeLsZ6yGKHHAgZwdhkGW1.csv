with a tent a coleman and sleeping bags
some fishing poles a cooler of cokes
three days before we had to be back

when youre seven youre in seventh heaven
when youre going camping in the wild outdoors
as we turned up on that old dirt road
he looked at me and swore

dad this could be the best day of my life
ive been dreaming day and night about the fun weve had
just me and you doing what ive always wanted to
im the luckiest boy alive
this is the best day of my life

his fifteenth birthday rolled around
classic cars were his thing
when i pulled in the drive with that old vette
i thought that boy would go in sane

when youre in your teens
your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
you worked nights on end
till it was new again
and as he sat behind the wheel

this could be the best day of my life
ive been dreaming day and night
about the fun weve had
just me and you
doing what ive always wanted to
im the luckiest boy alive
this is the best day of my life

standing in a little room
back of the church with our tuxes on
looking at him i say i cant believe son that youre grown

he said dad
this could be the best day of my life
ive been dreaming day and night
of being like you
now its me and her
watching you and mom ive learned
im the luckiest man alive
this is the best day of my life

im the luckiest man alive
this is the best day of my lifeembed"
