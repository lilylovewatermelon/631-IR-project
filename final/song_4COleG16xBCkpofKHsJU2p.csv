she said she needed a break
a little time to think
but then she went to cleveland with some guy named leland
that she met at the bank
theres nothing wrong with ohio
except the snow and the rain
i really like drew carey and id love to see
the rock n roll hall of fame

prechorus
so when youre done doing whatever
and when youre through doing whoever
you know denton county will be right here waiting for you

chorus
come back to texas
its just not the same since you went away
before you lose your accent
and forget all about the lone star state
theres a seat for you at the rodeo
and ive got every slow dance saved
besides the mexican food sucks north of here anyway

verse 2
i think i made a mistake
its not that easy to take
she went to make a deposit then she cleaned out her closet
guess ill sit here and wait
for her to come back home i wish shed come back home
it shouldnt take very long so long so long
i bet she misses the sunrise and mrs bairds fruit pies
but i could be wrong
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likeprechorus
so when youre done doing whatever
and when youre through doing whoever
you know denton county will be right here waiting for you

chorus
come back to texas
its just not the same since you went away
i bet you missed your exit
and drove right on through the lone star state
theres a seat for you at the rodeo
and ive got every slow dance saved
besides the mexican food sucks north of here anyway

bridge
troy aikman wants you back
willie nelson wants you back
nasa wants you back
and the bush twins want you back
pantera wants you back
and blue bell wants you back
i got a premonition im taking a petition
and the whole states gonna sign

chorus
come back to texas
its just not the same since you went away
before you lose your accent
and forget all about the lone star state
theres a seat for you at the rodeo
and ive got every slow dance saved
chorus
come back to texas
