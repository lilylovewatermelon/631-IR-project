was an honest man
asked me for the phone
tried to take control

refrain
oh i dont see it that way
i dont see it that way

verse 2
we shared some ideas
all obsessed with fame
says were all the same

refrain
oh i dont see it that way
i dont see it that way

prechorus
raised in carolina
im not like that
tryin to remind her
when we go back

chorus
i missed the last bus ill take the next train
ill try but you see its hard to explain
i say the right thing but act the wrong way
i like it right here but i cannot stay
i watch the tv forget what im told
well i am too young and they are too old
the joke is on you this place is a zoo
youre right its true
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likeverse 3
he says he cant decide
i shake my head to say
everythings just great

refrain
oh i just cant remember
i just cant remember

prechorus
raised in carolina
she says im not like that
tryin to remind her
when we go back

chorus
i say the right thing but act the wrong way
i like it right here but i cannot stay
i watch the tv forget what im told
well i am too young and they are too old
oh man cant you see im nervous so please

i missed the last bus well take the next train
ill try but you see its hard to explain51embed"
