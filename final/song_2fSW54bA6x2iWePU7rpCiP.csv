verse 1
one hundred and fortyfive days im counting
tryna hold on but the time goes slowly
two hundred and twentyfive ice cold showers
hurricane hit my cell aint get no power
tryna walk a narrow straight path is a battle
kinda hard to walk when youre chained in shackles
my soul bleeds through these four walls
my heart aches after phone calls

i just caught some time ill be home soon
it wont be long i promise
i will be okay just wipe those
tears off of your face im sorry
i wont right my wrongs im guilty

cold shower cold slab cold food cold bath

chorus
mama please dont you cry im sorry
