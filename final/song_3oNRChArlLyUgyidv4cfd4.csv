catch me ridin slidin in east memphis smokin on some butter mane
call up ta double dolla for the fucking gasoline
elvis presley boulevard we swangin on em hard
hangin out the chevy screaming motherfuck the law

verse 2 yung mutt
pull up and we park in the parking lot of walmart
just so i can maybe snatch a shady grey tee
fuck a shopping cart
put that bitch on walk back to the car
heartbeat pacing never racing
fuck a security guard
yeah my paper so thin i aint got no tree shading me

verse 3 yung christ
i got that 1080p only smoking og
i be that junkie motherfucker with that dope up in me
the almighty 59
beelzebub of my time
cabin fever runnin high from snorting back to back lines

verse 4 yung mutt
sun shinin brightlyâ€”wait thats just the weed im lighting
ta askin if the blunt needs tightening
v8 spilling might be blood
im killing bugs im swatting flies
all you gnats tryna flock to my eyes
your size is compromised from tryna fly
sick of this all of these icarus wannabes
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeoutro ghost
