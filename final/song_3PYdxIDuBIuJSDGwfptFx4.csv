im so tired of being here
suppressed by all my childish fears
and if you have to leave
i wish that you would just leave
your presence still lingers here
and it wont leave me alone

prechorus
these wounds wont seem to heal
this pain is just too real
theres just too much that time cannot erase

chorus
when you cried id wipe away all of your tears
when youd scream id fight away all of your fears
and i held your hand through all of these years
but you still have all of me

verse 2
you used to captivate me by your resonating light
and now im bound by the life you left behind
your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams
your voice it chased away all the sanity in me

prechorus
these wounds wont seem to heal
this pain is just too real
theres just too much that time cannot erase
