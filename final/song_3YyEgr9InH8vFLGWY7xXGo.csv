i got a gal in cedartown georgia
i used to have to walk nearly three miles to court her
she never had much just a sharecroppers daughter
but i married her and took her down to new orleans
bought a little house in the south french quarter
got a job hooking bales loading them on a steamboat
i give her seven days pay next day im broke
when she aint a sleeping all day shes a primping
every evening when the sun goes down
she starts a swarming on orleans town
walking into work this morning at daybreak
i caught her with the tall long dandy from canebreak
she walked right by me and she looked right through me
i made up my mind what im a gonna do
eased in the pawnshop and bought a 22
watched as the roomclerk gave them a room key
standing outside i could read room 23
tonight ill put her on a train for georgia
gonna be a lotta kin folks squalling and a grieving
cause that cedartown gal aint breathingyou might also likeembed"
