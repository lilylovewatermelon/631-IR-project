one question what cant be done
you tear me down with the same thing
theres nothing the end its begun
what can you do when it all drains

prechorus
down there you go always
see if i care fading
down dont you know where ill be
cause im here on my own

chorus
waiting when im waiting
dont you know ive been here before
and i dont care where im going
so ill stay

verse 2
when you walk dont leave a note
just put your hands on the back door
when you talk its just a joke
just know i cant take it anymore

prechorus
down there you go always
see if i care fading
down dont you know where ill be
cause im here on my own

waiting when im waiting
dont you know ive been here before

waiting when im waiting
dont you know
ill tell you once more
that as long as youre gone
then ill stay

bridge
outside theres no place i can hide
and youre dead of time is anything alright
when the wind tries the storm wont subside
youll be outside and im in here and ill call

chorus
waiting when im waiting
dont you know ive been here before
and i dont care where im going
so ill be waiting when im waiting
dont you know ill tell you once more
that as long as youre gone
then ill stay
outro
then ill stay
i missed it
and youll go
then ill stay stay1embed"
