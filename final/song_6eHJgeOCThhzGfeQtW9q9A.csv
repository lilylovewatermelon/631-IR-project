this is the point of no return
cause this is where we crash and burn
and now every time i face this pain
i can hear it coming back again
its the sound of letting go

chorus
its the sound of letting go
its the sound of letting go

breaking up and breaking down
this is what weve come to now
whats the use we cant deny
cant you hear it
its the sound of letting go

verse 3
we could go around all day
fine excuses we can say
in the silence i can hear
cant you feel it
its the sound of letting go
