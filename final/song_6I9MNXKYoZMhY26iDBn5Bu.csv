i got too high on the couch last sunday
she said it was fine
you worked hard all week and deserve you a little time
and this one she dont want money but she wants the stars
so tonight im takin her out and were gettin ours

chorus
so come on get in baby wont you try me
ive got your favorite song mixed in with the high beams
if we dont go right now well never knowooh
so come on get in lets see how far this goes

verse 2
youll burn down this city with a classy little smile
but ill swear i like ya better when youre dancin undеr lights in the hall
youre as kind as the mornin givin all things light
and thеres some high beams mixin with your favorite song drivin tonight

chorus
so come on get in baby wont you try me
ive got your favorite song mixed in with the high beams
if we dont go right now well never knowooh
so come on get in lets see how far this goes
