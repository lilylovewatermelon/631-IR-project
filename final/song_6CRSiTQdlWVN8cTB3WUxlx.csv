who should i be
whether i am good or bad should lead us both to be
so i pray for the rain
and if i had her every day id still praise her the same

all it takes is the moonlight and as long as the weathers fair
reacts through a river romance by the evening air
a fragrance on her flesh this is who she is dont apologize
you are to awe but youll only have to be beautiful in the beholders eye

hook
wonderful wildflower
open up let me see
sexy is in seaaaason
share your sunshine with meeee

ceelo green
the picture is perfect a keepsake cause the occasions rare
its poetry in motion im just proud to say that i was there
to pull her out of the ground standin out in the crowd oh my how shes grown
hold her with both my hands and put her right on the table when i get her home
