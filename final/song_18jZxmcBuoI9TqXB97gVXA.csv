sometimes you need a reason
a bit of love you can believe in
a little hug a little daydreaming
apparently theres some correlation
between hearts and outer space and
all im really trying to say is

prechorus 1
that im just a sagittarius
and were kind of spontaneous
so lets head out to vegas
and find an elvis to marry us
dont try to argue with the moon

chorus
we can blame it on the stars
oh come on let your heart just breathe
stars oh come on let your guard down and
we can blame it on the stars

verse 2
we like to think that were waiting
on a previous reservation
its all written in the constellations
now i dont know but neither do you
truth is its a good excuse
for both our hearts to let loose
you might also likeprechorus 2
and i know that youre a cancer
which means you like holding hands
so show me how to do this dance and
spin me like a ceiling fan oh
dont try to argue with the moon

chorus
we can blame it on the stars
oh come on let your heart just breathe
stars oh come on let your guard down and
we can blame it on the stars

bridge
i read your horoscope and baby you should know
just what your future holds
let your hips move let my fingers find you
wrap my arms around you here we go
stars oh come on let your heart just breathe
the stars the stars stars

chorus
we can blame it on the stars
oh come on let your heart just breathe
stars oh come on let your guard down and
we can blame it on the stars1embed"
