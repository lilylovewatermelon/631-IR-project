the poor stays poor the rich get richer
it’s just so disproportionate
get outta here

chorus claret jai
sometimes life seems so unfortunate
thats why i dont give a shit ohohohoh
the poor stay poor the rich get richer ohoh
its just so disproportionate ahah
you dont know just what i go through
thats why i would rather show you
just how far that i can take it every rule im breakin it

verse 1 eminem
terrible but not ripable invincible i hung invisible
fuckin mistletoe over the world i stuck my ass up under it
now pucker up them lips and kiss it hoes kiss
here we go bad and evil so you know how thisll go
the competitions miserable we stomp them bitches this is no
joke goin overboard like someone threw us off the boat
choke cough cough from all the smoke im tryna stay on fire
so you know if i hate fucking water sprinklers i dont love the hose oh
someone let the cat out the bag now its time to stuff its face
baggin that bitch smother that little motherfucker til it suffocates who
you had long enough of a wait why are they
tryin to be so secretive bad and evil is reunited hey
came back to annihilate the games in dire straights as i await
word on satan is i drop fall on my knees before this
ouija board and i pray now i lay me down to sleep
i do this shit in my sleep i’m sleepin now imagine if i awake
im champ bitch ill never taste the canvas
could never be no damn wuss or pussy
never mushy so you cant squish
nowhere near a tush in fact if i jump out a bush
in a sneak attacks the only way ill say i am bush
outlandish these words are weapons that i brandish
standoffish to hoes keep your hands off this
cant top it so what the fuck would i sugarcoat it for
law fuck protocol id holla at this ho but now my throat is sore

verse 2 royce da 5’9”
baby im lawless you couldnt burn me if you threw acid on me
im at ya homie im at your home ready to spray you
while you nappin homie have everything on and around
your mattress lookin like the word in front of a matrimony
you high thug yeah go head jump no matter how high you get
you gon come up short like spud webb
my duis get waived like sayin bye
still ridin with no ls like james todd cant change i
i thank god for my safe thinkin last time i was safe thinkin
me and my niggas was doin a bank job
i stay violent yall go the peace route
you got a mouth like kanye
ill knock your whole bottom row of teeth out
no disrespect to mr west shit im just nice with mine
and this just rap im just like ricky hatton i just like the line
these weak rappers want to set us up they never tough
they ask me for a hook i tell em left or right head or gut gut
what yall messin with is a nigga thatll leave you fubar
fucked up beyond all recognition
yall are rock stars im the opposite i could just
throw a rock and hit a star for the fuck of it for the fuck
partner you not hard i body your hot bars
beef is left you pray right like allahu akbar
lets go when i leave yall shot you aint gon be on your metro
in a bad area that call dropped call dropped
