it aint new york city
and it ain’t la
we aint got no rooftop bars
like they do on broadway

prechorus
its just a little town square middle of nowhere
ain’t even big enough to be a map dot
we aint got a lot but we sure do a lot
with the little bit that we got

chorus
we got a little somethinsomethin we can throw on ice
find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moons up high
with your girl and your boys by a fire making noise
in a field on a friday night
we got some george strait songs that we turn up loud
livin it up til the sun comes back around
who said theres nothing to do
who said there’s nothing to do
who said there’s nothing to do
in this nothingtodo town

verse 2
yeah our way of living no it aint complicated
don’t knock it til you try it yeah you might not hate it
around here we work and we play cuss and we pray
and at the end of a long hard day
see dylan scott liveget tickets as low as 28you might also likechorus
we got a little somethinsomethin we can throw on ice
find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moon’s up high
with your girl and your boys by a fire making noise
in a field on a friday night
we got some brooks  dunn songs that we turn up loud
livin it up til the sun comes back around
who said theres nothing to do
who said theres nothing to do
who said theres nothing to do
in this nothingtodo town

prechorus
its just a little town square middle of nowhere
aint even big enough to be a map dot
we aint got a lot but we sure do a lot
with the little bit that we got

chorus
we got a little somethinsomethin we can throw on ice
find us somewhere that we can drink it while the moons up high
with your girl and your boys by a fire making noise
in a field on a friday night
we got some tim mcgraw songs that we turn up loud
livin it up til the sun comes back around
who said theres nothing to do
who said theres nothing to do
who said theres nothing to do
in this nothingtodo town

our little nothingtodo townembed"
