hey dj

verse
lady in a glass dress
i can see right through you
you act like you dont want this
but you know that you do
since he broke your heart girl
you say youll never love again
and you wont let it stop girl
but we know in the end

chorus
you still dream dream
you still dream dream
baby i can make your dreams come true
oh oh my lady in a glass dress
ooh oohyou might also like31embed"
