verse 1 justin timberlake
if i wrote you a symphony
just to say how much you mean to me what would you do
if i told you you were beautiful
would you date me on the regular tell me would you
well baby ive been around the world
but i aint seen myself another girl like you
this ring here represents my heart
but theres just one thing i need from you saying i do
because

prehook justin timberlake
i can see us holdin hands
walkin on the beach our toes in the sand
i can see us on the country side
sittin on the grass layin side by side
you can be my baby
let me make you my lady girl you amaze me
aint gotta do nothin crazy

hook justin timberlake  timbaland
see all i want you to do is be my love so dont give away

verse 2 justin timberlake
now if i wrote you a love note
and made you smile at every word i wrote what would you do
would that make you wanna change your scene
and wanna be the one on my team tell me would you

cause girl ive never been more sure that baby its you
this ring here represents my heart
and everything that you been waitin for just say it i do
because

prehook justin timberlake

shawty cool as a fan on the move once again ay
but he still has fans from peru to japan
hey listen baby i dont wanna ruin your plan nah
but if you got a man try to lose him if you can
cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
when they wanna come and kick it with a standup guy
you dont really wanna let the chance go by
cause you aint been seen with a man so fly
and babe with friends so fly i can go fly
private cause i handle my bi
they call me candle guy why
simply cause i am on fire haha
i hate to have to cancel my vacation so you cant deny
im patient but i aint gon try nah
you dont come i aint gon die
hold up what you mean you cant go why why
me and your boyfriend we aint no tie uhuh
you say you wanna kick it when i aint so high man
well baby its obvious that i aint yo guy
i aint gon lie ill fill your space
but forget your face i swear i will
st barts anguilla anywhere i chill nice
just bring with me a pair i will cmon
