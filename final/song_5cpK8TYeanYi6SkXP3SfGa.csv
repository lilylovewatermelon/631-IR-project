well shes just waiting for the summertime when the weathers fine
she could hitch a ride out of town and so far away from that
low down good for nothin
mistakemakin fool with excuses like
baby that was a long time ago
but thats just a euphemism if you want the truth
he was out of control
but a short times a long time when your mind just wont let it go

verse 2
well summer came along and it then was gone and so was she
but not from him because he followed her just to let her know
a dreams a dreams
and all this livins so much harder than it seems
but girl dont let your dreams be dreams
you know this livins not so hard as it seems
dont let your dreams be dreams
your dreams be dreams
