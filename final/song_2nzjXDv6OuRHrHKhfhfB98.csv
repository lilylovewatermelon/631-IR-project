i got the drip catch me duckin
all of these bitches aint fuckin me no
cant hold a conversation with noone but my cousin
he tell me dont worry the money is comin
these bitches is coming
yeah
the only question i got now will i see it before i end up dug in the ground
lay low at the bottom of a tulip bed
they know ruby got a lot of useless thread
cut me open let me rest there aint nothin in my chest
a hollow cage that caused my death
im hauled away just pause my breath

verse 2 yung carecrow
woke up dope sick wit a cut wrist
lil bad bitch saying heres a plot twist
when you cut it you werent even a little pissed
just a grin on your face sayin watch this
now im sittin back thinkin how sick am i
but that went away the moment i got high
im saying now what it do who are you
get the fuck out my living room
get the fuck out my mental too
what bitch you cant hear when i talk to you
now im back to square one with my hand on the gun
mama screamin son dont do itâ€”i love you dont do it dont do it dont do it
i cant help this feelin
dont you see that i need all these prescriptions
this aint no livin
its only a vision of the vicious cycle that is my addictionsee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like91embed"
