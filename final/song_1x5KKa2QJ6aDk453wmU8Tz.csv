any minute the five oclock crowd will be coming
taps will be flowing with beer
the cigarette smoke soon to be rising
and at 530 clancy gets here
she knows all their faces
shes practically raised them
and thats why theyre loyal and true
theyll pay their tabs
and that pays the light bill
and she keeps a glass full of brew

chorus
and the welders and the drivers
and the old nine to fivers
and the regular joes of the world
are singing heres to you clancy
and your neighborhood tavern
pour me another my girl

verse 2
theres a waitress named lilly
shows up at 7
to make sure the service is great
and theres a black dude named elmo
that cooks in the kitchen
burgers and chicken fried stake
here round 9 oclock the band will start playing
and the music will fill up the air
and theyll take a break every 45 minutes
and the jukebox takes over from there

and the welders and the drivers
and the old nine to fivers
and the regular joes of the world
are singing heres to you clancy
and your neighborhood tavern
pour me another my girl

verse 3
its 135 last calls upon us
its time to settle a score
wont you call me a cab and bring me a tab
and while youre at it bring me one more
shes cleaned the last table
and shined up the bar
its late and everyones gone
then shell cock her pistol
and count all her money
and drive that old chrysler back home

chorus
and the welders and the drivers
and the old nine to fivers
and the regular joes of the world
singing heres to you clancy
and your neighborhood tavern
pour me another my girl
outro
have a good night sleep clancy
in your neighborhood tavern
well see you tomorrow my girlembed"
