flames so hot that they turn blue
palms reflecting in your eyes
like an endless summer
thats the way i feel for you
if time stood still id take this moment make it last forever

prechorus
your halos full of fire
im rising up rising up
my hot loves full of fire
loves full of fire
la ah
chorus
baby if you wanna leave come to california
be a freak like me too
screw your anonymity loving me is all you need
to feel like i do
we could slow dance to rock music kiss while we do it
talk til we both turn blue
baby if you wanna leave come to california
be a freak like me too

verse 2
leather black and eyes of blue blue blue blue
sun reflecting in your eyes
like an easy rider

looking back my past
it all seems stranger than a stranger
