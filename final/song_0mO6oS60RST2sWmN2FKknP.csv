just a moment
right before all the song and dance
wasnt brave enough to tell you
but there aint gonna be another chance
its not long until all that i have
and everythings still one more hour
minutes are racing whatever ive done
i did it for love all that i have
i did it for fun one more hour
couldnt get enough all that i have
i did it for fame one more hour
but never for money
not for houses not for her
not for my future children
until now

verse 2
how could i love again
how could i ever ask for more
and to the road ahead
into a life i cant ignore
lose her how could i love again
move on how can i walk this path for sure
lose her with no more time to spare
move on i know the answer more and more

as long as i can long as i can
spend some time alone
as long as i can long as i can
be the man i am

bridge
ooh life is strange
for one more hour
i can rage
for one more hour

chorus
as long as i can lose her as long as i can move on
spend some time alone
as long as i can lose her as long as i can move on
remember who i am
as long as i can lose her as long as i can move on
spend some time alone
as long as i can how could i love again as long as i can
be the man i am

outro
just a minute fella right before you go out there
all your voices said you wouldnt last a minute bare
one more hour and youll know your life is one to share
just a minute baby right before we go from here
all those people said we wouldnt last a minute near
im with you and i could roll into another year
just a minute fella right before you go out there
all your voices said you wouldnt last a minute bare
one more hour and youll know your life is one to share
just a minute baby right before we go from here
all those people said we wouldnt last a minute near
im with you and i could roll into another year
just a minute fella right before you go out there
all your voices said you wouldnt last a minute bare22embed"
