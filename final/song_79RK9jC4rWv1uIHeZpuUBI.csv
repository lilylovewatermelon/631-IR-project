ill make you laugh and tell you things
you start thinking this is more than what it really is
youre beginning to dream and maybe someday
you could be the angel that could make me change
but all i see is a storm that youll get lost in
cause if it feels this good when were just talking

chorus
you should be walking away
walking away
as far as you can go as fast as you can
you dont know it but you ought to be
walking away
walking away
from me baby
instead of trying to save me
you ought to be walking away

verse 2
youre standing there in your party dress
and there aint no doubt about it darling im impressed
but i see you and i know me
id say right now that im the last thing that you need
but girl dont get me wrong id sure love to do this
but somewhere in my heart i know the truth is
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
you ought to be walking away
walking away
as far as you can go as fast as you can
you dont know it but you ought to be
walking away
walking away
from me baby
instead of trying to save me
you ought to be walking away
