today was the worst day i went through hell
i wish i could remove it from my mind
two months away from you but i couldnt tell
i thought that everything was gonna be just fine

prechorus
the postcard that you wrote with a stupid little note
something wasnt quite right about it
it smelt like cheap perfume and it didnt smell like you
there is no way you can get around it
because you wrote

chorus
i wish you were her
you left out the e
you left without me
and now youre somewhere out there with a
bitch slut psychopath
i hate you why are guys so lame
everything i gave you
i want everything back but you

verse 2
my friends tried to tell me all along
that you werent the right one for me
my friends tried to tell me to be strong
i bet you didnt think that i would see

now youre losing me youre losing me now
because you wrote

chorus
i wish you were her
you left out the e
you left without me
and now youre somewhere out there with a
