you put me down a lot
but im giving you my heart
go on take it
please be careful not to break it
just remember its the only one ive got
its the only one ive got

dont break my heart

you make me laugh a lot
and buy me silly things
and id rather be with you than anyone else
but if you make me mad
but if you make me mad
youll wish that you had not
youll wish that you had not

dont break my heart

where are the roses and whispered sighs
where are the compliments and dreaming eyes
it doesnt matter you see
i know you love me
and real basic love never dies
