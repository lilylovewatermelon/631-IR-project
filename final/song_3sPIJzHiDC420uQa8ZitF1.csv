i know youre gonna call me an sob
first class white trash from bfe
i know youre gonna call me every name in the book
whatever makes you feel good
and i know youre gonna call me out of your league
tell all your friends that was a onetime thing
smoke a few smokes drink a few drinks
and really tell em what you think

chorus
youre gonna call me crazy
a lowdown no account fool
and youre gonna say you hate me
girl do what you gotta do
but when youre 2am buzzin late night needin loving
and its lookin like youre leavin lonely
baby we both know youre gonna call me

verse 2
yeah you wish id change and i wish i could
its bad when its bad when its good its good
you love me and hate me and somewhere in between
i know my phones gonna ring

chorus
youre gonna call me crazy
a lowdown no account fool
and youre gonna say you hate me
girl do what you gotta do
but when youre 2am buzzin late night needin loving
and its lookin like youre leavin lonely
baby we both know youre gonna call me

call me rough around the edges
i dont care what you call me

chorus
youre gonna call me crazy
