can you tell im faking it
but i want to be myself
a counterfeit disposition
cant be good for my health
so many different faces
depending on the different phases
my personality changes
im a chameleon
theres more than one dimension
i can fool you and attract attention
camouflage my nature let me demonstrate

chorus
makeups all off
who am i
the magics in the makeup magics in the makeup
who am i

verse 2
if you bore me then im comfortable
if you interest me im scared
my attraction paralyzes me
no courage to show my true colors that exist
but i wanna be the real thing
but if you catch my eye cant be authentic
the ones i loathe are the ones that know me the best
see no doubt liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likechorus
my makeups all off
who am i
the magics in the makeup magics in the makeup
who am i

magics in the makeup
but i wanna be the real thing
but the magics in the makeup
and i wanna be the real thing
