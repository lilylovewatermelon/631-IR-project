between two mountains that claimed some half assed biblical truth cerpin knew better as it had been etchasketched with the branding of a caveat emptor scarlett with with rheumatic shakes cashed beyond mocking belief this one last hit would spin him and wring him through the mud he’d always been denied but this time he didn’t want to wait outside while the party raged on without him

the rail that adorned the top of the bridge pulsated a cape of winced shuton looking cars drove past in amazement “who the fuck was that wing nut doing his trapeze act” thought one commuter as he shot by “ama mira el muchacho va brincar” screamed a thirteen year old girl trying to flag her parents’ attention racing by in a beat up truck filled brink wise with landscape tools a few miles up the street the band played on springs coiled tightly in the tendons of his legs they were ready his tears smoldered into the afternoon air no one could stop this now he wondered in flashback stanzas omitted from this reality his body took form halfmoon die cast on a february dive an emblem for all to see unamused compound of fractures brittely awaiting for the portal to openplummeting in the pupilcraving a mute resolve ”i’ll fucking show them gathered a light wind past his face defecating a verse that sang “yo ya me voy y nadien me recordara” he smiled from his chandelier vantage point inaudible to the ribbon mic tenderness of his naked iris hearing device waiting for the opportunity wilting in sin the cat among the pigeons could now pounce back into the arms of his true family slicing of one last breath sparking diamonds in the headlights forever stained in maroon stamps

cerpin had always been a little overly possessed by his chimerical scribblings between lunch breaks and during class maybe even in his sleep you would find him drawing neocultures diseased and grotesque that was the portal he created getting dirty in the nails small hairs yanked always a canvas moment waiting in the wings this served its purpose well as he was malnourished without the outlet so vividly they spoke to him committed to its paper he never noticed if anyone else could hear them too no matter really because its what they said and how they said it they were infatuated with each other from the get of their disturbance he knocked on doors that everyone else knew had no existence spiral notebooks lending variety in the medium ouija boarded inch by gasp slow motion in their claps center psalm lesions of grandeur inbred petting within bald of point conceived infatuation clad in flat ash waiting to be rejected always waiting to be defective un juramento sin formame escape de las montanias salte veneno scalpula failed to release you could say he was whipped by the argot of his outlet cerpin taxt ever the ardent underdog and of this was born a pig stye pavilion of dribbling hieroglyphics he needed to be needed longing for scores unzipped face deformed expatriate they were meant for each other they defined one another and soon they would be one

wait now hadn’t this all happened before traced back in years recalling the events there was a venom in numerical tries an autocrat in waiting unknown to himself even he started losing grip the sangfroid hunchback that was held together by electric ligature was always finding it harder and harder to stay alive let alone make amends in the eye of his storms this had happened before

on an opaque afternoon fending for himself in the wake of a mistake cerpin was caught on guard in the line of quarrelling fire a closed can of inebriation had found its way between his own crosshairs striking him in the cranium a class of migraine unto itself maybe he had asked for it maybe it was the excuse he needed to traverse the borderland of clairaudient dwellings through aneurysm vespers in the cabinet were the means to smithereens of an aching argument he left the point of impact yeah he left it for broke to medicate his wounds maybe he had made a mistake but mistakes are what his dreams were made of

supple and warm came the covers over his body that handful of morphine his mother left behind when she died sure came in handy this was the hit that marked the beginning in and out of reality for one week on end his residency would live in infamy it was here that they would first make contact with him the autocrat in waiting fighting to stay alive

he had been nominated tagged and placed within the high water flood of twisted necks banging mainline swan dives and cold gizzard to the easing of his confusion we had studied his slithering new fangled strut from abroad true prince among the living dead a wicker at wits end sweltering an oracle of muse stuck upon inoperable amputechture whose flesh wounds felt him thud the ground each time gangs of obstacle contusions buried him zealot deep in stupor with his armor of broken skin he had now become a carcass of caricature immune to the slashing on his right fretted arm mending a hand me down impression dressed in revenant shards one who had drunk with the owls with neuce in left hand showered by lacerations that poured as loud and quick as sand magnet for the wielding of knives with a handless desert of lapwing practicing on his punching bag heart stacked against a tidal wave of formative droves making all his advances imperially morose bodies can only take so much wear and tear before they collapse

now the hurdles they stood in q’s dwarfing one another in size and shape they seemed to throw themselves at his body puncturing with cesspools inseminating a passive aggressive whiteout that lit his hair on rooted nerve ending mala suerte that reduced him to a rubble of incoherent belligerence so as not to add to the demons that leached under his socket of eyes people would walk the other way when they saw him hypnotized his tongue became a cluster of stolen hinges unable to close sentences to decipher riddles imbedded in mud hunted by a bulletin of linguistics playing dead for keeps and its sick to all who couldn’t see how he could float to the brink with pain by his side flirting with the insomnia of daft parasites you could hear him sing in his sleepcon cada cuerpo que estranes mas este varco se olvido como a nadar he had been salvaged almost every other time but this one would brake the foundation that he built from the insideunconventional and undeniable a tremulant megaphone calls

that is until we brimmed the ballots with the grins of bloodlet nominations punctual and factual after all he created us what would we be without our beloved bull legged hex of a leader an empty throne for the tremulant regime was an unfitting glove left with pistol grip persuasion and so our plan unfolded born of hatchet faced spindles a conspiracy that reared its mug shot at the shores of nedra queret a pinched swerve found at the bottom of a manmade throat that was carved into stalactite teeth and bandaged with the charm of taffeta webs to some it was known as the orifice of the underworldstuffed with loons that helped bat cerpins eyes where endorphins made carnage from an insulant pride throughout the years it had become a lair made of murals that drifted out of tar and thin air belched of lab coated meat hooks caught on spinal column thorns found within a planet surrounded by the grave rings of nervosa with its mote floating on an axis suspended in time filled with the remnants of an earth bound portal triangular in scope where defeated cerpin lay growing in some tattered pit of stomach a convalescent home of croaking entrails mangled by the pettiness of insignificant others on this black and white planet roared boils upon its shores nesting bedwetting for our heir to the throne

many a sun did pass before the house of tremula metacarpi was to decide upon a new leader and who better than the aforementioned neo infidel known as cerpin taxt probably the loneliest hull of a man that we tremulants had ever laid eyes on he resided in the manacle sect of mundy one of many small caves that overlooked the shanty town of rezjua engrossed in shadows of curdled blades flashing themselves in the broad daylight piss of kinetic cleansing

with immense fever we handpicked the irradi excerpts from the guilty library of halftruths a book of suspended impact howto manual that taught seduction through the art of suicide chapterless void of crass ultimatums liberally adopting the monthly blood of human conversions it was with the aid of this manual that set the snails into a marmoset of momentum each page wrapped itself around cerpin raping its way into his body for it was by his hand that that we were damned to live in motion sick stills of bone colored paper by his ink cult of prods that begot him his only children yet the ragman of mundy knew nothing of his next to kin the ones he abandoned in a stationary of underwater flu so it had begun with a blunt caress of affection from the cerphim neuralgia who summoned him with a warrant towards the canvas of his face thus administering a morphined carriage of admission the gates of thanos were now spread eagle wide

cerpin mumbles a costpital riddle
they had imagined me as catastrophic felt an anxious excrement scathing directions from inside my rib cage slouched over pointing gums at porcelain aching max occupancy mocking efficiency i’m starting not to feel the left side of my face staring at a field of numb quilted walkers mangled around an ectopic horse feed on mute i’ve painted my limbs with the black of my own ashes can’t see the light switch when the lights were torn off from its canal of wrist cuts can’t feel my way past the obvious must make neck tender adorn it with perforation they had imagined me as beaten and disfigured across a stretched carpet of pink slip deadlines they beckon from a stomach wall lining hung by jurors gaffels at attention

“you have been brought here by way of your own device you stand there drenched in guilt a sentence you can not deny to the outer reaches you will find find bipolar chance you are hereby banished for the crime of attempt aboard the televator hides the esp will take you by the serving of your time” spoke the gentle infant voice of unhydriate purgatory strategist perpetual lepers who protected the checkmates “to draw bedpost sight from deathbed dirt” chanted the lepers with their map fresh out of wrinkles fallen face penance first mosaic intervals jonesing imminent mistakes“followed by the stilting of glass candle lights” they wept“for tunnels will lend you a route of repenting escape” they kept chanting repeating hymns into the esp impure “three cuts into the slattern conscience lurks the altan sarsen elections” intervened the tremulants in a whispering of thought observing the trials from their maddox oracle “dragging a fire under the sheets of sadav commania” rebutted the tremulants unseen to the lepers“where you will reach a fear” continued the lepers “that mirrors a view that is closer than it appears in your sleep where you will find the greatest of all lies the insignificance of others”

and such was their sentence prescription unfilled left clenching in my hand what was it that i had done i could not remember where was i going the lepers had said their piece and all across the the council of unhydriate the eyes had it they prepared my craft in which i was to travel in adorned it with amoebas as a means of autopilot automation for it was reapers who would man the ship fastened on a seat of arachnids that swarmed my face and penetrated my mouth so as to gut me of cabin pressure by the time the spiders had tied my body down i began to feel my eyes secret steam and blood i felt my equilibrium trade places with my lungs my feet became walls my back ruptured open with choirs of latitude flapping wings that had spread an ephemeral rush that began to convert my into a hibernating jet propelled larvae i squirmed into position vomiting rigor mortis settling in and then it happened a grapnel of thick neon quagmire shot open and sank me through the continuum of time and space itself

the lepers had successfully accomplished their task in their punishing of my wayward act from their lodges of sweat sang the gallows birds of unhydriate singing songs of excommunication into a scape of infra recon spectra probation lunged into nightmare inside the esp impure it was the attempt that fell victim to the shackles in this limitless soar voicing the stark plea of “let us nurse this viper in the bosom of your sewers”

“impeso en la sala de tivrones un pais escrito con el noche from the prickpatch of poppy fields exhumed under the tremble of lock and key on this deaf night of crossed eyes donde me perde my first attempt will cripple at the door of atrophy ests son las viajes antes que me fui”  cerpin taxt

inertiatic esp
now i’m lost now i am lost last night i heard lepers flinch like birth defects it’s musk was fecal in origin as the words dribbled off of its chin it said “i’m lost now i am lost” dolls wreck the minced meat of pupils cast in oblong arms length the hooks have been picking their scabs where wolves hide in the company of men it said “i’m lostnow i am lost” are you peaking in the red perforated at the neck what of this mongrel architect a broken arm of sewers set past present and future tense clipside of the pink eyed fountain “now i’m lost now i am lost” it’s been said long time ago you’ll be the first and last to know you’ll never know you’ll never know

his pupils twitched lightly subtle panic aroused in his crystal eyes found himself in a sore of molastic putrescence that covered him entirely it appeared to be a placenta like cocoon that tore itself out of a pore in the cement procured by a heat lamp of dry heaves misplaced in an oil slick of coat hangers that lanced off the beggars torso slit yard with its rusted cars barrel fires and vagrant argot “i too haven’t eaten for days” said the bum clutching warmth by the barrel outside they had seen brighter days minus cutty sark pauses in and out of cells in their empty slit pocket “what of the quarters that house the weary bones of tranquil fatigue where might i find a bed of sand to stake my keep” cerpin asked unable to get a response long pause continued fingers unable to commit to the pointing seasonal winds made amends with the inquiry draining a draft that turned his attention to a dilapidated boxcar swaying shuttering in the dark and empty slit yard the silence grew deafening eye contact impaled on a nail of denial pull up a rail it rumbles with the girth of early bird squeals said one vagrant “ponte trucha” said the other

the jettisoned grounds seemed damp with lethargy crisp with eggshell walks careful not to graze the taste that grew restless mouthing off this sleeping leviathan without question adorned by the heckling winks of the vagrants cerpin made his way to the jaundiced colored boxcar it looked like a prescription bottle filled with tablets of multi colored seagulls trapped inside were the shrieks of lap steel cackles half hearse half tree stump unearthed were heard it sat there maliciously waiting with splintering inner jokes “si no te importa me duermo aqui” coughed cerpin ready to close shop shrinking his styes “three corneas two feet septic skin and gimp swagger” crooned one vagrant “que chingaos quere deser eso” snapped cerpin “you’ll see” he sneered back centrifugally hoarse in premonition “it is the lepers who sing out the sentencing that brought you here as you harbor rabid saunces swimming up the portal of tomorrow’s dead tongues” claimed that thick scented homeless gravel trembling binge tremors

in the distance something drew closer and closer to the slit yard circling around the bed where cerpin taxt laid it replicated prowl cars closing the kill eyebrows perked in wonder yet unconscious and deceitful “i need to sleep off the unease that queses this howling metal buffalo”and as sleep crept in the doors choked closed with a card sharpened crack awaken by shivers and millipede tacks strobe lighting manic submission where murder premeditated as conversation ran on a lynching of phonetic hurdes trampolened by empty streets “que hermoso eres sin tu cara” fisseld the virulent poison panic fetched to a writhingwalls and ceilings made canyons out of my body jagged wood sculpted cuts in all the right places smiling in flesh water burials decapitated shrugs in headless lust isles “how could this happen i’m in a trunk welted by pencors planted as decoys sticky syphillistic up the neck of cranes and nightingale fileswhere i’d sooner drink the poison”paced the voice in his head neck broken of grunts from roller coasted rattles unkept in this new found hostel “what sort of train have i slept in tonight”his mother then held him and said “you have arrived”

pneumonia mosque breath capsizing ditches on a plank epileptic with seizures broke into the cylinder rings now nervosa was set catatonic and spent “tira me a las aranas rompe me el osico di medi me vete ala chingada” i screamed suddenly awakened skidding hollow disorientation left squirming with pulsing rust barter raised the dice of entrails as a white flag yet i had been stapled to the deck of a refuse barge gagging on the fumes of embalming fluids lost in shallow mote pinned down by whom it may concern and there were others squeals for help need not apply for not a soul was heard for miles but how was i too to feel the lathering of conversations past teething of infantile pants clawed fingers scraped against the hush of broken craft under their breath the length of waves untuned scattered helm of safeties perception my ear canals did not lie there was something there baiting me for the instance my designated means kept slamming up against what i made out to be other ships but i really couldn’t tell from my position all i knew was that the impacts occurred every three minutes or so i was shut down by inhalants floating about when i thought to myself “this is fait accompli by the evening” forming incisional tunnel vision where i could only see upwards i began to try to toss and turn so that i could break free from the grip of the staples three inches deep and three inches wide i wasn’t going anywhere

that night as it was permanent night i feel asleep to the rumble hunger unseated in my works passed out from the heat and began hearing the voices again only this time they were left of center in the distance almost talking in their sleep jerked from slumber one of the other ships had rammed my barge tearing my back from the hold of the staples as the small of my back shined popped blisters filled of raw pink skin with my right arm free i gained strength and pulled my upper body from the clench bitten of staples the night breeze scorched the skin of its virgin paper and broke it into a scab colored branding birthmarked to the bone i looked around in utter silence

down below me i could see a black and white sphere sullen and unnerving floating in a graveyard of abandoned submarines that circled the magnificent dot as a ringed mote had i been here before what sort of deja vu was it tricking in my scalp like a picture that i had d r a all this and still not a single person in sight i didn’t know how much longer to take it every breath i took taxed me i slayed meager to the second only had the salt water of the rings to fill my tired body with then i heard them again footsteps belittled by laughter i jumped onto another sub and followed my concrete sense of radar but couldn’t pin point where it was coming from from vessel to vessel until i fell on a apl k19 russian sub it was riddled with pagan alphabet graffiti empty the water began to shiver in a frenzy and before i knew it the whole mote was awash rapid a convulsion storm i hid inside the k19 while a hail outside began to fester thunderous gaps of passages relieved itself from above slinging itself at the water hemorrhaging epical proportions a tell tale noise swore down leveling i saw them all a thresher 593’s skylarking in belly flopped strolls widowmakers a uss waltzer every unliving kind of sub possible through the scope of the k19 with flinches it precipitated a monumental wreckage laying waste to the landfill when the calamity had subsided i ventured outside there it fucking was vessel impaled upon vessel scathing a hue silhouette of rats birthing through mouths tail ribbed insertion of catheter mountains left menstruating on vessel upon vessel diuretic in conception phlegmed of scrap heap clumps overpopulated dysentery spills where had it all come from soaking up the water growing scarcely visible i was able to construct pathways from the debris that littered itself everywhere leapt onto a copper tinted sub given the moniker ectos 333 plucked from seaside same as the others nobody home was i the only one there i glanced to the left and spotted a slogan written on the side of the boat it was a bit undecipherable covered by years of decay weather worn wet and peeling i squatted down for a closer readit said“it is decided that all gods must die so as to maintain social and cosmological order moattilliatta remains merciful and vengeful” i really hadn’t the faintest idea i knew nothing of this superstitious ramble tangent inconsistency perhaps of a populist consensus no comprehension as to why i could even read it seeing as how it was written in a language never seen or heard of before

held my patience for the voices to bubble up again but all grew quietall remained calm strolled along the other subs in search of food blankets anything really must have traveled around in leap years for what seemed like forever the loneliness collected in resin filled corners smeared up and down these ghastly waters a permanence of night can do wonders for the imagination i and didn’t need more of it cramp laked the jostling and brittle coating of my bones sank sicker to a stick made up of mirage bruises clotted myself chewed on my own skin drifting in and out fits of repetition fell drowsy frail and heavy heavy on the eyes heavy on the palms heavy on the concrete heavy towards the light plastering vagueness brushing along swaying immediately i came to finding myself engulfed by the voices verse vacuum i had to make a brake for it i began shoveling across the mourners crimping at the alarms looking for a safe house frantic gibberish spurting inconspiritly swallowing tongue swept for shelter gutted bloated and tired had to find the k19 to hide my hyde from the spare part fallout sure its frame could withstand such a pounding and from the heavens sliced open an entry in the grimacing downpour glistened of hades near its defecation peak i managed to see the winking from afar felt my arms torque forward the stealth of all appendages ran in formation towards primate arching swallowing terrain whole marking my target hurd sprint the photo finish like a motherfuck i’d be damned to get propellered back of my skull spawned sirens at full tilt imminent 30 seconds of mote only one more sub and there she was sight for the sorest of all eyes elbowed out of pivots turned my cranium in a gaulk at the charcoal lit sky taken for granted were the jets summoning from the skies because not only was this place filled with submarinesbut also it layed of transportation scrimmaged of mileage bowing 747’s single engine cesna’s a towing pelt that thwarted a vanished account of junk piles this is where they all came tocrashing all around me cramp struck in arm again phoenix craft and carpel throbs aloud snow lotion stalks my last dash made from a leap of faith lid shut tight at the soles of my feet would i make it this time eyes shut from terror think i lost control of my function pigmented pearl at a harbor padding a cell of my own sat there petrified overhead the collisions as it gashed open the siege of all missing ships safety in numbers in them where i hid the interface wreck sealed shut the entrance of my k19 now the only fucking problem was opening it it rained for three straight hours forming overhead through the scope i observed a layer of dry ice residue made from a dead vessel collage

i made it or had i really claustraphonic circumprison was i running out of air the k19 could no longer reenter the atmosphere in question and with choices guzzled on empty i fell into exhaustion throwing in the towel “ala verga”i whimpered“i’ll just sit here till they rescue me”i kidded myself swaying mental patiently “i’ll just keep tellin myself that i’m ok”“someone willcome” snaped into sobs followed by hysterics maimed with laughter this shit was endless for the pecking i too became a voice in the pond eyes rolled back solitary in confinement unglued in its eternal waltz slowly my being transparent clocked out all that was left was a puddle made of spit heavy on the eyes grew heavy on the eyes

wolfram tarant as i would read on his name tag in peripherals was the name of the infectant md a quacking malpractice advocate whose very name was synonymous with butchery his offices located on the fault lines of the vocifur euphrates entangled itself in a splendorous sedative impunity as it was masked a camouflage of stiple teleferance this worked to his advantage with no outside intervention his services had been requested by the mentiads which was an alias for the tremulants bounty hunters if you will but without surgical skill they could not perform the proper surgery needed on cerpin the task was simple by order of red tezcatlipoca base tendon to the high order of tremula metacarpi unleash the last of the great teraquetzals  spare no bloodfit like glove”

when duty called with bounty and receipt the payment made a mockery as to the relevance of cerpins body wolfram chased around the room fantasies wired his eyes immense and unethical as if consumed by a dictation of good posture and common decency “you will reach the highest peaks of jackal children sacrifice rain fingers down in a bath of blood” he shook with priapic vigor i couldn’t fight it attached to machinery cowardice became shock the good doctor had a healing touch his hands lapped at my wounds for fingers he had none attached to his wrists were the heads of mongrels tearing at my flesh nursing it to wealth no silver scalpels but filthy dogs that winked the stare of exlovers past present and sutured tense “why have you done this to me”“you did this to yourselfbesides it is merely an option” creaked a slovenly grin lip “once you taste it there’s no turning back” i didn’t understand the wingspan of my speech began shrieking cringes “tranquilo escraboso tranquilo” “what choices do you speak of” i demanded “observe restless one observeon your cornea will appear the image of your sworn enemy a bricktank in the final installation of your discontent an obese boar who goes by koral mataxia this foul tempter commissioned by the tremulants will find his holves enjoying the fruits of your endeavors he is to steal your most beloved and you are you are to allow him to do so with little opposition” wolfram seemed to stray “if it wasn’t for him where would tremula be i forsee with pleasurethere must be organization in this chaos do what thou wilt spreads very thinlyour very existence depends on your wrath” i didnt understand “your greatest losses will fan this very flame” fermium waves of cancerous leaches sucked me dry of a fight i did not believe him wolfram began shouting “cursed are the genes of your cathartic existence it was written and so shall it be how perfect your prototype of nihilistic expenditure a true prince among the living dead” my doubts increased with voltage “you can’t turn back you haven’t got the courage” wolfram insisted replacing my arms with wings cast out in this orgy of uncut gordian knots “flooded you will grieve at an institutional romance engulfed in a rage of jealous activity she will evoke your self destruct only after you have struck” he beamed in soapoperative legislation “we will provide you with the gate it is you who has to make the choice i trust my custom job will convince you of your self worthjoin us and leave them all behind can you deny this crown peasant ranting for torture in the fixing of pure decadence”

back in rezjua semantics sanded down the morale at the gathering sympathizers who rallied around cerpins body the amount of morphine that he ingested was enough to appropriate his state further and further to the verge of permanent psychosis the tremulants claimed a forfeiture of propertythat of the temple of his bodystarting with his comprehensionwere they convincing him some prayed some paced some knew that the worst was yet to come messages kept scrawling out of his mouthtempting a belief that everything was alright those closest to him held their breath aa jewel like no other was about to be stolen and of all the treasures they had to pick from theirs it was enough to make you laugh at the defiling martyrdom of a petty catholic guilt he had yet to live his slogan making his way through prune wrinkeld omenshibernating in gums rationed and chattering as was his logic to box your own response what was it that wolfram was foaming at the hands about cerpin came in and out of his sleep his body sat up in the emergency room found elbow deep in the clasp more of his friends gathered fusing a residential vigil praying for his soul he mutated double speak an oar sinking not knowing where it was everyone slouched torn of pale witness to an apparation please come back to us just as he started making out the images he awoke back into the arms of wolfram tarant unable to break the morphine tackle that found him dead asleep the dogs paraded back and forth underneath speaking at his wings cerpins body was now of normal cosmetics no longer a butchers shoptrimmed of fat on the ground no more probing or slicing he felt rested he sat and smiled “where am i”unable to remember the dogs began to speak in unison tones sirens of shriveled mutiny “when will you come convulsing to my basement” dr wolfram tarant

bring me the head of clavietika tres ojos

and this is what her painting said minus rhetorical lapsus scaffolding stunned by images she’d against ash in the gambling sand hypnoquatic trance from the verberateing look submissive to the sound of her painting voice this crippled my tips receptor picking up jammed communicatios but when it came to her slander we just had to implodeeyes first of course flamed the palms shuttered at breakneck teases that was the plan implemented bring her to me as recherche spoke we took orders quite well never questioned the pamphletsmaybe that’s why we gave in so easilyjust never had the fight in us yet we were bred to fight amongst each other like narcs in tattle tale mode “marxanialatecla illuminosasoil qurac guard” i shouted into my talk back pore this was the standard procedure that we followed when calling for back uplike we really needed it “there’ll be a phixia cadre on the horizontal prayer of the magnifying glass in three decibel inclines” said hq back to me “may recherche rest his tired bones” i thoughtspotting this type of blasphemy always meant more phixias would die we were on her fucking ass heat sunk by intuition we were gonna sack her back to the quarac they had ways of muzzling her down but everytime the phixia quarantine managed to get their antler pencors near her she out of death would duplicate instantly clavietikas were always up for the fight and us phixias picked bones for a living our encounters usually ended in an abortive marriage of afterlifethat taunted a punishing blow

something told us that this clavietika was the mother hechicera the one that sheltered ojeno valasofallen ceraphim and creator divine of the opposing side his design was almost flawless he made her with just the right touch she was a double headed mutirandom shaped appendage with lateral appendix impervious to hurt in the elastic form of an astral projected body translucent in her structure deceitful and impregnable with the power of deforming and the stare of defamationcourt jestering suggestive suicidea page torn from irradi exerptas one word and you were dead one drop that made a convincing argueless impressionand you would turn on yourself starting with the eyes of course sowvietna held a counter institutionary liberator in her belly and the clavietika knew she was sweeping dirt in her eyes it was a matter of seconds before we would catch her recherche had no schematics only a starving window pain that throbbed for an end to it all

ojeno valaso and recherche bellicose were at one time inseparable the pettiness of gossip the competitive streaks not even the sharing of lovers could separate them there was a bond sewn together by a phantasmagoric aesthetic los tres ojos to obtain enlightenment ignoring temptations from the left and the right the middle eye focused illuminouslyragman hermit for the studying of survival and dead doll stares the piercing gaze with which to paint your enemy dead funny how history forgets to absolve its captors of their sin the groping handle infixed between a shanking knife held by the both of them forged the land “from ruins to anthills” was heard and with it came the new beginning prosperity inched its way over the sands of sowvietna but like all tell tales the tranquility would come to a swift end in the harvest month of krona twenty years after the sowvietna civil war it all went terribly wrong pallbearing a turn in the sheen highlighting recherches’ twitching eye ojeno would be the first to stab a friend in the back ojeno began noticing the brevity with which he began dealing with others he grew fat with power and as drunk with leisure as any glutten would given the access of total ownership but was sowvietna his ojeno didnt seem to think so members of his cabinet seemed to vanish into the melted paper sand people went missing at an all time highand the streets fell desolate tumbleweed populous unheard in the gasp it was said that to look recherche in the eye was punishable by hanging all holidays were omitted from the calendar uniforms became mandatory loin cloths over black electric tape body suites wrapped to a mummy shape the mother tongue was banned no one was to speak ectal which naturally rolled off the antennas a series of short germanic hand codes equipped with clickhissing and emotionless bravado became mandatory by law vietnic as it was so bitterly installed became the lisp that corrected our roots ectal was tenthousand times more elegant in its long vowels soaring pronunciated submerged tone that mimicked the ocean whales a beauty now long and forgotten it was rumored that recherche with his medically corrected speech impediment in asshole operandi wanted a language that was marked of his inflection and muddy drawl a code of his own doing square wheeled chewing marbles in the mouth sow vietna had made a term for the worst this is why ojeno vowed never again to follow the path they never applied what happened to them recherche began public executions for those un willing to commit to the diet of sowvietna volunteers would be treated more phixiately than those caught running for the borders impaleliours are what they called them they were exactly what they sounded like hoisted high onto the quarac totem pole ever so sharply they would slide down until their inner sanctions would jumble to a stop on these carved poles splintered and congested hooverd a glass eye immense in size it emitted a ray of light on the impaliours below it ashes fell to the floor burnt by the glass magnified in captivity with it came the pigment of the phixias dress face painted by honour these executions were one of the turning points for ojeno in a matter of years he would defect

“only devils might care yet you run with with tales of fibbing scrutiny somnolent breather now its time to let it crack you only run from yourself” laughed the phixia with antennas glowing “i’m gonna get a bonus for this one” he grunted back gargling his blow hole shut by stitches the phixias had been tracking this poor soul down for hours they outnumbered the child three to one he had been beaten like a bully sack on grated shreds sitting hopeless and endangered they walked away for a breather letting him slightly recover from the pulp of disconnecting bones slagged off broken and open in a matter of minutes they would strap him to the faces of their elongated backs and take them him back to the quarac there he would be reconditioned in a reeducation camp year zero taught properly a volunteer for the impaliours “any sign of that clavietika ” asked one phixia strapping the child in backpack configuration “radio into hq see if she’s flying low enough to be caught on the radar i could use the extra pay” spoken like a true grunt he had no clue as to the physical trauma that it took to hunt one of those things down “let’s hurry up the night icicles fall fast upon us we needn’t set camp and set water on the brain” they hurried back to the prison quarac blasting shifts in penance chained among gangs phixias crush everything in their path women and children first no taboo was too much this is how they learned to live in these hugger mugger times if you as much as hushed a single unphixia like thought you would be banished to the quarac as an impaleliour to run with the phixias one must think as a group never as a single rhythm “you will make a great impaleliour just give it here we need your corpse for fresh face paint” clobbered sensceisly the young child gave them not the satisfaction of defeat “you didn’t knock me out you neckless fucking stump” gears jerked from the gully intrepid and conniving they killed him on impulse alone sardined matches as yet to be let out they took commands from his ulcers crop circle phenomena plastered propaganda lubricant on the hides compensation for the better of the land on every shelter a warning how to look breath and eat narcs were escorted with encouragement the phixias were watching all the time

clavietika used the ice of nightfall to rejuvenate herself in the morning began her rampage amongst all things phixia they could not find where she hid last night unaware that they were so close to each other in a crevice saucer made of elder ruins she emerged from a sound sleep the phixias had been tracking her that day when they made the realization that she was on the clipside of the pinkeye fountain

morning drew alarm on tracking devices pricking up there ears they seemed to be going through withdrawl systems weakling criteria careering through mephoscalpic ceremony as she finished her ritual of morning magic passes her joints broke the barrier of sound blurting her whereabouts pussing the ears of the phixias only a few could withstand the noise because it paralyzed them yawning before the day could began her ancestry embarked on confrontation while the phixias could do nothing but watch and freeze at first sight of her as she arose from slumber her necks twisted round for a better view caught off guard by their presence as well she began filtering passages from the irradi exerptas line by line as all phixias became her slave tantamount to medusa perveing lids unlocked behold your fate she sang phixiasonce proud and merciless regressed slobbering coitus interrupts blue balled at their core movement was not an option as she slung death from her poach pendulum brushing frantic strollsthe phixias began to disrobe their useless armor of alligator skin the use of their weapons seemed to work in her favor cutlery weilded by themselves exacting a blood clot potion that had them drinking from their palms the eyes were rendered useless as they were the first to go held in their pencors some impaled the pupils with great delight some opened pockets in their bellies for the morning of their sight in their minds chasing dragon fumes of opium fields coughing up a bliss so pure that death seemed not so imminent frolicking and holding each other they became objectified auditory hallucinations “try the throat it legwarms well the comatose of spinal cellswish yourself the will to crawlremove your feet for they have no use” these instructasketches seduced them wellforever in her grasp in her dream like spell the triumph of herself willed the killing of themselves as she painted out the beauty for all of them to see as statues fall at the weather of time their corpse’s resembled a civilization long frail and lost as she dripped upwards into murdersome air all phixias had drawn their last sips of blood on recherches sand slowly it all became disowned when all the commotion had died down she lowered herself down on the sand to make sure that everyone was dead little did she know that one of the phixias marxanalia had left her talk back pore open so that the others at the quarac could find her and the others when clavietika came upon marxanalia she realized that recherche had been watchinglistening before she knew it she was surrounded by a phalanx of phixias armed with headphonetic protective gear that also shielded their eyes from the ghost effect that she perpetrated at them a blue whaled siren shot through the desert mushroom clouding nails of sonic temper on them phixias squirmed in disbelief she was the one entity that made them know fear as her brute force exploded some of the phixias protective gear fell victim to disintegration enabling them to take their own life as she floated spitting suicide at their beastial costumes paranormaly activated all around her harpooned by some phixias who remained untouched by her they tried to strattle her down to mute positionyet their efforts seemed childish and unredeeming the power of her voice strung the phixias round a lasso like force that killed them on impact with the sand only but one of the brave phixias managed to force himself inside herbecause that was the trick in order to take her down you had to go right through her projected physique this one did penetrate her transparent case planting a quarac immobilization muzzle in her very center he fortunately did not make it as it was impossible to withstand the radioactivity that made up the dna of her design once the others saw that the implant had been installed they activated it with out any hesitation as they clicked the on button of their archaic contraption clavietika choked on an embalming fluid of arsenic powder crippling her astral projected body revealing the inside compartment of cockpit seating where they found none other than ojeno valaso she did have her weakness because she was the mother hechicera

ojeno was hauled to the prison camp dragging his body into the cheers and delight of all the other phixias the prisoners all bowed in his honour for he was the epitome of their struggleand now it seemed as though it was all over they were proud of him for standing up to the war monger recherche he was the real criminal their hope now sank eternal lost at least not with out a fight as was much of their lives like his recherche stood imposing as a figure of excess power in the marble cut foot stool of his podium balcony he grinned the “i told you so” reassurance of an eight year old child having gotten his way this was a sad day for all sowvietna the cancer had lumped a greater strength in multiples of three“i stand before you victorious”the prisoners spat on the ground cursing his name “before you i bring the body of ojeno valaso the clavietika tresojos” the phixias rallied behind their gluttonous leader in a roar of approval“we will rid our land of the perverse instability starting with him” “re education begins now” bellowed his guttural flatulence “what is the whole of the law” he screamed hypnotic and spastically “los tres ojos”they beamed back at him“ragman” they continued“and dead doll stares” reached the frenzy to its all time low “ojeno will volunteer his mistakes as an impaliourwe will slide his body down to ashat dawn brings the promise of a new tommorow”

as dawn drew its first early squints the magnetic fortress of ojeno valaso’s body itched adorned bein crudo from the poison induced in his body he knew today was his last day no game plan reallyit was all over the radioactive costume that waged suicide on the phixia populous was all but destroyed he knew that if he could get to it that he could gestate a new epidemic in hearts of the quaracthe clavietika was left in the desert to be inhabited by crackpot dust it was useless he was doomed for all to see the tecla illuminosa rang gently in the distant mildeu of his holding tank four notes that served as impending death calling from the sharpness of the totem poles that waited for his body outside the scenario relished by recherche danced around the cranial sanctuty of ojeno’s thoughts the phixias marched into the cell and unlocked the shackles round his wrists they paraded him outside in front of the other prisoners a crown of leaches was placed around his head sucking dry the nutritious intelligence that sweated blood from his drooping head laying waste to the knowledge he had accumulated from years of projecting suicide on the weak minded phixias this was his day in the sun burning crisp of bodily function none of the magic passes he learnt from the ancestry of his clavietikas could save him now the guards placed him standing over a hole in the ground that held the pointed poles that would soon erect itself from the floor crowds gathered round to catch a final glimpse of their fallen leader slowly the totem poles began their rise into the blistering scorch of there sun the tip of the poles teased his body sliding past his legs rearing its point slowly climbing past his thighs until ojeno felt the vicinity of his lower region being probed

the sun threw a tarp over ojeno’s body suffocating heat in a slouching death kiss ojeno began hallucinating himself at the foot of a bridge about to jump off while strange mechanical beasts scurried along under him his dream sequence found him hovering over a lifeless body held together by technicalities of machinesurrounded by scuffling mourners the pain penetrated him to an exhaustion that stung the spinal tail of deep breathing calluseshe screamed into the rays of light that illuminated his body the pole cut through him sauldering pieces of digestion making it’s way past his lungs cutting off circulation unbreading his throat shooting right through the entrance of his mouth ojeno moaned welting forming a bruise on two legs unable to go anywhere death did not set in right away drawing with it a lengthy demise the phixias roared indefinitely for hours pelting him with rocks that bit his head thumping it broken ways a purple shade of black grew all over him shivering from heat with his own hands recherche began cranking the lever that connected a series ropes to a gigantic circular glass as it rose over ojeno creating a dome overhead phixias overjoyed from miles around “what of your maggot prince now ” scolded one phixia to an old woman sitting on her knees filled with anger the dome glass magnified a beam of light onto ojeno’s heat soaked body the light eradicated his form into ash upon first touch the phixias lunged under him celebrating their victory by painting themselves in the ashes it was all over heat sunk in intuition

the beam of light obscured his perception as a projection he emerged again but this time he was not a regeneration he was cerpin taxt again a harmonic force lifted his body from the sowvietna desert and slowly he could see how small they really were the farther he got away the farther he got away the more it dawned on him that he was but a germ in the perspiration of a speaker ordering people to drink dripped in sweat into a vat of of kool aid as it was being stirred by the hand of the speaker his podium soapbox seemed tank like governing all in his scowl his scowl was undistiguishable as it was hidden behind dark shaded sunglasses the tint masked his omnipotence masking the enigma that was completely under his control “pastor jones will now speak” rang the voice from the speaker of the paplease get some medicationsimple it’s simple we must die with dignity

“place her in your anecdote pouchremove it of the other carcasses” molted one of the giants lava spilling from his mouth slitted on his belly was storage designed for food but at this time it was to be transformed into a nursing home he keeled over towards her picking her up by both of her heads as he removed her from the slump she stretched out into a toffee shape drooping lifeless expressions on her melting face she blew in pieces no longer dripping upwards at the sky the giants careful not to drop her fell ill with silence never had they feasted on such an alien sight “what is it” cried one of the giants aghast with nervousness the giants trembled in gears “she is the seed” remarked another “we must bring her to adastra he will know what to do with her” all at once they agreed gang mentalityoverpoweredbytheherdtheybeganchantingleperpsalmsintotheespimpureinorder to transport themselves to their place of origin they had to chant their mantralink “cuantas vidas me vas a pagarde estos bosques susiou de sangre del aere muerto cicatriz quando llegara a la ciudad donde tropizesalte veneno en las montanias donde nasi” and with them she left the desert glandsbathed by the sweat thunderous from the throat of conviction the mantra worked dematerializing them back to their home

zxiat and ghiest were mended of the gemini mirror you could spot them in doubletake mime wondering these children knew the hum louder and softer than any of the others while it piedpiped their nightsight in the mourning of their allotment is where you could hear them smile two receptors picking up the messages in the outfields zoning in on the atonements at hand they knew when the mayday distressed others but no one would ever believe a child they scurried along the pyramines of toplitzin not a care on their mind sometimes they would even play in koral’s garden with the dramagon statues a prayer to them meant the gift of life or so their parents had winked they hushed them nightly with boogie man legends that drew the curtains on their afternoon sight would they ever see the black of night this was their handicap living in hexile on this occasion while rummaging through the grass blades of koral’s garden the twins were being watched by a third party she stared at their presence with wonder how could they not know what they were playing with compass point studious behavior to her eye the slobber from her viewpoint couldn’t drool any faster neuralgia who had seen it all before was immersed in the children’s activitieshow they talked to the dramagon statues with effortless interplay how they stared into its’ eyes even how they only ever spoke to the one on the left it meant something to them it meant something to her it only lured her for curiosity’s sake when the twins would stop playing she would rush over immediately to the one statue on the left and with falsetto paper cuts she would hum out the hymn it became a source of meditation for her all while koral would spy on her trance mesh lace between her and the twins they had managed to contact the spirit of a distant relative who had been deceased for iceage lengths it channeled its thoughts through them in a divination nod they seemed to naturally bring it onto themselves and even more so this intrigued koral mataxia peeping from a vanishing state she was under the spell of this relative it wanted to know where it was and why was it thereand why was there so much suffering neuralgia could not bare all the truths because the children might discover their own fate on the day that she revealed the nature of the beast she became ripe for the picking she knew no other real love than that of the one she had developed to this stranger so for koral to strike when he didit only deafend matters worse for toplitien what have you brought from your salavace finds

just three days prior to a reading of the new litany koral was sent word that his herd of giant malnourishments was to be bringing something of great value to the citadel something not found in the eightball pond of the toplitzin pyramines something septic parted its hair this way koral couldn’t even be bothered by such uneventful news because of his earwhig obsession that festered in the grime of seated teeth he was too busy trying to corrupt neuralgia into a ‘yes’ mode of submission she was unbreakable she could give a fuck less who and or what he was about it was just a shelter to her she could always find someone better to take care of her she feared him not she merely wanted to spar with his feelingswho was really being had as she waited for his appearance to be made she felt the distant asking of a factcheck on what she had just said to the dramagon statuette she wanted out to converse with her subconscious but koral’s sleeping quarters were heavily guarded every door was locked she had no escape route    until finally a hypnotic surrender blew itself well beyond a dozing portion their nightly mating routine did ever please her after his impotent try failed to subdue her he left to attend the welcome of the salavace enabling neuralgia to escape to the gardens on her way past some of the rooms she heard a pocket of hissing flirting from a closed door she whisked for a dropping of eaves glass to ear to door “what have you brought for me to see” he fisted through his lockjaw “what is all this end allbe all rhetoric” he asked impatiently the giants of his salavace reconsquadron stepped back as they pushed forward on one of the giants “hectros unflesh your forage womb and show koral what we have found” hectros quivered in the hacksaw point of his cerebreal pattern to begin he had to hold his breath while his fingers sliced for the find from within his bowels csectioned quite the apparition if bricks could only sprout wings“what is it” koral demanded hectros fumbled and said “she is the seed that you have been looking for master” koral replied “no my son the precious creature i have been bedding now holds the seed” the clavietika shot straight upspines in a rowspine as an arrow

both her mouths shot rays of light as everything around them shot out of focus everyone had disappeared as the two heads became one its face began shoving seizures from a ray in its mouth crisis personality autopsyticks a time from a peeling back of nails and skin the spins swung the room to a stop and suddenly cerpin taxt woke up for a brief moment in time he caught a glimpse from above the circuits spilling haywire he was in a hospital all his friends stood around him calling him back pleading for a second coming to the dismay of cerpin’s drowning body ice shocked in the freezing heat he snapped back in the drip of the iv back to koral mataxia “did you see that” winced adastra ears to the ground dimensions croaking the technique “ponte ojo” laughed the witch doctor “i want you to incinerate itwhatever it is”

“yes koral then give me the ashes to place in the sackcloth”

“very well”

the giants wept a thunder that scattered across the skies was this all she was good for “her
remains are the seed” scolded adastra “she will be of better use as the black of an ash” they dragged her to the repitissue room for the deed as they locked the doors behind her and set the oven controls to a melting rot the clavietika began hissing air boiling like a pot of hot water this only disturbed the ogres more they couldn’t bear to stand by as their baby was cleaned to ash adastra walked into the repitissue room to collect the final ingredients when he was done he made his way towards the garden of the dramagons “slaviaceesteviria” he shouted at the statuettes and within seconds the statue on the left rose on a hinge revealing a grave pit of some sort adastra then proceeded to dump all of the clavietika’s ashes into the earthcolored safe a potion had been set as a boobytrap offering on the following morning zxiat and ghiest would encounter a more developed contact point of reference

with zxiat and gheist only reaching three years in age each they had always managed to steer clear of the litany call it luckbut they were taught very well by their parents on when not to be seen or heard for the twins the medication was never administered as it was with all children koral seemed to like the effect it had on the kids when he entered their homes he wanted them to have it ingrained in their spongelike impression the memory of koral collecting them while their parents slept their tiny little bodies collected more flavor if it was coerced with adrenalinalways working as a kill switch the twins made their way towards the dramagon garden to pay their relative a visit they began seeing him in the form of a grandfather they were taught about the ways koral stole the others while their parents retreated obediently they were taught that they were the hunted and that they hadn’t very much longer to live he consoled them parental as one unit the statuette spoke to them ever so gently it told them how good they had beenand how proud he was of them the twins smiled peaking in the red they would do anything for him he asked that before they left could they lift the hatch at the bottom of his feet he asked with the promise of a reward in mindas it would rain on them as gifts in the dead of night zxiat never bothered to ask if it had a name it was gheist who uttered the tag certificate dangling off the toe to its identity moattilliattahe is moattilliattahe promised me something’s gonna shower drown the pallbearer plantszxiat wondered if this person would clean the slate maybe he could make them all wake up neuralgia in the meantime had long been brainwashed into forgetting her daily visitations she couldn’t even remember when the last time it was that she had prayed to the dramagon off the wagon in a fucking spree servitude she too forgot significance and pushed it out of her way just the way koral had planned it all along koral instead began appearing at the garden speaking to the dramagon on the left it spoke with him at great lengths about a little blueprint he had been kind of toying with it was really quite simple they would debate for hours throwing vein branch telepathy at each other’s cranial entanglements he presented moattilliatta with a map of the air space that surrounded many feet above them whispers traded strong holds with cackles as their brows arched pinched to no good

the litany had been read to soured snores of the toplitzin city it was only fair that he did it this way too many pigeons in the oven this is just how it was on this reading fell the droplets of zxiat’s and gheist’s names it was a day that the twins feared would come moatilliatta knew nothing of this as he was under koral’s spell that day marked the contractions at three minutes apart cracking yolk unsnapped the storm tremula metacarpi was filtering its scorn on a wooden horse table chipped by previous bloodlust adastra set the utencils for sharper unravelings these two will bring me closer to him zxiat and gheist felt distant from their physical costumes that uniform wasn’t really gonna matter anymore where they were going would bring them closer to moattilliatta too they marched up to the horses made of wood and placed their bodies in full sacrificial pose there in their eyes was a lifeless staircase to the wakemode they wanted to inherit from the billfold of his backside koral reached in handle touching palm he slowly read the inscripture of brailed chapters  i’ll reign blood on this city read his fingers on the machete handle that was about to decapitate the twins neuralgia felt no emotion in the care she abandoned she was preoccupying herself with chores that koral ordered her to do she sat there folding lumps of fleshbatter for the nightly meal through grinders she devoured the mush into a fertilizer machine making a batch of play dough nutrients for koral to eat every time she laid into the blob rolling pin in hand koral would slice the pacifier softness of the children’s’ faces blood lept onto his face as goggles the smell of copper musk knocked the shit out of everything koral’s frenzy smiled out a laughing fit while the soaked parts of the children retired by his lap the carnage dressed his possession couture quite nicely neuralgia slaved away into the evening keeping her end of the bargain after koral reached climax he unclothed his porkframe from the robes that were common place in his ceouniratta burial rites they always required a burning so that everything would just blow away forgetting what had just occurred his caravan eyes breached full dress for a stabbing growth from an unaccidental footholdtalon pecking fabrication moattilliatta could now commence his pulling heads up out of the intraexhaust territories targeted handpicked the noose from the camp of the riots adastra saw it coming before becoming koral mataxia the alternate personality that dueled only with himself

by the right dramagon soil had imploded dirt beneath the statuette laid in pieces on the ground corrosion smoke trailed toward the skies swirling ingested to oversize pills something had hatched an insult deflowering in the hips of clouded mudhunting for koral of one thousand or more moattilliatta adorned the pillow lips that floated through his sides he was slicing right by the wind breaking sound and tasting light such a magnificient specimen tremula had constructed a finely tuned weapon with one taste on his mind let it spell holes in the grip he reached a wing span that covered three arenas full of fetus stock completely made of raw cartilage and marrow pole switchblades he wore the epidermis wings of zxiat’s and gheist’s skinned torsos he had no flesh masquerade to hide his anonymity just the exoskeleton made by scribbleinfected tremulants courtesy of wolfram tarant that day marked the twisting of the new hex zerorougehe’d hibernate no more from cell to cell building after building he toppled the pyramines exposing fire hydrant fires of pale neck wine neuralgia tried to repent yet moattilliatta could not forgive her with one of his legs he held her body down while carving out her trachea with his left claw her scream became muted on the instant that it happened her body kept moving she sat up and walked in a circle skipping to the scratches on the record before her aftershock collapsed her front row seat served its punishment in the eyes of moattilliatta koral would feel the impact in his old factory nap as his scent slept right through most of it when he finally caught scent of the bodies he rushed over to his window for a better look moattilliatta had piled up the cadavers of all of toplitzin’s population in front of koral’s homein the midst of high noon koral could see no one in front of his home except for the pile of people moattilliatta perched itself on the roof of his house waiting for just the right secondkoral felt the knocking of his breath behind him and he froze moattilliatta arched back his enormous head and opened his perforated jaws the blood of all the people fell from his guilty mouth adastra could see bird as he lived on as the eyes on the back of koral’s headand with one jolt downwards moattilliatta clipped the duet in half leaving two pieces squirming and trying to hide as moattilliatta served himself for another his entire body began to regenerate into a bubbling stretch of molecules he pulsated light reflection dawning the birth back into homehe clobbered at the nothing air like a roach trapped on its backhe mutated with shapes of elbows and legs kicking and contorting on the inside of his body he came to submerging from a fullbodied river that lead him to the footsteps of a bridge at the other end of it was a row of steps that immersed itself into another body of water he walked slow poking the romrseing silence as he walked across the bridge all he could think was about getting over only so that he could come back and finish his business at the other end he held his breath and walked down into the water below him for now it was cerpin taxt’s turn to go home around the hospital cerpin’s friends caught their breath and lashed out a sigh of relief he had finally made it through ectoplasm spit from his nose ears and mouthhe smiled for miles around he knew what it all meant to the friends who lined up to greet him the worst was over he spent the next three days getting oriented with simple speech patterns and physical therapy it would be a while before things got back to normal shotgunned to reality waiting to go back

through an oubliette he awakes

cerpin began spending the next couple of years of his life packing up and saying his goodbyes all the times he had told his friends that he was leaving they never picked up on the slang fast enough or maybe some of them dismissed it the way you ignore a beggar he managed to slip through their fingers every time looking everyone in the eye when informing them of this all of his attempts shrugged an apathy from his shoulders his luck had run its course in the runon sentence of his life he knew the images well he didn’t need a reminder he knew he did not belong the cord grew shorter and shorter by the years until he was paid a visit by the ink he dispersed into sculpting holds tremula metacarpi was inches away from victory through the curtains of his room came a gliding entrancea mist of vermin dandruff settled on him deleting all the pretext he tossed and turned on that abbreviated night the tremulants sent word to him that he had not finished the job well enough they felt immensely disappointed by his halfassed tries they wanted more from him “it seems you’ve gotten away scotfree cerpin” aroused the voices of his visions “did you really think you could get away that easily do you take us for imbeciles in your rapid eye movement was it ectopic for you shift all sort of pretty shapes did we propel yourself far and long” cerpin clutched his eyes closed in a tenantversus landlord debate  “you you’re the one who left us herewhat will we do without you if you think you’ve passed all the tests then come collect what is rightfully yours” all the banter roared at cerpin without so much as a face to put behind it assaulted by the collective chatter of drawn false teeth “i know i know” cerpin whimpered “all of this time bedsore containment how am i to know that the music has faded” “that is for you to come and figure out now isn’t it” grinned the whiny solution metacarpi at every turn “you have but one more chance” cerpin had pissed himself by the bucketload “what is it anything i’ll do anything” he cried his arms crippled a contortion of subliminal surrender he would do anything now just to please his children he knew what awaited him and it suited him fine this world had become grey and monotonous the world as he knew it wasted away miserably with no interest for his kind why beat them when you could join them in the realm of tremula metacarpi a throne was just itching for an occupant an appointed location just beneath a bridge in rezjua by a network of commuters would appear an entrance to the espimpure they gave him a date for the new portal would he accept could he commit was it in his blood did he have to get rid of it the body the sickness badgered him endlessly pulling at his soul the tremulants made martyrs out of his sentence attempts the lepers of unhydriat were nowhere to be found alive tremulants had ceased them with brief bouts of muzzles and asthma dominoes couldn’t have hit it any harder on the nail cerpin taxt had given up in order to be with his beloved they had it in for each other crossing the picket line smearing blood all over the tracks all over the concrete all over his face “ya me voy”

cerpin taxt stood high above the wobbling miscarriage of oncoming traffic the rail that adorned the top of the bridge pulsed a cape of wincedshut onlooking he had managed to get this far without hesitation he didn’t stretch his arms in some lame christ pose he had more class than that standing perfectly still he disassembled his flag blew his nose into it and shoved it back in his front left pocket he wore a pair of black slipon winos his jeans stained by a sweating reaction to his mission fell in normal rotation around his waist they were black his skin parted to a smear of candle wax abandonment cerpin’s head became interchangeable sometimes monkshaven other times a long black shoepolish shine the nostrils on his grill flared apeways his lips had a cleft wound that had been tapered by a lacerating tailor what room was there for such a creature in his mind he thought it would be a good idea if he burned all of his id bracelets and cards so that when they blew away they would end up in the landfill on the other side of town surely neuralgia would find them there in a projected state of astral wondering no money in his pockets no letter of reckoning all the plans had accumulated in a warp round of loosechange thinking he had wished to teach more to his friends about the meaning of it allyet with all three of his eyes constantly blinkingwho could ever tell if he could see at all his body hadn’t really expected much less but this one paved the way for a last meal he began walking it like a tightrope from the coma came a limp strut not too familiar to his body before the accident his arms carved to a ratpoisoned shrivel parked themselves neatly to his sides in the distance came the grunting of a vehicle semiseismic in its size the driver slowly brought his truck to a halt cerpin just stared marbleeyed holding on to nothing the driver looked up at him hoping he wouldn’t do it nothing could rewrite the previous pages quietly standing there within seconds cerpin would make up his mind

a light breeze simmered around the balance of his stance each closing second opened up a dilation to the blinking that only he could see everyone froze collapsing lungs full of sighs an application had been turned in while others turned away like the hands of a clock seeping forward his body began to slide into a centrifugal force he knew the routine no panic had its way just a calm throbbing on the door knob he had made a skeleton key made of cobwebs and hair and from up on the roof of his mouth did he pull it out hairballed to the gag swiftly moving now as his body gained momentum he held the picklock with a vengeance fists pointing at a sea of mayday handling he promised to come fighting with a silence most deafening no loose muscles no more dents a torpedo gaining on them tremula had not the faintest idea what was in store for them faster he sank towards the medium exit of the concrete he bared no thoughts in mind he had erased himself from the directory with amnesia as an asthmatic anesthetic while the portal craved a gaping penetration coughing right before his remorse struck gold within one gulp cerpin taxt had hit the ground the cracking of the marrow the boils roaring up on the shores one side of his face had collapsed inwards while the rest of his body remained intact his limbs slightly mumbled an escape act and the puppet strings fell behind the ragman of mundy tangled and defaced people turned away in disgust the driver of the truck that had stopped to watch him came over to his side he whispered in his ears dios mio que esistes to no response cerpin’s right eye was left open not a murmur now without blinks all that was left was a uniform which he had no use for keeping his essence unglued itself from the asphalt leaving behind a syrup of red for his body was the feast served on beds of ancestral curses now that feared chalk outline would close in circumference only around the temple of his ruins on the underpass in downtown rezjua cerpin left a tale as it forever stained the ground he hit on that jealous cold leach afternoon no one knew what hit them the accusations flew from angles far and deprived who was to blame for the death of cerpin taxt had he really jumped to his death while our backs were bathing just east of the river enial

on the day of his funeral a march of convicted devotees brought the ashes of cerpin’s body to a pauper’s grave the ghetto tramontaine that they scaled lead to the outhouse of dumpster waste there were no street signs just the mud of unpaved roads in the distance surveyed the watchful eyes of some keystone border patrol he had always warned of not littering away foolishly because it would end up here funny how unwanted trash accumulates away from the safety of urban decay on the other side of the river nestled just behind the graves separated a reality subpoena asking who would choose sides cerpin had chosen his path was it everybody else who had already died against a sandpapered kiss bidding for the farewell bet was lost the soul of cerpin taxt
