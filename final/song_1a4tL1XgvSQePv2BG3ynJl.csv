it started on thursday
at seven or maybe eight
you crashed into my world with a boom
you came over as a guest
i said i liked you and i confessed
by ten oclock i was making fun of you

prechorus
you stayed for a while then left with a smile
but at least i made you happy
you make me happy too
its kinda cheesy to say but

chorus
youre everything i want
when im with you all the hurting stops
youre the hand that fits my glove
and ill never replace you
cause ill never find love so true

verse 2
its only been three days
youre playing the waiting game
been acting cool when were not together
i drove you home from school
when im with you i feel so tall
i wish this feeling would last forever
you might also likeprechorus
and i stare into space
my heart starts to race
but at least ive got your picture
you gave me yesterday
its kinda cheesy to say but

chorus
youre everything i want
when im with you all the hurting stops
youre the hand that fits my glove
and ill never replace you
cause ill never find love so true

bridge
looking back at us
two years and were going strong
they say that time flies when youre having fun
i never wanna be alone again no

chorus
know youre everything i want
when im with you all the hurting stops
youre the hand that fits my glove
know youre everything i want
youre everything i want
and ill never replace you
cause ill never find love so trueembed"
