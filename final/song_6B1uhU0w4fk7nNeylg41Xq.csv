my brother you love her
but dont give up your instincts
hang onto you know what
theyll be gone fast as you blink
theyre trained to seduce you
suck you dry quick as they can
they bite down reduce you
now youre barely a man

oh my god
how could you deny the flood
thats flowing through you
hey you youre saying that
shes all that you desire liar
hey you you think you can
throw water on this fire liar

verse 2
its not wrong to let go
and let the woman ride you
for fuck sake dont lose touch
with the dog thats inside you
she wanted what you had
you bet she smelt the spore
dont wimp up fuck her up
one more time slam that door
