i know exactly how you feel
it doesnt matter what you say
i see the sun begin to set
and we gotta gotta get away
i got a patch of open road
i already miss you with all of my soul
so before we both get old
i think we gotta gotta get away

prechorus
i kept wishing bought the tickets stuck them on my wall
lets rip them down and leave the town before the cops can call
and bring us back cover our tracks in the dust
i think we must

chorus
take on the world lets go crazy
love will tell us where to go
ill be your girl be my baby
love will tell us where to go
oh oh oh through a dark night
oh oh oh without a sunrise
oh oh oh and we will be alright
and love will tell us where to go
love will tell us where to go
love will tell us where to go

the wheels on this train keep turning
were flying with the birds and
the worlds so bright it hurts when
were on the getaway
im the bonnie to your clyde
youre the moon and im the tide
i i want this for all of my life
since the night that we got away

prechorus
i kept wishing bought the tickets stuck them on my wall
lets rip them down and leave the town before the cops can call
and bring us back cover our tracks in the dust
i think we must

chorus
take on the world lets go crazy
love will tell us where to go

and love will tell us where to go
love will tell us where to go

bridge
when things get rough when we have loved
weve got enough to tell us where to go
when we get lost when love is all
all that we got to tell us where to go

then were alright well be alright
love will tell us where to go

chorus
