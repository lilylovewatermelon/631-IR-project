soon as we get started making love going hard
i hear a knock knock knocking on the wall
and as soon as i go deep getting it in then again
theres a knock knock knocking on the wall
girl your legs keep shaking and i swear
we breaking our new headboard headboard
and the love we make it feels so good girl you know im proud
looking in your lovely face scream my name you do it so loud

chorus
i bet the neighbors know my name
way you screaming scratching yelling
bet the neighbors know my name
and they be stressing while we sexing
bet the neighbors know my name
my name my name
i bet the neighbors know my name

verse 2
take this pillow right here grab this
and i know youre so excited if you bite it they wont hear
and you know just what we capable of when we making love
so the music gon be loud you gon scream and shout

while they dreaming you be screaming now they banging on our door
