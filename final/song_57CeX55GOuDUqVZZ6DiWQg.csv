she called and said she wanted to see me
i say yeah thats fine baby drop on by
i figured i could make it better
just like every other time we had this fight
of all the kind of over it couldve been
i never wouldve bet on this

chorus
i was thinking she would come over stay over
wake up hungover still head over heels for me
thought it was something we could talk over drink over
then it would be over back to how it used to be
no but its the kind where the sheets get colder
and she dont need no shoulder to cry on shes gone
she aint pulling over its just over

verse 2
when she left the kitchen she left no questions
i said where in the world did i go wrong
and it dont matter where shes headed
shes gone gone gone

chorus
i was thinking she would come over stay over
wake up hungover still head over heels for me
thought it was something we could talk over drink over
then it would be over back to how it used to be
no but its the kind where the sheets get colder
and she dont need no shoulder to cry on shes gone
she aint pulling over its just over

like the page shes turning over
like the light shes starting over
without me

chorus
i was thinking she would come over stay over
wake up hungover still head over heels for me
thought it was something we could talk over drink over
then it would be over back to how it used to be
no but its the kind where the sheets get colder
and she dont need no shoulder to cry on shes gone
she aint pulling over its just over
