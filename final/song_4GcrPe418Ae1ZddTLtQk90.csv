this could be destiny
oh sweetheart
ive had no sense of time
since we started

ive got friends in need
oh sweetheart
ive grown lengths and lengths
and lengths of love
since we started this thing out

verse 2
there is a bitter breed
oh sweetheart
they will be watching you sometimes
with their bitter hearts

but we are through with these
oh were shifting the heartache
we want strong summer love
the most robust of blood
just to stay awake
