give me love like her
cause lately ive been waking up alone
paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
told you id let them go

prechorus
and that ill fight my corner
maybe tonight ill call ya
after my blood turns into alcohol
no i just wanna hold ya

chorus
give a little time to me or burn this out
well play hideandseek to turn this around
all i want is the taste that your lips allow
mymy mymyy oh give me love
mymy mymyy oh give me love
mymy mymyy oh give me love
mymy mymyy oh give me love
mymy mymyy give me love

verse 2
give me love like never before

and its been a while but i still feel the same
maybe i should let you go
