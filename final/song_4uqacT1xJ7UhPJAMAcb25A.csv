theres a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious
makes you so sick at heart that you cant take part you cant even passively take part
and youve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
upon the levers upon all the apparatus and youve got to make it stop

verse 1 mike shinoda
to save face how low can you go
talk a lotta game but yet you dont know
static on the way make us all say woah
the people up top push the people down low
get down and obey every word
steady gettin mine if you havent yet heard
wanna take what i got dont be absurd
dont fight the power nobody gets hurt
if you havent heard yet then im lettin you know
there aint shit we dont run when the guns unload
and no one make a move unless my people say so
got everything outta control now everybody go

interlude
hey hey hey hey
hey hey hey hey

chorus chester bennington
steel unload final blow
we the animals take control
hear us now clear and true
wretches and kings we come for you
you might also likeverse 2 mike shinoda
so keep pace how slow can you go
talk a lotta shit and yet you dont know
fire on the way make you all say whoa
the people up top and the people down low
get down and im runnin it like that
the front of the attack is exactly where im at
somewhere in between the kick and the hihat
the pen and the contract the pitch and the contact
so get with the combat im lettin em know
there aint shit you can say to make me back down no
so push the button let the whole thing blow
spinnin everything outta control now everybody go

interlude
hey hey hey hey
hey hey hey hey

chorus chester bennington
steel unload final blow
we the animals take control
hear us now clear and true
wretches and kings we come for you
steel unload fire blow
filthy animals beat them low
skin and bone black and blue
no more this sun shall beat onto you
bridge mike shinoda
from the front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put em up real high
front to the back and the side to side
if you fear what i feel put em up real high

outro mario savio
when the operation of the machine becomes so odious
makes you so sick at heart that you cant take part you cant even passively take part
and youve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
upon the levers upon all the apparatus and youve got to make it stop
and youve got to indicate to the people who run it to the people who own it
that unless youre free the machine will be prevented from working at all10embed"
