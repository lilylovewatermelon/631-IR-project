yeah well well owww
yeah yeah
bring on that pecan pie
pour some sugar on it sugar dont be shy
scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl
dont be stingy im a growing girl

i offer big love with no apology
how can i deny the world the most of me
i am not afraid to throw my weight around
pound by pound by pound

because im big blonde and beautiful
face the fact the simply irrefutable
no one wants a meal that only offers the least
when girl were serving up the whole damn feast oh ho

slice me off a piece of that hog head cheese woah
then take a look inside my book of recipes ooo
now dont you sniff around for something fluffy and light
we need a man who brings a mansize appetite

ill use a pinch of sugar and a dash of spice
ill let you lick the spoon because it tastes so nice oo ooo
well keep it in a oven til its good and hot
keep on stirring til it hits the spot
you might also likebecause im big blonde and beautiful
there is nothing bout us thats unsuitable oo oo oo
why sit in the bleachers timid and afraid ooo
when edna you look like the whole parade

they say that white has might and thin is in
well thats just bull
cause ladies big is back and as for black
its beautiful

all shapes and sizes follow me
who wants a twig when you can climb the whole tree oo oo oo oo
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah
oh yeah groovy baby groovyembed"
