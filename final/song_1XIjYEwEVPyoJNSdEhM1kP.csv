the partys not over cause the liquor is gone
the neighbours complained oh the cops have been called
everyones sleeping but im still awake
the partys not over til i hear you say were going home

verse 2  brad petering and jordana
the bottle was resting where one sip was slung
the dance floor was empty just a memory of fun
the ice will be melting before morning breaks
the partys not over til i hear you say were going home

interlude  sample
daily dawns another day
i must up to make my way
though i dress and drink and eat
move my fingers and my feet
learn a little here and there
weep and laugh and sweat and swear
hear a song and watch a stage
leave some words upon a page
though i walk in blinded woe
back to bed im bound to go

verse 3  brad petering and jordana
the music has faded the ashtrays been filled
your head may be aching the wine may be spilled
restless and sober but we all gotta stay
cause the partys not over til i hear you say were going home

and uh giving happiness to other people
and uh were going to a lot of partiesembed"
