theres something bout you baby
theres something bout the way
ya got me shaking like a seizure
no mistaking

verse 1
i would die for your heaven
i could lie here forever
every night were together
if youd like ill do whatever
you really want
you remind me of my mom
you make me feel like god
and im watching you fall from above

chorus
theres something bout you baby
theres something bout the way
ya got me shaking like a seizure
no mistaking that i need ya
theres something bout you baby
theres nothing like the way you get me high
you got a heart from heaven
but youre burning like hell
