couldnt give a damn what you said to me
i dont really care what you think of me
cause either way youre gonna think what you believe
theres nothing you could say that would hurt me
im better off without you anyway
i thought it would be hard but im okay
i dont need you if youre gonna be that way
cause with me its all or nothing

prechorus
im sick of your shit dont deny
youre a waste of time
im sick of your shit dont ask why

chorus
and i hate you now
so go away from me
youre gone so long
i can do better i can do better
hey hey you
i found myself again
thats why youre gone
i can do better i can do better

verse 2
youre so full of shit i cant stand the way you act
i just cant comprehend
i dont think that you can handle it
im way over over it
i will drink as much limoncello as i can
and ill do it again and again
i dont really care what you have to say
cause you know you know youre nothing
