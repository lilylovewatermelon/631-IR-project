on the oklahoma shore of that old red river
i stand right here and curse my pride
that river runs deep
that current is strong
and the woman i love is on the other side
how did the love we made together
break apart and drift away
leave me lost and lonely
on this crimson bank

chorus
red river blue
god pull me through
id walk through fire if that bridge hadnt burned in two
texoma sky
tears in my eyes
she said goodbye and now im red river blue

verse 2
they say everything is bigger
under that texas moon
ill bet my right hand you wont find a bigger fool
shes probably smiling somewhere tonight
in someone elses arms
im here dragging the muddy bottom
for pieces of my heart
