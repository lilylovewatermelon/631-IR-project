once all alone
i was lost in a world of strangers
no one to trust
on my own i was lonely

prechorus
you suddenly appeared
it was cloudy before but now its all clear
you took away the fear
and you brought me back to the light

chorus
you are the sun you are the sun
you make me shine you make me shine
or more like the stars
that twinkle at night twinkle at night
you are the moon you are the moon
that glows in my heart glows in my heart
youre my daytime my nighttime my world
you are my life you are my life

verse 2
now i wake up every day
with this smile upon my face
no more tears no more pain
cause you love me
you might also likeprechorus
you help me understand
that love is the answer to all that i am
and im im a better man
since you taught me by sharing your life

chorus
you are the sun you are the sun
you make me shine you make me shine
or more like the stars
that twinkle at night twinkle at night
you are the moon you are the moon
that glows in my heart glows in my heart
youre my daytime my nighttime my world
you are the sun you are the sun
you make me shine you make me shine
or more like the stars
that twinkle at night twinkle at night
you are the moon you are the moon
that glows in my heart glows in my heart
youre my daytime my nighttime my world

bridge
you gave me strength
when i wasnt strong
you gave me hope when all hope was lost
you opened my eyes when i couldnt see
love was always here waiting for me
chorus
you are the sun you are the sun
you make me shine you make me shine
or more like the stars
that twinkle at night twinkle at night
you are the moon you are the moon
that glows in my heart glows in my heart
youre my daytime my nighttime my world
you are the sun you are the sun
you make me shine you make me shine
or more like the stars
that twinkle at night twinkle at night
you are the moon you are the moon
that glows in my heart glows in my heart
youre my daytime my nighttime my world
you are the sun you are the sun
you make me shine you make me shine
or more like the stars
that twinkle at night twinkle at night
you are the moon you are the moon
that glows in my heart glows in my heart
youre my daytime my nighttime my world
