it aint ever done me no good no how
gonna break through and blast off to the bardo
in them flowers of light far away from the here and now

taking a 49 divine day vacation
from reality and all else in between
gonna transmigrate to my destination
far beyond time in an eternal dream

but am i dreaming or am i dying
either way i dont mind at all
oh it feels so good you just cant help but crying
oh you have to let go so the soul may fall

oh my god its so beautiful
everything is a part of me
its so hard looking through all the lies made of wool
but if you close your eyes it becomes so easy to seeyou might also like6embed"
