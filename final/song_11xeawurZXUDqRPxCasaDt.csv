there aint much a war when its 434
with the man you were before that bar door
no one loves you enough to give you a ride
and your cars sittin right outside
oh jamie

verse 2 zach bryan
keep your tires between the ditches and your eyes peeled on the road
theres two more minutes before youre back home
dont 103 feel so free you always loved the revelry
oh jamie

verse 3 charles wesley godwin
the flashin red and blue in a cracked rear view
hе remembers thе smile he once owned
but he aint gonna stop for any cop
from here to damn near wichita county

chorus zach bryan charles wesley godwin
well ill go tonight boys i dont mean no harm
i just miss my lovin lady and layin in her arms
ill go tonight boys i dont mean no harm
i just miss my lovin lady and layin in her arms

verse 4 charles wesley godwin
cause theres a tombstone hidden in a place that he dont visit
where the love of his life was laid to rest
hell make it there by dusk that is where theyll draw their guns
oh jamie
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeverse 5 charles wesley godwin
cause this life aint worth livin if the love that youve been given
is taken before you are
now jamies dancin and spinnin round his baby in the stars

chorus zach bryan  charles wesley godwin
ill go tonight boys i dont mean no harm
i just miss my lovin lady and layin in her arms
ill go tonight boys i dont mean no harm
i just miss my lovin lady and layin in her arms

outro zach bryan
when its late and its cold on that old hidden road
you can hear laughter all in the trees
dont 103 feel so free you dont miss the revelry
do you jamieembed"
