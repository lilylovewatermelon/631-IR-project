lookee here got em all lined up
same bitchy girls and boys
on their hands on their knees
slither through the streets
programmed to seek and destroy
and it all adds up
and it all adds up

verse 2
oh my my no ones on my side
too paranoid to listen to me
you can cast me out
you can tape my mouth
but you cant get a stone to bleed
and it all adds up
and it all adds up

prechorus
you know i love it
when you say youre afraid
dont you hate it
when im making you shake
hang the truth from a noose
put a hit man on the loose
now youre counting on him
making your day

there aint no magic bullet
theres no cure for the weak
theres no sympathetic shoulder
here to put you to sleep
youre a long long way from
where you thought you would be
every murder has a motive
but you aint killing me

postchorus
and it all adds up
you got something to say
and it all adds up
say it

riddle me this
before i take it back
been stealing my shit for years
so kiss my choir
the bad mans fire
cause you know
im gonna bring you to tears
and it all adds up
and it all adds up
verse 4
shake shake shake
callin all the snakes
been itching for the new payroll
bang bang bang
blow down the new slang
you cant keep all the money you stole
and it all adds up
