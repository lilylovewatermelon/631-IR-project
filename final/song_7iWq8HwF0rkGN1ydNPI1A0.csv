tell me now captain wheres the hidden loot
hidden out in the enemy shoes
i want the drag of the rope as i hang on in the wind
just tryin to figure out what kind of trouble were in
call the guards upon the castle walls
began to pray pickle your fall
cause im takin out one prisoner around here
cause were spreadin our disease start smellin your fears
spreadin our disease start smellin start smellin your fears

just tell em were coming and the oceans cold
torn old paper baby broken bones
cause the facts they have written are bright and bold
nothin will stand between us and our gold
oh tell em were coming and our storys untold
torn old paper baby broken bones
cause the facts they been written down bright and bold
nothin will stand between us and our gold

bring the torches sticks and fat to aid us
in the night where were gonna need a whole lotta light
the dungeons dark and the caverns deep
dont you ever close your eyes dont you ever fall asleep
keep your swords out by your sides
there aint no place in this whole damn world that you can hide
in this fight you will be til you die
so buckle it tight and hang on hang on for the ride
