i feel it can you feel it tonight
i feel the fire between you and i
i mean it dont you turn off a light
though i dont wanna leave you ever no
she was like dang
boy i never took you for a one night stand
so dont make plans
for nothing but me and a lil romance hey
you and i whiskey on ice
maybe later we can turn down all the lights
so keep em on with nothing on
oohmymymy

chorus ed sheeran  paulo londra
i was rolling up something with you
kickin back in a way that we do
i got everything i need in this room
smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
know my friends are in the club
and they keep ringin my phone brrt
but they aint got nothing on you uh uh
and you aint got nothing on you leones con flow

verse 2 paulo londra
mommy i usually get scared but today i drink alcohol uh
i want to tell you that i dont know what happened uh
since we both left in the afternoon
to kiss each other both even to make love
now i have your scent come to the room
what we both do can not be matched
we look like fiction when we go into action
this love movie i dont know how to stop yeah
but what kills
it that tonight we see each other and in my house
and i know what you like and what catches you
that i tell you that im not going to let you go

and you aint got nothing on you

verse 3 dave
yuh take the lead follow me whats it gonna be
how you playin hard to get when you hollered me
i take chanel to chanel for a shopping spree

under my persona when had her over

why cause thats suttin to do
i got a million and two but theyre nothin on you nah
