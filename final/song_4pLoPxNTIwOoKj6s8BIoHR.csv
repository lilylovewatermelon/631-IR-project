wont you come through
water on me
we gon walk right through
and im swimming like nemo
no caller id no
you dont really like me no
and i dont really like people
but youre better by default

verse
no red rocks so bright so bright
you can open your eyes
hell all rise all rise all rise
make you so blind so blind
with a thousand teeth a leviathan
biting tightly on my wrist it look like heaven
it weigh tightly on my neck until it break
if i lived too long youd kill me with a stake
no mistake no mistake no mistake
the reflection never point the same way
abba on repeat yeah
diamonds like a dancing queen so

chorus
wont you come through
water on me
we gon walk right through
and im swimming like nemo
no caller id no
you dont really like me no
and i dont really like people
but youre better by default
wont you come through
water on me
we gon walk right through
and im swimming like nemo
no caller id no
you dont really like me no
and i dont really like people
but youre better by defaultyou might also like28embed"
