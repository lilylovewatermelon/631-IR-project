hey leave a message

verse 1
hey call me back when ya get this
or when youve got a minute
we really need to talk
wait you know what
maybe just forget it
cause by the time you get this
your number might be blocked

prechorus
stay and blah blah blah
you just want what you cant have
no way
ill call the cops
if you dont stop ill call your dad

chorus
and i hate to do this to you on your birthday
happy birthday by the way
its not you its me and all that other bullshit
you know thats bullshit
dontcha babe
im not your party favor

prechorus
youll hear stay and blah blah blah
you just want what you cant have

if you dont stop ill call your dad

happy birthday by the way

dontcha babe
