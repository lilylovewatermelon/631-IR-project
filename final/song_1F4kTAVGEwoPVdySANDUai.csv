the way she came into the place i knew right then and there
there was something different about this girl
the way she moved her hair her face her lines
divinity in motion
as she stalked the room i could feel the aura of her presence
every head turned feeling passion and lust
the girl was persuasive the girl i could not trust
the girl was bad the girl was dangerous

verse 1
i never knew but i was walkin the line hee
come go with me i said i have no time heehee
she said dont you pretend we didnt talk on the phone hee
my baby cried she left me standin alone hee hee

chorus
shes so dangerous
the girl is so dangerous heehee
take away my money throw away my time
you can call me honey but youre no damn good for me

spoken interlude
she came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
i fell trapped into her web of sin
a touch a kiss
a whisper of love i was at the point of no return
deep in the darkness of passions insanity
i felt taken by lusts strange inhumanity
this girl was persuasive this girl i could not trust
the girl was bad the girl was dangerous
