its the wanting you never getting you
keeps me wanting you
missing you just to picture you
is what gets me through
fit for you i was meant for you
what i was sent to do meant to do
wasnt meant for you
hope i set the ship right
cause if i never had you
then i could never lose you
do you know what might happen
if i decide to choose you
then the world may just stop spinning
it may just well be the ending
talking all about existence who knows
but i cannot see tomorrow
if youre not in my tomorrow uhoh

chorus
im tryna save the world
how can i when
you belong to me i belong to them
who do i give me to who do i let win
you or the world
you or the world

your light shines so bright its like two stars colliding
well only survive if we fight it dont fight it
your light shines so bright its like two stars colliding
well only survive if we fight it dont fight it yeah

verse 2
cause if i really have to
then you know i would choose you
do you know what would happen
if i ever lose you
then my heart would just stop beating
and my mind would just stop thinking
and my strengths would turn to weakness you know
that i cannot see tomorrow
if youre not in my tomorrow uhoh

chorus
i gotta save the world
how can i when
you belong to me but i belong to them
who do i give me to who do i let win
you or the world
you are my world60embed"
