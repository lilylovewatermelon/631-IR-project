good to now be here
it was love at first sight and misery after two months
always feeling fucked up either by love or no love
i thought you was married to the single life she said
i wasnt necessarily looking for happiness just less pain
i shouldve said somethin
you said the only thing wrong with money is you aint have enough of it
you said you deserve better and now so do i
anyways the best part of us was me
when you got with me you were a genius
now without me you have to live life as an idiot
i dont write songs i write life i told you that
and you were only fuckin with my feelings because you didnt know your own
i do miss who i thought you were
and sometimes im miserable without you
so its just like youre still here shit

verse
i need you to show me
love me love me closely
love me like you own me and my heart
i need you to show me
love me love me closely
love me like you own me and my heart yeahsee trippie redd liveget tickets as low as 61you might also like24embed"
