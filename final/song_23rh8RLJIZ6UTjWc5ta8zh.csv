tell me tell me that you want to

verse 1
i can see you but you cant see me
i could touch you and you wouldnt even feel me
wait a second and youll settle down
im just waiting till you really let your guard down
youre relaxed youre sublime youre amazing
you dont even know the danger youre facing
if im quiet ill slide up behind you behind you
and if you hear me ill enjoy trying to find you

prechorus 1
ive been with you all day
im trying to stay calm
im impatient and its really hard to breathe
im going to empty you and fill you in with me

prechorus 2
just keep the violence down
not yet dont make a sound
oh god im feeling it
its reaching fever pitch
my skin is caving in
my heart is driving out
no mercy no remorse
let nature take its course

its almost time to play
its time to be afraid
i cant control the pain
i cant control in vain
