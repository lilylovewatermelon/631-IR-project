well you know i wouldnt fight
if these guys wouldnt shove me
now i cant go home
cause my baby she dont love me
there aint no use in tryin anymore

well last week or so
i woke up in a cell
dont know how i got there
but my head it hurt like hell
the guard already knew my name
before i came inside
i got a girl who dont like that at all

chorus
well you know i wouldnt fight
if these guys wouldnt shove me
now i cant go home
cause my baby she dont love me
there aint no use in tryin anymore

well you know i wouldnt fight
if these guys wouldnt shove me
now i cant go home
cause my baby she dont love me
