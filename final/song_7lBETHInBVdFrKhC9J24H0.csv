looking in the mirror i can see myself
standing in your arms holding me
and kissing me and loving me
ooh you just cant get enough of me
now im on the phone
telling you im all alone
so come on over im out the shower now
about to oil down i cant wait til you get here

chorus
i wanna be like those girls in the movies
to have a man so in love it makes him drop to his knees
shes even on his mind while hes asleep at night
cause thats the feeling youve given me
i wanna be like those girls in the movies
to have a man so in love it makes him drop to his knees
shes even on his mind while hes asleep at night
cause thats the feeling youve given me

verse 2
im almost ready to accept the truth
im in love with you and i wanna tell you
im glad that youre here
and now were face to face
in the candlelight
im watching your eyes watching my eyes
laying here with you
feels so good feels so good

with your hand in mine hand in mine
we dont have to worry about time we dont have to worry about time
or what the future brings or what it brings
we can just let it be we can let it be
the way you smile at me you smile at me
i already see i already see
you dont wanna leave dont wanna leave
so we can just sit back relax and let it move naturally

chorus
i wanna be like those girls in the movies
to have a man so in love it makes him drop to his knees
shes even on his mind while hes asleep at night
cause thats the feeling youve given me
i wanna be like those girls in the movies
to have a man so in love it makes him drop to his knees
shes even on his mind while hes asleep at night
cause thats the feeling youve given me
i wanna be like those girls in the movies
to have a man so in love it makes him drop to his knees
shes even on his mind while hes asleep at night
cause thats the feeling youve given me
i wanna be like those girls in the movies
to have a man so in love it makes him drop to his knees
shes even on his mind while hes asleep at night
cause thats the feeling youve given me
