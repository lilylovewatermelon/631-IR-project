im a twenty gauge shotgun with both barrels blazing
im a hundred miles an hour round the curve without braking
im a herd of wild horses through her bed of daisies
and shell plant em all back again

verse 2
i think im john wayne when i get to drinking
im the first one to jump on the boat while its sinking
but i aint half as tough as what id have you thinking
if you really knew her youd know im the weak one

chorus
cause shes like a lighthouse standing in the path of a mad hurricane
and her kind laughs at the lightning and dances around in the rain
and when im at the end of my rope
and i dont know if i can hold on
shes stronger

verse 3
she makes the weight of the world feel as light as a feather
shes the needle and thread patching me back together
god knows i aint perfect but shes making me better
if id never met her id hate to think where id be

chorus
cause shes like a lighthouse standing in the path of a mad hurricane
and her kind laughs at the lightning and dances around in the rain
well and when im at the end of my rope and i dont know if i can hold on
shes stronger
shes like a lighthouse standing in the path of that mad hurricane
and her kind laughs at the lightning and dances around in the rain
and when im at the end of my rope and i dont know if i can hold on
