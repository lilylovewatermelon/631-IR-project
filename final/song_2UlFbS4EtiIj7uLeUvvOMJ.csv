its been eighteen days
since id look at myself
i dont wanna have to change
if i dont then no one will
is it my state of mind
or is it just everything else
i dont wanna have to be here
i dont understand it now

since i first held you
but to me it feels just like
it feels like a lifetime
im trying hard to rearrange
some say its the hardest thing to do
but thats another eighteen days
without you

verse 2
time after time
ive been through this
you show me what it means to live
you give me hope when i was hopeless
as my days fade to night
i remember that state of mind
im soaring straight into your heart
and ill fly high

cause its been eighteen days
since i first held you
but to me it feels just like
it feels like a lifetime
im trying hard to rearrange
some say its the hardest thing to do
but thats just too many days
without you

and i know what they say
about all good things
will they come to an end
but ill fight this time
so that we might
have a chance at this
