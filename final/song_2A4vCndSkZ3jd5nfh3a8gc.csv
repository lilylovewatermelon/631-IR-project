chorus
i cannot love on no skeezer
that is a dub i dont need her
i hit her once then i leave her
blow up my phone for no reason
i cheated on you with a dancer
okay i surrender my hands up
at least i admit it i man up
i do not have all the answers
and i gotta stay with the nine these days
bitches that get niggas lined these days
and i am not with all the drama ayy
pop him just for movin’ wocky ayy
highbridge niggas they be wildin ayy
you sleepin on me but i’m wide awake
eliantte bring tsunamis ayy
jump inside the water ride the wave yeah

verse 1
up to no goodie i put on my hoodie
got sick of margielas got rid of the truey
and im on a private jet gettin some pussy
givenchy givenchy my luggage is louis
dont wanna stress you no baby i just wanna sex you
undress you dont wanna caress you
dont wanna tell you i love you if i do not mean it
them niggas will say that to hit you
i love you i hate you i dont want you back now
go through some things that you cannot take back now
i reach out to people who dont reach me back now
i need you i need you it’s too late i’m mad now
i spazzed out they backed out the mag now they sat down
i love my life more than i love my lifestyle
i love my ice how it shine even when the lights out
she pulled my lights out but i swear no i
