verse 1
aiyyo when rakim allah attack its a wrap yall relax
the almanac just show me where the partys at
seminars and tracks whores comas and cardiacs
broads and cats screaming oh my god hes back
just imagine i hit the lab and get it crackin
a thousand styles in one verse rhythms will switch patterns
chicks get stabbed in the back till they get spasms
known to spit a magnum or split an atom
who woulda known that jesus would come back to the ghetto
on that level and that thorough like a black hero
and pack metal so rap rebels will back pedal
the pharaoh of five boroughs and take over the rap world
gettin bizarre hardcore this is for yall
the crib or the park play it when you get in the car
chill at the bar sip somethin or split a cigar
get with your dogs dont be alarmed this kid is the bomb

verse 2
uh yeah yo i used to paint this flow on ancient scrolls
and learn ta make this dough where gangstas roll
think like the late great capone when the bank is closed
its cats that claim they bold but they aint this cold
im from new york city even pretty chicks act up
niggas get clapped up you stack up they stick that up
put the strap up you think my name was kid back up
big niggas spittin noise pick that up or lift that up
raised by gangstas and gamblers hustlers con artists
and convicts killers and dons
drug dealers playas and pimps smooth talkers
stick up kids thugs real niggas and gods
haunted by every soul that lay dead in the turf
cursed by every spirit that never made it to birth
since the moon separated from earth
thats why they say im the greatest that ever orchestrated a verse

verse 3
ay yo we toast to that its the cat that broke backs
to a soul clap a smoke a track how dope is that
poet for rap wrote backs that most slack
that know rap before they turned coke to crack
to my dogs hearin sirens on and firearms
outcome die in wars or behind iron bars
the boulevard tire frauds when i evolve
try and rob my dialogue i am god
chicks moan just to get next to my throne
and sniff my cologne and get ra alone
sex spots at home im testosterone
caress spots stress drops bedrocks the bone
hit the floor its hot for 2003
hits galore who rock a style as wild as me
rest assure when i rock dance crowds and scream
bismillah irrahman irrahim its the
