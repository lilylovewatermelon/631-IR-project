alluring lassos slide on so smooth
tension made of razors
dragging across you
the flushing of eyes
couldnt cleanse your abrasions
deep inside consumed with guilt
im clothed in a bed of blankouts
dream suspicious strangers over night

righteous pharisees befriending
silent movements mar reinjuring god
the taste of absent minded actions outweigh forgiveness

briding a widow in spite of her venom
ive failed to mention your soul
three becoming two
such a left in criminal
only the mind of the temptress knows
actions are my remorse for amnesia

righteous pharisees befriending
silent movements mar reinjuring god
the taste of absent minded actions outweigh forgiveness

so close to healing the weak
turning into the enemy
paralyzing kings
you might also likewe are so self
righteous pharisees befriending
silent movements mar reinjuring god
the taste of absent minded actions outweigh forgivenessembed"
