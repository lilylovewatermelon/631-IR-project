you did good lick

verse 1 yung christ
i got the glock in my yoga pants
fucking that bitch in a yoga stance
swangin that k with an open stance
loaded from smoking that opium
stain a lil boy in the clothes hes in
all of my walls they closing in
5150 they tryna come get me
just minding my business and moseying
matte black smokin packs
panic attacks back to back
xanax on my lap debatin
should i relapse
but back to the hoe i was talkin bout
i just wanna put it up in her mouth
pimping up in my blood whats up cuz
thuggin that dirty south
four letters two numbers bitch grey59
three fingers in the air main bitch by my side
licky pull up in a quartеr mill and slaughter up your daughter
yung jesus with thеm forgi wheels dont walk he drive on water
anytime any place
any hood any state
good til it fuckin aint
woods to the fuckin face
ridin with my baby sage
lines on expensive plates
tears on my diamond chains
stoic never looking phased
poet when im spitting game game
show me how that pussy shaved shaved
dosage climbin with my shame shame
mama crying for my pain pain
will they ever understand no
can i even help my dad no
money fuckin up my fam
giving until theres nothing left
pulling up in that latest damn
choppa stay on me dont need no hands
prefer to be lonely dont need no friends
hoe we just fuckin i dont date fans
im with my cousin and talkin plans
went to my hood and i copped some land
blowing through my money like democrats
twostep on the irs fuck a tax
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeverse 2 romeo da black rose
why the fuck you look to me for help
there aint an ace in the cards i was dealt
im 31 still dont know how to take care of myself
honestly im scared that i might melt
leave behind a bunch of black spots on a white pelt
maybe in the next life ill come back as a nice belt ion know
theres a fine line between me and you
the biggest difference is ill snort that shit and probably puke
dodge and juke all the bullshit yall try and pull me through
but im still shining baby girl wylin
catch me riding by with that look in my eyes
palms start to sweat by the way im gripping my 9
yeah im always on my toes but im still the same height
standing tall over my grave
make sure its filled with all the people we supposedly saved
make sure you throw the plaques in and all the money we made
i cant put them on my wall that shit just aint my taste
it aint my taste it aint my taste
lil shawty wanna marry me i said youre better off in debt
if it didnt work out baby ill be real hard to forget
german whips and private jets private beaches to access
fuck on me baby im still a mess and no that aint a threat
i ride for my family thats grey59
try and be all i can be and not waste my time
on the brink of insanity i cant make up my mind
yeah i battle my vanity and i think im blind
outro yung christ  romeo da black rose
four letters two numbers bitch grey59
three fingers in the air
three fingers in the air
four letters two numbers bitch grey59
three fingers in the air m
three fingers in the air main
i ride for my family thats grey59
i ride for my family thats grey59
try and be all i can be and i waste my titititime
try and be all i can be and i waste my time8embed"
