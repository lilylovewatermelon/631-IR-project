weightlessness no gravity
were we somewhere inbetween
i’m a ghost of you you’re a ghost of me
a bird’seye view of san luis

verse 2
oh highway boys all sleeping in
with their dirty mouths and broken strings
oh their eyes are shining like the sea
for you the queen of san luis
i’m a ghost of you you’re a ghost of me
a bird’seye view of san luis

bridge
cutting through the avenues
id always find my way to you
beside the hook the hammer lies
fumbling round in the smoke
spending time chasing ghosts
hold me down hold me down child
hold me down hold me down child

verse 3
california called you queen
with your golden hair and magazine
were you somewhere inbetween
fast asleep a flying dream

im a ghost of you you’re a ghost of me
a bird’seye view of san luis
im a ghost of you you’re a ghost of me
a bird’seye view of san luis
im a ghost of you you’re a ghost of me
a bird’seye view of san luis
im a ghost of you you’re a ghost of me
