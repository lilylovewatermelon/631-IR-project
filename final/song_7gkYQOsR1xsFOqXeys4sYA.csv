verse 1
yall dont know about my biggie wars
who you thought kick in the door was for
but thats my heart yall still trippin off the jigga shit
real niggas listen up and ima tell you how the whole thing start
off top i brung queens up from hard times
rockin at the fever streets was all mine
it was my version of the blues droppin out schools
the crack epidemic had rap representin new rules
so i got in them shoes tried em wore them
wasnt a perfect fit so i couldnt sport em
young murderers ride i knew all them
jungle got shot will died we was warrin
i wrote it in my album
i was 18 when lake seen the island and lord held me down and
my surroundings started changin i had a baby
i was makin my rounds with az
niggas started noticin my flow and was open when
the golden child closed em in
with more style than them older men
puff tried to start a label prince rakeem had formed wutang
snoop and dre had a new thing
so puff drove his new range through queensbridge projects
he let me drive it before ready to die hit
big and i hit blunts performin at the ark
next thing you knew big blew and all the ballin starts
he had kim in his crew i found fox
only niggas in new york with number one charts
big was ahead of his time him and raekwon
my niggas but dig it they couldnt get along
thats when ghostface said it on the purple tape
bad boy bitin nas album cover wait
big told me rae was stealin my slang
and rae told me out in shaolin big would do the same thing
but i borrowed from both them niggas
jigga started to flow like us but hit with aint no niggas
had much versace swagger
big admired the brooklynite and took him in as iceberg the rappers
today dont know nothin about this boss shit
theres more shit to wantin to be this king of new york shit
uhh uhh uhh

verse 2
rap became a version of malcolm and martin
rest in peace will queensbridge live on
theres some ghetto secrets i cant rhyme in this song
theres some missing pieces i had to leave out
had lost trust for steve stoute at some point til i got to know him
we old friends but whats loyal
puff soaked interscope offices with champagne bottles on steve
and steve thought the dramas on me
cause previously it wouldve been against whoever
friends forever
however i learned with some niggas its all business
but im a street dude with morals
then this niggas with jigga too much
he used to say jay wanted my spot
i laughed stayed home never hung a lot
a quiet man who used to be alone plannin
baby moms thought i was too quiet couldnt stand it
she hit the streets later on she hittin the sheets
with a rapper who wanted me on his songs thinkin he strong
i taught her how to watch for cars who might follow
taught her street shit that i know
her weakness was shine yo
but thats her i aint mad baby it made me stronger
now i get my paper longer
illmatic i was boss it was written i flossed
one of the most creative lps ever to hit stores
in the firm i learned i am nastradamus
qbs finest oochie wally faced more problems
i gave it all up so i can chill at home with mama
she was gettin old and sick so i stayed beside her
we had the best times she asked would i make more songs
i told her not til i see her health get more strong
in the middle of that jay tried to sneak attack
assassinate my character degrade my hood
cause in order for him to be the don nas had to go
the gambino rules i understood
what yall want see i already had
the gift and the curse fuck that shit the first youll be last
im the mans man a rappers rapper
god son â€“ theyll be none after
i was scarface jay was manolo
it hurt me when i had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo
uhh uhh uhh
