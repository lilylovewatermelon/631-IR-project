dont wanna take it slow
i wanna take you home
and watch the world explode
from underneath your glow

prechorus
i wanna watch the way
you creep across my skull

chorus
you slowly enter
because you know my room
and then crawl your knees off
before you shake my tomb

verse 2
i wanna watch you close
i need to see for sure
after the tapings through
who do you think we can show

you creep across my skull

cause you know my room
and then you crawl your knees off
and then you shake my tomb
