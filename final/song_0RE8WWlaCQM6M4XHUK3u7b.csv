verse 1 luke bryan  karen fairchild
what you doing in this place
well i could probably ask you the same thing
another round girl what you think
if youre buying well you know ill drink
so make it seven on seven
do you want it on the rocks
a double shot of heaven
spilling out the top

chorus luke bryan  karen fairchild karen fairchild  luke bryan
and well go shot for shot for shot
til we forgot what we came here to forget
aint a clock a tick a tock thats gonna stop
a night we wont regret
so put your drink down throw your camera up
flip it around and snap a payback picture
ill send it to my ex ill send it to my ex
and send em both a text saying
we aint going home alone tonight
girl you aint gotta i aint gotta go
home alone tonight
