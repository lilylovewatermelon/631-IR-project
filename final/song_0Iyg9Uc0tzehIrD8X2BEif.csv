we grow apart just to be on our own
and we walk right next to all that we have known
give me your hand we can climb further up
and we climb the trees and the forest seems to be bigger now
oh we had so much more

chorus
i knew she was trouble from the first kiss
i could tell that something wasnt right with you
with you

verse 2
we take our time to see what is up ahead
but were scared of the past and what is left
well stay inside and never let out our hands
and well pretend that the world it will never end
no it will never end

chorus
i knew she was trouble from the first kiss
i could tell that something wasnt right with you
with you
i could feel it blowing in the night wind
i could tell that something wasnt right with you
with you

why dont you come back down so we can turn it around
why dont you ever know just to let it go
cause nothing comes around for you
so bring me back from one to two
and tell me what else i could do

chorus
i knew she was trouble from the first kiss
i could tell that something wasnt right with you
with you
i could feel it blowing in the night wind
i could tell that something wasnt right with you
with you

outro
why dont you come back down so we can turn it aroundembed"
