we were coastin on the coast when you opened my eyes
made me notice where the ocean is holding the sky right
i was blinded
your smile shining behind those green eyes
the horizon so enticing
please say youll be mine

hook
dont wake me up cause im in love with all that you are
you make me see the truth in things i think that you are
the remedy for everything it seems that you are
the truth itself cause nothing else can take me so far

verse 2
my afternoon dream when the world is speedin
i am still sleepin in my blue dream
and i know the meaning for all the seasons
you are the reason my love
my mind is open so wide since you came inside
i feel so alive
without you life just passes by passes by passes by

hook
dont wake me up cause im in love with all that you are
you make me see the truth in things i think that you are
the remedy for everything it seems that you are
the truth itself cause nothing else can take me so far
