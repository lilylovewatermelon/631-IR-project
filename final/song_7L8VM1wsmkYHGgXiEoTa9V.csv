you think youre smooth
you think that love cant get its hands on you

im living proof
a man aint that strong
you got no choice when the right one comes along

cause you cant run
and you cant hide
when loves got you in its sites
you might as well give up the fight
when it calls
cause you cant break the fall

you say its got no chance
you make no mistakes
cause youve been close to the edge before and walked away

but your days comin
dont kid yourself
and when it comes youll be down before you know you fellsee joe nichols liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likeembed"
