hidden memories come stealing from my mind
and i feel my own heart beating out the simple joy of living
and i wonder how i ever was that kind

but the wild road i was rambling was always out there calling
and you said a hundred times i should have died
then you reached down and touched me and lifted me up with you
so i believe it was a road i was meant to ride

chorus
im like a soldier getting over the war
im like a young man getting over his crazy days
like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
i dont have to do that anymore
im like a soldier getting over the war

there are nights i dont remember and pain thats been forgotten
and a lot of things i choose not to recall
there are faces that come to me in my darkest secret memories
faces that i wish would not come back at all

but in my dreams parade of lovers from the other times and places
theres not one that matters now no matter who
im just thankful for the journey and that ive survived the battles
and that my spoils of victory is you

im like a soldier getting over the war
im like a young man getting over his crazy days
like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
every day gets better than the day before
im like a soldier getting over the warembed"
