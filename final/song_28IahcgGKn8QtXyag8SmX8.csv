can somebody explain to me
why everybody is tryna be
livin like a celebrity doin what they see on mtv
ice is cool but im looking for more
simple things is what my heart beats for
cause thats me
i dont ask for much
baby having you is enough

chorus
you aint got to buy nothin
its not what i want
baby its you
we dont have to go nowhere
its not what i want
baby its you
its not bout what you got i know you got a lot
no matter what you do you always get it hot its you its you
baby all i want is you yeah

verse 2
it dont matter that your car is fly fly
and your rims are spinnin on the side and
it dont matter where we go tonight
cause if im with you ill be all right
thats cool but im lookin for more
its your love that my heart beats for
cause thats me
dont have to spend a dime
