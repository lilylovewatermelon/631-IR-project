verse 1
dont fall down tonight youre alive and so am i
hold on we might hotwire this old car
and drive

verse 2
sticks and stones they say but we dont have bones inside our brains
if bones are the walls between you and i then i feel pretty tempted
to beat myself with sticks and stones anyway
ive got a ray gun in my bag a treasure map under my hat
and ill never miss a headshot or a dotted line
ive spent way too much time thinkin about dreamin about life
to miss the point which is just listen
cause ive listened for minesee cavetown liveget tickets as low as 86you might also like9embed"
