tryna be all that i can be for you
when youre not with me its hard because its lonely
honesty i told em im in love with you
but theyre okay with bein number two
driftin us apart
i aint did nothin wrong yet
im tempted when youre gone
cause i dont do well alone dont do well alone
they want me more than ever now
and im scared that i want em too

a man with flaws when the song end
my options come callin
