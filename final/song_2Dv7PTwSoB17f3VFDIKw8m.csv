now dissolve me
two tabs on your tongue
a herd of shepherds to herd the sheep
sleep now my only one
broken sweethearts ah
who sleep apart
both still pine for the others side spine
spoon as sleep starts

prechorus
and pulse to pulse
now shush

chorus
she makes the sound the sound the sea makes
to calm me down

verse 2
i am seethrough
soap sliver youre so thin
as i begin rubbing lathers out
your state worsens on my skin
and gold
fatless finger to lip
onetwo threefour hush

and pulse to pulse

chorus
she makes the sound the sound the sea makes
to calm me down
she makes the sound the sound the sea makes
im tired now
