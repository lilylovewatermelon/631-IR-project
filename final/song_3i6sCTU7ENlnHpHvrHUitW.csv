verse 1
my mind sometimes gets dark and wild
my mind sometimes
i don’t wan be bothered
inhale exhale breathin just got a lil harder
i mean well i mean well
alls well it ends well
inhale exhale
losin my sanity prolly
ill see you in hell
yeah ima meet you there
as of lately my demons they bother me
when i’m sleepin’ they sittin on top of me
and wherever i go they’ll follow me
i fell into the pit and its bottomless
they want my soul but it isnt my property
try to take it from me demonic robbery
crazy the way that the devilll lie to me
just leave me alone i could do bad on my own
i get high off my ass on my own
paranoia is strong
what if she don’t love me no more
i hope im wrong

refrain
ohohoh there aint no place like home
i wanna go back home
i hate the world we know

verse 2
mind fumblin fumblin fumblin fumblin
i wonder if wonder if wonder if wonder if
im gonna live gonna live
all these threats that i get from my enemies
wonder why i keep a 40 right next to me
scared of niggas runnin in my vicinity
ima be the killer aint no one killin me
thats a better choice like votin for hillary
where im from niggas dont give a fuck
so we loadin up and shootin like documentary
numb to the core
i dont wanna feel shit anymore
i dont wanna feel rich anymore
know that they want me dead
so im takin meds until i fall on the floor
i dont know who to call anymore
i dont know what to call it anymore
tears fall like raindrops but nah i dont wanna ball anymore
pick up the rock score
i pill pop some more
why it numbs me inside
i know it aint right but its part of the ride
refrain
there aint no place like home
i wanna go back home
i hate the world we know
there aint no place like home
i wanna go back home
i hate the world we know55embed"
