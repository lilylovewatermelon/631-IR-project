johnny yuma was a rebel
he roamed through the west

he wandered alone

he got fighting mad this rebel lad
he packed no star as he wandered far
where the only law was a hook and a draw
the rebel johnny yuma
away away away rolled the rebel

he was panther quick and leather tough
if he figured that hed been pushed enough
the rebel johnny yuma
