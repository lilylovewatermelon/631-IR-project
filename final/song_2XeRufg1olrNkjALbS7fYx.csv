i took her daddy’s old twohorse trailer
i patched a place in the floor that was bare
and we loaded up her barrel pony
and a rigging bag is all that i had
left with our suitcases filled with desire
four hundred dollars two good spare tires

chorus
now our windshield’s a painting that hangs in our room
changes with each mile like a radio tune
we got up above we’ll make it on love
under the rodeo moon

verse 2
sometimes we sleep in a hotel
when we’re riding that hot hand of luck
sometimes we crash at a friend’s house
sometimes we just sleep in the truck
at nighttime you’ll find us out in the fast lane
staying one step ahead of snow wind and rain

chorus
now our windshield’s a painting that hangs in our room
changes with each mile like a radio tune
we got up above we’ll make it on love
under the rodeo moon

yeah we left with our suitcases filled with desire
four hundred dollars two good spare tires

chorus
now our windshield’s a painting that hangs in our room
changes with each mile like a radio tune
we got up above we’ll make it on love
under the rodeo moonembed"
