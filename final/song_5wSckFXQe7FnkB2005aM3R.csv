i dont care to be scared
when i drive my haunted car
ghost red hot tonight
my gaze in the rearview mirror

yes i see the backseat of my car
oh i see the backseat of my car

shopping bags falling down
apples roll magazine crumpled
in the heat of night
milk leaks sucked up by the velvet

cause i see the backseat of my car
yes i see the backseat of my car
oh i see the backseat of my car

hop in the back
how far do you want to go
