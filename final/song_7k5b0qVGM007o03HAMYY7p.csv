stood together outside i dont even know what
was going through my mind now i think it was love
i never knew i could find someone who i thought was dumb
but made my heart go badadum badadum
and i was so scared for my life but i said that i would rather try
and im pretty sure im out of time hahaha
and i throw my meds straight into the mud
cause it doesnt seem to help me when im falling in love
and my stomach hurts but i dont mention the blood
i think i might need a doctor for the mess that ive become
oh i found it hard to breathe
its getting dark out dont you think
tell me or is it just me

chorus
then she took my coat cause it was cold
and we took pictures with her phone
she left her polaroid at home
i texted all my friends i wrote that
i was falling for this girl
her eyes were glowing hazel pearls
i told her that she was my world
and she said yeah she said no

postchorus
yeah she said no
yeah she said no
yeah she said no
yeah she said—

you probably dont give a fuck who i am
i dont blame you i hate me too
but i cant do a lot to change it
or the thoughts in my head
i am faceless im nameless im better off dead
thats too far im so sorry please excuse my mess
im so stupid so worthless i wont do it again
that i promise you im just a boy with a pen
and a ukulele is it not evident
that im broken im frozen im stuck in my bed oh
i was hoping youd open me up ohoh
but instead my emotions took over my mind oh
and i said that i hate you oh
i hate that i wish you were dead ohoh

chorus
then she took my coat cause it was cold ohoh
and we took pictures with her phone ohoh
she left her polaroid at home ohoh
i texted all my friends i wrote that
i was falling for this girl ohoh
her eyes were glowing hazel pearls
i told her that she was my world ohoh
