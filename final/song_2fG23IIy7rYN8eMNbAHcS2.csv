you turn on the light then you turn it back off
cause sleepin alone yeah it aint what you thought
its the drip of the sink its the click of the clock
and youre wonderin if im sleepin
you heard from your friends that im doin okay
and youre thinkin that maybe you made a mistake
and you want me to know but i dont wanna know how youre feeling

chorus
keep it to yourself oh
if you think that you still love me
put it on a shelf oh
if youre looking for someone
make it someone else
when youre drunk and its late
and youre missin me like hell
keep it to yourself

verse 2
if you see me out and im standing alone
well it dont mean that im gonna need a ride home
if you walk up to me like it aint what it is
i know that it aint gonna end with a kiss

chorus
so keep it to yourself oh
if you think that you still love me
put it on a shelf oh
if youre looking for someone
make it someone else
when youre drunk and its late
and youre missin me like hell
just keep it to yourself
yeah keep it to yourself
yeah when youre drunk and its late
and youre sad and you hate goin home alone
cause youre missin me like hell
keep it to yourself
yeah keep it to yourself
