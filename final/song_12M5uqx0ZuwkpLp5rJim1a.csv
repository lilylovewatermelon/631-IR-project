we were in the backseat
drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
i rent a place on cornelia street
i say casually in the car
we were a fresh page on the desk
filling in the blanks as we go
as if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
leading us home

chorus
and i hope i never lose you hope it never ends
id never walk cornelia street again
thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
id never walk cornelia street again
and baby i get mystified by how this city screams your name
and baby im so terrified of if you ever walk away
id never walk cornelia street again
id never walk cornelia street again

verse 2
windows flung right open autumn air
jacket round my shoulders is yours
we bless the rains on cornelia street
memorize the creaks in the floor
back when we were card sharks playing games
i thought you were leading me on
i packed my bags left cornelia street
before you even knew i was gone

you hold my hand on the street
walk me back to that apartment
years ago we were just inside
barefoot in the kitchen
sacred new beginnings
that became my religion listen
