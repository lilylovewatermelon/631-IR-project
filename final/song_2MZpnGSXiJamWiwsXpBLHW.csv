verse 1
i can hardly make you mine
tell it to you all the time
at the end of a long day
and when i wake

verse 2
if you could just give me sign
we could leave it all behind
stop taking the long way
before we play

chorus
i dont think i can make it
can i owe you one
still i lead on the days
like a loaded gun

solo

verse 3
i can hardly make you mine
tell it to you all the time
but you never wanted
you had to take
you might also likeverse 4
so i could never give you up
i guess that this is just a crush
for the end of the long day
and when i wake

bridge
but i know youre not the one or the only only
but we both know what its like to be lonely lonely
but these fantasies they left us longing
boy just bring my love back to me
i guess for now this is how itll be

chorus with brian
i dont think i can make it
can i owe you one owe you one owe you one
still i lead on the days
like a loaded gun loaded gun loaded gun
i dont think i can make it
can i owe you one owe you one owe you one
still i lead on the days
like a loaded gun loaded gun loaded gun6embed"
