out beyond the call of duty
hold your instincts hostage and stick near me
lets drink a toast
its the most i can stand to cry
about the mental energy you wasted on this wedding invitation
lets thank the host
youve been such a great host
the roast was just so perfectly prepared

chorus
now i know you care
now i know you care
we are underused
we are underused

verse 2
simply put i want to grow old
dying does not meet my expectations
lets drink a toast to all those who arrived alive
to tell about their struggles in hushed tones around a fire
its late winter
lets sink the ship
mix our blood just the tip
a crip is sleeping on the basement stairs
