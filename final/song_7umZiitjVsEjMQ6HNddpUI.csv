look i love her curves but whats more preferred
is the way she articulates words
cant help observe and stare when she in the mirror
masking the massacre while she fixing her hair
i mean she’s so perfect in her own little world
we built the foundation everything i want in a girl
and its a matter of time until her last name mine
you got potential baby just imagine us combined
i wanna see you shine like the gem that you are
want you be so secure that they can see from afar
that you dont need not a man and you can stand on your own
lets keep stacking your bread and one day we gon get gone
and get away from here
youre the only reason i be staying here
wanna paint a picture lets make it clear
the future so bright baby race you there girl

verse 2 joey bada
look girl you talk too much need to relax
no stress please just please roll us a fat
blunt so we can smoke and fill the room with love
you buzz cause im feelin the groove with this one
come take you a sip lets dance under the moon
the way that its lit got me feelin the mood
to vibe and be tuned im so into you
lets lose track of the night and stay up til its noon
watch the sun rise and watch the moon fall
asleep if you will surprise when you spawn
back from the world of infinite beyond
roll your eyes back and lets keep on goin
come take a ride ill be your chauffeur
i wanna make you sing to me as your toes curl
i love it when she doing all the things i showed her
i thank the lord for her man i swear i owe her
