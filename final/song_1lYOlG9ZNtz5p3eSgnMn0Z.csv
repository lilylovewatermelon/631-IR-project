i met him in a crowded room
where people go to drink away their gloom
he sat me down and so began
the story of a charmless man
educated the expensive way
he knows his claret from his beaujolais
i think hed like to have been ronnie kray
but then nature didnt make him that way

refrain
he went nanananana nana
nanananana nana nana

chorus 1
he thinks his educated airs those family shares
will protect him that well respect him
he moves in circles of friends who just pretend
that they like him he does the same to them
and when you put it all together
theres the model of a charmless man

refrain
nanananana nana
nanananana nana nana
see blur liveget tickets as low as 995you might also likeverse 2
he knows the swingers and their cavalry
says he can get in anywhere for free
i began to go a little crosseyed
and from this charmless man i just had to hide

refrain
he went nanananana nana
nanananana nana nana

chorus 2
he talks at speed he gets nose bleeds
he doesnt see his days are tumbling down upon him
and yet he tries so hard to please
hes just so keen for you to listen but no ones listening
and when you put it all together
theres the model of a charmless man

chorus 1
he thinks his educated airs those family shares
will protect him that youll respect him
and yet he tries so hard to please
hes just so keen for you to listen but no ones listening
and when you put it all together
theres the model of a charmless man
refrain
nanananana nana
nanananana nana nana
nanananana nana nana
