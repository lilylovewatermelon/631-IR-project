i dont wanna do this
over and over yeah

verse 1
hes a man so full of style and grace
any womand be impressed
takes a smile and paints it on your face
makes you feel like youve been blessed
promises things so special
seems to come right from a song
soon as you begin to feel secure yeah
you turn around and he is gone oh

chorus
packin his bags gotta go gotta go
packin his bags gotta go
hes a samsonite man

verse 2
maybe he is just a rollin stone
wandering from here to there
searchin for a place to call his own
you wonder if he even cares
so many years of heartache and pain
is all you seem to know him for
is it you or is it he to blame
whenever he walks out your door oh
