who spoke the earth and sky to form
who sets the sun and calls the dawn
who breathed me out of dust to life
with the will to trust or run and hide

chorus
and i will stay should the world by me fold
lift up your name as the darkness falls
i will wait and hold fast to your word
heart on your heart and my eyes on yours

verse 2
who loved me through my rebel way
who chose to carry all my shame
who breathes in me with endless life
the king of glory jesus christ

chorus
and i will stay should the world by me fold
lift up your name as the darkness falls
i will wait and hold fast to your word
heart on your heart and my eyes on yours
