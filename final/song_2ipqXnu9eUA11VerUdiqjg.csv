some days i feel like i let myself down
i love my life gonna run it in the ground
cant sleep for days got your name in my brain
cant sleep for days gotta stay up stay up forever

verse 1 machine gun kelly
im writing this at 53666 in the morning
wide awake still not even yawning
not even sure why im up at dawn like im celebrating
when my agent told me that no ones calling
its a ounce in my living room on the couch
next to a couple homies that smoked it and passed out
so im alone with my thoughts in this glass house
in the cabinet are glass vials i just poured all the last out
i smelled her now shes on my mind
i met her the first time my light turned lime
hate it when shes gone but she aint hard to find
left her on my desk she made designs in little lines

chorus phem
some days i feel like i let myself down
i love my life gonna run it in the ground
cant sleep for days got your name in my brain
cant sleep for days gotta stay up stay up forever

ayy look im writing this at 53666 in the evening
in my head talking to these demons demons
in my bed staring at these ceilings
i just bleached my hair and changed my whole appearance
im just fed up with these smoke and mirrors
my uncle sold some pictures of me with no clearance
what the fuck is family i cant take that serious
thank god everybody sucks so i can write these lyrics
go pick her up i need to lift my spirits
they dont know that we hook up i dont let cameras near us
theres some shit i do when shes around i shouldnt share
like that week i spent locked in a room with her in paris fuck
