she paints her fingers with a close precision
he starts to notice empty bottles of gin
and takes a moment to assess the sin shes paid for
a lonely speaker in a conversation
her words are swimming through his ears again
theres nothing wrong with just a taste of what you paid for

prechorus
say what you mean tell me im right
and let the sun rain down on me
give me a sign i wanna believe

chorus
whoaohohohoh mona lisa
youre guaranteed to run this town
whoaohohohoh mona lisa
id pay to see you frown

verse 2
he senses something call it desperation
another dollar another day
and if she had the proper words to say she would tell him
but shed have nothing left to sell him

prechorus
say what you mean tell me im right
and let the sun rain down on me
give me a sign i wanna believe
