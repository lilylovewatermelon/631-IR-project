when i met you woman
i couldnt help but notice a face so beautiful
now imagine the faces you would make if we ever made love
oh oh oh oh

verse 1
pulled up in the drop top benz
hit the horn two times and you walked outside
dress keep hugging them thighs and the only thing inside my mind is
i want you yes i do and if theres anything you suggest i do then tell me
now we all in the crib on my sofa
girl im so glad you came over
i wanna tell you come closer
but i dont know if you feel like i feel tell me girl

prechorus
dont it feel good when i touch on it
wouldnt it be nice if all night i was in you
come kiss me come with me down the hall to my bedroom
tonight well be

chorus
making love faces
making love faces
shadows on the wall while the candles burning
messing up the bed while you sweating out your perm and
making love faces
making love faces
my hands rubbing on your skin
lets go hard dont hold it in
