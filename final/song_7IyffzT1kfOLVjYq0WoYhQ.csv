theres just a hint of indifference
in her lack of conversation when we talk
and the subject matters change
theres no mention of our future now at all
she still kisses me each morning
but it seems more like a habit than before
i know she still loves me
but i dont think she likes me anymore

verse 2
she used to laugh at all my jokes
but lately i cant seem to make her smile
and the last time we made love it was good
but god its been a while
shes always there when i get home
but shes no longer waiting at the door
i know she still loves me
but i dont think she likes me anymore

bridge
cause its just a little colder every time i hold her
shes just going through the motions
from whats left of her devotion
and it scares me half to death
wonderin what tomorrow holds in store
i know she still loves me
but i dont think she likes me anymore

right now i know she loves me
but i dont think she likes me anymoreembed"
