bitch i aint sleep in days
i ​aint got a break yeah i dont take no breaks
pushing two hundred in that jeeper creepers and i aint hit the brakes
if you wanna live like this you gotta be flawless no mistakes
used to eat them noodles in the basement now its steak
yeah i be so high i be forgetting whats at stake
bitch just pulled up on me ate my dick now she want stay
yeah flawless all my diamonds now my wrist turn to a lake
pour some wock up in that pineapple fanta sipping laker
yeah they really on they last breath they on they stimulator
i just bought a m3

yeah money sex and drugs bitch thats all i need
i be high flying with my doves where my birdies be yeah
