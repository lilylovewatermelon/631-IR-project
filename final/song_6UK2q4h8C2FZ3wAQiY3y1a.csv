wasnt a stone i didnt throw when i wrecked it
my foolish words so cruel and cold were disconnected
tell me why when she cried all i did was close my eyes

chorus
if she could see me now
if she could see me breaking down
maybe shed turn around
if she could see me now

verse 2
now the sunshine feels like rain trying to drown me
and the world feels out of place all around me
so i wait and i pray ill run into her someday

chorus
if she could see me now
if she could see me breaking down
maybe shed turn around
if she could see me now

bridge
so many things i wish i could tell her show her
just how bad i really need her miss her love her

if she could see me now
if she could see me breaking down
maybe shed turn around
if she could see me now
if she could see me breaking down
maybe shed turn around
if she could see me now if she could see me now2embed"
