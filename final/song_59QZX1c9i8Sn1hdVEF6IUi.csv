its just the way the game is played
its best if you just wait your turn

bridge
the wait is over the wait is over
the wait is over the wait is over
the wait is over the wait is over
the wait is over the wait is over

verse 1
i pitch with a grenade
swing away if youre feeling brave
theres so much power in my name
if you pop off and you say it
stadium gon do the wave
im such a fucking lady
you dont have to be so afraid
cause i got room up on my team
you can play but hold up

refrain
its just the way the game is played
its best if you just wait your turn

chorus
its getting crowded over here
but babe the wait is over
sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
the wait is over
fumble dont you fumble thats a flag on the play
babe if you dont wanna then you dont have to wait
but together we gon be taking over

its just the way
the game is played

wait your turn

verse 2
so you dont wanna wait
i hate to hear that such a shame
cause if you play it sideways aint no timeout in my game

i know you want to win
and you wish i would let you in

its just the way the game is played
its best if you just wait your turn
