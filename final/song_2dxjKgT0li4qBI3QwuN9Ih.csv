verse 1 kanye west
back when they thought pink polos would hurt the roc
before cam got the shit to pop
the doors was closed
i felt like bad boys street team i couldnt work the locks
now lets go take em back to the plan
me and my momma hopped in that uhaul van
any pessimists i aint talk to them
plus i aint have no phone in my apartament
lets take em back to the club
least about an hour i stand on line
i just wanted to dance i went to jacob an hour
after i got my advance i just wanted to shine
jay favorite line dawg in due time
now he look at me like damn dawg you where i am
a hiphop legend
i think i died in that accident ‘cause this must be heaven

verse 2 kanye west
back when gucci was the shit to rock
back when slick rick got the shit to pop
id do anything to say i got it
damn them new loafers hurt my pocket
before anybody wanted k west beats
me and my girl split the buffet at kfc
dog i was havin nervous breakdowns
like man these niggas that much better than me
baby im goin on an aeroplane
and i dont know if ill be back again
sure enough i sent the plane tickets
but when she came to kick it things became different
any girl i cheated on sheets i skeeted on
couldnt keep it at home thought i needed a nia long
im tryin to right my wrongs
but its funny them same wrongs helped me write this song now
chorus kanye west
i gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin extra fly
fore the day you die you gon touch the sky
you gon touch the sky baby girl testify
come up in the spot lookin extra fly
fore the day you die you gon touch the sky
verse 3 lupe fiasco
yes yes yes guess whos on third
lupe steal like lupin the 3rd
here like ear til im beer on the curb
peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
lets slow it down like were on the syrup
bottleshaped body like mrs butterworth
but before you say another word
im back on the block like im layin on the street
im tryna stop lyin like im mummra
but im not lyin when im layin on the beat en garde
or touché lupe cool as the unthawed
but i still feel possessed as a gun charge
come as correct as a porn star
in a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
so i represent the first
now let me end my verse right where the horns are like uh
chorus kanye west
i gotta testify
come up in the spot lookin extra fly
fore the day you die you gon touch the sky
you gon touch the sky baby girl testify
come up in the spot lookin extra fly
fore the day you die you gon touch the sky
