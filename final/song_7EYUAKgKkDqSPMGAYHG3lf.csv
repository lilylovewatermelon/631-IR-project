like a long lonely stream
i keep running towards a dream
moving on moving on
like a branch on a tree
i keep reaching to be free
moving on moving on

chorus
cause theres a place in the sun
where theres hope for everyone
where my poor restless hearts gotta run
theres a place in the sun
and before my life is done
gotta find me a place in the sun

verse 2
like an old dusty road
i get weary from the load
moving on moving on
like this tired troubled earth
ive been rolling since my birth
moving on moving on

chorus
cause theres a place in the sun
where theres hope for everyone
where my poor restless hearts gotta run
i know theres a place in the sun
and before my life is done
gotta find me a place in the sun

and youre feeling sad

chorus
yes theres a place in the sun
where theres hope for everyone
where my poor restless hearts gotta run
i know theres a place in the sun2embed"
