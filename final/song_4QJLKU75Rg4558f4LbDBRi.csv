my best friend gave me the best advice
he said each days a gift and not a given right
leave no stone unturned leave your fears behind
and try to take the path less traveled by
that first step you take is the longest stride
what if what if

chorus 1
if today was your last day
and tomorrow was too late
could you say goodbye to yesterday what if what if
would you live each moment like your last
leave old pictures in the past
donate every dime you have
what if what if
if today was your last day
what if what if
if today was your last day

verse 2
against the grain should be a way of life
whats worth the prize is always worth the fight
every second counts cause theres no second try
so live like youll never live it twice
dont take the free ride in your own life
what if what if

if today was your last day
and tomorrow was too late
could you say goodbye to yesterday what if what if
would you live each moment like your last
leave old pictures in the past
donate every dime you have what if what if
and would you call old friends you never see
reminisce old memories
would you forgive your enemies what if what if
would you find that one youre dreamin of
swear up and down to god above
that you finally fall in love that you finally fall in love
if today was your last day

bridge
if today was your last day
would you make your mark by mending a broken heart
you know its never too late to shoot for the stars
regardless of who you are
so do whatever it takes takes
cause you cant rewind a moment in this life
let nothin stand in your way way
cause the hands of time are never on your side

chorus 2
if today was your last day
and tomorrow was too late
could you say goodbye to yesterday
would you live each moment like your last
leave old pictures in the past
donate every dime you have what if what if
and would you call old friends you never see
reminisce old memories
would you forgive your enemies what if what if
would you find that one youre dreamin of
swear up and down to god above
that you finally fall in love what if what if
if today was your last day18embed"
