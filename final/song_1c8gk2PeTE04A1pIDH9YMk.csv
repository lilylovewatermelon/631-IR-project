theres a fire starting in my heart
reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark
finally i can see you crystal clear
go ahead and sell me out and ill lay your shit bare
see how ill leave with every piece of you
dont underestimate the things that i will do
theres a fire starting in my heart
reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark

prechorus
the scars of your love remind me of us
they keep me thinkin that we almost had it all
the scars of your love they leave me breathless
i cant help feeling

chorus
we couldve had it all youre gonna wish you never had met me
rolling in the deep tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand youre gonna wish you never had met me
and you played it to the beat tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep

verse 2

but ive heard one on you now im gonna make your head burn
