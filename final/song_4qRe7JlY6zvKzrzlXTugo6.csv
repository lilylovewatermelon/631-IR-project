we killed a lot of innocent civilians
to us every civilian in baghdad was a terrorist
these fedayeen are now in civilian clothes
that makes everybody free game
but if they came within our perimeter we lit em up
and when we would pull the body out
and we would search the car
we would find nothing
this took place time and time again
no harm no foul
thats okay dont worry about it
because this is a new type of war
this is an eradication
