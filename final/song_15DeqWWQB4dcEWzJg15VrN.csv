i was ridin shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
hes got a onehand feel on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
i look around turn the radio down
he says baby is something wrong
i say nothin i was just thinkin
how we dont have a song
and he says

chorus
our song is a slamming screen door
sneakin out late tapping on your window
when were on the phone and you talk real slow
cause its late and your mama dont know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date man i didnt kiss her and i should have
and when i got home fore i said amen
askin god if he could play it again

verse 2
i was walking up the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong and been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway well on my way to my lovin bed
i almost didnt notice all the roses
and the note that said
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likechorus
our song is a slamming screen door
sneakin out late tapping on your window
when were on the phone and you talk real slow
cause its late and your mama dont know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date man i didnt kiss her and i should have
and when i got home fore i said amen
askin god if he could play it again

ive heard every album listened to the radio
waited for somethin to come along
that was as good as our song

chorus
cause our song is a slamming screen door
sneakin out late tapping on his window
when were on the phone and he talks real slow
cause its late and his mama dont know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date man i didnt kiss him and i should have
and when i got home fore i said amen
askin god if he could play it again
postchorus
play it again oh yeah

outro
i was ridin shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
i grabbed a pen and an old napkin
and i wrote down our song36embed"
