and it came to me then that every plan
is a tiny prayer to father time
as i stared at my shoes in the icu
that reeked of piss and 409
and i rationed my breaths as i said to myself
that id already taken too much today
as each descending peak on the lcd
took you a little farther away from me
away from me

verse 2
amongst the vending machines and yearoldâ€‹ magazines
in a place where we only say goodbye
it stung like a violent wind that our memories depend
on a faulty camera in our minds
and i knew that you were a truth i would rather lose
than to have never lain beside at all
and i looked around at all the eyes on the ground
as the tv entertained itself

bridge
cause theres no comfort in the waiting room
just nervous paces bracing for bad news
and then the nurse comes round and everyone lifts their head
but im thinking of what sarah said
that love is watching someone die
see death cab for cutie liveget tickets as low as 147you might also likechorus
so whos gonna watch you die
so whos gonna watch you die
so whos gonna watch you die
