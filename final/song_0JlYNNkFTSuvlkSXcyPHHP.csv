verse 1 the game  dr dre
what happened in hiphop that got pac and big shot
the thicks blocks now every rapper claim he let his clip pop
but even myself tote a gun and know to run than get shot
ive been there before now im fuckin with doc
gotta do them calvin broadus numbers
if not i pitch rocks anticipatin my incarceration
media think im fakin like mason but when it comes to mace
fuck r kelly i dont take it in the face
i find out who sprayed it and im puttin you under the pavement
no buddhist priest catholic or baptist pastor can save him
im far from religious but i got beliefs
so i put canary yellow diamonds in my jesus piece
i came back from the dead without a part of my chest
laid in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
i waited for 3 years while everybody else dropped
now i understand why nas did a song with his pops

im ready to die without a reasonable doubt
smoke chronic and hit it doggystyle before i go out
until they sign my death certificate all eyez on me

ready to die without a reasonable doubt
smoke chronic and hit it doggystyle before i go out
until they sign my death certificate all eyez on me
im still at it illmatic and thats the documentary the documentary

verse 2 the game
if i die my niggas
fuck it i did a song with mary blige my niggas
got a hook from faith no verse from jay
i guess on westside story he thought i spit in his face
told ed lover  moni love i was talkin to ja
with that maybach line it was payback time
keep fuckin with me nigga ill put you under me
take your car and trade it in for eight 300 zs
if you cross my t ill dot your eyes
youll do life in a cemetery ill do mine with shyne
come home sit in the throne with my legs crossed
and my air forces middle finger up fuck the world
cause im feelin like puff when life after death hit
mo money mo problems and i lost my best friend
im the second dopest nigga from compton youll ever hear
the first nigga only put out albums every 7 years
interlude radio interview
you know what speaking of jay
that just makes me roll down
now your song westside story
uh oh
you got a line that says
i dont do button up shirts
or drive maybachs
is that a shot at jay
nah i was talkin about ja rule
yeah so i mean i justii got a lot of respect for jay
you know what im sayin
i never take shots at legends
i justthats just somethin i dont do

verse 3 the game  busta rhymes
let me tell you why i do this shit
im a son of a gun cause moms was a hoover crip
first day i got signed i had to prove i spit
freestyle with busta rhymes son duke is sick
the protégé of doc dre i could finally put the shoes on
now that the rumors of rakim and cube gone
they say truth hurts sunk like quicksand
dont stop me in traffic and ask about hittman
i gotta restore the feelin that crawled from under the rock
after tha dogg pound crushed the buildings
i got a family to feed im the middle of 9 children
we can talk about a loan after i sell 5 million
if i tell you i aint game and i dont know dre
you goin do me like xzibit and cut half my face
i take all the credit for puttin the west back on the map
if you aint feelin that guess im guerrilla black
chorus the game  dr dre
im ready to die without a reasonable doubt
smoke chronic and hit it doggystyle before i go out
until they sign my death certificate all eyez on me
im still at it illmatic and thats the documentary
ready to die without a reasonable doubt
smoke chronic and hit it doggystyle before i go out
until they sign my death certificate all eyez on me
im still at it illmatic and thats the documentary the documentary12embed"
