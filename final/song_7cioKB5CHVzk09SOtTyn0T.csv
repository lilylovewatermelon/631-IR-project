the winner is beyoncé knowles female pop vocalist
i would like to thank the judges for picking me

verse 1 beyoncé
and ive been driftin off on knowledge
catcalls on catwalks man these women gettin solemn
i could sing a psalm for a solomon or salamander
we took a flight at midnight and now my mind cant help but wonder how come
spoonfed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
when im lookin off the edge i preach my gut it cant help but ignore it
im climbin up the walls cause all the shit i hear is borin
all the shit i do is borin all these record labels borin
i dont trust these record labels im torn
all these people on the planet workin ninetofive just to stay alive
the ninetofive just to stay alive the ninetofive just to stay alive
the ninetofive just to stay alive the ninetofive just to stay alive
the ninetofive just to stay alive the ninetofive just to stay alive
all the people on the planet workin ninetofive just to stay alive how come
