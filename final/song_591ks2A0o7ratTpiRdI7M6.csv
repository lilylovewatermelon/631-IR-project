chorus
heart been broke so many times i dont know what to believe
mama say it’s my fault its my fault i wear my heart on my sleeve

verse
while in the cell with lil hakeem after i slapped him i had told him
i dont know how you get down with them clowns but im a soldier
no one could understand i had way too much aggression
that built over the years from my abandoned adolescence
see i done been lied to backstabbed and heartbroken
i wanted to cry but i was too afraid to open
prayin’ one day i’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
i spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
while at my nana house i play the couch starin at the ceiling
tryin’ not to get in my feelings
thinkin of a way i could make these millions
maybe thatll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days yeah

chorus
heart been broke so many times i dont know what to believe
mama say it’s my fault its my fault i wear my heart on my sleeve
think its best i put my heart on ice heart on ice cause i cant breathe
ima put my heart on ice heart on ice its gettin the best of me
