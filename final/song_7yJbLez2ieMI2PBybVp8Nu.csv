i was in the corner
drinking from the punch
yeah you were in the kitchen
cuttin’ up a rug
no need to complicate it
i had fallen in love
with you so underrated
something fillin’ up my lungs

refrain
every color of your love i’ve seen enough i want another
every color of your love i’ve seen enough i want another

chorus
hey little mamma when you talk back
i see your eyes light up
and i love that
i’m just a peach fuzz boy i’m so alone
no i don’t wanna miss you honey
come home

verse 2
knock knock you’re coming over
couple times a week
hanging on my shoulder
shaking like a leaf
you might also likerefrain
every color of your love i’ve seen enough i want another
every color of your love i’ve seen enough i want another

chorus
and hey little mamma when you talk back
i see your eyes light up
and i love that
i’m just a peach fuzz boy i’m so alone
no i don’t wanna miss you honey
come home

every color of your love i’ve seen enough i want another
every color of your love i’ve seen enough i want another
