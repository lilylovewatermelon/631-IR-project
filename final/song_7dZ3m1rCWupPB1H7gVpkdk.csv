yeah
and i cant feel my legs im a paraplegic
lord i want a fair one with my demons
karen meyers became married to jesus
born dead they had to dig up my fetus
and now the devil want to tear me to pieces
im a diagnosed insomniac
an astronaut who blastin off into the star galactic
on top of saturn foxtrottin with velociraptors
the dinoaliens invaded earth so they could feed on hypochondriacs
prepared for the rapture closet hillbilly
threw the spinners on the tractor i listen to uncle kracker but
thats white america for you we all that matters
im walkin backwards shadowboxin with karate masters
its more to rap we sell the royal crack at castle rock
a bad apple like an unemployed macintosh
we lost jobs now they brainwashed with dot com
its only so long until we surrender the free world to hong kong
chorus
and sinners stay still but the merry go round
and round
it all just keeps spinnin
gotta keep swimmin keep swimmin yeah keep swimmin
eat drink and let the merry go round
eat drink and let the merry go round
eat drink and let the merry go round
eat drink and let the merry go round yeah yeah
