back in my day i was always
cruising the road on sunday
making those tires spin your way
yeah it seems like yesterday
wed go swinging on the front porch
you were all mine and i was all yours
yeah those are the days i miss
a ten minute ride i could make it in five

chorus
this might sound crazy but maybe
youre thinking bout me tonight
cause im thinking bout you tonight
something bout the taste of a first love first touch
that dont ever seem to fade
now youre 600 miles away
and a ten hour drive
but if you called me tonight
i can make it in five

verse 2
the last i heard you were on the west coast
looking hotter than a texas summer
yeah girl i cant help but wonder
what youve seen what youve missed
what youve felt whove you kissed
girl you never crossed my mind
yeah you stay there all the time

and this might sound crazy but maybe
youre thinking bout me tonight
cause im thinking bout you tonight
something bout the taste of a first love first touch
that dont ever seem to fade
now youre 600 miles away
and a ten hour drive
but if you called me tonight
i can make it in five

verse 3
i dont know how many nights that ive spent staring at this phone
looking for your area code or some number yeah that i dont know
but the one that came up tonight is the one ive known all my life
its your mamas place and i heard your pretty voice say

outro
this might sound crazy
but are you thinking bout me tonight
cause im thinking bout you tonight yeah
something bout the taste of a first love first touch
that dont ever seem to fade
and i just need to see your face
its a ten minute drive this ol trucks gonna fly
ill be there in five
yeah baby sit tight
