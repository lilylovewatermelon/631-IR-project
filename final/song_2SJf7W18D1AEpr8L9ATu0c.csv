oh heres to my yesterday
no tomorrow without a yesterday

verse 1
all these years ive been searching
for who im supposed to be
all this time ive been wasting
cause i was right in front of me

prechorus
oh its a crooked old tradition
by a masterful magician
but in all this trouble ive met
i havent got one single regret no

chorus
heres to my future
heres to my yesterday
heres to change
oh heres to my yesterday
no tomorrow without a yesterday
heres to my future
goodbye to yesterday
yesterday

oh im a hopeless crash collision
cause im a hostage to my pride
and by my own volition

prechorus
its a crooked old tradition
by a masterful magician
but in all this trouble ive met
i havent got one single regret no

chorus
heres to my future
heres to my yesterday

oh heres to my yesterday
no tomorrow without a yesterday
heres to my future
goodbye to yesterday
yesterday

bridge
a new day you can go
you can do anything you wanna
its your play swing low
go high anywhere you wanna
you can reach for the moon
anywhere your dreams could take you
go astray fade away
just leave it to yesterday
chorus
heres to my future
heres to my yesterday
heres to change
oh heres to my yesterday
no tomorrow without a yesterday
heres to my future
goodbye to yesterday
