she doesnt look she doesnt see
opens up for nobody
figures out she figures out
narrow line she cant decide
everything short of suicide
never hurts nearly works

chorus
something is scratching its way out
something you wanna forget about

verse 2
a part of you thatll never show
youre the only one thatll ever know
take it back when it all began
take your time would you understand
what its all about
what its all about

chorus
something is scratching its way out
something you wanna forget about
no one expects you to get up
all on your own with no one around

chorus
something is scratching its way out
something you wanna forget about
no one expects you to get up
all on your own with no one around2embed"
