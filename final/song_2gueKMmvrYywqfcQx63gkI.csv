whisper in my ear
say youre something special
who cares if you mean it
just as long as i believe you
you always are sincere
i just wanna please you
take you out to eat
sit you down and feed you
baby when i think of you my problems go away
i hope that when you think of me that youll feel the same way
youre such a cutie pie that i would never think youd play me
like those other guys that you switch off from day to day

prechorus
oh i i swear i taught you everything you knew
so i i guess i really didnt have a clue
that you you had been with a few more than a few
its all good just make me feel good

chorus 1
cause i said fuck that put her on the map
ass so fat good head to match
yeah yeah yeah
so we say fuck that put her on the map
ass so fat good head to match
she rides me fast like shes running track

your daddy met your mommy
back when you were in her tummy
since you havent met your real father
i guess you can call me your daddy
do things that make me happy
and if i dont approve of your attitude
ill send your ass straight to your room
and make you change my name to papi
i like it when you work it harder
teach me things i never knew
i like it when you work it harder
freaky me freaky you
la la la la la

chorus 2
cause i said fuck that put her on the map
