you are coming home are you still alone
are you not the same as you used to be
as the sun grows high and you serve your time
does each day just feel like another lie
now you know is it just for show
just a foolish game that you hide behind
dont forget the nights when it all felt right
are you not the same as you used to be

chorus
used to be
used to be

verse 2
in an endless night could you feel the fright
of an age that was and could never be
so we hold it close when we feel the most
like a love that we could not leave behind
turn the wheel to each way we feel
til im lost and i cannot find you there
dont forget the nights when it all felt right
are you not the same as you used to be

chorus
used to be
used to be

coming home any day now
any day now any day now
coming home any day now
any day now any day now
coming home any day now
any day now any day now1embed"
