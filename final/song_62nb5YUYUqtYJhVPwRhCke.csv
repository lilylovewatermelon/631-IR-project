chorus lil baby
i know how it feel to think everybody against you
i know how it feel to watch bullets go through a windshield
i know how it feel when you try your best to be real
i know how it feel when you think no one understands you
i know how it feel when the one you love gettin ran through
i know how it feel i done really cut off my mans too
i know how it feel when you broke and them bills past due
