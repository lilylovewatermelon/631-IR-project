oh the devils inside
you opened the door you gave him a ride
too young to know too old to admit
that you couldnt see how it ends

chorus
what did you do to my eyes
what did you sing to that lonely child
promised it all but you lied
you better slow down baby soon
its all or nothing to you

verse 2
the glow of hollywood signs
they sold you a bridge
they fed you the lines they fed you to lions
you always confused your servants for friends
but you couldnt see how it ends
its all or nothing to you

chorus
what did you do to my eyes
what did you say to my only child
promised your love but you lied
you better slow down baby soon
its all or nothing to you
you might also likeoutro
what did you do to my eyes
what did you sing to that lonely child
promised it all but you lied
you better slow down baby soon8embed"
