i like to dance with the water
the undertow and the waves
the water is mischievous ha
i like how it misbehaves
the village may think im crazy
or say that i drift too far
but once you know what you like
well there you are
you are your fathers daughter
stubbornness and pride
mind what he says but remember
you may hear a voice inside
and if the voice starts to whisper
to follow the farthest star
moana that voice inside is who you are

men sina  women
we make our nets from the fibers
we weave our nets from the fibers
the water is sweet inside
a real tasty treat inside
we use the leaves to build fires
we sing these songs in our choirs
to cook up the meat inside
we have mouths to feed inside
