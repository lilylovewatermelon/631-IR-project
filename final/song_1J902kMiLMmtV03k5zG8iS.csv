if i leave tomorrow
would you be alright
would you be filled with sorrow
would you put up a fight
how can i protect you
when i dont feel alright

chorus
if i just vanished
do you think youd manage
or would you disappear right beside me
do you think youre ready
when i go unsteady
lover please prepare for my absence

verse 2
if i left the country
would you search and search
or would you give up easy
and find me in the dirt
would i live forever
or blend right into earth

chorus
if i just vanished
do you think youd manage
or would you disappear right beside mе
do you think youre ready
when i go unstеady
lover please prepare for my absence

absence makes a heart grow stronger
pray my baby will not squander
everything to gain by my leaving
and if i can return the favor
pray my baby always savors
every moment we were both present

chorus
cause if i just vanished
do you think youd manage
or would you disappear right beside me
do you think youre ready
when i go unsteady
lover please prepare for my absence5embed"
