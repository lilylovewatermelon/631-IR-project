verse 1
i only wanted to have fun
learning to fly learning to run
i let my heart decide the way
when i was young
deep down i must have always known
that this would be inevitable
to earn my stripes id have to pay
and bare my soul

chorus
i know im not the only one
who regrets the things theyve done
sometimes i just feel its only me
who cant stand the reflection that they see
i wish i could live a little more
look up to the sky not just the floor
i feel like my life is flashing by
and all i can do is watch and cry
i miss the air i miss my friends
i miss my mother i miss it when
life was a party to be thrown
but that was a million years ago
see adele liveget tickets as low as 165you might also likeverse 2
when i walk around all of the streets
where i grew up and found my feet
they cant look me in the eye
its like theyre scared of me
i try to think of things to say
like a joke or a memory
but they dont recognize me now
in the light of day

chorus
i know im not the only one
who regrets the things theyve done
sometimes i just feel its only me
who never became who they thought theyd be
i wish i could live a little more
look up to the sky not just the floor
i feel like my life is flashing by
and all i can do is watch and cry
i miss the air i miss my friends
i miss my mother i miss it when
life was a party to be thrown
but that was a million years ago
