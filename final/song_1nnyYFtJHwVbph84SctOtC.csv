i think my life might be better if i lived in colorado hmm
sit around and get high sippin some white wine out the bottle bottle
i threw my phone into a lake and watch it sink to a better place down at the bottom
i think my life might be better if i lived in colorado

chorus
cause maybe there id like myself work on my mental health
might even feel compelled to sing karaoke
down at the local dive and meet some young exwife
wеd start a brandnew life and nevеr be lonely
swear to god i am going not that far
but i know i wont i know i wont
yeah i know i wont i know i wont i know i

verse 2
who am i kiddin im addicted to the chip on my shoulder hmm
i like it best breakin a sweat so why go somewhere that is colder
and ill admit it would be nice to meet some guy whos not my type and move to boulder
but i think ill probably hate my life if i lived in colorado i think ill probably hate my life

chorus
cause maybe there id like myself work on my mental health
might even feel compelled to finally let go
but its an empty dream that shits not meant for me
id choose the devil i know over the heaven i dont
swear to god i am going not that far
but i know i wont i know i wont
yeah i know i wont i know i know i know
