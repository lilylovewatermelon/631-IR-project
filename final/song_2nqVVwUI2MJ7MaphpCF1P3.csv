girl you make a thug want to get a legal gig
its only right we spend our lonely nights
gettin crazy biz till we awake the kids
dont get too loud got respect for you honey
to keep it all real you come second to my money
and can you be my ghetto love prophecy

and i know that you really care a lot for me
wanna see you happy even if its not with me not with me
even if its not with me
