i shoulda known when i got you alone
that you were way too into me to know
this isnt love boy this aint even close
but you always think were something that were not
and now you call me every single night
i only answer cause im too polite
we happened once or maybe it was twice
yeah you always make it hard for me to stop
but you always think were something that were not
hey

chorus
you wanna be more than just friends
i cant go through this again
stop tryna get inside my head
dont wanna do more than hookup
its getting stupid cause i shoulda known but i forgot
that you think were something that were not
hey

verse 2
i hear youre telling everyone you know that im the one
like you cant let me go
and you just keep on blowing up my phone
cause you never seem to know when you should stop
dont introduce me to any of your friends
delete my number dont call me again
we had some fun but now its gonna end
but you always made it hard for me to stop
now you always think were something that were not
hey
