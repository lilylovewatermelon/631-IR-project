theres no hope for us we speak in tongues
blacker than the sun no death cant touch

theres no hope for us we speak in tongues
blacker than the sun no death cant touch
the crooked young the crooked young

postchorus
we dont sleep we dont eat
we speak in tongues
we cant die were dead inside
no death cant touch the crooked young

the faceless wont save you
the clouds wont hear your fucking prayers
