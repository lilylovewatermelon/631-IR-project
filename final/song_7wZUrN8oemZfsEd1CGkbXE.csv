hey

verse 1
closed off from love i didnt need the pain
once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
time starts to pass before you know it youre frozen ooh
but somethin happened for the very first time with you
my heart melted to the ground found somethin true
and everyones lookin round thinkin im going crazy
ooh yeah

prechorus
but i dont care what they say im in love with you
they try to pull me away but they dont know the truth
my hearts crippled by the vein that i keep on closin
you cut me open and i

chorus
keep bleedin
keep keep bleeding love
i keep bleedin
i keep keep bleeding love
keep bleedin
keep keep bleeding love
you cut me open
you might also likebreak
mm yeah

verse 2
tryin hard not to hear but they talk so loud
their piercin sounds fill my ears try to fill me with doubt
yet i know that their goal is to keep me from fallin ooh yeah
but nothins greater than the rush that comes with your embrace
and in this world of loneliness i see your face
yet everyone around me thinks that im going crazy
maybe maybe

prechorus
but i dont care what they say im in love with you
they try to pull me away but they dont know the truth
my hearts crippled by the vein that i keep on closin
you cut me open and i

chorus
keep bleedin
keep keep bleeding love
i keep bleedin
i keep keep bleeding love
keep bleedin
keep keep bleeding love
you cut me open mmh
bridge
and its drainin all of me
though they find it hard to believe
ill be wearin these scars for everyone to see

prechorus
i dont care what they say im in love with you
they try to pull me away but they dont know the truth
my hearts crippled by the vein that i keep on closin
ooh you cut me open and i

chorus
keep bleedin
keep keep bleeding love
i keep bleedin
i keep keep bleeding love you
keep bleedin
keep keep bleeding love
oh you cut me open and i
keep bleedin
keep keep bleeding love you
