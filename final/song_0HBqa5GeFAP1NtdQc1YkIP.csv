hit or miss fuck or fight
its time to live your life
go ahead i know im right
im going to lay it on the line
put yourself in my shoes
would you stand up for your rights
line them up and knock em down
im not running scared tonight

chorus
i have climbed these walls before
and im not scared anymore
theres a time to lead and a time to follow
because i wont take this anymore these walls
ive climbed these walls before these walls
theres a time to lead and a time to follow

verse 2
i see the walls closing in
and i feel im in danger
my enemy is not alone
in the mirror theres a stranger
as i tried to break out
my panic led to fear
hopeless i am alone
im afraid the end is near
the truth doesnt always have to hurt
