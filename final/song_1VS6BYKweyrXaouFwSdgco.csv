stay in the shade
until you reach the grave
hide from yourself
and see how you fade
youll see how you fade

verse 2
love moves on
life goes on
and while you dont
youll stand all alone

refrain
youll see how you fade
youll see how you fade
youll see how you fade
move on
youll see how you fade
move on
youll see how you fadesee josé gonzález liveget tickets as low as 50you might also likeembed"
