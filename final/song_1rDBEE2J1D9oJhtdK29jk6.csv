i heard you laughing
in a crowd outside a restaurant we used to go to
i caught a glimpse that stopped me in my tracks
it took me back
you looked happy with that little girl up on your shoulders
happy i know where she got those crystal eyes of blue
times been sweet to you

chorus
as bad as it was as bad as it hurt
i thank god i didnt get what i thought that i deserved
sometimes life leads you down a different road
when youre holdin on to someone that you gotta let go
someday youll see the reason why
sometimes yeah sometimes theres good in goodbye

verse 2
i dont regret it
the time we had together
i wont forget it
but we both ended up where we belong
i guess goodbye made us strong
and yeah im happy
i found somebody too who makes me happy
and i knew one day id see you on the street
and itd be bittersweet
