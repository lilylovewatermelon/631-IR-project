decided to write a song for my hero
considering hes done so much for me
hes the one that pulled me up when i fell down so low
hes the one that led me through the darkness when i could not see
never met a man more gentle or any humbler
never once heard him raise his voice or saw him mad
but i watched him break his back on the coal and lumber
to give her everything she never had

chorus
cause when it all comes down to zero
theres nothing more this life could ever give
and i know ill never find another hero
not another one like him

verse 2
he was born on a summer day in some dark holler
way back in the hills of perry county
but grew up poor and he never saw a dollar
but a dollar aint no good in a coal camp anyway

chorus
cause when it all comes down to zero
theres nothing more this life could ever give
and i know ill never find another hero
not another one like him
you might also likebridge
and if im half the man he was when i die
i dont know if i could ask for too much more
taught me you only need one hand to count your real friends in this life
you find true love you better take both arms hold on til youre sore

chorus
cause when it all comes down to zero
theres nothing more this life could ever give
and i know ill never find another hero
not another one like him

outro
decided to write a song for my hero
considering hes done so much for meembed"
