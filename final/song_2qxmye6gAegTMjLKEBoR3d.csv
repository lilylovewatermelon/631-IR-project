this night is cold in the kingdom
i can feel you fade away
from the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
your steps keep me awake

prechorus
dont cut me down throw me out leave me here to waste
i once was a man with dignity and grace
now im slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
so please please

chorus
could you find a way to let me down slowly
a little sympathy i hope you can show me
if you wanna go then ill be so lonely
if youre leaving baby let me down slowly
let me down down
let me down down
let me down let me down
down let me down down
let me down
if you wanna go then ill be so lonely
if youre leaving baby let me down slowly

verse 2
cold skin drag my feet on the tile
as im walking down the corridor
and i know we havent talked in a while
so im looking for an open door
