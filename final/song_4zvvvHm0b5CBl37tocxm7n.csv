i would shun the light share in evenings cool and quiet
who would trade that hum of night
for sunlight sunlight sunlight
but whose heart would not take flight
betray the moon as acolyte
on first and fierce affirming sight
of sunlight sunlight sunlight

chorus
i had been lost to you sunlight
and flew like a moth to you sunlight oh sunlight
oh your love is sunlight
oh your love is sunlight
oh but it is sunlight

verse 2
all the tales the same
told before and told again
a soul that’s born in cold and rain
knows sunlight sunlight sunlight
and at last can grant a name
to a buried and a burning flame
as love and its decisive pain
oh my sunlight sunlight sunlight
see hozier liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likechorus
all that was shown to me sunlight
was somethin foreknown to me sunlight
oh sunlight
oh your love is sunlight
oh your love is sunlight
oh but it is sunlight
oh your love is sunlight
oh your love is sunlight
oh but it is sunlight sunlight

bridge
all these colours fade for you only
hold me carry me slowly my sunlight
all these colours fade for you only
hold me carry me slowly my sunlight

verse 3
each day youd rise with me
know that i would gladly be
the icarus to your certainty
oh my sunlight sunlight sunlight
strap the wing to me
death trap clad happily
with wax melted i’d meet the sea
under sunlight sunlight sunlight
chorus
oh your love is sunlight
oh your love is sunlight
oh but it is sunlight
oh your love is sunlight
oh your love is sunlight
oh but it is sunlight
oh your love is sunlight
oh your love is sunlight
oh but it is sunlight
oh your love is sunlight
oh your love is sunlight
oh but it is sunlight
