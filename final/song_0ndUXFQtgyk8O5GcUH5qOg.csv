do we know how to get the message across
we turn the lights off to find our way out
no time to get through to grasp what was lost
dont turn the lights off and leave me in the dark

chorus
hey im pleading my soul is bleeding
i dont wanna be left alone not when im right next to you
what are you thinking its so misleading
is it not for me to know
i think its just hard for you to show

verse 2
we never spoke in the words that we want
we turn the lights off to find our way out
we never chosen to keep what weve got
dont turn the lights off and leave me in the dark

chorus
hey im pleading my soul is bleeding
i dont wanna be left alone not when im right next to you
what are you thinking its so misleading
is it not for me to know
i think its just hard for you to show
see trapt liveget tickets as low as 36you might also likebridge
hard for you to show
its so hard for you to show
why is it hard for you to show
hard for you to show

verse 3
i thought it would be nice to lie down and close my eyes
it never occurred to me that i am already asleep
dont be the one to dont be the one to let it show
dont be the one to dont be the one to be alone
dont be the one to dont be the one to let it show
dont be the one to be alone tonight

outro
hey im pleading my soul is bleeding
i dont wanna be left alone not when im right next to you
what are you thinking its so misleading
i dont wanna be left alone
i dont wanna be left alone
i dont wanna be left alone
no i dont wanna be left alone
i dont wanna be left alone
no one wants to be left aloneembed"
