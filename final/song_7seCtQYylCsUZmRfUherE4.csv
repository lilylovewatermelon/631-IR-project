our first full moon sky

ill breathe you in
i wont let you down
i wont hold your back
i wont make a sound

i know what scares you the most

being alone
or just like them
being alive
while feeling so dead

at least youll have my heart
you know you shine so bright

ive got a single silver bullet
shot right through my heart
to prove i can survive
without you
got a single silver bullet
shot right through my heart
to prove i can survive
without you
see hawthorne heights liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likecan you sleep at night
if i hold you tight
i wont let you go
it feels so right

please dont leave this time

at least youll have my heart
you know you shine sooo bright

like a single silver bullet
shot right through my heart
to prove i can survive
without you
got a single silver bullet
shot right through my heart
to prove i can survive
without you

tonight we fly away so high
tonight we fly away
you know the moon is full and
i cant live without you

tonight well fly away
got a single silver bullet
tonight well fly
got a single silver bullet
like a single silver bullet
shot right through my heart
to prove i can survive
without you
got a single silver bullet
shot right through my heart
to prove i can survive

like a single silver bullet
tonight well fly away so high
shot right through my heart
like a full moon sky
to prove i can survive
without you

got a single silver bullet
tonight well fly away so high
shot right through my heart
like a full moon sky
to prove i can survive
without youembed"
