a hospital bed
a room filled with flowers
every monitor beep keeps the time
as i count down the hours
the petals they weep
theyre uprooted like me
and cut from the cord of their mother
who created everything

chorus
if you wont save her
please just take her away

verse 2
she pulls me close
says that she loves me
that she wishes to still be around
on the day that i marry
tightly she holds
but the plan still unfolds
im cutting the cord from the mother
who gave me everything

chorus
if you wont save her
please just take her
nothing breaks her away
from the promise of a better day
see nothing more liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likerefrain
this is your moment of glory hallelujah this is your moment of glory hallelujah
this is your moment of glory hallelujah this is your moment of glory hallelujah

bridge
it may feel like god went north and left you to be hallelujah
but all you need to know is you have everything you need hallelujah
its just a blink of an eye til the next time we meet hallelujah
ill hold you til the end ill hold you til youre free

chorus
if you wont save her
please just take her
nothing breaks her away
from the promise of a better day
if you wont save her ill hold you til the end
please just take her ill hold you til the end
nothing breaks her away ill hold you til the end

ill hold you til the end
ill hold you til the end
ill hold you til the end
ill hold you til the end
