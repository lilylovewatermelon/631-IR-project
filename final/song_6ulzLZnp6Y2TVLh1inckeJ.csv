verse 1
we inbetween heaven and hell hell
fuck a ninetofive id rather end up dead or in jail jail
american ninja to these obstacles no stoppin me we on the move
your mouth runnin like a prostitutes keep your head to yourself
i work harder than anybody you know know
im done with tricks dont need no money to blow
deadly aim selfcontained superstar they yell the name
blood diamonds finna go to hell for my chain
the p fitted on my head though im too high
you cant reach me with the cell phone no goodbyes no hellos
you dont want this life i live youd rather had a wife and kid
shootin dice with jesus christ put twenty on the midnight
to everyone who sell me drugs
dont mix it with that bullshit im hopin not to join the 27 club
just want the cokedealer house with the velvet rug
fuck the world theres no one else but us woah

chorus

to everyone but us every motherfucker but us
it aint nothin but a brand name nothin but a brand name
