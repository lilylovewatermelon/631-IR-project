on his side of the bed
hes sleeping like a baby
dreams are dancing in his head
lying with his lady
its a peaceful night
and everythings just fine

on his side of the bed
but on her side of the bed
those big brown eyes are crying
from the things he never says
and deep inside shes dying

as she turns to face the wall
theres no love at all
on her side of the bed

chorus
if hed just reach out
shed forget about
all the times that he let her down
oh but in his mind
everythings all right
when the lights go out

on his side of the bed
he never even noticed her negligee of red
the very same one that she wore the night
that they were wed
but he never turned his head
to her side of the bed

chorus

verse 3
now on his side of the bed
he wakes up and turns to say
i love you
but instead

all he finds are pages
full of words shed never said
and thats all she left
on her side of the bedembed"
