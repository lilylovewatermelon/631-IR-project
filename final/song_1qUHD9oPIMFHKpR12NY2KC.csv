its a truth that in love and war
worlds collide and hearts get broken
i want to live like i know im dying
take up my cross not be afraid

is it true what they say that words are weapons
and if it is then everybody best stop steppin
cause i got ten in my pocket thatll bend your locket
im tired of all these rockers sayin come with me

chorus
wait its just about to break its more than i can take
everythings about to change
i feel it in my veins its not going away
everythings about to change

verse 2
it creeps in like a thief in the night
without a sign without a warning
but we are ready and prepared to fight
raise up your swords dont be afraid

prechorus
is it true what they say that words are weapons
and if it is then everybody best stop steppin
cause i got ten in my pocket thatll bend ya locket
im tired of all these rockers sayin come with me
