i will beginas is these seven years now
my daily wontand read a history
written by one whose deft right hand was dust
to the last digit ages ere my birth
of all my predecessors popes of rome
for though mine ancient early dropped the pen
yet others picked it up and wrote it dry
since of the making books there is no end
and so i have the papacy complete
from peter first to alexander last
can question each and take instruction so
have i to darei ask how dared this pope
to suffer suchanone how suffered he
being about to judge as now i seek
how judged once well or ill some other pope
study some signal judgment that subsists
to blaze on or else blot the page which seals
the sum up of what gain or loss to god
came of his one more vicar in the world
so do i find example rule of life
so square and set in order the next page
shall be stretched smooth oer my own funeral cyst

eight hundred years exact before the year
i was made pope men made formosus pope
say sigebert and other chroniclers
ere i confirm or quash the trial here
of guido franceschini and his friends
readhow there was a ghastly trial once
of a dead man by a live man and both popes
thusin the antique penmans very phrase
then stephen pope and seventh of the name
cried out in synod as he sat in state
while choler quivered on his brow and beard
come into court formosus thou lost wretch
that claimedst to be late the pope as i

and at the word the great door of the church
flew wide and in they brought formosus self
the body of him dead even as embalmed
and buried duly in the vatican
eight months before exhumed thus for the nonce
they set it that dead body of a pope
clothed in pontific vesture now again
upright on peters chair as if alive
and stephen springing up cried furiously
bishop of porto wherefore didst presume
to leave that see and take this roman see
exchange the lesser for the greater see
a thing against the canons of the church

then one a deacon who observing forms
was placed by stephen to repel the charge
be advocate and mouthpiece of the corpse
spoke as he dared set stammeringly forth
with white lips and dry tongueas but a youth
for frightful was the corpseface to behold
how nowise lacked there precedent for this
but when for his last precedent of all
emboldened by the spirit out he blurts
and holy father didst not thou thyself
vacate the lesser for the greater see
half a year since change arago for rome
ye have the sins defence now synod mine
shrieks stephen in a beastly froth of rage
judge now betwixt him dead and me alive
hath he intruded or do i pretend
judge judgebreaks wavelike one whole foam of wrath
whereupon they being friends and followers
said ay thou art christs vicar and not he
a way with what is frightful to behold
this act was uncanonic and a fault

then swallowed up in rage stephen exclaimed
so guilty so remains i punish guilt
he is unpoped and all he did i damn
the bishop that ordained him i degrade
depose to laics those he raised to priests
what they have wrought is mischief nor shall stand
it is confusion let it vex no more
since i revoke annul and abrogate
all his decrees in all kinds they are void
in token whereof and warning to the world
strip me yon miscreant of those robes usurped
and clothe him with vile serge befitting such
then hale the carrion to the marketplace
let the townhangman chop from his right hand
those same three fingers which he blessed withal
next cut the head off once was crowned forsooth
and last go fling all fingers head and trunk
in tiber that my christian fish may sup
either because of ts which means fish
and very aptly symbolises christ
or else because the pope is fisherman
and seals with fisherssignet anyway
so said so done himself to see it done
following the corpse they trailed from street to street
till into tiber wave they threw the thing
the people crowded on the banks to see
were loud or mute wept or laughed cursed or jeered
according as the deed addressed their sense
a scandal verily and out spake a jew
wot ye your christ had vexed our herod thus
now when formosus being dead a year
his judge pope stephen tasted death in turn
made captive by the mob and strangled straight
romanus his successor for a month
did make protest formosus was with god
holy just true in thought and word and deed
next theodore who reigned but twenty days
therein convoked a synod whose decree
did reinstate repope the late unpoped
and do away with stephen as accursed
so that when presently certain fisherfolk
as if the queasy river could not hold
its swallowed jonas but discharged the meal
produced the timely product of their nets
the mutilated man formosussaved
from putrefaction by the embalmers spice
or as some said by sanctity of flesh
why lay the body again bade theodore
among his predecessors in the church
and burialplace of peter which was done
and addeth luitprand many of repute
pious and still alive avouch to me
that as they bore the body up the aisle
the saints in imaged row bowed each his head
for welcome to a brothersaint come back
as for romanus and this theodore
these two popes through the brief reign granted each
could but initiate what john came to close
and give the final stamp to he it was
ninth of the name i follow the best guides
whoin full synod at ravenna held
with bishops seventyfour and present too
eude king of france with his archbishopry
did condemn stephen anathematise
the disinterment and make all blots blank
for argueth here auxilius in a place
de ordinationibus precedents
had been no lack before formosus long
of bishops so transferred from see to see
marinus for example read the tract
but after john came sergius reaffirmed
the right of stephen cursed formosus nay
cast out some say his corpse a second time
and herebecause the matter went to ground
fretted by new griefs other cares of the age
here is the last pronouncing of the church
her sentence that subsists unto this day
yet constantly opinion hath prevailed
i the church formosus was a holy man

which of the judgments was infallible
which of my predecessors spoke for god
and what availed formosus that this cursed
that blessed and then this other cursed again
fear ye not those whose power can kill the body
and not the soul saith christ but rather those
can cast both soul and body into hell
john judged thus in eight hundred ninety eight
exact eight hundred years ago today
when sitting in his stead vicegerent here
i must give judgment on my own behoof
so worked the predecessor now my turn

in gods name once more on this earth of gods
while twilight lasts and time wherein to work
i take his staff with my uncertain hand
and stay my six and fourscore years my due
labour and sorrow on his judgmentseat
and forthwith think speak act in place of him
the pope for christ once more appeal is made
from mans assize to mine i sit and see
another poor weak trembling human wretch
pushed by his fellows who pretend the right
up to the gulf which where i gaze begins
from this world to the nextgives way and way
just on the edge over the awful dark
with nothing to arrest him but my feet
he catches at me with convulsive face
cries leave to live the natural minute more
while hollowly the avengers echo leave
none so has he exceeded mans due share
in mans fit licence wrung by adams fall
to sin and yet not surely diethat we
all of us sinful all with need of grace
all chary of our lifethe minute more
or minute less of grace which saves a soul
bound to make common cause with who craves time
we yet protest against the exorbitance
of sin in this one sinner and demand
that his poor sole remaining piece of time
be plucked from out his clutch put him to death
punish him now as for the weal or woe
hereafter god grant mercy man be just
nor let the felon boast he went scotfree
and i am bound the solitary judge
to weigh the worth decide upon the plea
and either hold a hand out or withdraw
a foot and let the wretch drift to the fall
ay and while thus i dally dare perchance
put fancies for a comfort twixt this calm
and yonder passion that i have to bear
as if reprieve were possible for both
prisoner and popehow easy were reprieve
a touch o the handbell here a hasty word
to those who wait and wonder they wait long
i the passage there and i should gain the life
yea though i flatter me with fancy thus
i know it is but natures craventrick
the case is over judgment at an end
and all things done now and irrevocable
a mere dead man is franceschini here
even as formosus centuries ago
i have worn through this sombre wintry day
with winter in my soul beyond the worlds
over these dismalest of documents
which drew night down on me ere eve befell
pleadings and counterpleadings figure of fact
beside facts self these summaries to wit
how certain three were slain by certain five
i read here why it was and how it went
and how the chief o the five preferred excuse
and how law rather chose defence should lie
what argument he urged by wary word
when free to play off wile start subterfuge
and what the unguarded groan told tortures feat
when law grew brutal outbroke overbore
and glutted hunger on the truth at last
no matter for the flesh and blood between
alls a clear rede and no more riddle now
truth nowhere lies yet everywhere in these
not absolutely in a portion yet
evolvable from the whole evolved at last
painfully held tenaciously by me
therefore there is not any doubt to clear
when i shall write the brief word presently
and chink the handbell which i pause to do
irresolute not i more than the mound
with the pinetrees on it yonder some surmise
perchance that since mans wit is fallible
mine may fail here suppose it sowhat then
sayguido i count guilty theres no babe
so guiltless for i misconceive the man
whats in the chance should move me from my mind
if as i walk in a rough countryside
peasants of mine cry thou art he can help
lord of the land and counted wise to boot
look at our brother strangling in his foam
he fell so where we find himprove thy worth
i may presume pronounce a frenzyfit
a fallingsickness or a feverstroke
breathe a vein copiously let blood at once
so perishes the patient and anon
i hear my peasantsall was error lord
our story thy prescription for there crawled
in due time from our hapless brothers breast
the serpent which had stung him bleeding slew
whom a prompt cordial had restored to health
what other should i say than god so willed
mankind is ignorant a man am i
call ignorance my sorrow not my sin
so and not otherwise in aftertime
if some acuter wit fresh probing sound
this multifarious mass of words and deeds
deeper and reach through guilt to innocence
i shall face guidos ghost nor blench a jot
god who set me to judge thee meted out
so much of judging faculty no more
ask him if i was slack in use thereof
i hold a heavier fault imputable
inasmuch as i changed a chaplain once
for no causeno if i must bare my heart
save that he snuffled somewhat saying mass
for i am ware it is the seed of act
god holds appraising in his hollow palm
not act grown great thence on the world below
leafage and branchage vulgar eyes admire
therefore i stand on my integrity
nor fear at all and if i hesitate
it is because i need to breathe awhile
rest as the human right allows review
intent the little seeds of act the tree
the thought to clothe in deed and give the world
at chink of bell and push of arrased door

o pale departure dim disgrace of day
winters in wane his vengeful worst art thou
to dash the boldness of advancing march
thy chill persistent rain has purged our streets
of gossipry pert tongue and idle ear
by this consort neath archway portico
but wheresoeer rome gathers in the grey
two names now snap and flash from mouth to mouth
sparks flint and steel strike guido and the pope
by this same hour tomorrow eveaha
how do they call himthe sagacious swede
who finds by figures how the chances prove
why one comes rather than another thing
as say such dots turn up by throw of dice
or if we dip in virgil here and there
and prick for such a verse when such shall point
take this swede tell him hiding name and rank
two men are in our city this dull eve
one doomed to deathbut hundreds in such plight
slip aside clean escape by leave of law
which leans to mercy in this latter time
moreover in the plenitude of life
is he with strength of limb and brain adroit
presumably of service here beside
the man is noble backed by nobler friends
nay for who wish him well the citys self
makes common cause with the housemagistrate
the lord of hearth and home domestic judge
who ruled his own and let men cavil die
hell bribe a gaoler or break prison first
nay a sedition may be helpful give
hint to the mob to batter wall burn gate
and bid the favourite malefactor march
calculate now these chances of escape
it is not probable but well may be
again there is another man weighed now
by twice eight years beyond the seventimesten
appointed overweight to break our branch
and this mans loaded branch lifts more than snow
all the worlds cark and care though a birds nest
were a superfluous burthen notably
hath he been pressed as if his age were youth
from todays dawn till now that day departs
trying one question with true sweat of soul
shall the said doomed man fitlier die or live
when a straw swallowed in his posset stool
stumbled on where his path lies any puff
thats incident to such a smoking flax
hurries the natural end and quenches him
now calculate thou sage the chances here
say which shall die the sooner this or that
that possibly this in all likelihood
i thought so yet thou trippst my foreign friend
no it will be quite otherwisetoday
is guidos last my term is yet to run

but say the swede were right and i forthwith
acknowledge a prompt summons and lie dead
why then i stand already in gods face
and hear since by its fruit a tree is judged
show me thy fruit the latest act of thine
for in the last is summed the first and all
what thy life last put heart and soul into
there shall i taste thy product i must plead
this condemnation of a man today

not so expect nor question nor reply
at what we figure as gods judgmentbar
none of this vile way by the barren words
which more than any deed characterise
man as made subject to a curse no speech
that still bursts oer some lie which lurks inside
as the split skin across the coppery snake
and most denotes man since in all beside
in hate or lust or guile or unbelief
out of some core of truth the excrescence comes
and in the last resort the man may urge
so was i made a weak thing that gave way
to truth to impulse only strong since true
and hated lusted used guile forwent faith
but when man walks the garden of this world
for his own solace and unchecked by law
speaks or keeps silence as himself sees fit
without the least incumbency to lie
why can he tell you what a rose is like
or how the birds fly and not slip to false
though truth serve better man must tell his mate
of you me and himself knowing he lies
knowing his fellow knows the samewill think
he lies it is the method of a man
and yet will speak for answer it is truth
to him who shall rejoin again a lie
therefore this filthy rags of speech this coil
of statement comment query and response
tatters all too contaminate for use
have no renewing he the truth is too
the word we men in our degree may know
there simply instantaneously as here
after long time and amid many lies
whatever we dare think we know indeed
that i am i as he is hewhat else
but be mans method for mans life at least
wherefore antonio pignatelli thou
my ancient self who wast no pope so long
but studied god and man the many years
i the school i the cloister in the diocese
domestic legaterule in foreign lands
thou other force in those old busy days
than this grey ultimate decrepitude
yet sensible of fires that more and more
visit a soul in passage to the sky
left nakeder than when fleshrobe was new
thou not pope but the mere old man o the world
supposed inquisitive and dispassionate
wilt thou the one whose speech i somewhat trust
question the afterme this self now pope
hear his procedure criticise his work
wise in its generation is the world

this is why guido is found reprobate
i see him furnished forth for his career
on starting for the lifechance in our world
with nearly all we count sufficient help
body and mind in balance a sound frame
a solid intellect the wit to seek
wisdom to choose and courage wherewithal
to deal with whatsoever circumstance
should minister to man make life succeed
oh and much drawback what were earth without
is this our ultimate stage or startingplace
to try mans foot if it will creep or climb
mid obstacles in seeming points that prove
advantage for who vaults from low to high
and makes the stumblingblock a steppingstone
so guido born with appetite lacks food
is poor who yet could deftly playoff wealth
straitened whose limbs are restless till at large
and as he eyes each outlet of the cirque
the narrow penfold for probation pines
after the good things just outside the grate
with less monition fainter consciencetwitch
rarer instinctive qualm at the first feel
of the unseemly greed and grasp undue
than nature furnishes the main mankind
making it harder to do wrong than right
the first time careful lest the common ear
break measure miss the outstep of lifes march
wherein i see a trial fair and fit
for one else too unfairly fenced about
set above sin beyond his fellows here
guarded from the archtempter all must fight
by a great birth traditionary name
diligent culture choice companionship
above all conversancy with the faith
which puts forth for its base of doctrine just
man is born nowise to content himself
but please god he accepted such a rule
recognised mans obedience and the church
which simply is such rules embodiment
he clave to he held on bynay indeed
near pushed inside of deep as layman durst
professed so much of priesthood as might sue
for priestsexemption where the layman sinned
got his arm frocked which bare the law would bruise
hence at this moment whats his last resource
his extreme stray and utmost stretch of hope
but thatconvicted of such crime as law
wipes not away save with a worldlings blood
guido the threeparts consecrate may scape
nay the portentous brothers of the man
are veritably priests protected each
may do his murder in the churchs pale
abate paul canon girolamo
this is the man proves irreligiousest
of all mankind religions parasite
this may forsooth plead dinned ear jaded sense
the vice o the watcher who bides near the bell
sleeps sound because the clock is vigilant
and cares not whether it be shade or shine
doling out day and night to all men else
why was the choice o the man to niche himself
perversely neath the tower where times own tongue
thus undertakes to sermonise the world
why but because the solemn is safe too
the belfry proves a fortress of a sort
has other uses than to teach the hour
turns sunscreen paravent and ombrifuge
to whoso seeks a shelter in its pale
ay and attractive to unwary folk
who gaze at storied portal statued spire
and go home with full head but empty purse
nor dare suspect the sacristan the thief
shall judashard upon the donors heel
to filch the fragments of the basketplead
he was too near the preachers mouth nor sat
attent with fifties in a company
nocloser to promulgated decree
clearer the censure of default proceed

i find him bound then to begin life well
fortified by propitious circumstance
great birth good breeding with the church for guide
how lives he cased thus in a coat of proof
mailed like a manatarms though all the while
a puny starvelingdoes the breast pant big
the limb swell to the limit emptiness
strive to become solidity indeed
rather he shrinks up like the ambiguous fish
detaches flesh from shell and outside show
and steals by moonlight i have seen the thing
in and out now to prey and now to skulk
armour he boasts when a wave breaks on beach
or bird stoops for the prize with peril nigh
the man of rank the muchbefriended man
the man almost affiliate to the church
such is to deal with let the world beware
does the world recognise pass prudently
do tides abate and seafowl hunt i the deep
already is the slug from out its mew
ignobly faring with all loose and free
sandfly and slushworm at their garbagefeast
a naked blotch no better than they all
guido has dropped nobility slipped the church
plays trickster if not cutpurse body and soul
prostrate among the filthy feedersfaugh
and when law takes him by surprise at last
catches the foul thing on its carrionprey
behold he points to shell left high and dry
pleads but the case out yonder is myself
nay it is thou law prongs amid thy peers
congenial vermin that was none of thee
thine outsidegive it to the soldiercrab

for i find this black mark impinge the man
that he believes in just the vile of life
low instinct base pretension are these truth
then that aforesaid armour probity
he figures in is falsehood scale on scale
honor and faitha lie and a disguise
probably for all livers in this world
certainly for himself all say good words
to who will hear all do thereby bad deeds
to who must undergo so thrive mankind
see this habitual creed exemplified
most in the last deliberate act as last
so very sum and substance of the soul
of him that planned and leaves one perfect piece
the sin brought under jurisdiction now
even the marriage of the man this act
i sever from his life as sample show
for guidos self intend to test him by
as from a cup filled fairly at the fount
by the components we decide enough
or to let flow as late or staunch the source

he purposes this marriage i remark
on no one motive that should prompt thereto
farthest by consequence from ends alleged
appropriate to the action so they were
the best he knew and feigned the worst he took
not one permissible impulse moves the man
from the mere liking of the eye and ear
to the true longing of the heart that loves
no trace of these but all to instigate
is what sinks man past level of the brute
whose appetite if brutish is a truth
all is the lust for money to get gold
why lie rob if it must be murder make
body and soul wring gold out lured within
the clutch of hate by love the traps pretence
what good else get from bodies and from souls
this got there were some life to lead thereby
what where or how appreciate those who tell
how the toad lives it livesenough for me
to get this goodwith but a groan or so
then silence of the victimswere the feat
he foresaw made a picture in his mind
of father and mother stunned and echoless
to the blow as they lie staring at fates jaws
their folly danced into till the woe fell
edged in a month by strenuous cruelty
from even the poor nook whence they watched the wolf
feast on their heart the lamblike child his prey
plundered to the last remnant of their wealth
what daily pittance pleased the plunderer dole
hunted forth to go hide head starve and die
so leave the pale awestricken wife past hope
of help i the world now mute and motionless
his slave his chattel to use and then destroy
all this he bent mind how to bring about
put this in act and life as painted plain
and have success the crown of earthly good
in this particular enterprise of man
a marriageundertaken in gods face
with all those lies so opposite gods truth
for ends so other than mans end

thus schemes
guido and thus would carry out his scheme
but when an obstacle first blocks the path
when he finds there is no monopoly
of lies and trick i the tricking lying world
that sorry timid natures even this sort
o the comparini want nor trick nor lie
proper to the kindthat as the gorcrow treats
the bramblefinch so treats the finch the moth
and the great guido is minutely matched
by this same couplewhether true or false
the revelation of pompilias birth
which in a moment brings his scheme to nought
then he is piqued advances yet a stage
leaves the low region to the finch and fly
soars to the zenith whence the fiercer fowl
may dare the inimitable swoop i see
he draws now on the curious crime the fine
felicity and flower of wickedness
determines by the utmost exercise
of violence made safe and sure by craft
to satiate malice pluck one last archpang
from the parents else would triumph out of reach
by punishing their child within reach yet
who nowise could have wronged thought word or deed
i the matter that now moves him so plans he
always subordinating note the point
revenge the manlier sin to interest
the meanerwould pluck pang forth but unclench
no gripe in the act let fall no moneypiece
hence a plan for so plaguing body and soul
his wife so putting day by day and hour by hour
the untried torture to the untouched place
as must precipitate an end foreseen
goad her into some plain revolt most like
plunge upon patent suicidal shame
death to herself damnation by rebound
to those whose hearts he holding hers holds still
such a plan as in its completeness shall
ruin the three together and alike
yet leave himself in luck and liberty
no claim renounced no right a forfeiture
his person unendangered his good fame
without a flaw his pristine worth intact
while they with all their claims and rights that cling
shall forthwith crumble off him every side
scorched into dust a plaything for the winds
as when in our campagna there is fired
the nestlike work that lets a peasant house
and as the thatch burns here there everywhere
even to the ivy and wild vine that bound
and blessed the hut where men were happy once
there rises gradual black amid the blaze
some grim and unscathed nucleus of the nest
some old malicious tower some obscene tomb
they thought a temple in their ignorance
and clung about and thought to lean upon
there laughs it oer their ravagewhere are they
so did his cruelty burn life about
and lay the ruin bare in dreadfulness
try the persistency of torment so
o the wife that at some fierce extremity
some crisis brought about by fire and flame
the patient stung to frenzy should break loose
fly anyhow find refuge anywhere
even in the arms of who might front her first
no monster but a manwhile nature shrieked
or thus escape or die the spasm arrived
not the escape by way of sino god
who shall pluck sheep thou holdest from thy hand
therefore she lay resigned to dieso far
the simple cruelty was foiled why then
craft to the rescue craft should supplement
cruelty and show hell a masterpiece
hence this consummate lie this loveintrigue
unmanly simulation of a sin
with place and time and circumstance to suit
these letters false beyond all forgery
not just handwriting and mere authorship
but false to body and soul they figure forth
as though the man had cut out shape and shape
from fancies of that other aretine
to paste belowincorporate the filth
with cherub faces on a missalpage

whereby the man so far attains his end
that strange temptation is permittedsee
pompilia wife and caponsacchi priest
are brought together as nor priest nor wife
should stand and there is passion in the place
power in the air for evil as for good
promptings from heaven and hell as if the stars
fought in their courses for a fate to be
thus stand the wife and priest a spectacle
i doubt not to unseen assemblage there
no lamp will mark that window for a shrine
no tablet signalise the terrace teach
new generations which succeed the old
the pavement of the street is holy ground
no bard describe in verse how christ prevailed
and satan fell like lightning why repine
what does the world told truth but lie the more

a second time the plot is foiled nor now
by corresponding sin for countercheck
no wile and trick to baffle trick and wile
the play of the parents here the blot is blanched
by gods gift of a purity of soul
that will not take pollution erminelike
armed from dishonour by its own soft snow
such was this gift of god who showed for once
how he would have the world go white it seems
as a new attribute were born of each
champion of truth the priest and wife i praise
as a new safeguard sprang up in defence
of their new noble nature so a thorn
comes to the aid of and completes the rose
courage towit no womans gift nor priests
i the crisis might leaps vindicating right
see how the strong aggressor bad and bold
with every vantage preconcerts surprise
flies of a sudden at his victims throat
in a byewayhow fares he when face to face
with caponsacchi who fights who fears now
there quails count guido armed to the chattering teeth
cowers at the steadfast eye and quiet word
o the canon at the pieve there skulks crime
behind law called in to back cowardice
while out of the poor trampled worm the wife
springs up a serpent

but anon of these
him i judge nowof him proceed to note
failing the first a second chance befriends
guido gives pause ere punishment arrive
the law he called comes hears adjudicates
nor does amiss i the mainsecludes the wife
from the husband respites the oppressed one grants
probation to the oppressor could he know
the mercy of a minutes fiery purge
the furnacecoals alike of public scorn
private remorse heaped glowing on his head
what ifthe force and guile the ores alloy
eliminate his baser soul refined
the lost be saved even yet so as by fire
let him rebuked go softly all his days
and when no graver musings claim their due
meditate on a mans immense mistake
who fashioned to use feet and walk deigns crawl
takes the unmanly meansay though to end
man scarce should make for would but reach thro wrong
may sin but must not needs shame manhood so
since fowlers hawk shoot nay and snare the game
and yet eschew vile practice nor find sport
in torchlight treachery or the luring owl

but how hunts guido why the fraudful trap
late spurned to ruin by the indignant feet
of fellows in the chase who loved fair play
here he picks up the fragments to the least
lades him and hies to the old lurkingplace
where haply he may patch again refit
the mischief file its blunted teeth anew
make sure next time a snap shall break the bone
craft greed and violence complot revenge
craft for its quota schemes to bring about
and seize occasion and be safe withal
greed craves its act may work both far and near
crush the tree branch and trunk and root beside
whichever twig or leaf arrests a streak
of possible sunshine else would coin itself
and drop down one more gold piece in the path
violence stipulates advantage proved
and safety sure be pain the overplus
murder with jagged knife cut but tear too
foiled oft starved long glut malice for amends
and last craft schemesscheme sorrowful and strange
as though the elements whom mercy checked
had mustered hate for one eruption more
one final deluge to surprise the ark
cradled and sleeping on its mountaintop
the outbreaksignalwhat but the doves coos
back with the olive in her bill for news
sorrow was over tis an infants birth
guidos first born his son and heir that gives
the occasion other men cut free their souls
from care in such a case fly up in thanks
to god reach recognise his love for once
guido cries soul at last the mire is thine
lie there in likeness of a moneybag
this babes birth so pins down past moving now
that i dare cut adrift the lives i late
scrupled to touch lest thou escape with them
these parents and their child my wifetouch one
lose all their rights determined on a head
i could but hate not harm since from each hair
dangled a hope for me nowchance and change
no right was in their child but passes now
to that childs child and through such child to me
i am the father nowcome what come will
i represent my child he comes between
cuts sudden off the sunshine of this life
from those three why the gold is in his curls
not with old pietros violantes head
not his grey horror her more hideous black
go these devoted to the knife

tis done
wherefore should mind misgive heart hesitate
he calls to counsel fashions certain four
colourless natures counted clean till now
rustic simplicity uncorrupted youth
ignorant virtue heres the gold o the prime
when saturn ruled shall shock our leaden day
the clown abash the courtier mark it bards
the courtier tries his hand on clownship here
speaks a word names a crime appoints a price
just breathes on what suffused with all himself
is redhot henceforth past distinction now
i the common glow of hell and thus they break
and blaze on us at rome christs birthnighteve
oh angels that sang erst on the earth peace
to man good willsuch peace finds earth today
after the seventeen hundred years so man
wills good to man so guido makes complete
his murder what is it i saidcuts loose
three lives that hitherto he suffered cling
simply because each served to nail secure
by a corner of the moneybag his soul
therefore lives sacred till the babes first breath
oerweights them in the balanceoff they fly

so is the murder managed sin conceived
to the full and why not crowned with triumph too
why must the sin conceived thus bring forth death
i note how within hairsbreadth of escape
impunity and the thing supposed success
guido is found when the check comes the change
the monitory touch o the tetherfelt
by few not marked by many named by none
at the moment only recognised aright
i the fulness of the days for gods lest sin
exceed the service leap the line such check
a secret which this life finds hard to keep
and often guessed is never quite revealed
guido must needs trip on a stumblingblock
too vulgar too absurdly plain i the path
study this single oversight of care
this hebetude that mars sagacity
forgetfulness of what the man best knew
here is a stranger who with need to fly
needs but to ask and have the means of flight
why the first urchin tells you to leave rome
get horses you must show the warrant just
the banal scrap clerks scribble a fair word buys
or foul one if a ducat sweeten word
and straight authority will back demand
give you the pick o the posthousein such wise
the resident at rome for thirty years
guido instructs a stranger and himself
forgets just this poor paper scrap wherewith
armed every door he knocks at opens wide
to save him horsed and manned with such advance
o the hunt behind why twere the easy task
of hours told on the fingers of one hand
to reach the tuscan frontier laugh at home
lighthearted with his fellows of the place
prepared by that strange shameful judgment that
satire upon a sentence just pronounced
by the rota and confirmed by the granduke
ready in a circle to receive their peer
appreciate his good story how when rome
the popeking and the populace of priests
made common cause with their confederate
the other priestling who seduced his wife
he all unaided wiped out the affront
with decent bloodshed and could face his friends
frolic it in the worlds eye ay such tale
missed such applause all by such oversight
so tired and footsore those bloodflustered five
went reeling on the road through dark and cold
the few permissible miles to sink at length
wallow and sleep in the first wayside straw
as the other herd quenched i the wash o the wave
each swine the devil inside him so slept they
and so were caught and cagedall through one trip
touch of the fool in guido the astute
he curses the omission i surmise
more than the murder why thou fool and blind
it is the mercystroke that stops thy fate
hamstrings and holds thee to thy hurtbut how
on the edge o the precipice one minute more
thou hadst gone farther and fared worse my son
fathoms down on the flint and fire beneath
thy comrades each and all were of one mind
straightway thy murder done to murder thee
in turn because of promised pay withheld
so to the last greed found itself at odds
with craft in thee and proving conqueror
had sent thee the same night that crowned thy hope
thither where this same day i see thee not
nor through gods mercy need tomorrow see

such i find guido midmost blotch of black
discernible in this group of clustered crimes
huddling together in the cave they call
their palace outraged day thus penetrates
around him ranged now close and now remote
prominent or obscure to meet the needs
o the mage and master i detect each shape
subsidiary i the scene nor loathed the less
all alike coloured all descried akin
by one and the same pitchy furnace stirred
at the centre see they lick the masters hand
this foxfaced horrible priest this brotherbrute
the abatewhy mere wolfishness looks well
guido stands honest in the red o the flame
beside this yellow that would pass for white
this guido all craft but no violence
this copier of the mien and gait and garb
of peter and paul that he may go disguised
rob halt and lame sick folk i the templeporch
armed with religion fortified by law
a man of peace who trims the midnight lamp
and turns the classic pageand all for craft
all to work harm with yet incur no scratch
while guido brings the struggle to a close
paul steps back the due distance clear o the trap
he builds and baits guido i catch and judge
paul is past reach in this world and my time
that is a case reserved pass to the next
the boy of the brood the young girolamo
priest canon and what more nor wolf nor fox
but hybrid neither craft nor violence
wholly part violence part craft such cross
tempts speculationwill both blend one day
and prove hells better product or subside
and let the simple quality emerge
go on with satans service the old way
meanwhile what promisewhat performance too
for theres a new distinctive touch i see
lustlacking in the twohells own blue tint
that gives a character and marks the man
more than a match for yellow and red once more
a case reserved should i doubt then comes
the gaunt grey nightmare in the furthest smoke
the hag that gave these three abortions birth
unmotherly mother and unwomanly
woman that near turns motherhood to shame
womanliness to loathing no one word
no gesture to curb cruelty a whit
more than the shepard thwarts her playsome whelps
trying their milkteeth on the soft o the throat
o the first fawn flung with those beseeching eyes
flat in the covert how should she but couch
lick the dry lips unsheathe the blunted claw
catch twixt her placid eyewinks at what chance
old bloody halfforgotten dream may flit
born when herself was novice to the taste
the while she lets youth take its pleasure last
these godabandoned wretched lumps of life
these four companionscountryfolk this time
not tainted by the unwholesome civic breath
much less the curse o the court mere striplings too
fit to do human nature justice still
surely when impudence in guidos shape
shall propose crime and proffer moneysworth
to these stout tall brighteyed and blackhaired boys
the blood shall bound in answer to each cheek
before the indignant outcry break from lip
are these i the mood to murder hardly loosed
from healthy autumnfinish the ploughed glebe
grapes in the barrel work at happy end
and winter come with rest and christmas play
how greet they guido with his final task
as if he but proposed one vineyard more
to dig ere frost come then relax indeed
anywhere anyhow and anywhy
murder me some three people old and young
ye never heard the names ofand be paid
so much and the whole four accede at once
demur as cattle would bid march or halt
is it some lingering habit old fond faith
i the lord of the land instructs thembirthrightbadge
of feudal tenure claims its slaves again
not so at all thou noble human heart
all is done purely for the paywhich earned
and not forthcoming at the instant makes
religion heresy and the lord o the land
fit subject for a murder in his turn
the patron with cut throat and rifled purse
deposited i the roadsideditch his due
nought hinders each good fellow trudging home
the heavier by a piece or two in poke
and so with new zest to the common life
mattock and spade ploughtail and waggonshaft
till some such other piece of luck betide
who knows since this is a mere start in life
and none of them exceeds the twentieth year

nay more i the background yet unnoticed forms
claim to be classed subordinately vile
complacent lookerson that laughperchance
shake head as their friends horseplay grows too rough
with the mere child he manages amiss
but would not interfere and make bad worse
for twice the fractious tears and prayers thou knowst
civility better marzimedici
governor for thy kinsman the granduke
fit representative of law mans lamp
i the magistrates grasp fullflare no rushlightend
sputtering twixt thumb and finger of the priest
whose answer to these comparinis cry
is a threatwhose remedy of pompilias wrong
a shrug o the shoulder a facetious word
or wink traditional with tuscan wits
to guido in the doorway laud to law
the wife is pushed back to the husband he
who knows how these homesquabblings persecute
people who have the public good to mind
and work best with a silence in the court

ah but i save my word at least for thee
archbishop who art under me in the church
as i am under godthou chosen by both
to do the shepherds office feed the sheep
how of this lamb that panted at thy foot
while the wolf pressed on her within crooks reach
wast thou the hireling that did turn and flee
with thee at least anon the little word

such denizens o the cave now cluster round
and heat the furnace sevenfold time indeed
a bolt from heaven should cleave roof and clear place
transfix and show the world suspiring flame
the main offender scar and brand the rest
hurrying each miscreant to his hole then flood
and purify the scene with outside day
which yet in the absolutest drench of dark
neer wants a witness some stray beautybeam
to the despair of hell

first of the first
such i pronounce pompilia then as now
perfect in whitenessstoop thou down my child
give one good moment to the poor old pope
heartsick at having all his world to blame
let me look at thee in the flesh as erst
let me enjoy the old clean linen garb
not the new splendid vesture armed and crowned
would michael yonder be nor crowned nor armed
the less preeminent angel everywhere
i see in the world the intellect of man
that sword the energy his subtle spear
the knowledge which defends him like a shield
everywhere but they make not up i think
the marvel of a soul like thine earths flower
she holds up to the softened gaze of god
it was not given pompilia to know much
speak much to write a book to move mankind
be memorised by who records my time
yet if in purity and patience if
in faith held fast despite the plucking fiend
safe like the signetstone with the new name
that saints are known byif in right returned
for wrong most pardon for worst injury
if there be any virtue any praise
then will this womanchild have provedwho knows
just the one prize vouchsafed unworthy me
ten years a gardener of the untoward ground
i tillthis earth my sweat and blood manure
all the long day that barrenly grows dusk
at least one blossom makes me proud at eve
born mid the briers of my enclosure still
oh here as elsewhere nothingness of man
those be the plants imbedded yonder south
to mellow in the morning those made fat
by the masters eye that yield such timid leaf
uncertain bud as product of his pains
whilesee how this mere chancesown cleftnursed seed
that sprang up by the wayside neath the foot
of the enemy this breaks all into blaze
spreads itself one wide glory of desire
to incorporate the whole great sun it loves
from the inchheight whence it looks and longs my flower
my rose i gather for the breast of god
this i praise most in thee where all i praise
that having been obedient to the end
according to the light allotted law
prescribed thy life still tried still standing test
dutiful to the foolish parents first
submissive next to the bad husbandnay
tolerant of those meaner miserable
that did his hests eked out the dole of pain
thou patient thus couldst rise from law to law
the old to the new promoted at one cry
o the trump of god to the new service not
to longer bear but henceforth fight be found
sublime in new impatience with the foe
endure man and obey god plant firm foot
on neck of man tread man into the hell
meet for him and obey god all the more
oh child that didst despise thy life so much
when it seemed only thine to keep or lose
how the fine ear felt fall the first low word
value life and preserve life for my sake
thou didsthow shall i sayreceive so long
the standing ordinance of god on earth
what wonder if the novel claim had clashed
with old requirement seemed to supersede
too much the customary law but brave
thou at first prompting of what i call god
and fools call nature didst hear comprehend
accept the obligation laid on thee
mother elect to save the unborn child
as brute and bird do reptile and the fly
ay and i nothing doubt even tree shrub plant
and flower o the field all in a common pact
to worthily defend that trust of trusts
life from the ever livingdidst resist
anticipate the office that is mine
and with his own sword stay the upraised arm
the endeavour of the wicked and defend
him whoagain in my defaultwas there
for visible providence one less true than thou
to touch i the past less practised in the right
approved so far in all docility
to all instructionhow had such an one
made scruple is this motion a decree
it was authentic to the experienced ear
o the good and faithful servant go past me
and get thy praiseand be not far to seek
presently when i follow if i may

and surely not so very much apart
need i place thee my warriorpriestin whom
what if i gain the other rose the gold
we grave to imitate gods miracle
greet monarchs with good rose in its degree
irregular noble scapegraceson the same
faultyand peradventure ours the fault
who still misteach mislead throw hook and line
thinking to land leviathan forsooth
tame the scaled neck play with him as a bird
and bind him for our maidens better bear
the king of pride go wantoning awhile
unplagued by cord in nose and thorn in jaw
through deep to deep followed by all that shine
churning the blackness hoary he who made
the comely terror he shall make the sword
to match that piece of netherstone his heart
ay nor miss praise thereby who else shut fire
i the stone to leap from mouth at swords first stroke
in lamps of love and faith the chivalry
that dares the right and disregards alike
the yea and nay o the world selfsacrifice
what if an idol took it ask the church
why she was wont to turn each venus here
poor rome perversely lingered round despite
instruction for the sake of purblind love
into madonnas shape and waste no whit
of aught so rare on earth as gratitude
all this sweet savour was not ours but thine
nard of the rock a natural wealth we name
incense and treasure up as food for saints
when flung to uswhose function was to give
not find the costly perfume do i smile
nay caponsacchi much i find amiss
blameworthy punishable in this freak
of thine this youth prolonged though age was ripe
this masquerade in sober day with change
of motley toonow hypocritesdisguise
now foolscostume which lie was least like truth
which the ungainlier more discordant garb
with that symmetric soul inside my son
the churchmans or the worldlingslet him judge
our adversary who enjoys the task
i rather chronicle the healthy rage
when the first moan broke from the martyrmaid
at that uncaging of the beastsmade bare
my athlete on the instant gave such good
great undisguised leap over post and pale
right into the midcirque free fightingplace
there may have been rash strippingevery rag
went to the windsinfringement manifold
of laws prescribed pudicity i fear
in this impulsive and prompt selfdisplay
ever such tax comes of the foolish youth
men mulct the wiser manhood and suspect
no veritable star swims out of cloud
bear thou such imputation undergo
the penalty i nowise dare relax
conventional chastisement and rebuke
but for the outcome the brave starry birth
conciliating earth with all that cloud
thank heaven as i do ay such championship
of god at first blush such prompt cheery thud
of glove on ground that answers ringingly
the challenge of the false knightwatch we long
and wait we vainly for its gallant like
from those appointed to the service sworn
his bodyguard with pay and privilege
whitecinct because in white walks sanctity
redsocked how else proclaim fine scorn of flesh
unchariness of blood when blood faith begs
where are the menatarms with cross on coat
aloof bewraying their attire whilst thou
in mask and motley pledged to dance not fight
sprangst forth the hero in thought word and deed
how throughout all thy warfare thou wast pure
i find it easy to believe and if
at any fateful moment of the strange
adventure the strong passion of that strait
fear and surprise may have revealed too much
as when a thundrous midnight with black air
that burns raindrops that blister breaks a spell
draws out the excessive virtue of some sheathed
shut unsuspected flower that hoards and hides
immensity of sweetnessso perchance
might the surprise and fear release too much
the perfect beauty of the body and soul
thou savedst in thy passion for gods sake
he who is pity was the trial sore
temptation sharp thank god a second time
why comes temptation but for man to meet
and master and make crouch beneath his foot
and so be pedestalled in triumph pray
lead us into no such temptations lord
yea but o thou whose servants are the bold
lead such temptations by the head and hair
reluctant dragons up to who dares fight
that so he may do battle and have praise
do i not see the praisethat while thy mates
bound to deserve i the matter prove at need
unprofitable through the very pains
we gave to train them well and start them fair
are found too stiff with standing ranked and ranged
for onset in good earnest too obtuse
of ear through iteration of command
for catching quick the sense of the real cry
thou whose swordhand was used to strike the lute
whose sentrystation graced some wantons gate
thou didst push forward and show mettle shame
the laggards and retrieve the day well done
be glad thou hast let light into the world
through that irregular breach o the boundarysee
the same upon thy path and march assured
learning anew the use of soldiership
selfabnegation freedom from all fear
loyalty to the lifes end ruminate
deserve the initiatory spasmonce more
work be unhappy but bear life my son
and troop you somewhere twixt the best and worst
where crowd the indifferent product all too poor
makeshift starved samples of humanity
father and mother huddle there and hide
a gracious eye may find you foul and fair
sadly mixed natures selfindulgentyet
selfsacrificing too how the love soars
how the craft avarice vanity and spite
sink again so they keep the middle course
slide into silly crime at unaware
slip back upon the stupid virtue stay
nowhere enough for being classed i hope
and fear accept the swift and rueful death
taught somewhat sternlier than is wont what waits
the ambiguous creaturehow the one black tuft
steadies the aim of the arrow just as well
as the wide faultless white on the birds breast
nay you were punished in the very part
that looked most pure of speckthe honest love
betrayed youdid love seem most worthy pains
challenge such purging as ordained survive
when all the rest of you was done with go
never again elude the choice of tints
white shall not neutralise the black nor good
compensate bad in man absolve him so
lifes business being just the terrible choice

so do i see pronounce on all and some
grouped for my judgment nowprofess no doubt
while i pronounce dark difficult enough
the human sphere yet eyes grow sharp by use
i find the truth dispart the shine from shade
as a mere man may with no special touch
o the lynxgift in each ordinary orb
nay if the popular notion class me right
one of well nigh decayed intelligence
what of that through hard labour and good will
and habitude that gives a blind man sight
at the practised fingerends of him i do
discern and dare decree in consequence
whatever prove the peril of mistake
whence then this quite new quick cold thrillcloudlike
this keen dread creeping from a quarter scarce
suspected in the skies i nightly scan
what slacks the tense nerve saps the woundup spring
of the act that should and shall be sends the mount
and mass o the whole mansstrengthconglobed so late
shudderingly into dust a moments work
while i stand firm go fearless in this world
for this life recognise and arbitrate
touch and let stay or else remove a thing
judge this is right this object out of place
candle in hand that helps me and to spare
what if a voice deride me perk and pry
brighten each nook with thine intelligence
play the good householder ply man and maid
with tasks prolonged into the midnight test
their work and nowise stint of the due wage
each worthy worker but with gyves and whip
pay thou misprision of a single point
plain to thy happy self who liftst the light
lamentst the darklingbold to all beneath
what if thyself adventure now the place
is purged so well leave pavement and mount roof
look round thee for the light of the upper sky
the fire which lit thy fire which finds default
in guido franceschini to his cost
what if above in the domain of light
thou miss the accustomed signs remark eclipse
shalt thou still gaze on ground nor lift a lid
steady in thy superb prerogative
thy inch of inklingnor once face the doubt
i the sphere above thee darkness to be felt

yet my poor spark had for its source the sun
thither i sent the great looks which compel
light from its fount all that i do and am
comes from the truth or seen or else surmised
remembered or divined as mere man may
i know just so nor otherwise as i know
i speakwhat should i know then and how speak
were there a wild mistake of eye or brain
in the recorded governance above
if my own breath only blew coal alight
i called celestial and the morningstar
i who in this world act resolvedly
dispose of men the body and the soul
as they acknowledge or gainsay this light
i show themshall i too lack courageleave
i too the post of me like those i blame
refuse with kindred inconsistency
grapple with danger whereby souls grow strong
i am near the end but still not at the end
all till the very end is trial in life
at this stage is the trial of my soul
danger to face or danger to refuse
shall i dare try the doubt now or not dare

o thouas represented here to me
in such conception as my soul allows
under thy measureless my atom width
mans mindwhat is it but a convex glass
wherein are gathered all the scattered points
picked out of the immensity of sky
to reunite there be our heaven on earth
our known unknown our god revealed to man
existent somewhere somehow as a whole
here as a whole proportioned to our sense
there which is nowhere speech must babble thus
in the absolute immensity the whole
appreciable solely by thyself
here by the little mind of man reduced
to littleness that suits his faculty
appreciable too in the degree
between thee and ourselvesnay even again
below us to the extreme of the minute
appreciable by how many and what diverse
modes of the life thou makest be why live
except for lovehow love unless they know
each of them only filling to the edge
insect or angel his just length and breadth
due facet of reflectionfull no less
angel or insect as thou framedst things
i it is who have been appointed here
to represent thee in my turn on earth
just as if new philosophy know aught
this one earth out of all the multitude
of peopled worlds as stars are now supposed
was chosen and no sunstar of the swarm
for stage and scene of thy transcendent act
beside which even the creation fades
into a puny exercise of power
choice of the world choice of the thing i am
both emanate alike from the dread play
of operation outside this our sphere
where things are classed and counted small or great
incomprehensibly the choice is thine
i therefore bow my head and take thy place
there is beside the works a tale of thee
in the worlds mouth which i find credible
i love it with my heart unsatisfied
i try it with my reason nor discept
from any point i probe and pronounce sound
mind is not matter nor from matter but
aboveleave matter then proceed with mind
mans be the mind recognised at the height
leave the inferior minds and look at man
is he the strong intelligent and good
up to his own conceivable height nowise
enough o the lowsoar the conceivable height
find cause to match the effect in evidence
works in the world not mans then gods leave man
conjecture of the worker by the work
is there strength thereenough intelligence
ample but goodness in a like degree
not to the human eye in the present state
this isoscele deficient in the base
what lacks then of perfection fit for god
but just the instance which this tale supplies
of love without a limit so is strength
so is intelligence then love is so
unlimited in its selfsacrifice
then is the tale true and god shows complete
beyond the tale i reach into the dark
feel what i cannot see and still faith stands
i can believe this dread machinery
of sin and sorrow would confound me else
devisedall pain at most expenditure
of pain by who devised painto evolve
by new machinery in counterpart
the moral qualities of manhow else
to make him love in turn and be beloved
creative and selfsacrificing too
and thus eventually godlike ay
i have said ye are godsshall it be said for nought
enable man to wring from out all pain
all pleasure for a common heritage
to all eternity this may be surmised
the other is revealedwhether a fact
absolute abstract independent truth
historic not reduced to suit mans mind
or only truth reverberate changed made pass
a spectrum into mind the narrow eye
the same and not the same else unconceived
though quite conceivable to the next grade
above it in intelligenceas truth
easy to man were blindness to the beast
by parity of procedurethe same truth
in a new form but changed in either case
what matter so the intelligence be filled
to the child the sea is angry for it roars
frost bites else why the toothlike fret on face
man makes acoustics deal with the seas wrath
explains the choppy cheek by chymic law
to both remains one and the same effect
on drum of ear and root of nose change cause
never so thoroughly so our heart be struck
what care iby gods gloved hand or the bare
nor do i much perplex me with aught hard
dubious in the transmitting of the tale
no nor with certain riddles set to solve
this life is training and a passage pass
still we march over some flat obstacle
we made give way before us solid truth
in front of it were motion for the world
the moral sense grows but by exercise
tis even as man grew probatively
initiated in godship set to make
a fairer moral world than this he finds
guess now what shall be known hereafter thus
o the present problem as we see and speak
a faultless creature is destroyed and sin
has had its way i the world where god should rule
ay but for this irrelevant circumstance
of inquisition after blood we see
pompilia lost and guido saved how long
for his whole life how much is that whole life
we are not babes but know the minutes worth
and feel that life is large and the world small
so wait till life have passed from out the world

neither does this astonish at the end
that whereas i can so receive and trust
men made with hearts and souls the same as mine
reject and disbelievesubordinate
the future to the presentsin nor fear
this i refer still to the foremost fact
life is probation and this earth no goal
but startingpoint of man compel him strive
which means in man as good as reach the goal
why institute that race his life at all
but this does overwhelm me with surprise
touch me to terrornot that faith the pearl
should be let lie by fishers wanting food
nor seen and handled by a certain few
critical and contemptuous straight consigned
to shore and shingle for the pebble it proves
but that when haply found and known and named
by the residue made rich for evermore
theseay these favoured ones should in a trice
turn and with double zest go dredge for whelks
mudworms that make the savoury soup enough
o the disbelievers see the faithful few
how do the christians here deport them keep
their robes of white unspotted by the world
what is this aretine archbishop this
man under me as i am under god
this champion of the faith i armed and decked
pushed forward put upon a pinnacle
to show the enemy his victorsee
whats the best fighting when the couple close
pompilia cries protect me from the fiend
no for thy guido is one heady strong
dangerous to disquiet let him bide
he needs some bone to mumble help amuse
the darkness of his den with so the fawn
which limps up bleeding to my foot and lies
come to me daughterthus i throw him back
have we misjudged here overarmed the knight
given gold and silk where the plain steel serves best
enfeebled whom we sought to fortify
made an archbishop and undone a saint
well then descend these heights this pride of life
sit in the ashes with the barefoot monk
who long ago stamped out the worldly sparks
fasting and watching stone cell and wire scourge
no such indulgence as unknits the strength
these breed the tight nerve and tough cuticle
let the worlds praise or blame run rilletwise
off the broad back and brawny breast we know
he meets the first cold sprinkle of the world
and shudders to the marrow save this child
oh my superiors oh the archbishop here
who was it dared lay hand upon the ark
his betters saw fall nor put finger forth
great ones could help yet help not why should small
i break my promise let her break her heart
these are the christians not the wordlings not
the sceptics who thus battle for the faith
if foolish virgins disobey and sleep
what wonder but the wise that watch this time
sell lamps and buy lutes exchange oil for wine
the mystic spouse betrays the bridegroom here
to our last resource then since all flesh is weak
bind weaknesses together we get strength
the individual weighed found wanting try
some institution honest artifice
whereby the units grow compact and firm
each props the other and so stand is made
by our embodied cowards that grow brave
the monastery called of convertites
meant to help women because these helped christ
a thing existent only while it acts
does as designed else a nonentity
for what is an idea unrealised
pompilia is consigned to these for help
they do help they are prompt to testify
to her pure life and saintly dying days
she dies and lo who seemed so poor proves rich
what does the body that lives through helpfulness
to women for christs sake the kiss turns bite
the doves note changes to the crows cry judge
seeing that this our convent claims of right
what goods belong to those we succour be
the same proved women of dishonest life
and seeing that this trial made appear
pompilia was in such predicament
the convent hereupon pretends to said
succession of pompilia issues writ
and takes possession by the fiscs advice
such is their attestation to the cause
of christ who had one saint at least they hoped
but is a titledeed to filch a corpse
to slander and an infantheir to cheat
christ must give up his gains then they unsay
all the fine speecheswho was saint is whore
why scripture yields no parallel for this
the soldiers only threw dice for christs coat
we want another legend of the twelve
disputing if it was christs coat at all
claiming as prize the woof of pricefor why
the master was a thief purloined the same
or paid for it out of the common bag
can it be this is end and outcome all
i take with me to show as stewardships fruit
the best yield of the latest time this year
the seventeenhundredth since god died for man
is such effect proportionate to cause
and still the terror keeps on the increase
when i perceivehow can i blink the fact
that the fault the obduracy to good
lies not with the impracticable stuff
whence man is made his very natures fault
as if it were of ice the moon may gild
not melt or stone twas meant the sun should warm
not make bear flowersnor ice nor stone to blame
but it can melt that ice and bloom that stone
impassible to rule of day and night
this terrifies me thus compelled perceive
whatever love and faith we looked should spring
at advent of the authoritative star
which yet lie sluggish curdled at the source
these have leapt forth profusely in old time
these still respond with promptitude today
at challenge ofwhat unacknowledged powers
o the air what uncommissioned meteors warmth
by law and light by rule should supersede
for see this priest this caponsacchi stung
at the first summonshelp for honours sake
play the man pity the oppressedno pause
how does he lay about him in the midst
strike any foe right wrong at any risk
all blindness bravery and obedienceblind
ay as a man would be inside the sun
delirious with the plenitude of light
should interfuse him to the fingerends
let him rush straight and how shall he go wrong
where are the christians in their panoply
the loins we girt about with truth the breasts
righteousness plated round the shield of faith
the helmet of salvation and that sword
o the spirit even the word of godwhere these
slunk into corners oh i hear at once
hubbub of protestation what we monks
we friars of such an order such a rule
have not we fought bled left our martyrmark
at every point along the boundaryline
twixt true and false religion and the world
where this or the other dogma of our church
called for defence and i despite myself
how can i but speak loud what truth speaks low
or better than the best or nothing serves
what boots deed i can cap and cover straight
with such another doughtiness to match
done at an instinct of the natural man
immolate body sacrifice soul too
do not these publicans the same outstrip
or else stop race you boast runs neck and neck
you with the wings they with the feetfor shame
oh i remark your diligence and zeal
five years long now rounds faith into my ears
help thou or christendom is done to death
five years since in the province of tokien
which is in china as some people know
maigrot my vicar apostolic there
having a great qualm issues a decree
alack the converts use as gods name not
tienchu but plain tien or else mere shangti
as jesuits please to fancy politic
while say dominicans it calls down fire
for tien means heaven and shangti supreme prince
while tienchu means the lord of heaven all cry
there is no business urgent for despatch
as that thou send a legate specially
cardinal tournon straight to pekin there
to settle and compose the difference
so have i seen a potentate all fume
for some infringement of his realms just right
some menace to a mudbuilt strawthatched farm
o the frontier while inside the mainland lie
quite undisputedfor in solitude
whole cities plague may waste or famine sap
what if the sun crumble the sands encroach
while he looks on sublimely at his ease
how does their ruin touch the empires bound

and is this little all that was to be
where is the gloriouslydecisive change
the immeasurable metamorphosis
of human clay to divine gold we looked
should in some poor sort justify the price
had a mere adept of the rosy cross
spent his life to consummate the great work
would not we start to see the stuff it touched
yield not a grain more than the vulgar got
by the old smeltingprocess years ago
if this were sad to see in just the sage
who should profess so much perform no more
what is it when suspected in that power
who undertook to make and made the world
devised and did effect man body and soul
ordained salvation for them both and yet
well is the thing we see salvation

i
put no such dreadful question to myself
within whose circle of experience burns
the central truth power wisdom goodnessgod
i must outlive a thing ere know it dead
when i outlive the faith there is a sun
when i lie ashes to the very soul
someone not i must wail above the heap
he died in dark whence never morn arose
while i see day succeed the deepest night
how can i speak but as i knowmy speech
must be throughout the darkness it will end
the light that did burn will burn clouds obscure
but for which obscuration all were bright
too hastily concluded sunsuffused
a cloud may soothe the eye made blind by blaze
better the very clarity of heaven
the soft streaks are the beautiful and dear
what but the weakness in a faith supplies
the incentive to humanity no strength
absolute irresistible comports
how can man love but what he yearns to help
and that which men think weakness within strength
but angels know for strength and stronger yet
what were it else but the first things made new
but repetition of the miracle
the divine instance of selfsacrifice
that never ends and aye begins for man
so never i miss footing in the maze
noi have light nor fear the dark at all

but are mankind not real who pace outside
my petty circle the world measured me
and when they stumble even as i stand
have i a right to stop ears when they cry
as they were phantoms took the clouds for crags
tripped and fell where the march of man might move
beside the cry is other than a ghosts
when out of the old time there pleads some bard
philosopher or both andwhispers not
but words it boldly the inward work and worth
of any mind what other mind may judge
save god who only knows the thing he made
the veritable service he exacts
it is the outward product men appraise
behold an engine hoists a tower aloft
i looked that it should move the mountain too
or else had just a turret toppled down
success enoughmay say the machinist
who knows what less or more result might be
but we who see that done we cannot do
a feat beyond mans force we men must say
regard me and that shake i gave the world
i was born not so long before christs birth
as christs birth haply did precede thy day
but many a watch before the star of dawn
therefore i livedit is thy creed affirms
pope innocent who art to answer me
under conditions nowise to escape
whereby salvation was impossible
each impulse to achieve the good and fair
each aspiration to the pure and true
being without a warrant or an aim
was just as sterile a felicity
as if the insect born to spend his life
soaring his circles stopped them to describe
painfully motionless in the midair
some word of weighty counsel for mans sake
some know thyself or take the golden mean
forwent his happy dance and the glad ray
died half an hour the sooner and was dust
i born to perish like the brutes or worse
why not live brutishly obey my law
but i of body as of soul complete
a gymnast at the games philosopher
i the schools who painted and made musicall
glories that met upon the tragic stage
when the third poets tread surprised the two
whose lot fell in a land where life was great
and sense went free and beauty lay profuse
i untouched by one adverse circumstance
adopted virtue as my rule of life
waived all reward and loved for lovings sake
and what my heart taught me i taught the world
and have been teaching now two thousand years
witness my workplays that should please forsooth
they might please they may displease they shall teach
for truths sake so i said and did and do
five hundred years ere paul spoke felix heard
how much of temperance and righteousness
judgment to come did i find reason for
corroborate with my strong style that spared
no sin nor swerved the more from branding brow
because the sinner was called zeus and god
how nearly did i guess at that paul knew
how closely come in what i represent
as duty to his doctrine yet a blank
and as that limner not untruly limns
who draws an object round or square which square
or round seems to the unassisted eye
though galileos tube display the same
oval or oblongso who controverts
i rendered rightly what proves wrongly wrought
beside pauls picture mine was true for me
i saw that there are first and above all
the hidden forces blind necessities
named nature but the things self unconceived
then followhow dependent upon these
we know not how imposed above ourselves
we well knowwhat i name the gods a power
various or one for great and strong and good
is there and little weak and bad there too
wisdom and folly say these make no god
what is it else that rules outside mans self
a fact thenalways to the naked eye
and so the one revealment possible
of what were unimagined else by man
therefore what gods do man may criticise
applaud condemnhow should he fear the truth
but likewise have in awe because of power
venerate for the main munificence
and give the doubtful deed its due excuse
from the acknowledged creature of a day
to the eternal and divine thus bold
yet selfmistrusting should man bear himself
most assured on what now concerns him most
the law of his own life the path he prints
which law is virtue and not vice i say
and least inquisitive where least search skills
i the nature we best give the clouds to keep
what could i paint beyond a scheme like this
out of the fragmentary truths where light
lay fitful in a tenebrific time
you have the sunrise now joins truth to truth
shoots life and substance into death and void
themselves compose the whole we made before
the forces and necessity grow god
the beings so contrarious that seemed gods
prove just his operation manifold
and multiform translated as must be
into intelligible shape so far
as suits our sense and sets us free to feel
what if i let a child think childhoodlong
that lightning i would have him spare his eye
is a real arrow shot at naked orb
the man knows more but shuts his lids the same
lightnings cause comprehends nor man nor child
why then my scheme your better knowledge broke
presently readjusts itself the small
proportioned largelier parts and whole named new
so much no more two thousand years have done
pope dost thou dare pretend to punish me
for not descrying sunshine at midnight
me who crept allfours found my way so far
while thou rewardest teachers of the truth
who miss the plain way in the blaze of noon
though just a word from that strong style of mine
grasped honestly in hand as guidingstaff
had pricked them a sure path across the bog
that mire of cowardice and slush of lies
wherein i find them wallow in wide day

how should i answer this euripides
paultis a legendanswered seneca
but that was in the dayspring noon is now
we have got too familiar with the light
shall i wish back once more that thrill of dawn
when the whole truthtouched man burned up one fire
assured the trial fiery fierce but fleet
would from his little heap of ashes lend
wings to the conflagration of the world
which christ awaits ere he make all things new
so should the frail become the perfect rapt
from glory of pain to glory of joy and so
even in the endthe act renouncing earth
lands houses husbands wives and children here
begin that other act which finds all lost
regained in this time even a hundredfold
and in the next time feels the finite love
blent and embalmed with its eternal life
so does the sun ghastlily seem to sink
in those north parts lean all but out of life
desist a dread mere breathingstop then slow
reassert day begin the endless rise
was this too easy for our afterstage
was such a lightingup of faith in life
only allowed initiate set mans step
in the true way by help of the great glow
a way wherein it is ordained he walk
bearing to see the light from heaven still more
and more encroached on by the light of earth
tentatives earth puts forth to rival heaven
earthly incitements that mankind serve god
for mans sole sake not gods and therefore mans
till at last who distinguishes the sun
from a mere druid fire on a far mount
more praise to him who with his subtle prism
shall decompose both beams and name the true
in such sense who is last proves first indeed
for how could saints and martyrs fail see truth
streak the nights blackness who is faithful now
untwists heavens pure white from the yellow flare
o the worlds gross torch without a foil to help
produce the christian act so possible
when in the way stood neros cross and stake
so hard now that the world smiles rightly done
it is the politic the thrifty way
will clearly make you in the end returns
beyond our fools sport and improvidence
we fools go thro the cornfield of this life
pluck ears to left and right and swallow raw
nay tread at pleasure a sheaf underfoot
to get the better at some poppyflower
well aware we shall have so much wheat less
in the eventual harvest you meantime
waste not a spikethe richlier will you reap
what then there will be always garnered meal
sufficient for our comfortable loaf
while you enjoy the undiminished prize
is it not this ignoble confidence
cowardly hardihood that dulls and damps
makes the old heroism impossible
unlesswhat whispers me of times to come
what if it be the mission of that age
my death will usher into life to shake
this torpor of assurance from our creed
reintroduce the doubt discarded bring
the formidable danger back we drove
long ago to the distance and the dark
no wild beast now prowls round the infant camp
we have built wall and sleep in city safe
but if the earthquake try the towers that laugh
to think they once saw lions rule outside
till man stand out again pale resolute
prepared to diethat is alive at last
as we broke up that old faith of the world
have we next age to break up this the new
faith in the thing grown faith in the report
whence need to bravely disbelieve report
through increased faith in thing reports belie
must we denydo they these molinists
at peril of their body and their soul
recognised truths obedient to some truth
unrecognised yet but perceptible
correct the portrait by the living face
mans god by gods god in the mind of man
then for the few that rise to the new height
the many that must sink to the old depth
the multitude found fall away a few
een ere the new law speak clear keep the old
preserve the christian level call good good
and evil evil even though razed and blank
the old titles stand thro custom habitude
and all they may mistake for finer sense
o the fact than reason warrantsas before
they hope perhaps fear not impossibly
surely some one pompilia in the world
will say i know the right place by foots feel
i took it and tread firm there wherefore change
but what a multitude will fall perchance
quite through the crumbling truth subjacent late
sink to the next discoverable base
rest upon human nature take their stand
on what is fact the lust and pride of life
the mass of men whose very souls even now
seem to need recreatingso they slink
wormlike into the mud light now lays bare
whose future we dispose of with shut eyes
they are baptisedgrafted the barren twigs
into the living stock of christ may bear
one day till when they lie deathlike not dead
those who with all the aid of christ lie thus
how without christ whither unaided sink
what but to this rehearsed before my eyes
do not we end the century and i
the impatient antimasque treads close on kibe
o the very masques self it will mockon me
last lingering personage the impatient mime
pushes alreadywill i block the way
will my slow trail of garments neer leave space
for pantaloon sock plume and castanet
here comes the first experimentalist
in the new order of thingshe plays a priest
does he take inspiration from the church
directly make her rule his law of life
not he his own mere impulse guides the man
happily sometimes since ourselves admit
he had danced in gaiety of heart i the main
the right step in the maze we bade him foot
what if his heart had prompted to break loose
and mar the measure why we must submit
and thank the chance that brought him safely through
will he repeat the prodigy perhaps
can he teach others how to quit themselves
prove why this step was right while that were wrong
how should he ask your hearts as i asked mine
and get discreetly through the morrice so
if your hearts misdirect youquit the stage
and make amendsbe there amends to make
such is for the augustine that was once
this canon caponsacchi we see now
and my heart answers to another tune
puts in the abate second in the suite
i have my taste too and tread no such step
you choose the glorious life and may for me
who like the lowest of lifes appetites
what you judgebut the very truth of joy
to my own apprehension which must judge
call me knave and you get yourself called fool
i live for greed ambition lust revenge
attain these ends by force guile hypocrite
today perchance tomorrow recognised
the rational man the type of commonsense
theres loyola adapted to our time
under such guidance guido plays his part
he also influencing in due turn
these last clods where i track intelligence
by any glimmer those four at his beck
ready to murder any and at their own
as ready to murder himthese are the world
and first effect of the new cause of things
there they lie also dulythe old pair
of the weak head and not so wicked heart
and the one christian mother wife and girl
which three gifts seem to make an angel up
the first foot of the dance is on their heads

still i stand here not off the stage though close
on the exit and my last act as my first
i owe the scene and him who armed me thus
with pauls sword as with peters key i smite
with my whole strength once more then end my part
ending so far as man may this offence
and when i raise my arm what plucks my sleeve
who stops me in the righteous functionfoe
or friend o still as ever friends are they
who in the interest of outraged truth
deprecate such rough handling of a lie
the facts being proved and incontestable
what is the last word i must listen to
is it spare yet a term this barren stock
we pray thee dig about and dung and dress
till he repent and bring forth fruit even yet
is it so poor and swift a punishment
shall throw him out of life with all that sin
let mercy rather pile up pain on pain
till the flesh expiate what the soul pays else
nowise remonstrance on all sides begins
instruct me theres a new tribunal now
higher than godsthe educated mans
nice sense of honour in the human breast
supersedes here the old coarse oracle
confirming handsomely a point or so
wherein the predecessor worked aright
by rule of thumb as when christ saidwhen where
enough i find it in a pleading here
all other wrongs done patiently i take
but touch my honour and the case is changed
i feel the due resentmentnemini
honorem trado is my quick retort
right of him just as if pronounced today
still should the old authority be mute
or doubtful or in speaking clash with new
the younger takes permission to decide
at last we have the instinct of the world
ruling its household without tutelage
and while the two laws human and divine
have busied finger with this tangled case
in the brisk junior pushes cuts the knot
pronounces for acquittal how it trips
silverly oer the tongue remit the death
forgivewell in the old way if thou please
decency and the relics of routine
respectedlet the count go free as air
since he may plead a priests immunity
the minor orders help enough for that
with farinaccis licencewho decides
that the mere implication of such man
so privileged in any cause before
whatever court except the spiritual
straight quashes the procedurequash it then
it proves a pretty loophole of escape
moreover that beside the patent fact
o the laws allowance theres involved the weal
o the popedom a sons privilege at stake
thou wilt pretend the churchs interest
ignore all finer reasons to forgive
but herein lies the proper cogency
let thy friends teach thee while thou tellest beads
that in this case the spirit of culture speaks
civilisation is imperative
to her shall we remand all delicate points
henceforth nor take irregular advice
o the sly as heretofore she used to hint
apologies when law was out of sorts
because a saucy tongue was put to rest
an eye that roved was cured of arrogance
but why be forced to mumble under breath
what soon shall be acknowledged the plain fact
outspoken say in thy successors time
methinks we see the golden age return
civilisation and the emperor
succeed thy christianity and pope
one emperor then as one pope now meanwhile
she anticipates a little to tell thee take
count guidos life and sap society
whereof the main prop was is and shall prove
supremacy of husband over wife
shall the man rule i the house or may his mate
because of any plea dispute the same
oh pleas of all sorts shall abound be sure
if once allowed validityfor harsh
and savage for inept and sillysooth
for this and that will the ingenious sex
demonstrate the best master eer graced slave
and theres but one short way to end the coil
by giving right and reason steadily
to the man and master then the wife submits
there it is broadly statednor the time
admits we shifta pillar nay a stake
out of its place i the tenement one touch
whereto may send a shudder through the heap
and bring it toppling on our heads perchance
moreover if this breed a qualm in thee
give thine own feelings play for oncedeal death
thou whose own life winks oer the socketedge
wouldst thou it went out in such ugly snuff
as dooming sons to death though justice bade
why on a certain feast barabbas self
was set free not to cloud the general cheer
neither shalt thou pollute thy sabbath close
mercy is safe and graceful how one hears
the howl begin scarce the three little taps
o the silver mallet ended on thy brow
his last act was to sacrifice a count
and thereby screen a scandal of the church
guido condemned the canon justified
of coursedelinquents of his cloth go free
and so the luthers and the calvins come
so thy hand helps molinos to the chair
whence he may hold forth till dooms day on just
these petitmaître priestlingsin the choir
sanctus et benedictus with a brush
of soft guitarstrings that obey the thumb
touched by the bedside for accompaniment
does this give umbrage to a husband death
to the fool and to the priest impunity
but no impunity to any friend
so simply overloyal as these four
who made religion of their patrons cause
believed in him and did his bidding straight
asked not one question but laid down the lives
this pope tookall four lives together made
just his own length of daysso dead they lie
as these were times when loyaltys a drug
and zeal in a subordinate too cheap
and common to be saved when we spend life
come tis too much good breath we waste in words
the pardon holy father spare grimace
shrugs and reluctance are not we the world
bid thee our priam let soft culture plead
hecubalike non tali virgil serves
auxilio and the rest enough it works
the pope relaxes and the prince is loth
the fathers bowels yearn the mans will bends
reply is apt our tears on tremble hearts
big with a benediction wait the word
shall circulate thro the city in a trice
set every window flaring give each man
o the mob his torch to wave for gratitude
pronounce it for our breath and patience fail

i will sirs for a voice other than yours
quickens my spirit quis pro domino
who is upon the lords side asked the count
i who write
on receipt of this command
acquaint count guido and his fellows four
they die tomorrow could it be tonight
the better but the work to do takes time
set with all diligence a scaffold up
not in the customary place by bridge
saint angelo where die the common sort
but since the man is noble and his peers
by predilection haunt the peoples square
there let him be beheaded in the midst
and his companions hanged on either side
so shall the quality see fear and learn
all which work takes time till tomorrow then
let there be prayer incessant for the five

for the main criminal i have no hope
except in such a suddenness of fate
i stood at naples once a night so dark
i could have scarce conjectured there was earth
anywhere sky or sea or world at all
but the nights black was burst through by a blaze
thunder struck blow on blow earth groaned and bore
through her whole length of mountain visible
there lay the city thick and plain with spires
and like a ghost disshrouded white the sea
so may the truth be flashed out by one blow
and guido see one instant and be saved
else i avert my face nor follow him
into that sad obscure sequestered state
where god unmakes but to remake the soul
he else made first in vain which must not be
enough for i may die this very night
and how should i dare die this man let live

carry this forthwith to the governorembed"
