i gave it all to you
with no questions asked
i wanted a future
who cares bout the past
that first argument
you up and left up and left
ive seen a change in you change in you
words i wont accept
i thought i had lost you
when you twist back my arm
cause the man i thought i knew
wouldnâ€™t do me no harm
and that ran through my mind
over again i promised myself
you wouldnt put your hands on me again
never no more

chorus
i didnt sleep that night
and i held my pillow tight
now trust me when i say
you have been told
im tellin you to never touch me no more
never no more

i should have left you
when you called me out my name
i stooped to your level
replied you the same
now here we are again
you at my throat
now i see the same old change
that i did before
i walk away from you
at the drop of a dime
saw that this treatment is way out of line
and that ran through my mind
over and over again promised myself
you wouldnt put your hands on me again
never no more never

bridge
you know id rather give you your space
cuz i just dont know
what to or not to say
stay out your way or get in your face
i just know you better not touch me again
or i i walk away
that is one game i refuse to play
oh ohhhh
chorus
oh i didnt sleep that night
i held my pillow tight
now trust me when i say
you have been told
im tellin you never to touch me no more
never no more

never no moreembed"
