how many lies do we have to tell
to keep from saying that i wish you well

how many times that false alarm goes off goes off
goes off goes off
i know ill see you tomorrow

verse 2
how many tears do we have to cry
how many sleepless lonely nights
to work it out is it worth it now
should we go ahead
or should we turn around
i know i’ll see you tomorrow
