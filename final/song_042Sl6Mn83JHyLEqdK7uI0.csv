try not to abuse your power
i know we didnt choose to change
you might not wanna lose your power
but havin its so strange

verse 1
she said you were a hero
you played the part
but you ruined her in a year
dont act like it was hard
and you swear you didnt know didnt know
no wonder why you didnt ask
she was sleepin in your clothes in your clothes
but now shes got to get to class

prechorus
how dare you
and how could you
will you only feel bad when they find out
if you could take it all back
would you

chorus
try not to abuse your power
i know we didnt choose to change
you might not wanna lose your power
but havin its so strange
you might also likeverse 2
i thought that i was special
you made me feel
like it was my fault you were the devil
lost your appeal
does it keep you in control in control
for you to keep her in a cage
and you swear you didnt know didnt know
you said you thought she was your age

prechorus
how dare you
and how could you
will you only feel bad if it turns out
that they kill your contract
would you

chorus
try not to abuse your power
i know we didnt choose to change
you might not wanna lose your power
but power isnt pain
