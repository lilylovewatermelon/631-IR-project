you can cake on all that make up
and steal your roomates dress
take pictures of your good side
in the bathroom at the bar
call your friend a slut
for leavin the party early
with a guy who never looked at you
and you can split an adderal
with a stranger in the bathroom stall
send a misspelled text to an ex
who put his fist through your bedroom wall
cause bein treated like shit
its really comfortable to you
know what im sayin no no no

chorus
that aint beautiful
no that aint you
you can do better
oh you can do better better

verse 2
you can fly to turks and caicos
in a seat you cant afford
cause some girl you met six months ago
asked you to be in her wedding
get pissed at your plus one
even though hes just a friend
for lookin up the girl from lsu on instagram
with the drunk bridesmaids divin for the bouquet
spilling cabernet on the dance floor
and youre in the back with your arms crossed
bein a bad sport and you
wake up in the mornin in the wrong room
you cant find your passport
and you call your mama cryin on the bathroom floor
see sam hunt liveget tickets as low as 32you might also likechorus
but that aint beautiful
no that aint you
you can do better
oh you can do better better
if that aint beautiful
no that aint you
you can do better
oh you can do better betterembed"
