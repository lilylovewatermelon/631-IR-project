true that i saw her hair like the branch of a tree
a willow dancing on air before covering me
under cotton and calicoes
over canopy dapple long ago

verse 2
true that love in withdrawal was the weepin of me
that the sound of the saw must be known by the tree
must be felled for to fight the cold
i fretted fire but that was long ago

chorus
and its not tonight oh oh
where im set alight oh oh
and i blink in sight oh
of your blinding light oh
oh and its not tonight oh oh
where you hold me tight oh oh
light a fire bright oh
oh let it blaze alright oh
oh but youre good to me oh youre good to me oh oh
oh but youre good to me baby oh oh

verse 3
with the roar of the fire my heart rose to its feet
like the ashes of ash i saw rise in the heat
settle soft and as pure as snow
i fell in love with the fire long ago

with each love i cut loose i was never the same
watching stillliving roots be consumed by the flame
i was fixed on your hand of gold
layin waste to my lovin long ago

chorus

where im set alight oh oh
and i blink in sight oh
of your blinding light oh
oh and its not tonight oh oh
where you hold me tight oh
light the fire bright oh
oh let it blaze alright honey oh oh
oh but youre good to me oh youre good to me oh oh
oh but youre good to me baby oh oh

verse 5
so in awe there i stood as you licked off the grain
though ive handled the wood i still worship the flame
long as amber of ember glows
all the would that id loved is long ago

chorus
and its not tonight oh oh
where im set alight oh oh
and i blink in sight oh
of your blinding light oh
oh and its not tonight oh oh
where you hold me tight oh oh
light the fire bright oh
oh let it blaze alright oh
oh youre good to me oh youre good to me oh oh
oh but youre good to me oh oh
