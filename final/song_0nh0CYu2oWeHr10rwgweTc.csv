places that you could wanna be cooped up
i know the truth yeah like how i move huh
you got your tonguetied got a divine vibe
lets go from hennessy to red and white wine vibes
see you require time you need some quiet time
now you cant fuck no one that fucked you in their side time
they try to hide love girl i provide mine
i know the guidelines that i gotta abide by
oh miami nights im in the benz ocean drive prime
tryna never let you in again but you gon slide by
always give me reason in the seasons where i need you
things you say in public i would rather keep in secret
but you know that i love all of that ignorant shit youre talkin
dick you down in your apartment
you know everythin bout it like its your store and your department
we be goin off too often
i be goin so hard that im exhausted
now we need to lay our feet up
laid up on my chest while i confess that you be movin way too fast to keep up
when you talkin body language you dont have to speak up
if you woulda kept this shit one hundred i wouldnt have had to creep up
oh no no

chorus
do me how you do me
you gon do you and ima do me
shawty we been in that hot pursuit
youve been doin you i think its time that i do me
do me how you do me
you gon do you and ima do me
shawty we been in that hot pursuit
youve been doin you i think its time that i do me

laces that you should never be stooped up
you seem to find yourself whenever you get liquor drunk and juiced up
ive been at a full stop tryna get you moved up
i aint tryna wait no
you know how a player go
i got certain feelings for you i aint tryna say it though
somethin bout the body language that you speakin
stop the games let that freak shit begin
work got you busy on the weekdays
so im in the deep phase up until that weekend begin
know your shit a movie so im sneakin peekin
tell your nigga sue me he be reachin reachin
i dont know your mixture
i got cold intentions when im scrollin through the gram
you see me goin through your pictures
i be goin through these phases you goin through these niggas
never figured you be doggin me like i be doggin bitches
shit is ironic isnt it ayy

chorus
do me how you do me
you gon do you and ima do me
shawty we been in that hot pursuit
youve been doin you i think its time that i do me
do me how you do me
you gon do you and ima do me
shawty we been in that hot pursuit
youve been doin you i think its time that i do me
outro
do me do me hot pursuit
youve been doin you i think its time that i do me3embed"
