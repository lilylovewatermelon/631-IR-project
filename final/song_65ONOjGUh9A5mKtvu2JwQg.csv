you walked away in silence
you walked away to breathe
stopped and turned around to say goodbye to me
im pleading as youre leaving im begging you stay
im not the man i used to be ive changed
im not the man i used to be ive changed

chorus
dont give up on us dont give up on love
dont give up on us dont give up on love
if my life is the price then my life it will cost
now that im picking up the pieces
see the pain that i have caused
its hard to believe in someone you thought was lost
dont give up on us dont give up on love
dont you walk away in silence

verse 2
in tears you counted reasons
tears covered you it seemed
face down screaming god help me please
im pleading as youre leaving im begging you to stay
im not the man i used to be ive changed
im not the man i used to be ive changed
