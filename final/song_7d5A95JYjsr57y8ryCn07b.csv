maker of earth and sky
and everything before our eyes
your word formed life and light
within the crucible of time
the genesis of all mankind

chorus
our lives a tapestry of grace
your hand has weaved together
in you no thread will ever fray
this hope is ours forever
your work of art a mystery
beyond all earthly measure
your love for us a masterpiece
jesus our hope always

verse 2
author of grace divine
love orchestrated in our lives
the cross of calvary
the gift of god the centerpiece
upon that cross you set us free

chorus
our lives a tapestry of grace
your hand has weaved together
in you no thread will ever fray
this hope is ours forever
your work of art a mystery
beyond all earthly measure
your love for us a masterpiece
jesus our hope always

lift our eyes towards the son
glorious you stand alone
raised to life youve overcome
holy is the lord our god

outro
your love is unrivaled
lift our eyes towards the son
your glory spans eternity
glorious you stand alone
your word is final
raised to life youve overcome
the cross of christ our victory
every knee will bow at the name of jesus
holy is the lord our god
for there is no name like the name of jesus1embed"
