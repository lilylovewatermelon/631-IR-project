check your pulse
its proof that youre not listening to
the call your lifes been issuing you
the rhythm of a line of idle days

chorus
scared of a world outside you should go explore
pull all the shades and wander the great indoors
the great indoors

verse 1
lamplight makes the shadows play
and posters take the walls away
the tv is your window pane
the view wont let you down
so put your faith in a late night show
i bet you didnt even know
depends on how far out you go
the channel numbers change

chorus
scared of a world outside you should go explore
pull all the shades and wander the great indoors
the great indoors

though lately i cant blame you
i have seen the world
and sometimes wish your room had room for two
so go unlock the door
and find what you are here for
leave the great indoors
leave the great indoors

outro
check your pulse
its proof that youre not listening to
the call your lifes been issuing you
the rhythm of a line of idle days1embed"
