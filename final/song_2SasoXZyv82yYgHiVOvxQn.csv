verse
how you get so much favor on your side
accept him as your lord and saviour i replied
thou shalt love thy neighbor not divide
ima ride thats on god
his light shine the brightest in the dark
single mothers know they got my heart
and all my brothers locked up on the yard
you can still be anything you wanna be
went from one in four to one in three
thirteenth amendment gotta end it thats on me
he the new commander and the chief
thats on keef thats on god
before the ranch i had horses in the garage
when the forbes cover was just a mirage
they had me chasin statues thats on pride
oh my god bust said thats on tribe
when i thought the book of job was a job
the devil had my soul i cant lie
life gon have some lows and some highs
before the grammys ever gave a nod
i wore my heart on my sleeve i couldnt hide
in 03 they told me not to drive
i bleached my hair for every time i couldve died
but i survived thats on god
ive been tellin yall since 05
the greatest artist restin or alive
thats on la reid thats on clive
thats no jive thats on god
off the 350s he supplied
the irs want they fifty plus our tithe
man thats over half of the pie
i felt dry thats on god
thats why i charge the prices that i charge
i cant be out here dancin with the stars
no i cannot let my family starve
i go hard thats on god
