you promised me a place from here much better
theres aftermath to them ties and tracks youre a rail dog
but would you give it all up for me
you said youd save a dime a day
and build a log cabin down there by the river
where we can raise the kids the best there is
not worry bout an arrowhead and quiver

yeah this place aint saving grace
you cant buy more peace than it pays
theres war paint more blood than there aint
and theres smoke down there on the river

ol jebediah gave it two more years
and hes landed a job with the man selling off land plots
he buried away the gold he made
and he saved enough to build that home for mary
another dime a day kept the wolves away
made a deal with the tribe and he hoped the chief would keep it
it all came down to the plan he made
yeah theres a fiery grave for the beardless ones
who need it

yeah this place aint saving grace
you cant buy more peace than it pays
theres war paint more blood than there aint
and theres smoke down there on the river
on the river

you cant buy more peace than it pays
theres war paint more blood than there aint
and theres smoke down there on the river
