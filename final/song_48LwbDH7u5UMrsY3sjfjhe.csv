yeah i think i got one
her soul is presidential like barack son
yeah she call me goose i call her maverick cause of top gun
they say we annoying they just jealous cause we got love
aw yeah
yeah i got a hot one
she dont want no problem if theres not one
but people come around and try some stupid shit to start one
shell give you the peoples fuckin elbow like the rock son
aw yeah

prechorus
there is a potion in your lips so sweet id die
there is an ocean in your hips so deep id dive
i hear an opus when we kiss that completes my life
yeah i think i got one
and every single little thing about her is so—

chorus
overwhelming
everything about you is so overwhelming
when i think about you it gets overwhelming
cause everything about you is so overwhelming
come over here and overwhelm me

“hey do i impress you”
i really like the way you rock a sweatsuit
when you working out
and im just watching how your legs move
they would think that you was like developed in a test tube
aw yeah
you deserve a theme song
you could be the shoulder that i lean on
love it when youre late for work and try to slip your jeans on
you be bumping chili peppers all up in your nissan
aw yeah

prechorus
there is a potion in your lips so sweet id die
there is an ocean in your hips so deep id dive
i hear an opus when we kiss that completes my life
yeah i think i got one
and every single little thing about her is so—

chorus
overwhelming
everything about you is so overwhelming
when i think about you it gets overwhelming
cause everything about you is so overwhelming
come over here and overwhelm me
bridge
you write checks that my ass cant cash
i bit a little more than i can chew
i bit a little more than i can chew
you write checks that my ass cant cash
i bit a little more than i can chew
i bit a little more than i can chew
cause everything about you is so—

chorus
overwhelming
everything about you is so overwhelming
when i think about you it gets overwhelming
cause everything about you is so overwhelming
come over here and overwhelm me21embed"
