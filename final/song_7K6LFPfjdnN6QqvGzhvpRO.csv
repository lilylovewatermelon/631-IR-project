i had a thought dear however scary
about that night the bugs and the dirt
why were you digging what did you bury
before those hands pulled me from the earth

chorus
i will not ask you where you came from
i will not ask and neither should you
honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
we should just kiss like real people do

verse 2
i knew that look dear eyes always seeking
was there in someone that dug long ago
so i will not ask you why you were creeping
in some sad way i already know

chorus
so i will not ask you where you came from
i would not ask and neither would you
honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
we should just kiss like real people do
i could not ask you where you came from
i could not ask and neither could you
honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
we could just kiss like real people dosee hozier liveget tickets as low as 35you might also like40embed"
