go for it
one two

verse 1
baby really hurt me crying in the taxi
he dont wanna know me
says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
says it was poison
so i guess ill go home
into the arms of the girl that i love
the only love i havent screwed up
shes so hard to please but shes a forest fire
i do my best to meet her demands play at romance
we slow dance in the living room
but all that a stranger would see
is one girl swaying alone stroking a cheek

chorus
they say youre a little much for me
youre a liability
youre a little much for me
so they pull back make other plans
i understand im a liability
get you wild make you leave
im a little much for eananana everyone

the truth is i am a toy that people enjoy
till all of the tricks dont work anymore
and then they are bored of me
i know that its exciting running through the night
but every perfect summers eating me alive until youre gone
better on my own

chorus
they say youre a little much for me
youre a liability
youre a little much for me
so they pull back make other plans
i understand im a liability
get you wild make you leave
im a little much for eananana everyone

outro
theyre gonna watch me disappear into the sun
youre all gonna watch me disappear into the sun150embed"
