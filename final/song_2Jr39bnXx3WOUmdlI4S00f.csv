people have the right to fly
and will when it gets compromised
their hearts say move along
their minds say gotcha heart
lets move it along
move it along

verse 2
and airports see it all the time
where someones last goodbye
blends in with someones sigh
cause someones coming home
in hand a single rose

and thats the way this wheel keeps working now
thats the way this wheel keeps working now
and i wont be the last
no i wont be the last
to love her

and you cant build a house of leaves
and live like its an evergreen
