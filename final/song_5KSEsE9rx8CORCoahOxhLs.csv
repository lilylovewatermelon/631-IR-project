the open wound she hides
she just keeps it bundled up
and never lets it show
she cant take much more of this
but she cant let it go
and thats ok she dont want the world

prechorus 1
all the things she says
while hes just lying there
without someone to hear her cry
she slips off into a dream
about a place to hide
and thats ok she dont want the world

hook
this love she feels
everything shes ever known
or ever thought was real
seems like its been thrown away
now hows she gonna live
its ok she dont want the world

verse 2
those words he never spoke
haunt her life the memories
of all the times before
she tried to show him love
while he would only ask for more
but its ok she dont want the world
you might also likeprechorus 2
softly in her sleep
pictures of the life shes longing
for slowly appear
shes seen them all before
but somehow never quite this clear
she just smiles she dont want the world

hook
this love she feels
everything shes ever known
or ever thought was real
seems like its been thrown away
now hows she gonna live
its ok she dont want the world

outro
a brand new morning shines
as she wakes up alone again
this time to face the day
she swears theres time to make it
as she simply walks away
and its ok she dont want the world1embed"
