you walked into the room
and now my hearts been stolen
you took me back in time to when i was unbroken
now youre all i want
and i knew it from the very first moment
cause a light came on when i heard that song
and i want you to sing it again

chorus
i swear that every word you sing
you wrote them for me
like it was a private show
but i know you never saw me
when the lights come on and im on my own
will you be there to sing it again
could i be the one you talk about in all your stories
can i be him

verse 2
i heard there was someone but i know he dont deserve you
if you were mine id never let anyone hurt you
i wanna dry those tears kiss those lips
its all that ive been thinking about
cause a light came on when i heard that song
and i want you to sing it again
