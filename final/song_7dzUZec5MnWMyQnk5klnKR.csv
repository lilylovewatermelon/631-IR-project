i wanna talk to you
the last time we talked mr smith you reduced me to tears
i promise you it wont happen again

verse 1
do i attract you do i repulse you
with my queasy smile
am i too dirty am i too flirty
do i like what you like
i could be wholesome i could be loathsome
guess im a little bit shy
why dont you like me why dont you like me
without makin me try

prechorus
i tried to be like grace kelly mm
but all her looks were too sad ah
so i tried a little freddie mm
ive gone identity mad

chorus
i could be brown i could be blue
i could be violet sky
i could be hurtful i could be purple
i could be anything you like
gotta be green gotta be mean
gotta be everything more
why dont you like me why dont you like me
why dont you walk out the door
see mika liveget tickets as low as 37you might also likeinterlude
getting angry doesnt solve anything

verse 2
how can i help it how can i help it
how can i help what you think
hello my baby hello my baby
putting my life on the brink
why dont you like me why dont you like me
why dont you like yourself
should i bend over should i look older
just to be put on your shelf

prechorus
i tried to be like grace kelly mm
but all her looks were too sad ah
so i tried a little freddie mm
ive gone identity mad

chorus
i could be brown i could be blue
i could be violet sky
i could be hurtful i could be purple
i could be anything you like
gotta be green gotta be mean
gotta be everything more
why dont you like me why dont you like me
walk out the door
bridge
say what you want to satisfy yourself hey
but you only want what everybody else says you should want
you want

chorus
i could be brown i could be blue
i could be violet sky
i could be hurtful i could be purple
i could be anything you like
gotta be green gotta be mean
gotta be everything more
why dont you like me why dont you like me
walk out the door
i could be brown i could be blue
i could be violet sky
i could be hurtful i could be purple
i could be anything you like
gotta be green gotta be mean
gotta be everything more
why dont you like me why dont you like me
walk out the door
