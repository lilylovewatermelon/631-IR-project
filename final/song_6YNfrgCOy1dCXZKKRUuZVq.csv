someone found the future as a statue in a fountain
at attention looking backward in a pool of water
wishes with a blue songbird on his shoulder
who keeps singing over everything

chorus
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me

verse 2
i picked up the song and found my picture in the paper
the reflection in the water showed an iron man still trying to salute
people from a time when he was everything hes supposed to be

chorus
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
everything means nothing to me
