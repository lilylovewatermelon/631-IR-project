broken glass from a picture frame scattered on the floor
youre screamin at me you cant take it anymore
i try and hold you you just push me away
this aint nothin new cause we just did this yesterday

chorus
times are gettin hard
hits you like a bullet through your heart
been tearin me apart
and its killin you i know
said wont you stay with me
i cant keep goin if you leave
aint how its supposed to be
so please dont go

verse 2
when the fires in your eyes i miss their ocean blue
i miss the blondehairеd girl that i thought i once knew
its hard to reason with thе voices in your head
and its been three damn days since youve gotten outta bed

chorus
times are gettin hard
hits you like a bullet through your heart
been tearin me apart
and its killin you i know
said wont you stay with me
i cant keep goin if you leave
aint how its supposed to be
so please dont go
you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus
times are gettin hard
hits you like a bullet through your heart
been tearin me apart
and its killin you i know
said wont you stay with me
i cant keep goin if you leave
aint how its supposed to be
so please dont go
said wont you stay with me
i cant keep goin if you leave
aint how its supposed to be
so please dont go

outro
said please dont go
said please dont go
please dont goembed"
