yeah yeah um woo
yeah yeah yeah

verse 1
thats the way every day goes
every time weve no control
if the sky is pink and white
if the ground is black and yellow
its the same way you showed me
nod my head dont close my eyes
halfway on a slow move
its the same way you showed me
if you could fly then youd feel south
up norths getting cold soon
the way it is were on land
still im someone to hold true
keep you cool when its still alive
wont let you down when its all ruin

chorus
just the same way you showed me showed me
you showed me love
glory from above
regard my dear
its all downhill from here

in the wake of a hurricane
dark skin of a summer shade
nosedive into flood lines
tall tower of milk crates
its the same way you showed me
cannonball off the porch side
older kids trying off the rooves
just the same way you showed me you showed
if you could die and come back to life
up for air from the swimming pool
youd kneel down to the dry land
kiss the earth that birthed you
gave you tools just to stay alive
and make it out when the sun is ruined

chorus
thats the same way you showed me showed me
you showed me love
glory from above
regard my dear
its all downhill from here

outro frank ocean  beyoncé
remember life remember how it was
climb trees michael jackson all ends here
say what up to matthew to shoob
say what up to danny
say what up to life immortality
bending up my nikes
running out of melpomene nicotine
stealing granny cigs take it easy
gimme something sweet
bitch i might like immortality
this is life life immortality154embed"
