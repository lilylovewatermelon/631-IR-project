nothings going on but i dont care
leave me here dont take me anywhere
why should i get up when ive got nothing due
just another lazy day afternoon
beautiful day outside but i dont care
everything i need i got right here
why should i go out why should i even move
just another lazy day afternoon

chorus
afternoon
when everybodys working
id rather be a jerk and lay around
afternoon
this day is just too perfect
just another lazy day afternoon
