woke up on the wrong side of rock bottom
youre all out of pennies and the well it done run dry
youd light em up and smoke em if you had em but you just aint got em
yeah aint we always lookin for a bluer sky

chorus 1
but if youre ever gonna find a silver lining
its gotta be a cloudy day
its gotta be a cloudy day
if you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning
youre gonna have to stand in the rain
youre gonna have to stand in the rain

verse 2
lemonade keeps turnin into lemons
and you wear your heart on a ripped unraveled sleeve
been run through the wringer and pushed plum to your limit
you say youre just unlucky but luck aint what you need

cause if youre ever gonna find a fourleaf clover
you gotta get a little dirt on your hands
you gotta get a little dirt on your hands
and if you wanna find a head that fits your shoulder
youre gonna have to go to the dance
youre gonna have to go to the dance

bridge
if you wanna find the honey
you cant be scared of the bees
and if you wanna see the forest
youre gonna have to look past the trees

chorus 1
if youre ever gonna find a silver lining
its gotta be a cloudy day
yeah its gotta be a cloudy day
ooh and if you wanna fill your bottle up with lightning
youre gonna have to stand in the rain
youre gonna have to stand in the rain
