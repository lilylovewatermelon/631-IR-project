there aint a pair of boots in my closet
that aint scuffed up and walked right through the soles
and there aint a pair of jeans
that aint hangin on by the seams and full of holes
i aint never been inside a threepiece suit
and my collars just a wornout shade of blue

chorus
i try to beat the morning sun out of the bed
and i work like hell til the sun goes down and then
i rest my head next to the most beautiful thing youve ever seen
lord only knows what she means to me
solid as the rock on her left hand
shes proud to be my woman
thats why im proud to be her man

verse 2
shes flowers in her hair on sunday morning
shes a bud light in her hand on friday night
shes cornbread in the oven
shes wild and crazy lovin me just right
oh you know thats right
she aint afraid to put me in my place
and she aint afraid to love me every night so every day

i try to beat the morning sun out of the bed
and i work like hell til the sun goes down and then
i rest my head next to the most beautiful thing youve ever seen
lord only knows what she means to me
solid as the rock on her left hand
shes proud to be my woman
thats why im proud to be her man

bridge
she can rock a dress in cowboy boots
make a rolling stone wanna plant some roots
shes the one thing that i cant afford to lose

chorus
so i try to beat the morning sun out of the bed
and i work like hell til the sun goes down and then
i rest my head next to the most beautiful thing youve ever seen
lord only knows what she means to me
the reason i keep this ring on my left hand
shes proud to be my woman
thats why im proud to be her man
shes proud to be my woman
and thats why im proud to be her manembed"
