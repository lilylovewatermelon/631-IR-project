verse 3 jaden  justin bieber
here we go
guess who
j smith and jb
uhhuh
i gotcha lil bro
i can handle them
hold up aight i can handle them
now hes bigger than me taller than me
and hes older than me and stronger than me
and his arms a little bit longer than me
but he aint on a jb song with me
i be trying a chill they be trying to sour the thrill
no pun intended was raised by the power of will
like luke with the force if push comes to shove
like kobe in the 4th ice water for blood lets go
i gotta be the best and yes were the flyest
like david and goliath i conquered the giant
so now i got the world in my hand
i was born from two stars so the moons where i land im gone
