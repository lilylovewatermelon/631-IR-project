waves of change waves of change
the future the future the future
the things we think to be inconsequential can affect the future unintentionally

once you had the power to effect monumental change would you let fear consume
or would you overcome

we sent a message into the past
a warning of mans imminent demise
we have that message
the following record was inspired by that message
though this story is not inevitable inevitable and a society does evolve

we can change our fate
we can change the future
we can change the pastyou might also like2embed"
