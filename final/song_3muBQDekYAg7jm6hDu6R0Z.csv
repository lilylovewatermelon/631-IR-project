chorus
these niggas prayed on my downfall they what
these niggas prayed on my downfall who

verse 1
go get a thermometer for the pot i need this shit cooked right
lets keep that water four hundred degrees fahrenheit
you ever been inside a federal court room
nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life
bein broke did somethin to my spirit
asked niggas to plug me they act like they couldnt hear me
look at me now drivin german engineering
you dont want your baby mama fucked keep the ho from near me
kilroy member when i used to use your ls
to hit the road hit the o and make them big boy sales
mu member when you had them green things mailed
with vacuum seals tryin not to have them green things smell
feds was on me what you know about related through money
i dont know nothin i just used to see em walk to the coney
i fuck with bitches my body count go from pershing to cody
any further questions you can take that up with the lawyer
my nigga fenkell j money brightmo lo project joe
will tell you every day before school i sold a half bow
how you think i won best dressed with no support
and had them paid lawyers comin in and out of court
ayy dwan though ayy theo aint it a blessing

after the pretrials after the status
after them impact statements after the castle
