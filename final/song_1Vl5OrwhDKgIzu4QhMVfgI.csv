        ursula went on in an unreal suspense the last weeks before going away she was not herself—she was not anything she was something that is going to be—soon—soon—very soon but as yet she was only imminent

        she went to see her parents it was a rather stiff sad meeting more like a verification of separateness than a reunion but they were all vague and indefinite with one another stiffened in the fate that moved them apart

        she did not really come to until she was on the ship crossing from dover to ostend dimly she had come down to london with birkin london had been a vagueness so had the trainjourney to dover it was all like a sleep

        and now at last as she stood in the stern of the ship in a pitchdark rather blowy night feeling the motion of the sea and watching the small rather desolate little lights that twinkled on the shores of england as on the shores of nowhere watched them sinking smaller and smaller on the profound and living darkness she felt her soul stirring to awake from its anaesthetic sleep

        let us go forward shall we said birkin he wanted to be at the tip of their projection so they left off looking at the faint sparks that glimmered out of nowhere in the far distance called england and turned their faces to the unfathomed night in front

        they went right to the bows of the softly plunging vessel in the complete obscurity birkin found a comparatively sheltered nook where a great rope was coiled up it was quite near the very point of the ship near the black unpierced space ahead there they sat down folded together folded round with the same rug creeping in nearer and ever nearer to one another till it seemed they had crept right into each other and become one substance it was very cold and the darkness was palpable

        one of the ships crew came along the deck dark as the darkness not really visible they then made out the faintest pallor of his face he felt their presence and stopped unsure—then bent forward when his face was near them he saw the faint pallor of their faces then he withdrew like a phantom and they watched him without making any sound

        they seemed to fall away into the profound darkness there was no sky no earth only one unbroken darkness into which with a soft sleeping motion they seemed to fall like one closed seed of life falling through dark fathomless space

        they had forgotten where they were forgotten all that was and all that had been conscious only in their heart and there conscious only of this pure trajectory through the surpassing darkness the ships prow cleaved on with a faint noise of cleavage into the complete night without knowing without seeing only surging on

        in ursula the sense of the unrealised world ahead triumphed over everything in the midst of this profound darkness there seemed to glow on her heart the effulgence of a paradise unknown and unrealised her heart was full of the most wonderful light golden like honey of darkness sweet like the warmth of day a light which was not shed on the world only on the unknown paradise towards which she was going a sweetness of habitation a delight of living quite unknown but hers infallibly in her transport she lifted her face suddenly to him and he touched it with his lips so cold so fresh so seaclear her face was it was like kissing a flower that grows near the surf

        but he did not know the ecstasy of bliss in foreknowledge that she knew to him the wonder of this transit was overwhelming he was falling through a gulf of infinite darkness like a meteorite plunging across the chasm between the worlds the world was torn in two and he was plunging like an unlit star through the ineffable rift what was beyond was not yet for him he was overcome by the trajectory

        in a trance he lay enfolding ursula round about his face was against her fine fragile hair he breathed its fragrance with the sea and the profound night and his soul was at peace yielded as he fell into the unknown this was the first time that an utter and absolute peace had entered his heart now in this final transit out of life
        when there came some stir on the deck they roused they stood up how stiff and cramped they were in the nighttime and yet the paradisal glow on her heart and the unutterable peace of darkness in his this was the allinall

        they stood up and looked ahead low lights were seen down the darkness this was the world again it was not the bliss of her heart nor the peace of his it was the superficial unreal world of fact yet not quite the old world for the peace and the bliss in their hearts was enduring

        strange and desolate above all things like disembarking from the styx into the desolated underworld was this landing at night there was the raw halflighted coveredin vastness of the dark place boarded and hollow underfoot with only desolation everywhere ursula had caught sight of the big pallid mystic letters ostend standing in the darkness everybody was hurrying with a blind insectlike intentness through the dark grey air porters were calling in unenglish english then trotting with heavy bags their colourless blouses looking ghostly as they disappeared ursula stood at a long low zinccovered barrier along with hundreds of other spectral people and all the way down the vast raw darkness was this low stretch of open bags and spectral people whilst on the other side of the barrier pallid officials in peaked caps and moustaches were turning the underclothing in the bags then scrawling a chalkmark

        it was done birkin snapped the hand bags off they went the porter coming behind they were through a great doorway and in the open night again—ah a railway platform voices were still calling in inhuman agitation through the darkgrey air spectres were running along the darkness between the train

        koln—berlin— ursula made out on the boards hung on the high train on one side

        here we are said birkin and on her side she saw elsass—lothringen—luxembourg metz—basle

        that was it basle

        the porter came up

        a bale—deuxieme classe—voila and he clambered into the high train they followed the compartments were already some of them taken but many were dim and empty the luggage was stowed the porter was tipped

        nous avons encore— said birkin looking at his watch and at the porter

        encore une demiheure with which in his blue blouse he disappeared he was ugly and insolent

        come said birkin it is cold let us eat

        there was a coffeewagon on the platform they drank hot watery coffee and ate the long rolls split with ham between which were such a wide bite that it almost dislocated ursulas jaw and they walked beside the high trains it was all so strange so extremely desolate like the underworld grey grey dirt grey desolate forlorn nowhere—grey dreary nowhere
        at last they were moving through the night in the darkness ursula made out the flat fields the wet flat dreary darkness of the continent they pulled up surprisingly soon—bruges then on through the level darkness with glimpses of sleeping farms and thin poplar trees and deserted highroads she sat dismayed hand in hand with birkin he pale immobile like a revenant himself looked sometimes out of the window sometimes closed his eyes then his eyes opened again dark as the darkness outside

        a flash of a few lights on the darkness—ghent station a few more spectres moving outside on the platform—then the bell—then motion again through the level darkness ursula saw a man with a lantern come out of a farm by the railway and cross to the dark farmbuildings she thought of the marsh the old intimate farmlife at cossethay my god how far was she projected from her childhood how far was she still to go in one lifetime one travelled through aeons the great chasm of memory from her childhood in the intimate country surroundings of cossethay and the marsh farm—she remembered the servant tilly who used to give her bread and butter sprinkled with brown sugar in the old livingroom where the grandfather clock had two pink roses in a basket painted above the figures on the face—and now when she was travelling into the unknown with birkin an utter stranger—was so great that it seemed she had no identity that the child she had been playing in cossethay churchyard was a little creature of history not really herself

        they were at brussels—half an hour for breakfast they got down on the great station clock it said six oclock they had coffee and rolls and honey in the vast desert refreshment room so dreary always so dreary dirty so spacious such desolation of space but she washed her face and hands in hot water and combed her hair—that was a blessing

        soon they were in the train again and moving on the greyness of dawn began there were several people in the compartment large florid belgian businessmen with long brown beards talking incessantly in an ugly french she was too tired to follow

        it seemed the train ran by degrees out of the darkness into a faint light then beat after beat into the day ah how weary it was faintly the trees showed like shadows then a house white had a curious distinctness how was it then she saw a village—there were always houses passing

        this was an old world she was still journeying through winterheavy and dreary there was ploughland and pasture and copses of bare trees copses of bushes and homesteads naked and workbare no new earth had come to pass

        she looked at birkins face it was white and still and eternal too eternal she linked her fingers imploringly in his under the cover of her rug his fingers responded his eyes looked back at her how dark like a night his eyes were like another world beyond oh if he were the world as well if only the world were he if only he could call a world into being that should be their own world

        the belgians left the train ran on through luxembourg through alsacelorraine through metz but she was blind she could see no more her soul did not look out

        they came at last to basle to the hotel it was all a drifting trance from which she never came to they went out in the morning before the train departed she saw the street the river she stood on the bridge but it all meant nothing she remembered some shops—one full of pictures one with orange velvet and ermine but what did these signify—nothing

        she was not at ease till they were in the train again then she was relieved so long as they were moving onwards she was satisfied they came to zurich then before very long ran under the mountains that were deep in snow at last she was drawing near this was the other world now

        innsbruck was wonderful deep in snow and evening they drove in an open sledge over the snow the train had been so hot and stifling and the hotel with the golden light glowing under the porch seemed like a home

        they laughed with pleasure when they were in the hall the place seemed full and busy

        do you know if mr and mrs crich—english—from paris have arrived birkin asked in german
        the porter reflected a moment and was just going to answer when ursula caught sight of gudrun sauntering down the stairs wearing her dark glossy coat with grey fur

        gudrun gudrun she called waving up the well of the staircase shuhu

        gudrun looked over the rail and immediately lost her sauntering diffident air her eyes flashed

        really—ursula she cried and she began to move downstairs as ursula ran up they met at a turn and kissed with laughter and exclamations inarticulate and stirring

        but cried gudrun mortified we thought it was tomorrow you were coming i wanted to come to the station

        no weve come today cried ursula isnt it lovely here

        adorable said gudrun geralds just gone out to get something ursula arent you fearfully tired

        no not so very but i look a filthy sight dont i

        no you dont you look almost perfectly fresh i like that fur cap immensely she glanced over ursula who wore a big soft coat with a collar of deep soft blond fur and a soft blond cap of fur

        and you cried ursula what do you think you look like

        gudrun assumed an unconcerned expressionless face

        do you like it she said

        its very fine cried ursula perhaps with a touch of satire

        go up—or come down said birkin for there the sisters stood gudrun with her hand on ursulas arm on the turn of the stairs half way to the first landing blocking the way and affording full entertainment to the whole of the hall below from the door porter to the plump jew in black clothes

        the two young women slowly mounted followed by birkin and the waiter

        first floor asked gudrun looking back over her shoulder

        second madam—the lift the waiter replied and he darted to the elevator to forestall the two women but they ignored him as chattering without heed they set to mount the second flight rather chagrined the waiter followed

        it was curious the delight of the sisters in each other at this meeting it was as if they met in exile and united their solitary forces against all the world birkin looked on with some mistrust and wonder

        when they had bathed and changed gerald came in he looked shining like the sun on frost

        go with gerald and smoke said ursula to birkin gudrun and i want to talk

        then the sisters sat in gudruns bedroom and talked clothes and experiences gudrun told ursula the experience of the birkin letter in the cafe ursula was shocked and frightened

        where is the letter she asked

        i kept it said gudrun

        youll give it me wont you she said

        but gudrun was silent for some moments before she replied

        do you really want it ursula

        i want to read it said ursula

        certainly said gudrun

        even now she could not admit to ursula that she wanted to keep it as a memento or a symbol but ursula knew and was not pleased so the subject was switched off

        what did you do in paris asked ursula

        oh said gudrun laconically—the usual things we had a fine party one night in fanny baths studio

        did you and you and gerald were there who else tell me about it

        well said gudrun theres nothing particular to tell you know fanny is frightfully in love with that painter billy macfarlane he was there—so fanny spared nothing she spent very freely it was really remarkable of course everybody got fearfully drunk—but in an interesting way not like that filthy london crowd the fact is these were all people that matter which makes all the difference there was a roumanian a fine chap he got completely drunk and climbed to the top of a high studio ladder and gave the most marvellous address—really ursula it was wonderful he began in french—la vie cest une affaire dames imperiales—in a most beautiful voice—he was a finelooking chap—but he had got into roumanian before he had finished and not a soul understood but donald gilchrist was worked to a frenzy he dashed his glass to the ground and declared by god he was glad he had been born by god it was a miracle to be alive and do you know ursula so it was— gudrun laughed rather hollowly

        but how was gerald among them all asked ursula

        gerald oh my word he came out like a dandelion in the sun hes a whole saturnalia in himself once he is roused i shouldnt like to say whose waist his arm did not go round really ursula he seems to reap the women like a harvest there wasnt one that would have resisted him it was too amazing can you understand it

        ursula reflected and a dancing light came into her eyes

        yes she said i can he is such a wholehogger

        wholehogger i should think so exclaimed gudrun but it is true ursula every woman in the room was ready to surrender to him chanticleer isnt in it—even fanny bath who is genuinely in love with billy macfarlane i never was more amazed in my life and you know afterwards—i felt i was a whole roomful of women i was no more myself to him than i was queen victoria i was a whole roomful of women at once it was most astounding but my eye id caught a sultan that time—

        gudruns eyes were flashing her cheek was hot she looked strange exotic satiric ursula was fascinated at once—and yet uneasy

        they had to get ready for dinner gudrun came down in a daring gown of vivid green silk and tissue of gold with green velvet bodice and a strange blackandwhite band round her hair she was really brilliantly beautiful and everybody noticed her gerald was in that fullblooded gleaming state when he was most handsome birkin watched them with quick laughing halfsinister eyes ursula quite lost her head there seemed a spell almost a blinding spell cast round their table as if they were lighted up more strongly than the rest of the diningroom

        dont you love to be in this place cried gudrun isnt the snow wonderful do you notice how it exalts everything it is simply marvellous one really does feel libermenschlich—more than human

        one does cried ursula but isnt that partly the being out of england

        oh of course cried gudrun one could never feel like this in england for the simple reason that the damper is never lifted off one there it is quite impossible really to let go in england of that i am assured

        and she turned again to the food she was eating she was fluttering with vivid intensity

        its quite true said gerald it never is quite the same in england but perhaps we dont want it to be—perhaps its like bringing the light a little too near the powdermagazine to let go altogether in england one is afraid what might happen if everybody else let go

        my god cried gudrun but wouldnt it be wonderful if all england did suddenly go off like a display of fireworks

        it couldnt said ursula they are all too damp the powder is damp in them

        im not so sure of that said gerald

        nor i said birkin when the english really begin to go off en masse itll be time to shut your ears and run

        they never will said ursula

        well see he replied

        isnt it marvellous said gudrun how thankful one can be to be out of ones country i cannot believe myself i am so transported the moment i set foot on a foreign shore i say to myself here steps a new creature into life

        dont be too hard on poor old england said gerald though we curse it we love it really

        to ursula there seemed a fund of cynicism in these words

        we may said birkin but its a damnably uncomfortable love like a love for an aged parent who suffers horribly from a complication of diseases for which there is no hope

        gudrun looked at him with dilated dark eyes

        you think there is no hope she asked in her pertinent fashion

        but birkin backed away he would not answer such a question

        any hope of englands becoming real god knows its a great actual unreality now an aggregation into unreality it might be real if there were no englishmen

        you think the english will have to disappear persisted gudrun it was strange her pointed interest in his answer it might have been her own fate she was inquiring after her dark dilated eyes rested on birkin as if she could conjure the truth of the future out of him as out of some instrument of divination

        he was pale then reluctantly he answered

        well—what else is in front of them but disappearance theyve got to disappear from their own special brand of englishness anyhow

        gudrun watched him as if in a hypnotic state her eyes wide and fixed on him

        but in what way do you mean disappear— she persisted

        yes do you mean a change of heart put in gerald

        i dont mean anything why should i said birkin im an englishman and ive paid the price of it i cant talk about england—i can only speak for myself

        yes said gudrun slowly you love england immensely immensely rupert

        and leave her he replied

        no not for good youll come back said gerald nodding sagely

        they say the lice crawl off a dying body said birkin with a glare of bitterness so i leave england

        ah but youll come back said gudrun with a sardonic smile

        tant pis pour moi he replied

        isnt he angry with his mother country laughed gerald amused

        ah a patriot said gudrun with something like a sneer

        birkin refused to answer any more

        gudrun watched him still for a few seconds then she turned away it was finished her spell of divination in him she felt already purely cynical she looked at gerald he was wonderful like a piece of radium to her she felt she could consume herself and know all by means of this fatal living metal she smiled to herself at her fancy and what would she do with herself when she had destroyed herself for if spirit if integral being is destructible matter is indestructible

        he was looking bright and abstracted puzzled for the moment she stretched out her beautiful arm with its fluff of green tulle and touched his chin with her subtle artists fingers

        what are they then she asked with a strange knowing smile

        what he replied his eyes suddenly dilating with wonder

        your thoughts

        gerald looked like a man coming awake

        i think i had none he said

        really she said with grave laughter in her voice

        and to birkin it was as if she killed gerald with that touch

        ah but cried gudrun let us drink to britannia—let us drink to britannia

        it seemed there was wild despair in her voice gerald laughed and filled the glasses

        i think rupert means he said that nationally all englishmen must die so that they can exist individually and—

        supernationally— put in gudrun with a slight ironic grimace raising her glass

        the next day they descended at the tiny railway station of hohenhausen at the end of the tiny valley railway it was snow everywhere a white perfect cradle of snow new and frozen sweeping up an either side black crags and white sweeps of silver towards the blue pale heavens

        as they stepped out on the naked platform with only snow around and above gudrun shrank as if it chilled her heart

        my god jerry she said turning to gerald with sudden intimacy youve done it now

        what

        she made a faint gesture indicating the world on either hand

        look at it

        she seemed afraid to go on he laughed

        they were in the heart of the mountains from high above on either side swept down the white fold of snow so that one seemed small and tiny in a valley of pure concrete heaven all strangely radiant and changeless and silent

        it makes one feel so small and alone said ursula turning to birkin and laying her hand on his arm

        youre not sorry youve come are you said gerald to gudrun

        she looked doubtful they went out of the station between banks of snow

        ah said gerald sniffing the air in elation this is perfect theres our sledge well walk a bit—well run up the road

        gudrun always doubtful dropped her heavy coat on the sledge as he did his and they set off suddenly she threw up her head and set off scudding along the road of snow pulling her cap down over her ears her blue bright dress fluttered in the wind her thick scarlet stockings were brilliant above the whiteness gerald watched her she seemed to be rushing towards her fate and leaving him behind he let her get some distance then loosening his limbs he went after her

        everywhere was deep and silent snow great snoweaves weighed down the broadroofed tyrolese houses that were sunk to the windowsashes in snow peasantwomen fullskirted wearing each a crossover shawl and thick snowboots turned in the way to look at the soft determined girl running with such heavy fleetness from the man who was overtaking her but not gaining any power over her

        they passed the inn with its painted shutters and balcony a few cottages half buried in the snow then the snowburied silent sawmill by the roofed bridge which crossed the hidden stream over which they ran into the very depth of the untouched sheets of snow it was a silence and a sheer whiteness exhilarating to madness but the perfect silence was most terrifying isolating the soul surrounding the heart with frozen air

        its a marvellous place for all that said gudrun looking into his eyes with a strange meaning look his soul leapt

        good he said

        a fierce electric energy seemed to flow over all his limbs his muscles were surcharged his hands felt hard with strength they walked along rapidly up the snowroad that was marked by withered branches of trees stuck in at intervals he and she were separate like opposite poles of one fierce energy but they felt powerful enough to leap over the confines of life into the forbidden places and back again

        birkin and ursula were running along also over the snow he had disposed of the luggage and they had a little start of the sledges ursula was excited and happy but she kept turning suddenly to catch hold of birkins arm to make sure of him

        this is something i never expected she said it is a different world here

        they went on into a snow meadow there they were overtaken by the sledge that came tinkling through the silence it was another mile before they came upon gudrun and gerald on the steep upclimb beside the pink halfburied shrine

        then they passed into a gulley where were walls of black rock and a river filled with snow and a still blue sky above through a covered bridge they went drumming roughly over the boards crossing the snowbed once more then slowly up and up the horses walking swiftly the driver cracking his long whip as he walked beside and calling his strange wild huehue the walls of rock passing slowly by till they emerged again between slopes and masses of snow up and up gradually they went through the cold shadowradiance of the afternoon silenced by the imminence of the mountains the luminous dazing sides of snow that rose above them and fell away beneath

        they came forth at last in a little high tableland of snow where stood the last peaks of snow like the heart petals of an open rose in the midst of the last deserted valleys of heaven stood a lonely building with brown wooden walls and white heavy roof deep and deserted in the waste of snow like a dream it stood like a rock that had rolled down from the last steep slopes a rock that had taken the form of a house and was now halfburied it was unbelievable that one could live there uncrushed by all this terrible waste of whiteness and silence and clear upper ringing cold

        yet the sledges ran up in fine style people came to the door laughing and excited the floor of the hostel rang hollow the passage was wet with snow it was a real warm interior

        the newcomers tramped up the bare wooden stairs following the serving woman gudrun and gerald took the first bedroom in a moment they found themselves alone in a bare smallish closeshut room that was all of goldencoloured wood floor walls ceiling door all of the same warm gold panelling of oiled pine there was a window opposite the door but low down because the roof sloped under the slope of the ceiling were the table with washhand bowl and jug and across another table with mirror on either side the door were two beds piled high with an enormous bluechecked overbolster enormous

        this was all—no cupboard none of the amenities of life here they were shut up together in this cell of goldencoloured wood with two blue checked beds they looked at each other and laughed frightened by this naked nearness of isolation

        a man knocked and came in with the luggage he was a sturdy fellow with flattish cheekbones rather pale and with coarse fair moustache gudrun watched him put down the bags in silence then tramp heavily out

        it isnt too rough is it gerald asked

        the bedroom was not very warm and she shivered slightly

        it is wonderful she equivocated look at the colour of this panelling—its wonderful like being inside a nut

        he was standing watching her feeling his shortcut moustache leaning back slightly and watching her with his keen undaunted eyes dominated by the constant passion that was like a doom upon him

        she went and crouched down in front of the window curious

        oh but this— she cried involuntarily almost in pain

        in front was a valley shut in under the sky the last huge slopes of snow and black rock and at the end like the navel of the earth a whitefolded wall and two peaks glimmering in the late light straight in front ran the cradle of silent snow between the great slopes that were fringed with a little roughness of pinetrees like hair round the base but the cradle of snow ran on to the eternal closingin where the walls of snow and rock rose impenetrable and the mountain peaks above were in heaven immediate this was the centre the knot the navel of the world where the earth belonged to the skies pure unapproachable impassable

        it filled gudrun with a strange rapture she crouched in front of the window clenching her face in her hands in a sort of trance at last she had arrived she had reached her place here at last she folded her venture and settled down like a crystal in the navel of snow and was gone

        gerald bent above her and was looking out over her shoulder already he felt he was alone she was gone she was completely gone and there was icy vapour round his heart he saw the blind valley the great culdesac of snow and mountain peaks under the heaven and there was no way out the terrible silence and cold and the glamorous whiteness of the dusk wrapped him round and she remained crouching before the window as at a shrine a shadow

        do you like it he asked in a voice that sounded detached and foreign at least she might acknowledge he was with her but she only averted her soft mute face a little from his gaze and he knew that there were tears in her eyes her own tears tears of her strange religion that put him to nought

        quite suddenly he put his hand under her chin and lifted up her face to him her dark blue eyes in their wetness of tears dilated as if she was startled in her very soul they looked at him through their tears in terror and a little horror his light blue eyes were keen smallpupilled and unnatural in their vision her lips parted as she breathed with difficulty

        the passion came up in him stroke after stroke like the ringing of a bronze bell so strong and unflawed and indomitable his knees tightened to bronze as he hung above her soft face whose lips parted and whose eyes dilated in a strange violation in the grasp of his hand her chin was unutterably soft and silken he felt strong as winter his hands were living metal invincible and not to be turned aside his heart rang like a bell clanging inside him

        he took her up in his arms she was soft and inert motionless all the while her eyes in which the tears had not yet dried were dilated as if in a kind of swoon of fascination and helplessness he was superhumanly strong and unflawed as if invested with supernatural force

        he lifted her close and folded her against him her softness her inert relaxed weight lay against his own surcharged bronzelike limbs in a heaviness of desirability that would destroy him if he were not fulfilled she moved convulsively recoiling away from him his heart went up like a flame of ice he closed over her like steel he would destroy her rather than be denied

        but the overweening power of his body was too much for her she relaxed again and lay loose and soft panting in a little delirium and to him she was so sweet she was such bliss of release that he would have suffered a whole eternity of torture rather than forego one second of this pang of unsurpassable bliss

        my god he said to her his face drawn and strange transfigured what next

        she lay perfectly still with a still childlike face and dark eyes looking at him she was lost fallen right away

        i shall always love you he said looking at her

        but she did not hear she lay looking at him as at something she could never understand never as a child looks at a grownup person without hope of understanding only submitting

        he kissed her kissed her eyes shut so that she could not look any more he wanted something now some recognition some sign some admission but she only lay silent and childlike and remote like a child that is overcome and cannot understand only feels lost he kissed her again giving up

        shall we go down and have coffee and kuchen he asked

        the twilight was falling slateblue at the window she closed her eyes closed away the monotonous level of dead wonder and opened them again to the everyday world

        yes she said briefly regaining her will with a click she went again to the window blue evening had fallen over the cradle of snow and over the great pallid slopes but in the heaven the peaks of snow were rosy glistening like transcendent radiant spikes of blossom in the heavenly upperworld so lovely and beyond

        gudrun saw all their loveliness she knew how immortally beautiful they were great pistils of rosecoloured snowfed fire in the blue twilight of the heaven she could see it she knew it but she was not of it she was divorced debarred a soul shut out

        with a last look of remorse she turned away and was doing her hair he had unstrapped the luggage and was waiting watching her she knew he was watching her it made her a little hasty and feverish in her precipitation

        they went downstairs both with a strange otherworld look on their faces and with a glow in their eyes they saw birkin and ursula sitting at the long table in a corner waiting for them

        how good and simple they look together gudrun thought jealously she envied them some spontaneity a childish sufficiency to which she herself could never approach they seemed such children to her

        such good kranzkuchen cried ursula greedily so good

        right said gudrun can we have kaffee mit kranzkuchen she added to the waiter

        and she seated herself on the bench beside gerald birkin looking at them felt a pain of tenderness for them

        i think the place is really wonderful gerald he said prachtvoll and wunderbar and wunderschon and unbeschreiblich and all the other german adjectives

        gerald broke into a slight smile

        i like it he said

        the tables of white scrubbed wood were placed round three sides of the room as in a gasthaus birkin and ursula sat with their backs to the wall which was of oiled wood and gerald and gudrun sat in the corner next them near to the stove it was a fairly large place with a tiny bar just like a country inn but quite simple and bare and all of oiled wood ceilings and walls and floor the only furniture being the tables and benches going round three sides the great green stove and the bar and the doors on the fourth side the windows were double and quite uncurtained it was early evening

        the coffee came—hot and good—and a whole ring of cake

        a whole kuchen cried ursula they give you more than us i want some of yours

        there were other people in the place ten altogether so birkin had found out two artists three students a man and wife and a professor and two daughters—all germans the four english people being newcomers sat in their coign of vantage to watch the germans peeped in at the door called a word to the waiter and went away again it was not mealtime so they did not come into this diningroom but betook themselves when their boots were changed to the reunionsaal

        the english visitors could hear the occasional twanging of a zither the strumming of a piano snatches of laughter and shouting and singing a faint vibration of voices the whole building being of wood it seemed to carry every sound like a drum but instead of increasing each particular noise it decreased it so that the sound of the zither seemed tiny as if a diminutive zither were playing somewhere and it seemed the piano must be a small one like a little spinet

        the host came when the coffee was finished he was a tyrolese broad rather flatcheeked with a pale pockmarked skin and flourishing moustaches

        would you like to go to the reunionsaal to be introduced to the other ladies and gentlemen he asked bending forward and smiling showing his large strong teeth his blue eyes went quickly from one to the other—he was not quite sure of his ground with these english people he was unhappy too because he spoke no english and he was not sure whether to try his french

        shall we go to the reunionsaal and be introduced to the other people repeated gerald laughing

        there was a moments hesitation

        i suppose wed better—better break the ice said birkin

        the women rose rather flushed and the wirts black beetlelike broadshouldered figure went on ignominiously in front towards the noise he opened the door and ushered the four strangers into the playroom

        instantly a silence fell a slight embarrassment came over the company the newcomers had a sense of many blond faces looking their way then the host was bowing to a short energeticlooking man with large moustaches and saying in a low voice

        herr professor darf ich vorstellen

        the herr professor was prompt and energetic he bowed low to the english people smiling and began to be a comrade at once

        nehmen die herrschaften teil an unserer unterhaltung he said with a vigorous suavity his voice curling up in the question

        the four english people smiled lounging with an attentive uneasiness in the middle of the room gerald who was spokesman said that they would willingly take part in the entertainment gudrun and ursula laughing excited felt the eyes of all the men upon them and they lifted their heads and looked nowhere and felt royal

        the professor announced the names of those present sans ceremonie there was a bowing to the wrong people and to the right people everybody was there except the man and wife the two tall clearskinned athletic daughters of the professor with their plaincut dark blue blouses and loden skirts their rather long strong necks their clear blue eyes and carefully banded hair and their blushes bowed and stood back the three students bowed very low in the humble hope of making an impression of extreme goodbreeding then there was a thin darkskinned man with full eyes an odd creature like a child and like a troll quick detached he bowed slightly his companion a large fair young man stylishly dressed blushed to the eyes and bowed very low

        it was over

        herr loerke was giving us a recitation in the cologne dialect said the professor

        he must forgive us for interrupting him said gerald we should like very much to hear it

        there was instantly a bowing and an offering of seats gudrun and ursula gerald and birkin sat in the deep sofas against the wall the room was of naked oiled panelling like the rest of the house it had a piano sofas and chairs and a couple of tables with books and magazines in its complete absence of decoration save for the big blue stove it was cosy and pleasant

        herr loerke was the little man with the boyish figure and the round full sensitivelooking head and the quick full eyes like a mouses he glanced swiftly from one to the other of the strangers and held himself aloof

        please go on with the recitation said the professor suavely with his slight authority loerke who was sitting hunched on the piano stool blinked and did not answer

        it would be a great pleasure said ursula who had been getting the sentence ready in german for some minutes

        then suddenly the small unresponding man swung aside towards his previous audience and broke forth exactly as he had broken off in a controlled mocking voice giving an imitation of a quarrel between an old cologne woman and a railway guard

        his body was slight and unformed like a boys but his voice was mature sardonic its movement had the flexibility of essential energy and of a mocking penetrating understanding gudrun could not understand a word of his monologue but she was spellbound watching him he must be an artist nobody else could have such fine adjustment and singleness the germans were doubled up with laughter hearing his strange droll words his droll phrases of dialect and in the midst of their paroxysms they glanced with deference at the four english strangers the elect gudrun and ursula were forced to laugh the room rang with shouts of laughter the blue eyes of the professors daughters were swimming over with laughtertears their clear cheeks were flushed crimson with mirth their father broke out in the most astonishing peals of hilarity the students bowed their heads on their knees in excess of joy ursula looked round amazed the laughter was bubbling out of her involuntarily she looked at gudrun gudrun looked at her and the two sisters burst out laughing carried away loerke glanced at them swiftly with his full eyes birkin was sniggering involuntarily gerald crich sat erect with a glistening look of amusement on his face and the laughter crashed out again in wild paroxysms the professors daughters were reduced to shaking helplessness the veins of the professors neck were swollen his face was purple he was strangled in ultimate silent spasms of laughter the students were shouting halfarticulated words that tailed off in helpless explosions then suddenly the rapid patter of the artist ceased there were little whoops of subsiding mirth ursula and gudrun were wiping their eyes and the professor was crying loudly

        das war ausgezeichnet das war famos—

        wirklich famos echoed his exhausted daughters faintly

        and we couldnt understand it cried ursula

        oh leider leider cried the professor

        you couldnt understand it cried the students let loose at last in speech with the newcomers ja das ist wirklich schade das ist schade gnadige frau wissen sie—

        the mixture was made the newcomers were stirred into the party like new ingredients the whole room was alive gerald was in his element he talked freely and excitedly his face glistened with a strange amusement perhaps even birkin in the end would break forth he was shy and withheld though full of attention

        ursula was prevailed upon to sing annie lowrie as the professor called it there was a hush of extreme deference she had never been so flattered in her life gudrun accompanied her on the piano playing from memory

        ursula had a beautiful ringing voice but usually no confidence she spoiled everything this evening she felt conceited and untrammelled birkin was well in the background she shone almost in reaction the germans made her feel fine and infallible she was liberated into overweening selfconfidence she felt like a bird flying in the air as her voice soared out enjoying herself extremely in the balance and flight of the song like the motion of a birds wings that is up in the wind sliding and playing on the air she played with sentimentality supported by rapturous attention she was very happy singing that song by herself full of a conceit of emotion and power working upon all those people and upon herself exerting herself with gratification giving immeasurable gratification to the germans

        at the end the germans were all touched with admiring delicious melancholy they praised her in soft reverent voices they could not say too much

        wie schon wie ruhrend ach die schottischen lieder sie haben so viel stimmung aber die gnadige frau hat eine wunderbare stimme die gnadige frau ist wirklich eine kunstlerin aber wirklich

        she was dilated and brilliant like a flower in the morning sun she felt birkin looking at her as if he were jealous of her and her breasts thrilled her veins were all golden she was as happy as the sun that has just opened above clouds and everybody seemed so admiring and radiant it was perfect

        after dinner she wanted to go out for a minute to look at the world the company tried to dissuade her—it was so terribly cold but just to look she said

        they all four wrapped up warmly and found themselves in a vague unsubstantial outdoors of dim snow and ghosts of an upperworld that made strange shadows before the stars it was indeed cold bruisingly frighteningly unnaturally cold ursula could not believe the air in her nostrils it seemed conscious malevolent purposive in its intense murderous coldness

        yet it was wonderful an intoxication a silence of dim unrealised snow of the invisible intervening between her and the visible between her and the flashing stars she could see orion sloping up how wonderful he was wonderful enough to make one cry aloud

        and all around was this cradle of snow and there was firm snow underfoot that struck with heavy cold through her bootsoles it was night and silence she imagined she could hear the stars she imagined distinctly she could hear the celestial musical motion of the stars quite near at hand she seemed like a bird flying amongst their harmonious motion

        and she clung close to birkin suddenly she realised she did not know what he was thinking she did not know where he was ranging

        my love she said stopping to look at him

        his face was pale his eyes dark there was a faint spark of starlight on them and he saw her face soft and upturned to him very near he kissed her softly

        what then he asked

        do you love me she asked

        too much he answered quietly

        she clung a little closer

        not too much she pleaded

        far too much he said almost sadly

        and does it make you sad that i am everything to you she asked wistful he held her close to him kissing her and saying scarcely audible

        no but i feel like a beggar—i feel poor

        she was silent looking at the stars now then she kissed him

        dont be a beggar she pleaded wistfully it isnt ignominious that you love me

        it is ignominious to feel poor isnt it he replied

        why why should it be she asked he only stood still in the terribly cold air that moved invisibly over the mountain tops folding her round with his arms

        i couldnt bear this cold eternal place without you he said i couldnt bear it it would kill the quick of my life

        she kissed him again suddenly

        do you hate it she asked puzzled wondering

        if i couldnt come near to you if you werent here i should hate it i couldnt bear it he answered

        but the people are nice she said

        i mean the stillness the cold the frozen eternality he said

        she wondered then her spirit came home to him nestling unconscious in him

        yes it is good we are warm and together she said

        and they turned home again they saw the golden lights of the hotel glowing out in the night of snowsilence small in the hollow like a cluster of yellow berries it seemed like a bunch of sunsparks tiny and orange in the midst of the snowdarkness behind was a high shadow of a peak blotting out the stars like a ghost

        they drew near to their home they saw a man come from the dark building with a lighted lantern which swung golden and made that his dark feet walked in a halo of snow he was a small dark figure in the darkened snow he unlatched the door of an outhouse a smell of cows hot animal almost like beef came out on the heavily cold air there was a glimpse of two cattle in their dark stalls then the door was shut again and not a chink of light showed it had reminded ursula again of home of the marsh of her childhood and of the journey to brussels and strangely of anton skrebensky

        oh god could one bear it this past which was gone down the abyss could she bear that it ever had been she looked round this silent upper world of snow and stars and powerful cold there was another world like views on a magic lantern the marsh cossethay ilkeston lit up with a common unreal light there was a shadowy unreal ursula a whole shadowplay of an unreal life it was as unreal and circumscribed as a magiclantern show she wished the slides could all be broken she wished it could be gone for ever like a lanternslide which was broken she wanted to have no past she wanted to have come down from the slopes of heaven to this place with birkin not to have toiled out of the murk of her childhood and her upbringing slowly all soiled she felt that memory was a dirty trick played upon her what was this decree that she should remember why not a bath of pure oblivion a new birth without any recollections or blemish of a past life she was with birkin she had just come into life here in the high snow against the stars what had she to do with parents and antecedents she knew herself new and unbegotten she had no father no mother no anterior connections she was herself pure and silvery she belonged only to the oneness with birkin a oneness that struck deeper notes sounding into the heart of the universe the heart of reality where she had never existed before

        even gudrun was a separate unit separate separate having nothing to do with this self this ursula in her new world of reality that old shadowworld the actuality of the past—ah let it go she rose free on the wings of her new condition

        gudrun and gerald had not come in they had walked up the valley straight in front of the house not like ursula and birkin on to the little hill at the right gudrun was driven by a strange desire she wanted to plunge on and on till she came to the end of the valley of snow then she wanted to climb the wall of white finality climb over into the peaks that sprang up like sharp petals in the heart of the frozen mysterious navel of the world she felt that there over the strange blind terrible wall of rocky snow there in the navel of the mystic world among the final cluster of peaks there in the infolded navel of it all was her consummation if she could but come there alone and pass into the infolded navel of eternal snow and of uprising immortal peaks of snow and rock she would be a oneness with all she would be herself the eternal infinite silence the sleeping timeless frozen centre of the all

        they went back to the house to the reunionsaal she was curious to see what was going on the men there made her alert roused her curiosity it was a new taste of life for her they were so prostrate before her yet so full of life

        the party was boisterous they were dancing all together dancing the schuhplatteln the tyrolese dance of the clapping hands and tossing the partner in the air at the crisis the germans were all proficient—they were from munich chiefly gerald also was quite passable there were three zithers twanging away in a corner it was a scene of great animation and confusion the professor was initiating ursula into the dance stamping clapping and swinging her high with amazing force and zest when the crisis came even birkin was behaving manfully with one of the professors fresh strong daughters who was exceedingly happy everybody was dancing there was the most boisterous turmoil

        gudrun looked on with delight the solid wooden floor resounded to the knocking heels of the men the air quivered with the clapping hands and the zither music there was a golden dust about the hanging lamps

        suddenly the dance finished loerke and the students rushed out to bring in drinks there was an excited clamour of voices a clinking of muglids a great crying of prosit—prosit loerke was everywhere at once like a gnome suggesting drinks for the women making an obscure slightly risky joke with the men confusing and mystifying the waiter

        he wanted very much to dance with gudrun from the first moment he had seen her he wanted to make a connection with her instinctively she felt this and she waited for him to come up but a kind of sulkiness kept him away from her so she thought he disliked her

        will you schuhplatteln gnadige frau said the large fair youth loerkes companion he was too soft too humble for gudruns taste but she wanted to dance and the fair youth who was called leitner was handsome enough in his uneasy slightly abject fashion a humility that covered a certain fear she accepted him as a partner

        the zithers sounded out again the dance began gerald led them laughing with one of the professors daughters ursula danced with one of the students birkin with the other daughter of the professor the professor with frau kramer and the rest of the men danced together with quite as much zest as if they had had women partners

        because gudrun had danced with the wellbuilt soft youth his companion loerke was more pettish and exasperated than ever and would not even notice her existence in the room this piqued her but she made up to herself by dancing with the professor who was strong as a mature wellseasoned bull and as full of coarse energy she could not bear him critically and yet she enjoyed being rushed through the dance and tossed up into the air on his coarse powerful impetus the professor enjoyed it too he eyed her with strange large blue eyes full of galvanic fire she hated him for the seasoned semipaternal animalism with which he regarded her but she admired his weight of strength

        the room was charged with excitement and strong animal emotion loerke was kept away from gudrun to whom he wanted to speak as by a hedge of thorns and he felt a sardonic ruthless hatred for this young lovecompanion leitner who was his penniless dependent he mocked the youth with an acid ridicule that made leitner red in the face and impotent with resentment

        gerald who had now got the dance perfectly was dancing again with the younger of the professors daughters who was almost dying of virgin excitement because she thought gerald so handsome so superb he had her in his power as if she were a palpitating bird a fluttering flushing bewildered creature and it made him smile as she shrank convulsively between his hands violently when he must throw her into the air at the end she was so overcome with prostrate love for him that she could scarcely speak sensibly at all

        birkin was dancing with ursula there were odd little fires playing in his eyes he seemed to have turned into something wicked and flickering mocking suggestive quite impossible ursula was frightened of him and fascinated clear before her eyes as in a vision she could see the sardonic licentious mockery of his eyes he moved towards her with subtle animal indifferent approach the strangeness of his hands which came quick and cunning inevitably to the vital place beneath her breasts and lifting with mocking suggestive impulse carried her through the air as if without strength through blackmagic made her swoon with fear for a moment she revolted it was horrible she would break the spell but before the resolution had formed she had submitted again yielded to her fear he knew all the time what he was doing she could see it in his smiling concentrated eyes it was his responsibility she would leave it to him

        when they were alone in the darkness she felt the strange licentiousness of him hovering upon her she was troubled and repelled why should he turn like this

        what is it she asked in dread

        but his face only glistened on her unknown horrible and yet she was fascinated her impulse was to repel him violently break from this spell of mocking brutishness but she was too fascinated she wanted to submit she wanted to know what would he do to her

        he was so attractive and so repulsive at one the sardonic suggestivity that flickered over his face and looked from his narrowed eyes made her want to hide to hide herself away from him and watch him from somewhere unseen

        why are you like this she demanded again rousing against him with sudden force and animosity

        the flickering fires in his eyes concentrated as he looked into her eyes then the lids drooped with a faint motion of satiric contempt then they rose again to the same remorseless suggestivity and she gave way he might do as he would his licentiousness was repulsively attractive but he was selfresponsible she would see what it was

        they might do as they liked—this she realised as she went to sleep how could anything that gave one satisfaction be excluded what was degrading who cared degrading things were real with a different reality and he was so unabashed and unrestrained wasnt it rather horrible a man who could be so soulful and spiritual now to be so—she balked at her own thoughts and memories then she added—so bestial so bestial they two—so degraded she winced but after all why not she exulted as well why not be bestial and go the whole round of experience she exulted in it she was bestial how good it was to be really shameful there would be no shameful thing she had not experienced yet she was unabashed she was herself why not she was free when she knew everything and no dark shameful things were denied her

        gudrun who had been watching gerald in the reunionsaal suddenly thought

        he should have all the women he can—it is his nature it is absurd to call him monogamous—he is naturally promiscuous that is his nature

        the thought came to her involuntarily it shocked her somewhat it was as if she had seen some new mene mene upon the wall yet it was merely true a voice seemed to have spoken it to her so clearly that for the moment she believed in inspiration

        it is really true she said to herself again

        she knew quite well she had believed it all along she knew it implicitly but she must keep it dark—almost from herself she must keep it completely secret it was knowledge for her alone and scarcely even to be admitted to herself

        the deep resolve formed in her to combat him one of them must triumph over the other which should it be her soul steeled itself with strength almost she laughed within herself at her confidence it woke a certain keen half contemptuous pity tenderness for him she was so ruthless

        everybody retired early the professor and loerke went into a small lounge to drink they both watched gudrun go along the landing by the railing upstairs

        ein schones frauenzimmer said the professor

        ja asserted loerke shortly

        gerald walked with his queer long wolfsteps across the bedroom to the window stooped and looked out then rose again and turned to gudrun his eyes sharp with an abstract smile he seemed very tall to her she saw the glisten of his whitish eyebrows that met between his brows

        how do you like it he said

        he seemed to be laughing inside himself quite unconsciously she looked at him he was a phenomenon to her not a human being a sort of creature greedy

        i like it very much she replied

        who do you like best downstairs he asked standing tall and glistening above her with his glistening stiff hair erect

        who do i like best she repeated wanting to answer his question and finding it difficult to collect herself why i dont know i dont know enough about them yet to be able to say who do you like best

        oh i dont care—i dont like or dislike any of them it doesnt matter about me i wanted to know about you

        but why she asked going rather pale the abstract unconscious smile in his eyes was intensified

        i wanted to know he said

        she turned aside breaking the spell in some strange way she felt he was getting power over her

        well i cant tell you already she said

        she went to the mirror to take out the hairpins from her hair she stood before the mirror every night for some minutes brushing her fine dark hair it was part of the inevitable ritual of her life

        he followed her and stood behind her she was busy with bent head taking out the pins and shaking her warm hair loose when she looked up she saw him in the glass standing behind her watching unconsciously not consciously seeing her and yet watching with finepupilled eyes that seemed to smile and which were not really smiling

        she started it took all her courage for her to continue brushing her hair as usual for her to pretend she was at her ease she was far far from being at her ease with him she beat her brains wildly for something to say to him

        what are your plans for tomorrow she asked nonchalantly whilst her heart was beating so furiously her eyes were so bright with strange nervousness she felt he could not but observe but she knew also that he was completely blind blind as a wolf looking at her it was a strange battle between her ordinary consciousness and his uncanny blackart consciousness

        i dont know he replied what would you like to do

        he spoke emptily his mind was sunk away

        oh she said with easy protestation im ready for anything—anything will be fine for me im sure

        and to herself she was saying god why am i so nervous—why are you so nervous you fool if he sees it im done for forever—you know youre done for forever if he sees the absurd state youre in

        and she smiled to herself as if it were all childs play meanwhile her heart was plunging she was almost fainting she could see him in the mirror as he stood there behind her tall and overarching—blond and terribly frightening she glanced at his reflection with furtive eyes willing to give anything to save him from knowing she could see him he did not know she could see his reflection he was looking unconsciously glisteningly down at her head from which the hair fell loose as she brushed it with wild nervous hand she held her head aside and brushed and brushed her hair madly for her life she could not turn round and face him for her life she could not and the knowledge made her almost sink to the ground in a faint helpless spent she was aware of his frightening impending figure standing close behind her she was aware of his hard strong unyielding chest close upon her back and she felt she could not bear it any more in a few minutes she would fall down at his feet grovelling at his feet and letting him destroy her

        the thought pricked up all her sharp intelligence and presence of mind she dared not turn round to him—and there he stood motionless unbroken summoning all her strength she said in a full resonant nonchalant voice that was forced out with all her remaining selfcontrol

        oh would you mind looking in that bag behind there and giving me my—

        here her power fell inert my what—my what— she screamed in silence to herself

        but he had started round surprised and startled that she should ask him to look in her bag which she always kept so very private to herself

        she turned now her face white her dark eyes blazing with uncanny overwrought excitement she saw him stooping to the bag undoing the loosely buckled strap unattentive

        your what he asked

        oh a little enamel box—yellow—with a design of a cormorant plucking her breast—

        she went towards him stooping her beautiful bare arm and deftly turned some of her things disclosing the box which was exquisitely painted

        that is it see she said taking it from under his eyes

        and he was baffled now he was left to fasten up the bag whilst she swiftly did up her hair for the night and sat down to unfasten her shoes she would not turn her back to him any more

        he was baffled frustrated but unconscious she had the whip hand over him now she knew he had not realised her terrible panic her heart was beating heavily still fool fool that she was to get into such a state how she thanked god for geralds obtuse blindness thank god he could see nothing

        she sat slowly unlacing her shoes and he too commenced to undress thank god that crisis was over she felt almost fond of him now almost in love with him

        ah gerald she laughed caressively teasingly ah what a fine game you played with the professors daughter—didnt you now

        what game he asked looking round

        isnt she in love with you—oh dear isnt she in love with you said gudrun in her gayest most attractive mood

        i shouldnt think so he said

        shouldnt think so she teased why the poor girl is lying at this moment overwhelmed dying with love for you she thinks youre wonderful—oh marvellous beyond what man has ever been really isnt it funny

        why funny what is funny he asked

        why to see you working it on her she said with a half reproach that confused the male conceit in him really gerald the poor girl—

        i did nothing to her he said

        oh it was too shameful the way you simply swept her off her feet

        that was schuhplatteln he replied with a bright grin

        ha—ha—ha laughed gudrun

        her mockery quivered through his muscles with curious reechoes when he slept he seemed to crouch down in the bed lapped up in his own strength that yet was hollow

        and gudrun slept strongly a victorious sleep suddenly she was almost fiercely awake the small timber room glowed with the dawn that came upwards from the low window she could see down the valley when she lifted her head the snow with a pinkish halfrevealed magic the fringe of pinetrees at the bottom of the slope and one tiny figure moved over the vaguelyilluminated space

        she glanced at his watch it was seven oclock he was still completely asleep and she was so hard awake it was almost frightening—a hard metallic wakefulness she lay looking at him

        he slept in the subjection of his own health and defeat she was overcome by a sincere regard for him till now she was afraid before him she lay and thought about him what he was what he represented in the world a fine independent will he had she thought of the revolution he had worked in the mines in so short a time she knew that if he were confronted with any problem any hard actual difficulty he would overcome it if he laid hold of any idea he would carry it through he had the faculty of making order out of confusion only let him grip hold of a situation and he would bring to pass an inevitable conclusion

        for a few moments she was borne away on the wild wings of ambition gerald with his force of will and his power for comprehending the actual world should be set to solve the problems of the day the problem of industrialism in the modern world she knew he would in the course of time effect the changes he desired he could reorganise the industrial system she knew he could do it as an instrument in these things he was marvellous she had never seen any man with his potentiality he was unaware of it but she knew

        he only needed to be hitched on he needed that his hand should be set to the task because he was so unconscious and this she could do she would marry him he would go into parliament in the conservative interest he would clear up the great muddle of labour and industry he was so superbly fearless masterful he knew that every problem could be worked out in life as in geometry and he would care neither about himself nor about anything but the pure working out of the problem he was very pure really

        her heart beat fast she flew away on wings of elation imagining a future he would be a napoleon of peace or a bismarck—and she the woman behind him she had read bismarcks letters and had been deeply moved by them and gerald would be freer more dauntless than bismarck

        but even as she lay in fictitious transport bathed in the strange false sunshine of hope in life something seemed to snap in her and a terrible cynicism began to gain upon her blowing in like a wind everything turned to irony with her the last flavour of everything was ironical when she felt her pang of undeniable reality this was when she knew the hard irony of hopes and ideas

        she lay and looked at him as he slept he was sheerly beautiful he was a perfect instrument to her mind he was a pure inhuman almost superhuman instrument his instrumentality appealed so strongly to her she wished she were god to use him as a tool

        and at the same instant came the ironical question what for she thought of the colliers wives with their linoleum and their lace curtains and their little girls in highlaced boots she thought of the wives and daughters of the pitmanagers their tennisparties and their terrible struggles to be superior each to the other in the social scale there was shortlands with its meaningless distinction the meaningless crowd of the criches there was london the house of commons the extant social world my god

        young as she was gudrun had touched the whole pulse of social england she had no ideas of rising in the world she knew with the perfect cynicism of cruel youth that to rise in the world meant to have one outside show instead of another the advance was like having a spurious halfcrown instead of a spurious penny the whole coinage of valuation was spurious yet of course her cynicism knew well enough that in a world where spurious coin was current a bad sovereign was better than a bad farthing but rich and poor she despised both alike

        already she mocked at herself for her dreams they could be fulfilled easily enough but she recognised too well in her spirit the mockery of her own impulses what did she care that gerald had created a richlypaying industry out of an old wornout concern what did she care the wornout concern and the rapid splendidly organised industry they were bad money yet of course she cared a great deal outwardly—and outwardly was all that mattered for inwardly was a bad joke

        everything was intrinsically a piece of irony to her she leaned over gerald and said in her heart with compassion

        oh my dear my dear the game isnt worth even you you are a fine thing really—why should you be used on such a poor show

        her heart was breaking with pity and grief for him and at the same moment a grimace came over her mouth of mocking irony at her own unspoken tirade ah what a farce it was she thought of parnell and katherine oshea parnell after all who can take the nationalisation of ireland seriously who can take political ireland really seriously whatever it does and who can take political england seriously who can who can care a straw really how the old patchedup constitution is tinkered at any more who cares a button for our national ideas any more than for our national bowler hat aha it is all old hat it is all old bowler hat

        thats all it is gerald my young hero at any rate well spare ourselves the nausea of stirring the old broth any more you be beautiful my gerald and reckless there are perfect moments wake up gerald wake up convince me of the perfect moments oh convince me i need it

        he opened his eyes and looked at her she greeted him with a mocking enigmatic smile in which was a poignant gaiety over his face went the reflection of the smile he smiled too purely unconsciously

        that filled her with extraordinary delight to see the smile cross his face reflected from her face she remembered that was how a baby smiled it filled her with extraordinary radiant delight

        youve done it she said

        what he asked dazed

        convinced me

        and she bent down kissing him passionately passionately so that he was bewildered he did not ask her of what he had convinced her though he meant to he was glad she was kissing him she seemed to be feeling for his very heart to touch the quick of him and he wanted her to touch the quick of his being he wanted that most of all

        outside somebody was singing in a manly reckless handsome voice

        mach mir auf mach mir auf du stolze
mach mir ein feuer von holze
vom regen bin ich nass
vom regen bin ich nass

        gudrun knew that that song would sound through her eternity sung in a manly reckless mocking voice it marked one of her supreme moments the supreme pangs of her nervous gratification there it was fixed in eternity for her

        the day came fine and bluish there was a light wind blowing among the mountain tops keen as a rapier where it touched carrying with it a fine dust of snowpowder gerald went out with the fine blind face of a man who is in his state of fulfilment gudrun and he were in perfect static unity this morning but unseeing and unwitting they went out with a toboggan leaving ursula and birkin to follow

        gudrun was all scarlet and royal blue—a scarlet jersey and cap and a royal blue skirt and stockings she went gaily over the white snow with gerald beside her in white and grey pulling the little toboggan they grew small in the distance of snow climbing the steep slope

        for gudrun herself she seemed to pass altogether into the whiteness of the snow she became a pure thoughtless crystal when she reached the top of the slope in the wind she looked round and saw peak beyond peak of rock and snow bluish transcendent in heaven and it seemed to her like a garden with the peaks for pure flowers and her heart gathering them she had no separate consciousness for gerald

        she held on to him as they went sheering down over the keen slope she felt as if her senses were being whetted on some fine grindstone that was keen as flame the snow sprinted on either side like sparks from a blade that is being sharpened the whiteness round about ran swifter swifter in pure flame the white slope flew against her and she fused like one molten dancing globule rushed through a white intensity then there was a great swerve at the bottom when they swung as it were in a fall to earth in the diminishing motion

        they came to rest but when she rose to her feet she could not stand she gave a strange cry turned and clung to him sinking her face on his breast fainting in him utter oblivion came over her as she lay for a few moments abandoned against him

        what is it he was saying was it too much for you

        but she heard nothing

        when she came to she stood up and looked round astonished her face was white her eyes brilliant and large

        what is it he repeated did it upset you

        she looked at him with her brilliant eyes that seemed to have undergone some transfiguration and she laughed with a terrible merriment

        no she cried with triumphant joy it was the complete moment of my life

        and she looked at him with her dazzling overweening laughter like one possessed a fine blade seemed to enter his heart but he did not care or take any notice

        but they climbed up the slope again and they flew down through the white flame again splendidly splendidly gudrun was laughing and flashing powdered with snowcrystals gerald worked perfectly he felt he could guide the toboggan to a hairbreadth almost he could make it pierce into the air and right into the very heart of the sky it seemed to him the flying sledge was but his strength spread out he had but to move his arms the motion was his own they explored the great slopes to find another slide he felt there must be something better than they had known and he found what he desired a perfect long fierce sweep sheering past the foot of a rock and into the trees at the base it was dangerous he knew but then he knew also he would direct the sledge between his fingers

        the first days passed in an ecstasy of physical motion sleighing skiing skating moving in an intensity of speed and white light that surpassed life itself and carried the souls of the human beings beyond into an inhuman abstraction of velocity and weight and eternal frozen snow

        geralds eyes became hard and strange and as he went by on his skis he was more like some powerful fateful sigh than a man his muscles elastic in a perfect soaring trajectory his body projected in pure flight mindless soulless whirling along one perfect line of force

        luckily there came a day of snow when they must all stay indoors otherwise birkin said they would all lose their faculties and begin to utter themselves in cries and shrieks like some strange unknown species of snowcreatures

        it happened in the afternoon that ursula sat in the reunionsaal talking to loerke the latter had seemed unhappy lately he was lively and full of mischievous humour as usual

        but ursula had thought he was sulky about something his partner too the big fair goodlooking youth was ill at ease going about as if he belonged to nowhere and was kept in some sort of subjection against which he was rebelling

        loerke had hardly talked to gudrun his associate on the other hand had paid her constantly a soft overdeferential attention gudrun wanted to talk to loerke he was a sculptor and she wanted to hear his view of his art and his figure attracted her there was the look of a little wastrel about him that intrigued her and an old mans look that interested her and then beside this an uncanny singleness a quality of being by himself not in contact with anybody else that marked out an artist to her he was a chatterer a magpie a maker of mischievous wordjokes that were sometimes very clever but which often were not and she could see in his brown gnomes eyes the black look of inorganic misery which lay behind all his small buffoonery

        his figure interested her—the figure of a boy almost a street arab he made no attempt to conceal it he always wore a simple loden suit with knee breeches his legs were thin and he made no attempt to disguise the fact which was of itself remarkable in a german and he never ingratiated himself anywhere not in the slightest but kept to himself for all his apparent playfulness

        leitner his companion was a great sportsman very handsome with his big limbs and his blue eyes loerke would go toboganning or skating in little snatches but he was indifferent and his fine thin nostrils the nostrils of a purebred street arab would quiver with contempt at leitners splothering gymnastic displays it was evident that the two men who had travelled and lived together sharing the same bedroom had now reached the stage of loathing leitner hated loerke with an injured writhing impotent hatred and loerke treated leitner with a finequivering contempt and sarcasm soon the two would have to go apart

        already they were rarely together leitner ran attaching himself to somebody or other always deferring loerke was a good deal alone out of doors he wore a westphalian cap a close brownvelvet head with big brown velvet flaps down over his ears so that he looked like a lopeared rabbit or a troll his face was brownred with a dry bright skin that seemed to crinkle with his mobile expressions his eyes were arresting—brown full like a rabbits or like a trolls or like the eyes of a lost being having a strange dumb depraved look of knowledge and a quick spark of uncanny fire whenever gudrun had tried to talk to him he had shied away unresponsive looking at her with his watchful dark eyes but entering into no relation with her he had made her feel that her slow french and her slower german were hateful to him as for his own inadequate english he was much too awkward to try it at all but he understood a good deal of what was said nevertheless and gudrun piqued left him alone

        this afternoon however she came into the lounge as he was talking to ursula his fine black hair somehow reminded her of a bat thin as it was on his full sensitivelooking head and worn away at the temples he sat hunched up as if his spirit were batlike and gudrun could see he was making some slow confidence to ursula unwilling a slow grudging scanty selfrevelation she went and sat by her sister

        he looked at her then looked away again as if he took no notice of her but as a matter of fact she interested him deeply

        isnt it interesting prune said ursula turning to her sister herr loerke is doing a great frieze for a factory in cologne for the outside the street

        she looked at him at his thin brown nervous hands that were prehensile and somehow like talons like griffes inhuman

        what in she asked

        aus was repeated ursula

        granit he replied

        it had become immediately a laconic series of question and answer between fellow craftsmen

        what is the relief asked gudrun

        alto relievo

        and at what height

        it was very interesting to gudrun to think of his making the great granite frieze for a great granite factory in cologne she got from him some notion of the design it was a representation of a fair with peasants and artisans in an orgy of enjoyment drunk and absurd in their modern dress whirling ridiculously in roundabouts gaping at shows kissing and staggering and rolling in knots swinging in swingboats and firing down shooting galleries a frenzy of chaotic motion

        there was a swift discussion of technicalities gudrun was very much impressed

        but how wonderful to have such a factory cried ursula is the whole building fine

        oh yes he replied the frieze is part of the whole architecture yes it is a colossal thing

        then he seemed to stiffen shrugged his shoulders and went on

        sculpture and architecture must go together the day for irrelevant statues as for wall pictures is over as a matter of fact sculpture is always part of an architectural conception and since churches are all museum stuff since industry is our business now then let us make our places of industry our art—our factoryarea our parthenon ecco

        ursula pondered

        i suppose she said there is no need for our great works to be so hideous

        instantly he broke into motion

        there you are he cried there you are there is not only no need for our places of work to be ugly but their ugliness ruins the work in the end men will not go on submitting to such intolerable ugliness in the end it will hurt too much and they will wither because of it and this will wither the work as well they will think the work itself is ugly the machines the very act of labour whereas the machinery and the acts of labour are extremely maddeningly beautiful but this will be the end of our civilisation when people will not work because work has become so intolerable to their senses it nauseates them too much they would rather starve then we shall see the hammer used only for smashing then we shall see it yet here we are—we have the opportunity to make beautiful factories beautiful machinehouses—we have the opportunity—

        gudrun could only partly understand she could have cried with vexation

        what does he say she asked ursula and ursula translated stammering and brief loerke watched gudruns face to see her judgment

        and do you think then said gudrun that art should serve industry

        art should interpret industry as art once interpreted religion he said

        but does your fair interpret industry she asked him

        certainly what is man doing when he is at a fair like this he is fulfilling the counterpart of labour—the machine works him instead of he the machine he enjoys the mechanical motion in his own body

        but is there nothing but work—mechanical work said gudrun

        nothing but work he repeated leaning forward his eyes two darknesses with needlepoints of light no it is nothing but this serving a machine or enjoying the motion of a machine—motion that is all you have never worked for hunger or you would know what god governs us

        gudrun quivered and flushed for some reason she was almost in tears

        no i have not worked for hunger she replied but i have worked

        travaille—lavorato he asked e che lavoro—che lavoro quel travail estce que vous avez fait

        he broke into a mixture of italian and french instinctively using a foreign language when he spoke to her

        you have never worked as the world works he said to her with sarcasm

        yes she said i have and i do—i work now for my daily bread

        he paused looked at her steadily then dropped the subject entirely she seemed to him to be trifling

        but have you ever worked as the world works ursula asked him

        he looked at her untrustful

        yes he replied with a surly bark i have known what it was to lie in bed for three days because i had nothing to eat

        gudrun was looking at him with large grave eyes that seemed to draw the confession from him as the marrow from his bones all his nature held him back from confessing and yet her large grave eyes upon him seemed to open some valve in his veins and involuntarily he was telling

        my father was a man who did not like work and we had no mother we lived in austria polish austria how did we live ha—somehow mostly in a room with three other families—one set in each corner—and the wc in the middle of the room—a pan with a plank on it—ha i had two brothers and a sister—and there might be a woman with my father he was a free being in his way—would fight with any man in the town—a garrison town—and was a little man too but he wouldnt work for anybody—set his heart against it and wouldnt

        and how did you live then asked ursula

        he looked at her—then suddenly at gudrun

        do you understand he asked

        enough she replied

        their eyes met for a moment then he looked away he would say no more

        and how did you become a sculptor asked ursula

        how did i become a sculptor— he paused dunque— he resumed in a changed manner and beginning to speak french—i became old enough—i used to steal from the marketplace later i went to work—imprinted the stamp on clay bottles before they were baked it was an earthenwarebottle factory there i began making models one day i had had enough i lay in the sun and did not go to work then i walked to munich—then i walked to italy—begging begging everything

        the italians were very good to me—they were good and honourable to me from bozen to rome almost every night i had a meal and a bed perhaps of straw with some peasant i love the italian people with all my heart

        dunque adesso—maintenant—i earn a thousand pounds in a year or i earn two thousand—

        he looked down at the ground his voice tailing off into silence

        gudrun looked at his fine thin shiny skin reddishbrown from the sun drawn tight over his full temples and at his thin hair—and at the thick coarse brushlike moustache cut short about his mobile rather shapeless mouth

        how old are you she asked

        he looked up at her with his full elfin eyes startled

        wie alt he repeated and he hesitated it was evidently one of his reticencies

        how old are you he replied without answering

        i am twentysix she answered

        twentysix he repeated looking into her eyes he paused then he said

        und ihr herr gemahl wie alt is er

        who asked gudrun

        your husband said ursula with a certain irony

        i havent got a husband said gudrun in english in german she answered

        he is thirtyone

        but loerke was watching closely with his uncanny full suspicious eyes something in gudrun seemed to accord with him he was really like one of the little people who have no soul who has found his mate in a human being but he suffered in his discovery she too was fascinated by him fascinated as if some strange creature a rabbit or a bat or a brown seal had begun to talk to her but also she knew what he was unconscious of his tremendous power of understanding of apprehending her living motion he did not know his own power he did not know how with his full submerged watchful eyes he could look into her and see her what she was see her secrets he would only want her to be herself—he knew her verily with a subconscious sinister knowledge devoid of illusions and hopes

        to gudrun there was in loerke the rockbottom of all life everybody else had their illusion must have their illusion their before and after but he with a perfect stoicism did without any before and after dispensed with all illusion he did not deceive himself in the last issue in the last issue he cared about nothing he was troubled about nothing he made not the slightest attempt to be at one with anything he existed a pure unconnected will stoical and momentaneous there was only his work

        it was curious too how his poverty the degradation of his earlier life attracted her there was something insipid and tasteless to her in the idea of a gentleman a man who had gone the usual course through school and university a certain violent sympathy however came up in her for this mudchild he seemed to be the very stuff of the underworld of life there was no going beyond him

        ursula too was attracted by loerke in both sisters he commanded a certain homage but there were moments when to ursula he seemed indescribably inferior false a vulgarism

        both birkin and gerald disliked him gerald ignoring him with some contempt birkin exasperated

        what do the women find so impressive in that little brat gerald asked

        god alone knows replied birkin unless its some sort of appeal he makes to them which flatters them and has such a power over them

        gerald looked up in surprise

        does he make an appeal to them he asked

        oh yes replied birkin he is the perfectly subjected being existing almost like a criminal and the women rush towards that like a current of air towards a vacuum

        funny they should rush to that said gerald

        makes one mad too said birkin but he has the fascination of pity and repulsion for them a little obscene monster of the darkness that he is

        gerald stood still suspended in thought

        what do women want at the bottom he asked

        birkin shrugged his shoulders

        god knows he said some satisfaction in basic repulsion it seems to me they seem to creep down some ghastly tunnel of darkness and will never be satisfied till theyve come to the end

        gerald looked out into the mist of fine snow that was blowing by everywhere was blind today horribly blind

        and what is the end he asked

        birkin shook his head

        ive not got there yet so i dont know ask loerke hes pretty near he is a good many stages further than either you or i can go

        yes but stages further in what cried gerald irritated

        birkin sighed and gathered his brows into a knot of anger

        stages further in social hatred he said he lives like a rat in the river of corruption just where it falls over into the bottomless pit hes further on than we are he hates the ideal more acutely he hates the ideal utterly yet it still dominates him i expect he is a jew—or part jewish

        probably said gerald

        he is a gnawing little negation gnawing at the roots of life

        but why does anybody care about him cried gerald

        because they hate the ideal also in their souls they want to explore the sewers and hes the wizard rat that swims ahead

        still gerald stood and stared at the blind haze of snow outside

        i dont understand your terms really he said in a flat doomed voice but it sounds a rum sort of desire

        i suppose we want the same said birkin only we want to take a quick jump downwards in a sort of ecstasy—and he ebbs with the stream the sewer stream

        meanwhile gudrun and ursula waited for the next opportunity to talk to loerke it was no use beginning when the men were there then they could get into no touch with the isolated little sculptor he had to be alone with them and he preferred ursula to be there as a sort of transmitter to gudrun

        do you do nothing but architectural sculpture gudrun asked him one evening

        not now he replied i have done all sorts—except portraits—i never did portraits but other things—

        what kind of things asked gudrun

        he paused a moment then rose and went out of the room he returned almost immediately with a little roll of paper which he handed to her she unrolled it it was a photogravure reproduction of a statuette signed f loerke

        that is quite an early thing—not mechanical he said more popular

        the statuette was of a naked girl small finely made sitting on a great naked horse the girl was young and tender a mere bud she was sitting sideways on the horse her face in her hands as if in shame and grief in a little abandon her hair which was short and must be flaxen fell forward divided half covering her hands

        her limbs were young and tender her legs scarcely formed yet the legs of a maiden just passing towards cruel womanhood dangled childishly over the side of the powerful horse pathetically the small feet folded one over the other as if to hide but there was no hiding there she was exposed naked on the naked flank of the horse

        the horse stood stock still stretched in a kind of start it was a massive magnificent stallion rigid with pentup power its neck was arched and terrible like a sickle its flanks were pressed back rigid with power

        gudrun went pale and a darkness came over her eyes like shame she looked up with a certain supplication almost slavelike he glanced at her and jerked his head a little

        how big is it she asked in a toneless voice persisting in appearing casual and unaffected

        how big he replied glancing again at her without pedestal—so high— he measured with his hand—with pedestal so—

        he looked at her steadily there was a little brusque turgid contempt for her in his swift gesture and she seemed to cringe a little

        and what is it done in she asked throwing back her head and looking at him with affected coldness

        he still gazed at her steadily and his dominance was not shaken

        bronze—green bronze

        green bronze repeated gudrun coldly accepting his challenge she was thinking of the slender immature tender limbs of the girl smooth and cold in green bronze

        yes beautiful she murmured looking up at him with a certain dark homage

        he closed his eyes and looked aside triumphant

        why said ursula did you make the horse so stiff it is as stiff as a block

        stiff he repeated in arms at once

        yes look how stock and stupid and brutal it is horses are sensitive quite delicate and sensitive really

        he raised his shoulders spread his hands in a shrug of slow indifference as much as to inform her she was an amateur and an impertinent nobody

        wissen sie he said with an insulting patience and condescension in his voice that horse is a certain form part of a whole form it is part of a work of art a piece of form it is not a picture of a friendly horse to which you give a lump of sugar do you see—it is part of a work of art it has no relation to anything outside that work of art

        ursula angry at being treated quite so insultingly de haut en bas from the height of esoteric art to the depth of general exoteric amateurism replied hotly flushing and lifting her face

        but it is a picture of a horse nevertheless

        he lifted his shoulders in another shrug

        as you like—it is not a picture of a cow certainly

        here gudrun broke in flushed and brilliant anxious to avoid any more of this any more of ursulas foolish persistence in giving herself away

        what do you mean by it is a picture of a horse she cried at her sister what do you mean by a horse you mean an idea you have in your head and which you want to see represented there is another idea altogether quite another idea call it a horse if you like or say it is not a horse i have just as much right to say that your horse isnt a horse that it is a falsity of your own makeup

        ursula wavered baffled then her words came

        but why does he have this idea of a horse she said i know it is his idea i know it is a picture of himself really—

        loerke snorted with rage

        a picture of myself he repeated in derision wissen sie gnadige frau that is a kunstwerk a work of art it is a work of art it is a picture of nothing of absolutely nothing it has nothing to do with anything but itself it has no relation with the everyday world of this and other there is no connection between them absolutely none they are two different and distinct planes of existence and to translate one into the other is worse than foolish it is a darkening of all counsel a making confusion everywhere do you see you must not confuse the relative work of action with the absolute world of art that you must not do

        that is quite true cried gudrun let loose in a sort of rhapsody the two things are quite and permanently apart they have nothing to do with one another i and my art they have nothing to do with each other my art stands in another world i am in this world

        her face was flushed and transfigured loerke who was sitting with his head ducked like some creature at bay looked up at her swiftly almost furtively and murmured

        ja—so ist es so ist es

        ursula was silent after this outburst she was furious she wanted to poke a hole into them both

        it isnt a word of it true of all this harangue you have made me she replied flatly the horse is a picture of your own stock stupid brutality and the girl was a girl you loved and tortured and then ignored

        he looked up at her with a small smile of contempt in his eyes he would not trouble to answer this last charge

        gudrun too was silent in exasperated contempt ursula was such an insufferable outsider rushing in where angels would fear to tread but then—fools must be suffered if not gladly

        but ursula was persistent too

        as for your world of art and your world of reality she replied you have to separate the two because you cant bear to know what you are you cant bear to realise what a stock stiff hidebound brutality you are really so you say its the world of art the world of art is only the truth about the real world thats all—but you are too far gone to see it

        she was white and trembling intent gudrun and loerke sat in stiff dislike of her gerald too who had come up in the beginning of the speech stood looking at her in complete disapproval and opposition he felt she was undignified she put a sort of vulgarity over the esotericism which gave man his last distinction he joined his forces with the other two they all three wanted her to go away but she sat on in silence her soul weeping throbbing violently her fingers twisting her handkerchief

        the others maintained a dead silence letting the display of ursulas obtrusiveness pass by then gudrun asked in a voice that was quite cool and casual as if resuming a casual conversation

        was the girl a model

        nein sie war kein modell sie war eine kleine malschulerin

        an artstudent replied gudrun

        and how the situation revealed itself to her she saw the girl artstudent unformed and of pernicious recklessness too young her straight flaxen hair cut short hanging just into her neck curving inwards slightly because it was rather thick and loerke the wellknown mastersculptor and the girl probably wellbroughtup and of good family thinking herself so great to be his mistress oh how well she knew the common callousness of it all dresden paris or london what did it matter she knew it

        where is she now ursula asked

        loerke raised his shoulders to convey his complete ignorance and indifference

        that is already six years ago he said she will be twentythree years old no more good

        gerald had picked up the picture and was looking at it it attracted him also he saw on the pedestal that the piece was called lady godiva

        but this isnt lady godiva he said smiling goodhumouredly she was the middleaged wife of some earl or other who covered herself with her long hair

        a la maud allan said gudrun with a mocking grimace

        why maud allan he replied isnt it so i always thought the legend was that

        yes gerald dear im quite sure youve got the legend perfectly

        she was laughing at him with a little mockcaressive contempt

        to be sure id rather see the woman than the hair he laughed in return

        wouldnt you just mocked gudrun

        ursula rose and went away leaving the three together

        gudrun took the picture again from gerald and sat looking at it closely

        of course she said turning to tease loerke now you understood your little malschulerin

        he raised his eyebrows and his shoulders in a complacent shrug

        the little girl asked gerald pointing to the figure

        gudrun was sitting with the picture in her lap she looked up at gerald full into his eyes so that he seemed to be blinded

        didnt he understand her she said to gerald in a slightly mocking humorous playfulness youve only to look at the feet—arent they darling so pretty and tender—oh theyre really wonderful they are really—

        she lifted her eyes slowly with a hot flaming look into loerkes eyes his soul was filled with her burning recognition he seemed to grow more uppish and lordly

        gerald looked at the small sculptured feet they were turned together half covering each other in pathetic shyness and fear he looked at them a long time fascinated then in some pain he put the picture away from him he felt full of barrenness

        what was her name gudrun asked loerke

        annette von weck loerke replied reminiscent ja sie war hubsch she was pretty—but she was tiresome she was a nuisance—not for a minute would she keep still—not until id slapped her hard and made her cry—then shed sit for five minutes

        he was thinking over the work his work the all important to him

        did you really slap her asked gudrun coolly

        he glanced back at her reading her challenge

        yes i did he said nonchalant harder than i have ever beat anything in my life i had to i had to it was the only way i got the work done

        gudrun watched him with large darkfilled eyes for some moments she seemed to be considering his very soul then she looked down in silence

        why did you have such a young godiva then asked gerald she is so small besides on the horse—not big enough for it—such a child

        a queer spasm went over loerkes face

        yes he said i dont like them any bigger any older then they are beautiful at sixteen seventeen eighteen—after that they are no use to me

        there was a moments pause

        why not asked gerald

        loerke shrugged his shoulders

        i dont find them interesting—or beautiful—they are no good to me for my work

        do you mean to say a woman isnt beautiful after she is twenty asked gerald

        for me no before twenty she is small and fresh and tender and slight after that—let her be what she likes she has nothing for me the venus of milo is a bourgeoise—so are they all

        and you dont care for women at all after twenty asked gerald

        they are no good to me they are of no use in my art loerke repeated impatiently i dont find them beautiful

        you are an epicure said gerald with a slight sarcastic laugh

        and what about men asked gudrun suddenly

        yes they are good at all ages replied loerke a man should be big and powerful—whether he is old or young is of no account so he has the size something of massiveness and—and stupid form

        ursula went out alone into the world of pure new snow but the dazzling whiteness seemed to beat upon her till it hurt her she felt the cold was slowly strangling her soul her head felt dazed and numb

        suddenly she wanted to go away it occurred to her like a miracle that she might go away into another world she had felt so doomed up here in the eternal snow as if there were no beyond

        now suddenly as by a miracle she remembered that away beyond below her lay the dark fruitful earth that towards the south there were stretches of land dark with orange trees and cypress grey with olives that ilex trees lifted wonderful plumy tufts in shadow against a blue sky miracle of miracles—this utterly silent frozen world of the mountaintops was not universal one might leave it and have done with it one might go away

        she wanted to realise the miracle at once she wanted at this instant to have done with the snowworld the terrible static icebuilt mountain tops she wanted to see the dark earth to smell its earthy fecundity to see the patient wintry vegetation to feel the sunshine touch a response in the buds

        she went back gladly to the house full of hope birkin was reading lying in bed

        rupert she said bursting in on him i want to go away

        he looked up at her slowly

        do you he replied mildly

        she sat by him und put her arms round his neck it surprised her that he was so little surprised

        dont you she asked troubled

        i hadnt thought about it he said but im sure i do

        she sat up suddenly erect

        i hate it she said i hate the snow and the unnaturalness of it the unnatural light it throws on everybody the ghastly glamour the unnatural feelings it makes everybody have

        he lay still and laughed meditating

        well he said we can go away—we can go tomorrow well go tomorrow to verona and find romeo and juliet and sit in the amphitheatre—shall we

        suddenly she hid her face against his shoulder with perplexity and shyness he lay so untrammelled

        yes she said softly filled with relief she felt her soul had new wings now he was so uncaring i shall love to be romeo and juliet she said my love

        though a fearfully cold wind blows in verona he said from out of the alps we shall have the smell of the snow in our noses

        she sat up and looked at him

        are you glad to go she asked troubled

        his eyes were inscrutable and laughing she hid her face against his neck clinging close to him pleading

        dont laugh at me—dont laugh at me

        why hows that he laughed putting his arms round her

        because i dont want to be laughed at she whispered

        he laughed more as he kissed her delicate finely perfumed hair

        do you love me she whispered in wild seriousness

        yes he answered laughing

        suddenly she lifted her mouth to be kissed her lips were taut and quivering and strenuous his were soft deep and delicate he waited a few moments in the kiss then a shade of sadness went over his soul

        your mouth is so hard he said in faint reproach

        and yours is so soft and nice she said gladly

        but why do you always grip your lips he asked regretful

        never mind she said swiftly it is my way

        she knew he loved her she was sure of him yet she could not let go a certain hold over herself she could not bear him to question her she gave herself up in delight to being loved by him she knew that in spite of his joy when she abandoned herself he was a little bit saddened too she could give herself up to his activity but she could not be herself she dared not come forth quite nakedly to his nakedness abandoning all adjustment lapsing in pure faith with him she abandoned herself to him or she took hold of him and gathered her joy of him and she enjoyed him fully but they were never quite together at the same moment one was always a little left out nevertheless she was glad in hope glorious and free full of life and liberty and he was still and soft and patient for the time

        they made their preparations to leave the next day first they went to gudruns room where she and gerald were just dressed ready for the evening indoors

        prune said ursula i think we shall go away tomorrow i cant stand the snow any more it hurts my skin and my soul

        does it really hurt your soul ursula asked gudrun in some surprise i can believe quite it hurts your skin—it is terrible but i thought it was admirable for the soul

        no not for mine it just injures it said ursula

        really cried gudrun

        there was a silence in the room and ursula and birkin could feel that gudrun and gerald were relieved by their going

        you will go south said gerald a little ring of uneasiness in his voice

        yes said birkin turning away there was a queer indefinable hostility between the two men lately birkin was on the whole dim and indifferent drifting along in a dim easy flow unnoticing and patient since he came abroad whilst gerald on the other hand was intense and gripped into white light agonistes the two men revoked one another

        gerald and gudrun were very kind to the two who were departing solicitous for their welfare as if they were two children gudrun came to ursulas bedroom with three pairs of the coloured stockings for which she was notorious and she threw them on the bed but these were thick silk stockings vermilion cornflower blue and grey bought in paris the grey ones were knitted seamless and heavy ursula was in raptures she knew gudrun must be feeling very loving to give away such treasures

        i cant take them from you prune she cried i cant possibly deprive you of them—the jewels

        arent they jewels cried gudrun eyeing her gifts with an envious eye arent they real lambs

        yes you must keep them said ursula

        i dont want them ive got three more pairs i want you to keep them—i want you to have them theyre yours there—

        and with trembling excited hands she put the coveted stockings under ursulas pillow

        one gets the greatest joy of all out of really lovely stockings said ursula

        one does replied gudrun the greatest joy of all

        and she sat down in the chair it was evident she had come for a last talk ursula not knowing what she wanted waited in silence

        do you feel ursula gudrun began rather sceptically that you are goingawayforever nevertoreturn sort of thing

        oh we shall come back said ursula it isnt a question of trainjourneys

        yes i know but spiritually so to speak you are going away from us all

        ursula quivered

        i dont know a bit what is going to happen she said i only know we are going somewhere

        gudrun waited

        and you are glad she asked

        ursula meditated for a moment

        i believe i am very glad she replied

        but gudrun read the unconscious brightness on her sisters face rather than the uncertain tones of her speech

        but dont you think youll want the old connection with the world—father and the rest of us and all that it means england and the world of thought—dont you think youll need that really to make a world

        ursula was silent trying to imagine

        i think she said at length involuntarily that rupert is right—one wants a new space to be in and one falls away from the old

        gudrun watched her sister with impassive face and steady eyes

        one wants a new space to be in i quite agree she said but i think that a new world is a development from this world and that to isolate oneself with one other person isnt to find a new world at all but only to secure oneself in ones illusions

        ursula looked out of the window in her soul she began to wrestle and she was frightened she was always frightened of words because she knew that mere wordforce could always make her believe what she did not believe

        perhaps she said full of mistrust of herself and everybody but she added i do think that one cant have anything new whilst one cares for the old—do you know what i mean—even fighting the old is belonging to it i know one is tempted to stop with the world just to fight it but then it isnt worth it

        gudrun considered herself

        yes she said in a way one is of the world if one lives in it but isnt it really an illusion to think you can get out of it after all a cottage in the abruzzi or wherever it may be isnt a new world no the only thing to do with the world is to see it through

        ursula looked away she was so frightened of argument

        but there can be something else cant there she said one can see it through in ones soul long enough before it sees itself through in actuality and then when one has seen ones soul one is something else

        can one see it through in ones soul asked gudrun if you mean that you can see to the end of what will happen i dont agree i really cant agree and anyhow you cant suddenly fly off on to a new planet because you think you can see to the end of this

        ursula suddenly straightened herself

        yes she said yes—one knows one has no more connections here one has a sort of other self that belongs to a new planet not to this youve got to hop off

        gudrun reflected for a few moments then a smile of ridicule almost of contempt came over her face

        and what will happen when you find yourself in space she cried in derision after all the great ideas of the world are the same there you above everybody cant get away from the fact that love for instance is the supreme thing in space as well as on earth

        no said ursula it isnt love is too human and little i believe in something inhuman of which love is only a little part i believe what we must fulfil comes out of the unknown to us and it is something infinitely more than love it isnt so merely human

        gudrun looked at ursula with steady balancing eyes she admired and despised her sister so much both then suddenly she averted her face saying coldly uglily

        well ive got no further than love yet

        over ursulas mind flashed the thought because you never have loved you cant get beyond it

        gudrun rose came over to ursula and put her arm round her neck

        go and find your new world dear she said her voice clanging with false benignity after all the happiest voyage is the quest of ruperts blessed isles

        her arm rested round ursulas neck her fingers on ursulas cheek for a few moments ursula was supremely uncomfortable meanwhile there was an insult in gudruns protective patronage that was really too hurting feeling her sisters resistance gudrun drew awkwardly away turned over the pillow and disclosed the stockings again

        ha—ha she laughed rather hollowly how we do talk indeed—new worlds and old—

        and they passed to the familiar worldly subjects

        gerald and birkin had walked on ahead waiting for the sledge to overtake them conveying the departing guests

        how much longer will you stay here asked birkin glancing up at geralds very red almost blank face

        oh i cant say gerald replied till we get tired of it

        youre not afraid of the snow melting first asked birkin

        gerald laughed

        does it melt he said

        things are all right with you then said birkin

        gerald screwed up his eyes a little

        all right he said i never know what those common words mean all right and all wrong dont they become synonymous somewhere

        yes i suppose how about going back asked birkin

        oh i dont know we may never get back i dont look before and after said gerald

        nor pine for what is not said birkin

        gerald looked into the distance with the smallpupilled abstract eyes of a hawk

        no theres something final about this and gudrun seems like the end to me i dont know—but she seems so soft her skin like silk her arms heavy and soft and it withers my consciousness somehow it burns the pith of my mind he went on a few paces staring ahead his eyes fixed looking like a mask used in ghastly religions of the barbarians it blasts your souls eye he said and leaves you sightless yet you want to be sightless you want to be blasted you dont want it any different

        he was speaking as if in a trance verbal and blank then suddenly he braced himself up with a kind of rhapsody and looked at birkin with vindictive cowed eyes saying

        do you know what it is to suffer when you are with a woman shes so beautiful so perfect you find her so good it tears you like a silk and every stroke and bit cuts hot—ha that perfection when you blast yourself you blast yourself and then— he stopped on the snow and suddenly opened his clenched hands—its nothing—your brain might have gone charred as rags—and— he looked round into the air with a queer histrionic movement its blasting—you understand what i mean—it is a great experience something final—and then—youre shrivelled as if struck by electricity he walked on in silence it seemed like bragging but like a man in extremity bragging truthfully

        of course he resumed i wouldnt not have had it its a complete experience and shes a wonderful woman but—how i hate her somewhere its curious—

        birkin looked at him at his strange scarcely conscious face gerald seemed blank before his own words

        but youve had enough now said birkin you have had your experience why work on an old wound

        oh said gerald i dont know its not finished—

        and the two walked on

        ive loved you as well as gudrun dont forget said birkin bitterly gerald looked at him strangely abstractedly

        have you he said with icy scepticism or do you think you have he was hardly responsible for what he said

        the sledge came gudrun dismounted and they all made their farewell they wanted to go apart all of them birkin took his place and the sledge drove away leaving gudrun and gerald standing on the snow waving something froze birkins heart seeing them standing there in the isolation of the snow growing smaller and more isolated
