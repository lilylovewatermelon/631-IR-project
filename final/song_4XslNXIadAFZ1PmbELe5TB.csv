i cant really go off right now nigga im in quarantine
im really in the market baby we could go to dover street
we can go to isolation where it get like four degrees

my life is a movie you not ready for that clip
my niggas they applaud and they applaud and they clap shit
and if its not bout dollars then you really dont make sense
and if you talkin’ money then lil’ bitch we can make friends
you holdin yourself back surrounded by fake friends
they just want you for payments
and they gon’ keep grabbin plates if you sneakin that cake in it makes sense
