daydreamin bout slidin in that bentley door
cuban chain tucked in so the backll show
whip it out in front of chicks they react to dough

pass the heineken youre not a crist fan
ice is the tightest broads breakin they neck and catchin arthritis
to bag a ghetto midas
jeans saggin down uh with the michael vick jersey
the white on whites from uptown
wifebeater underneath
if its totally necessary some gold teeth its on you
pull up to the club real slow leanin back on the cell

argue on the phone uh glance at the chrome yea
hand on your waist just in case its on
fully prepared to go to war til the break of dawn
slid a twenty to the bouncer hold down the car
rollin up  to rush into the bar
its a simple recipe ice
shine equals free p
mad birds in the jumpoff uh lookin thirsty
hot and broke daddy have mercy
she want prada the pearl of drawers
the new fendi mink so she can act stink
the camouflage pumas with the crystal stripes
the mz gatrak joints to keep her weave tight
one clown tried to throw your vibe off all night
not knowin that you 20 deep and you aight
