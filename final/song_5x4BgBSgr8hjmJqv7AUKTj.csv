im gon need you to raise your glass
i dont care what you put in it
heres to nights that you cant take back
we live hard but we love to laugh
we all thought that wed get rich fast
hop the plane out for greener grass
found out the greenest cash
dont compare to the friends that last

prechorus
see we wont forget where we came from
the city wont change us
we beat to the same drum
no we wont forget where we came from
the city cant change us
we beat to the same drum the same drum
