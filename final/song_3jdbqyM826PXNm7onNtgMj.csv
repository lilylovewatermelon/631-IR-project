i can hear the bells
well dont you hear em chime
cant you feel my heartbeat keeping perfect time
and all because he

touched me he looked at me and stared
yes he bumped me my heart was unprepared
when he tapped me and knocked me off my feet
one little touch now my lifes complete
cause when he nudged me love put me in a fix
yes it hit me just like a ton of bricks
yes my heart burst now i know what lifes about
one little touch and loves knocked me out

and i can hear the bells my head is spinning
i can hear the bells somethings beginning
everybody says that a girl who looks like me
cant win his love well just wait and see
cause i can hear the bells just hear them chiming
i can hear the bells my temperatures climbing
i cant contain my joy
cause i finally found the boy ive been missin
listen i can hear the bells

round one hell ask me on a date
and then round two ill primp but wont be late
because round threes when we kiss inside his car
wont go all the way but ill go pretty far
round four hell ask me for my hand
and then round five well book the wedding band
so by round six amber much to your surprise
this heavyweight champion takes the prize
you might also likeand i can hear the bells my ears are ringing
i can hear the bells the bridesmaids are singing
everybody says that a guy whos such a gem
wont look my way well the laughs on them
cause i can hear the bells my father will smile
i can hear the bells as he walks me down the aisle
my mother starts to cry
but i cant see cause link and i are french kissin
listen i can hear the bells

i can hear the bells my head is reeling
i can hear the bells i cant stop the pealing
everybody warns that he wont like what hell see
but i know that hell look inside of me yeah
i can hear the bells todays just the start cause
i can hear the bells and til death do us part
and even when we die well look down from up above
remembering the night that we two fell in love
we both will shed a tear
and hell whisper as were reminiscin
listen i can hear the bells we can hear the bells
i can hear the bells we can hear the bells
i can hear the bells2embed"
