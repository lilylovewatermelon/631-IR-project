i got a dog and my dog can dance
just not in public and not with my friends
i got a girl and shes twentyeight
now im the coolest guy in all of eighth grade
i know a kid that youve never met
his dad is a rock star we smoked in his van
i know a trick do you wanna see
i can be anything that i pretend to be

chorus
well get out of this well get out of this too
im not proud of this but im not proud of the truth
and if you run from me
then ill use my trick on you
the truth is that im screwed

verse 2
i went to france and danced in the rain
then told you all about it on our first date
my dad doesnt lie so you cant meet my dad
cause you fell in love with the me that went to france

chorus
well get out of this well get out of this too
im not proud of this but im not proud of the truth
and if you run from me
then ill use my trick on you
the truth is that were screwed
see ajr liveget tickets as low as 10you might also likeoutro
well get out of this cause i love you i do
well get out of this cause i love you its true
but if youre doubting this
if youre doubting that i do
