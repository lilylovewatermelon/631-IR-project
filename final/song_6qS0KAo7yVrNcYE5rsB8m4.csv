drop
they thought it was done dawg
but hes back bigger better stronger and free
like i aint fought my way off these motherfucking situations
trust this

verse 1 pitbull
im here to remind you just in case you forgot
mr 305 no label stay hot
38 choppers but please no glock
used to move work but had no trap no block no spot
ma was cool with the work but no rocks
until she found my first nickel ruff bag
said i had enough of this shit with your dad
so she told me to get the fuck out the pad
i was out to my first baby mamas crib
caught her fuckin round off to abuelas crib
thank god for music my savior
thats what helped me fight xavier
dont believe these rappers and what they play ya
i wanna be owner fuck a playa
shit better say it
i am an owner bitch

chorus avery storm  pitbull

city on my back and i wont surrender
let em know now that they gon remember
they dont know what i got into
they dont know everything i been through
they dont know what it takes to get through
they dont know they dont know
