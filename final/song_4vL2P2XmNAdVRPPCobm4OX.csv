in a book in a box in the closet
in a line in a song i once heard
in a moment on a front porch late one june
in a breath inside a whisper beneath the moon
there it was at the tip of my fingers
there it was on the tip of my tongue
there you were and i had never been that far
there it was the whole world wrapped inside my arms
and i let it all slip away

chorus
what do i do now that youre gone
no back up plan no second chance
and no one else to blame
all i can hear in the silence that remains
are the words i couldnt say

verse 2
theres a rain thatll never stop fallin
theres a wall that ive tried to take down
what i should have said just wouldnt pass my lips
so i held back and now weve come to this
and its too late now

chorus
what do i do now that youre gone
no back up plan no second chance
and no one else to blame
all i can hear in the silence that remains
are the words i couldnt say
are the words i couldnt say

i should have found a way to tell you how i felt
now the only one i’m tellin’ is myself

chorus
what do i do now that youre gone
no back up plan no second chance
and no one else to blame
all i can hear in the silence that remains
are the words i couldnt say what do i do

what do i do now that youre gone
what do i say no second chance
and no one else to blame
all i can hear in the silence that remains
are the words i couldnt say2embed"
