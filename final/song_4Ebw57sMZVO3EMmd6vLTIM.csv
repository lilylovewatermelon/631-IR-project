when i first got to nashville town
they called me in and sat me down
and told me all about the ins and outs of writing songs
said write about the things you know about
if theres anything that you dont know about
just stick around and youll find out before too long

verse 2
so i pulled out my guitar and i put my pen to paper
started working on the groove
they could move to all night long
yeah i poured out my heart soul
strummed a chord next thing you know
i looked down and i had this song

chorus
and it goes
jesus saves and beers better cold
a good womans made to love not just to hold
monday through friday sure takes awhile
we all get sideways and go that extra mile
the common ways we work and play
are still alive and well today
dont need to find a new way to say
we dont go out of style
see jon pardi liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likeverse 2
it may never see a bullet
in a billboard magazine
but then ive never been the kind
to go out chasing smoking guns
all i know is all of us tonight
know all the words and were acting like
itll be a week before the weekends done

chorus
singing jesus saves and beers better cold
a good womans made to love not just to hold
monday through friday sure takes awhile
we all get sideways and go that extra mile
the common ways we work and play
are still alive and well today
dont need to find a new way to say
we dont go out of style

chorus
singing jesus saves and beers better cold
a good womans made to love not just to hold
monday through friday sure takes awhile
we all get sideways and go that extra mile
the common ways we work and play
are still alive and well today
dont need to find a new way to say
we dont go out of style
spoken outro
aint going out of style
yeah no
get me one of those cold beersembed"
