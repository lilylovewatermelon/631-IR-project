if we dont watch the sun it will rise
if we dont take our time its not wise
putting posters up for your band
hey were playing a gig tonight if you wanna come by
now ill tear them down with my hand

prechorus
i didnt want to notice
didnt know the gun was loaded
didnt really know this
what kind of asshole drives a lotus

chorus
come here and go get with me
i wanna see you wednesday
come on come on come over
take it off your shoulder
come on and pull me over
we gotta get to work now
sliding it off your shoulder
as were falling over

you did it alone you did it for fun
you did it for everyone whos on the run
youre not just a friend youre me born again
well be in this race until the very end
he lives on the phone he cheats on his clone
youll never believe me til youre on your own
outro
comes in once a month
and he never leaves
he said he is broken
that theyre lost friends
didnt wanna floor ya
i didnt wanna be there for ya
didnt wanna warn ya
ill be there25embed"
