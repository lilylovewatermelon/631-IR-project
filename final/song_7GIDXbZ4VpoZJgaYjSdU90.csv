lunch up in a diner if ya act right we dine in the bahamas
now whoa lil mama im a gangsta

oh my god you caught my eyes like from twenty yards
you so damn fine

but the way you look tonight i just might take a bite
come closer feel that
its a woman and a man and a latex
out the shower hotel flowers on the bed
choice of wine white or red
what more can i say
