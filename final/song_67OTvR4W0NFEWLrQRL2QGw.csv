if shame had a face i think it would kind of look like mine
if it had a home would it be my eyes
would you believe me if i said im tired of this
well here we go now one more time

prechorus
i tried to climb your steps i tried to chase you down
i tried to see how low i could get down to the ground
i tried to earn my way i tried to tame this mind
you better believe that i tried to beat this

chorus
so when will this end it goes on and on
over and over and over again
keep spinning around i know that it wont stop
until i step down from this for good

verse 2
i never thought id end up here
never thought id be standing where i am
i guess i kind of thought it would be easier than this
i guess i was wrong now one more time

prechorus
i tried to climb your steps i tried to chase you down
i tried to see how low i could get down to the ground
i tried to earn my way i tried to tame this mind
you better believe that i tried to beat this
