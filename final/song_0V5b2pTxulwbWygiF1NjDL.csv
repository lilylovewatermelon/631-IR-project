this is a song about the innocence lost

verse 1
oh girl i dont know all the reasons why
i found the answer lookin in your eye
i go out walkin all day long
take away this lonely man soon he will be gone

chorus
cause ill tell you everything about livin free
yes i can see you girl can you see me

verse 2
you dont need to know what i do all day
its as much as i know watch it waste away

chorus
cause ill tell you everything about livin free
yes i can see you girl can you asee me

bridge
and go and see the sorcerer look into the ball
you may find the answer written on the wall
