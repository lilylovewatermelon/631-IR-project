and we both feel sorry sometimes its okay to feel sorry sometimes

verse 1
you been canceled come see the exit
save face for the broken
had you last threw you back took your heart and wrecked it
all pain no emotion
grab em by the neck dont let go
baby keem been top five what you smokin
i could put a wish on her tippy toes
no more opinions im done bein open
i need one hand in the air for the switch you dont
two hand in the air for a nigga you dont
three hand in the air
four for the man in the mirror
and i wont make it official
i just hope we confidential
back and forth in a rental
