when i was younger i used to be wild
as wild as an elephants child
no one could hold me down
no one could keep me around
now its your turn take a shot
baby show me everything that you got
maybe you can keep me alive
maybe you can get in my mind
but its only a matter of time

chorus
before i run far away
i need to take a holiday
maybe its a fall from grace
i gotta find a new place
a holiday
ill set off on a new chase
i gotta see a new face
i need to take a holiday

verse 2
my father he was always wise
as wise as an elephants eyes
he couldnt hold me down
he couldnt keep me around
so are you gonna take your shot
its the only one that you got
maybe ill go out on a limb
maybe ill jump in for a swim
when the lights go dim
see boys like girls liveget tickets as low as 77you might also likechorus
you know ill run far away
i need to take a holiday
maybe its a fall from grace
i gotta find a new place
a holiday
ill set off on a new chase
i gotta see a new face
i need to take a holiday
need to take a holiday
whoa whoa whoa whoa

bridge
a new start
ive broken too many hearts
and i dont have any clue where to go
i dont know
but maybe ill be back someday after my holiday

verse 3
when i was younger i used to be wild
as wild as an elephants child
and i dont think ill ever change
i think im gonna stay the same

chorus
ill run away
i need to take a holiday need to take a holiday
maybe its a fall from grace
i gotta find a new place
a holiday
ill set off on a new chase set off on a new chase
i gotta see a new face
i need to take a holiday
outro
a new start
ive broken too many hearts
and i dont have any clue where to go
i dont know
but maybe ill be back someday after my holiday
all of the wasted time
the hours that were left behind
the answers that well never find
they dont mean a thing tonightembed"
