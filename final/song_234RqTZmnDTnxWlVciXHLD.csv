and i cant deal with that
i try to see the good in life
but good things in life are hard to find
well blow it away blow it away

cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
this love is killing me but youre the only one

ive taken all i could take
and i cannot wait
were wasting too much time
being strong holding on
