back when you oh when you were my darlin i
i didnt mind to lose a little sleep i
i didnt mind to do a little walkin
my reputation never meant that much to me

prechorus
and how do i find that old familiar feeling
the one that carried me so many years ago
when fun was dominos and sevenup and seagrams
well things were simple then just movin nice and slow
aint it strange
well aint it strange

chorus
well i had no clue id be the boy who
your mama warned you about
well i had no clue id be the boy who
your mama warned you about

verse 2
well that old scene is always coming to me i
i see you standing with your husband and your child
and youre a picture of strength and grace and beauty
and me im just a fool in a supermarket aisle
see turnpike troubadours liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeprechorus
well i well i know hello would surely end up awkward
i never had the knack for talkin anyway
and youre not the kind for bendin over backwards
smile and turn my shopping cart around and walk away
and aint it strange
well aint it strange

chorus
well i had no clue id be the boy who
your mama warned you about
well i had no clue id be the boy who
your mama warned you about

instrument break

bridge
well aint it strange how well i knew you back when i was seventeen
and loving you was easy babe but i was just a child
and these days you aint nothin just an interstate daydream
folks were sleepin and we were runnin wild

prechorus
and i still do my share of sleepin on the floor
im not sure if anybody knows me anymore
chorus
well i had no clue id be the boy who
your mama warned you about
well i had no clue id be the boy who
your mama warned you aboutembed"
