how long can i survive with this mentality
how long can i survive with this mentality
things fall down but don’t stop now
oh can’t stop now
oh won’t stop now

verse
trials and tribulations im facing
in this age of information i hate this shit
cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
damn it wont be long fore i disappear
damn it wont be long fore i disappear
damn it wont be long fore i disappear
damn it wont be long fore i disappear
you call it runnin i call it escapin
start a new life in a foreign location
similar to my niggas duckin cases
cant take the possible time that he faces

chorus
how long can i survive with this mentality
how long can i survive with this mentality
things fall down but don’t stop now
oh can’t stop now
oh won’t stop now
