to get up and walk away would be too easy
so stay and stand your ground just watch your mouth with me
on the back of every right theres a wrong looming
so here you and i should tread as soft as these razor blades for boots will let be

chorus
have you ever tried to step in my shoes
have you ever tried to balance that beam
and if you ever tried to fit in my shoes
theyll never be quite as soft as they seemed

verse 2
thought unabashed honesty would be ideal
but a prophet did once say that honesty is a lonely word
so where do we go from here abandon ship now
my problem is you made me melt and i dont want to be frozen anymore

chorus
have you ever tried to step in my shoes
have you ever tried to balance that beam
and if you ever tried to fit in my shoes
theyll never be quite as soft as they seemed

bridge

have you ever tried to step in my shoes
have you ever tried to balance that beam
and if you ever tried to fit in my shoes
theyll never be quite as soft as they seemed4embed"
