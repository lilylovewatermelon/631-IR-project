weve been burnin both ends
keepin the lights on
so ive been thinkin we need
a little time alone

prechorus
so what you say we cancel our plans
tonight im only gonna be your man

chorus
lets get some candles burning
and some records turning
all the lights down low
take it nice and slow
the way your bodys moving
keep doing what youre doing to me all night long
writin our love song
girl i want it gotta have it
let the passion take us to a higher place
makin the kind of love we make

verse 2
there aint no way baby
to get me out this house
when you look this good

besides turn around and lockin the door
watching your red dress fall to the floor

chorus
lets get some candles burning
and some records turning
all the lights down low

the way your bodys moving
keep doing what youre doing to me all night long
writin our love song
girl i want it gotta have it
let the passion take us to a higher place
makin the kind of love we make
