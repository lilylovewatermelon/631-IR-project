i saw this angel ooh
i really saw an angel ooh ooh
hey hey
ooh ooh ooh ooh

verse 1
open up your eyes shut your mouth and see
that im still the only one whos been in love with me
im just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
and theres nothing i can do about it
broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
i got splinters in my knuckles crawling cross the floor
couldnt take you home to mother in a skirt that short
but i think thats what i like about it

chorus
shes an angel ooh only angel ooh
shes an angel ooh my only angel ooh

verse 2
i must admit i thought id like to make you mine
as i went about my business through the warning signs
end up meetin in the hallway every single time
and theres nothin we can do about it
told it to her brother and she told it to me
that shes gonna be an angel just you wait and see
when it turns out shes a devil in between the sheets
and theres nothing she can do about it hey hey
