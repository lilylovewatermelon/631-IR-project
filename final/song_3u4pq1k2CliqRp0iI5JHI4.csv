people say im no good
write me off oh yes they should
fuck em theyre just sick in the head
theyre writing my history
think somebody shouldve asked me
everyone was safe in their beds
their beds
and i said

verse 2
i wont live wont live like them
everyone theyre all seeing red
i dont know if its alright with you
but ill be gone a ghost will be here in my stead
my stead
and i said

verse 3
i cant live life underneath it all
everyone is older now and gone
i will not be here forever dear
so lets just make this count a lot in hereyou might also like2embed"
