oh danny boy the pipes the pipes are calling
from glen to glen and down the mountain side
the summers gone and all the roses fallin
its you its you must go and i must bide
but come yet back when summers in the meadow
or when the valleys hushed and white with snow
ill be here in sunshine or in shadow
oh danny boy oh danny boy i love you so
but if you come when all the flowers are dying
and i am dead as dead i well may be
youll come and find the place where i am lying
and kneel and say an ave there for me
and i will know though soft you tread above me
and then my grave will richer sweeter be
and youll bend down and tell me that you love me
and i will rest in peace until you come to meyou might also like2embed"
