uh no ive never done this before
never wanna do this again
wrong turn on a dusty road
i did it to myself i cant pretend
well i learned just a little too late
good god i must have been blind
cause she got me for everything
everything everything alright
like my daddy im a gamblin man
never been afraid to roll the dice
but when i put my bet on her
little miss snake eyes ruined my life
she better sleep with one eye open
better make sure to lock her doors
cause once i get my hands on her ima ooh

chorus

she ran away with all my money
and she did it for fun
