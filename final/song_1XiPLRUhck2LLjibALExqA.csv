pulling into the fast lane on the leaving side of town
just me and the dreams ive left undone
theres a whole lot of roads i can point this chevy down
but i can only think of one

chorus
on this river of concrete slab a man could drive for days
and let his imagination run
theres time for a million memories along the way
but i can only think of one oh i can only think of one

verse 2
summer down in galveston underneath the stars
a fire burning on the sand raging in our hearts
if theres a time in my whole life ive really been in love
i can only i can only i can only think of one
im not going to back til im back to where you are
to undo the damage thats been done
there may be a hundred ways to mend this broken heart
but i can only think of one oh i can only think of one
