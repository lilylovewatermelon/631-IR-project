think somethings broken then again nothing’s smoking
or shaking or choking like my old truck
but i think somethings broken
and i think its worth noting
it started about the time
she got all packed up

chorus
could be my ego could be my pride
could be my calm cool collective side
maybe my hearts coming eye to eye
with the truth she wasnt joking

verse 2
think somethings broken
cause im just laying round hoping
that maybe any moment
ill get on track
but i think somethings broken
all locked up or frozen cause i cant go forward and i sure cant go back

chorus
could be my ego could be my pride
could be my calm cool collective side
maybe my hearts coming eye to eye
with the truth she wasnt joking
see tim mcgraw liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likebridge
think its my heart
coming eye to eye
with the truth
she wasnt joking

verse 3
i know somethings broken
cause i just started smoking
and shaking and choking
like my old truckembed"
