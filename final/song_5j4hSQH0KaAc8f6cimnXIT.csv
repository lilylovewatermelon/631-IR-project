honey load up your questions
and pick up your sticks and your stones
and pretend im a shelter
for heartaches that dont have a home

prechorus
and choose the words that cut like a razor
and all that ill say is

chorus
fire away
take your best shot
show me what you got
honey im not afraid
rear back and take aim
and fire away

verse 2
well i wish i could say
that ive never been here before
but you know and i know
that ill always come back for more

prechorus
your love might be my damnation
but ill cry to my grave

and fire away
