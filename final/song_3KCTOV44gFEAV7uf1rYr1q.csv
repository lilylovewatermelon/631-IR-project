yeah

verse 1
stand in line behind me
weve got tons of time to
let it all hang out
cast the demons out

verse 2
once were in the roof falls
i heard that we have got to raise it up
and let the fucker burn

hook
and this is sure to take awhile
cause if were going out were going out with style
so we all jump around
and we fall to the ground
like its the last rock show
of our lives
yowzasee bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likeembed"
