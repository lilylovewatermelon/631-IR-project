yeah i guess im a disappointment doin everything i can
i dont wanna make you disappointed its annoying
i just wanna make you feel like everything i ever do
was never tryna make an issue for you but i guess the more you
thought about everything you were never even wrong
in the first place right yeah ima just ignore you
walking towards you with my head down
lookin at the ground im embarrassed for you
paranoia what did i do wrong this time
thats parents for you
very loyal shoulda had my back
but you put a knife in it´ my hands are full
what else should i carry for you

yeah you dont wanna make this work
you just wanna make this worse
want me to listen to you but you dont ever hear my words
you dont wanna know my hurt yeah
let me guess you want an apology probably
how can we keep going at a rate like this
we cant so i guess ima have to leave
please dont come after me
i just wanna be alone right now i dont really wanna think at all
go ahead just drink it off
both know youre gonna call tomorrow like nothings wrong

i feel like every time i talk to you youre in an awful mood
what else can i offer you
theres nothing left right now i gave it all to you

yeah dont talk down to me
thats not gonna work now
packed all my clothes and i moved out
i dont even wanna go to your house
every time i sit on that couch
i feel like you lecture me eventually i bet that we
coulda made this work
and prolly woulda figured things out
but i guess im a letdown
but its cool i checked out
oh you wanna be friends now
okay lets put my fake face on and pretend now
sit around and talk about the good times that didnt even happen
i mean why are you laughing
must have missed that joke let me see if i can find a reaction
no but at least youre happy
