i love to tell the story
of unseen things above
of jesus and his glory
of jesus and his love
i love to tell the story
because i know tis true
it satisfies my longings
as nothing else can do

chorus
i love to tell the story
twill be my theme in glory
to tell the old old story
of jesus and his love

verse 2
i love to tell the story
for those who know it best
seem hungering and thirsting
to hear it like the rest
and when in scenes of glory
i sing the new new song
twill be the old old story
that i have loved so long
