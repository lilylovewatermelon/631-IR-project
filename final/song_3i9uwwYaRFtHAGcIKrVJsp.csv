i knew i could never hold that girl
she was born to see the world
all i got is a picture she mailed me
barefoot in the snow white sand
a bag of seashells in her hand
she finally found a paradise it seems

chorus
on the coast of somewhere beautiful
trade winds blowing through her hair
sunlight dancing on the water
and i wish i was there
dont know how im gonna find her
all i know so far
shes on the coast of somewhere beautiful
running with my heart

verse 2
sometimes when the sun goes down
shadows fall across this little town
and i close my eyes and i drift away
to another place in another time
when the world was ours and she was mine
i dream of holding her again someday

on the coast of somewhere beautiful
trade winds blowing through her hair
sunlight dancing on the water
and i wish i was there
dont know how im gonna find her
all i know so far
shes on the coast of somewhere beautiful
running with my heart

outro
dont know how im gonna find her
all i know so far
shes on the coast of somewhere beautiful
running with my heart oh
shes running with my heart
on the coast of somewhere beautifulembed"
