itll get in my head a bad way babe
dont let it creep in your mind youll go blind that way
and thats a madness that breaks faith

they say the kingdom of heaven touched down
in an interstate motel lobby
true to the american way the american way
its available only today
americanas crusade for the common mans promised land

kaboom
blowout
everything must go
everything must go
make way for the kingdom come
blowout
everything must go
everything must go
make way for the revolution

they call that holy war in dallas
they send crusaders to reclaim the new jerusalem
they say the queen was born of malice
the queen of babylon and all her sons ascended to the throne
you might also likethey cry for holy war in dallas
they send crusaders out from phoenix to beijing
theyre calling purify the palace the streets
but the temple remains unclean
yea the temple remains unclean

i see it said in your eyes all the time
you aint gotta tell me youre fine babe
they call that holy war in dallas
they call for holy war on us3embed"
