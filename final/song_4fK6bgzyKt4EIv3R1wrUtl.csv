he gives another smile tries to understand her side
to show that he cares
she cant stay in the room
shes consumed with everything thats been going on
she says whatever happens dont let go of my hand

verse 2 michael jackson
everything will be alright he assures her
but she doesnt hear a word that he says
preoccupied shes afraid
afraid what theyve been doings not right
he doesnt know what to say so he prays
whatever whatever whatever

chorus michael jackson
whatever happens dont let go of my hand
see whatever happens dont let go of my hand
whatever happens dont you let go of my hand

guitar solo
dont let go of my hand
dont let go of my hand

verse 3 michael jackson
hes working day and night thinks hell make her happy
forgetting all the dreams that he had
he doesnt realize its not the end of the world
it doesnt have to be that bad
she tries to explain its you that makes me happy
whatever whatever whatever
