the fuck i need with life what the fuck
life is what needed me
they looking around for who
who the fuck wanna save me
yung christ been dodging death
dodging death done became my thing
take my chances with the glock
cock it back and let nina sing
looking out my window
feel my pulse going down
been mixing chemicals trying to find a compound
i dont wanna feel a thing
give me the drugs numb the pain
get away fuck out my face
you want to switch
well heres my place
bitch you can take it
how the fuck does it look from my view
tell me what you thinking
it aint all that it seems when you got to face it huh
save lives daily but i cant save me nah
all that glitters aint gold
aint that the saying fuck

verse 2 george washingtons ar15
ayy ayy ayy ayy
catch me at the cemetery visiting my enemies
gripping the machete glistening its rinsed and ready
reflecting wishes of death
if mine is selected tonight i know the devils sweating
you have until i count to seven to escape he threatened
please bury me under the cherry tree
standing on the floor of my grave pissing on my destiny
rejecting death gasp for breath
my existence theyll be questioning
ruby back from the dead and better than ever
yeah i guess well see
panoramic views of me whipping the panamera
is infinitely better than me dead and gone on nutella interior leather
chain still swanging only now it make my neck hurt
