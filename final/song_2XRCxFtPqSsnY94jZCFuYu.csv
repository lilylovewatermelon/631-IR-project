babe
theres something tragic about you
something so magic about you
dont you agree
babe
theres something lonesome about you
something so wholesome about you
get closer to me

prechorus
no tired sigh no rolling eyes
no irony
no who cares no vacant stare
no time for me

chorus
honey youre familiar like my mirror years ago
idealism sits in prison chivalry fell on his sword
innocence died screaming honey ask me i should know
i slithered here from eden just to sit outside your door

verse 2
babe
theres something wretched about this
something so precious about this
where to begin
babe
theres something broken about this
but i might be hoping about this
oh what a sin

to the strand a picnic planned
for you and me
a rope in hand for your other man
that hang from a tree

chorus
honey youre familiar like my mirror years ago
idealism sits in prison chivalry fell on his sword
innocence died screaming honey ask me i should know
i slithered here from eden just to sit outside your door
instrumental interlude

chorus
honey youre familiar like my mirror years ago
idealism sits in prison chivalry fell on his sword
innocence died screaming honey ask me i should know
i slithered here from eden just to hide outside your door106embed"
