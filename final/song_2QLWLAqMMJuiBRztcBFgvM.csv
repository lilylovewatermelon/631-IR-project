and you know im riding with the toast cheers

verse 3
rerererereporting from another world
magazine full of bullets you can be my cover girl
bless got the weed rolling thicker than a southern girl
strongarm rap like a nigga did a hundred curls
rockstar biatch check out how we rock
and if this aint hiphop it must be kneehop
im higher than a tree top she lick my lollipop
i still get my candy from your girlfriends sweet shop
spitting that heat rock im smooth not pete rock
and my and my money on et cetera three dots
still get a stomach ache every time i see cops
you better run motherfucker cause we not
you better run til your feet stop
you aint even a fucking alphabet in my teapot
colder than a ski shop holding on to the top
and even if i let go i still wont drop

chorus
i am the rhyming oasis
i got a cup of your time i wont waste it
i got my foot on the line im not racing
i thank god that i am not basic
iiii i i am not
