here it comes
the unavoidable sun weighs my head
and what the hell have i done
and you know
i dont remember a thing
i dont remember
a thing

verse 1
so im done
am i placating the notes
should i fault
cut off my tongue
so you say
apparently im digging it in
i cant feel
a thing
a thing a thing a thing a thing
and youve won
so i go bury my head
in the ground
yet i wont lose what i said
in the sound of the words and the note that it brings
no i cant feel
a thing

here it comes
the unavoidable sun of what’s just happened
and what’s been done
and you know
i don’t remember a thing
i don’t remember
a thing

outro
but it keeps on coming and i stop
but it keeps on coming and i just stand still
but it keeps on coming and i stop moving
but it keeps coming it keeps coming it keeps coming
but it keeps on coming and i stop
and it keeps on coming and i just stand still
but it keeps coming it keeps coming it keeps coming
but it keeps on coming and i stop
and it keeps on coming and i just stand still
but it keeps coming and i just stop
so i stop running and i just stop
but it keeps on coming and i just stop moving
but it keeps on coming and it keeps on coming so i just stand still
but it keeps on coming and i just stand still
and i run and i run and i run and i run3embed"
