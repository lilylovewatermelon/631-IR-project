i quit school in the 10th grade and i grew out my hair
i got me a job doing lawnmower repair
i met an army recruiter down at the winndixie
he said son youve no future pack up and go with me

verse 2
the first place we landed was a base called ballad
they convoyed our asses to a 10 acre fob
with my boots and my cover and an old m16
two bottles of water and a cold mre

chorus
oh youll meet lots of new friends and youre sure to get paid
well show you the world and well teach you a trade
its not a job its an adventure oh yes sir i got that
ah but you never told me id get my ass shot at
you never told me id get my ass shot at

verse 3
the first night in combat we went out on patrol
they ambushed our convey and we chased the asshole
we found them all hiding in low water ditches
and we took aim and killed all them son of a bitches

chorus
oh youll meet lots of new friends and youre sure to get paid
well show you the world and well teach you a trade
its not a job its an adventure oh yes sir i got that
ah but you never told me id get my ass shot at
you never told me id get my ass shot at

over here in the desert we grade on the curve
