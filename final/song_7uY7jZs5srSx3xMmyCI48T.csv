i watch the work of my kin bold and boyful
toying somewhere between love and abuse
calling to join them the wretched and joyful
shaking the wings of their terrible youths
freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
no more alone or myself could i be
lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
no shortage of sordid no protest from me

chorus
with her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
shes the angel of small death and the codeine scene
with her strawblonde hair her arms hard and lean
shes the angel of small death and the codeine scene

verse 2
feeling more human and hooked on her flesh
i lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
fresh from the fields all fetor and fertile
its bloody and raw but i swear it is sweet

chorus
with her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
shes the angel of small death and the codeine scene
with her strawblonde hair her arms hard and lean
shes the angel of small death and the codeine scene

oh oh oh

verse 3
in leashless confusion ill wander the concrete
wonder if better now having survived
the jarring of judgement and reasons defeat the sweet
heat of her breath in my mouth im alive

chorus
with her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
shes the angel of small death and the codeine scene
with her strawblonde hair her arms hard and lean
shes the angel of small death and the codeine scene
with her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
shes the angel of small death and the codeine scene
with her strawblonde hair her arms hard and lean
shes the angel of small death and the codeine scene61embed"
