verse 1 kaine
this for my niggas who be fuckin round with them feelings
and you get your heart caught up in a mess
cause you lust just to fuck whats up her dress
and never paid attention
cause you didnt think the girl would start trippin
shawty flip the script
start saying all type of shit out of her lips
ima tell you what i cant stand
when a woman play the role of a man
talkin to a nigga like you got to hold his hand
treat you like a spare like you lack to understand
i know you know that i aint gon go for this jaw jackin all the time
talkin to me out of line broad you done lost your mind
you gon fuck round and get me some time

i need a lil more grip a lil less lip

at the point of no return and you made it that way

hide behind your fake ass grin with your fake ass friend
used to them fake ass men

verse 3 d roc
one day i got shot by cupid
in the midst of this relationship went stupid
we went from talkin on the phone too long
to nowadays your ass aint home
you always call tellin me you out with your friends
but i find out later on you with your other men
then you aint in it for the dividends
say you suck and fuck and you aint gettin nothin
thats a damn shame it ended like this
now i aint got love for ya bitch
shoo fly dont bother me
will i get back with her probably
then i thought about it i wont
do i really want you i dont
the headache i really dont want
so ima leave her alone cause i can do bad on my own
thats why she gone
