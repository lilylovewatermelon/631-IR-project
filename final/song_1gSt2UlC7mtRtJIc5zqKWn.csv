i speak fast and im not gonna repeat myself no
so listen carefully to every word i say
im the only one whos gonna get away
with making excuses today

prechorus
youre appealing to emotions that i simply do not have
blackmailed myself cause i aint got
cause i aint got anyone else
this is a stick up give us all your inspiration
ive got the red carpet blues baby

chorus
so put your hands in the air and dont make a sound
but dont get the wrong idea
were gonna shoot you were gonna shoot you
and theres nothing in your head or pocket throat or wallet
that could change just how this goes no
were gonna shoot you were gonna shoot you whoa

verse 2
when i said that id return to you i meant more like a relapse
now and again i think his and hers for better or worse
but the only ring i want buried with me
are the ones around my eyes
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeprechorus
youre appealing to emotions that i simply do not have
ive got the red carpet blues baby

chorus
so put your hands in the air and dont make a sound
but dont get the wrong idea
were gonna shoot you were gonna shoot you
and theres nothing in your head or pocket throat or wallet
that could change just how this goes
and everyone shakes to the beat with a barrel down their throat

chorus
put your hands in the air and dont make a sound
but dont get the wrong idea
were gonna shoot you were gonna shoot you
and theres nothing in your head or pocket throat or wallet
that could change just how this goes
everyone shakes to the beat with a barrel down their throat
but dont get the wrong idea
were gonna shoot you were gonna shoot you
