pain and misery my only friend
i raise a toast and i salute the end
six feet in the ground is where the living begins

i got to get on with living or get the hell on with dying
shove a million dollars in my pocket but there aint no pacifying me
anyone can see whats happening to me

my lifes out of reach of my arms but im holding on
im living in a dream and no one hears me scream
im breaking at the seams of life but im holding on

ive created a world that is devoid of love
im praying to god and up to heaven above
my heart and my soul have turned to push and shove
its enough to kill me but its never enough

i got to get on with living or get the hell on with dying
shove a million dollars in my pocket but there aint no pacifying me
anyone can see whats happening to me
my lifes out of reach of my arms but im holding on
im living in a dream and no one hears me scream
im breaking at the seams of life but im holding onyou might also likeembed"
