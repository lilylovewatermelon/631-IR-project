there’s a dark part of town where the girls get down
and i cannot wait for a chance to go
wait for a chance to go
i’ve got my bad luck shoes and every excuse to dance these blues away
ain’t comin home
i ain’t comin home

chorus ryan merchant  sebu simonian
shut up shut up shut up
sit up sit up sit up
it’s a kangaroo court
a kangaroo court
shut up shut up shut up
sit up sit up sit up
it’s a kangaroo court
a kangaroo court

verse 2 ryan merchant  sebu simonian
in a dusty room i come to assume
that i’ve been doomed to lose my mind tonight
too weak to fight
so i try to save face then i rest my case
the judge pulls me aside says “c’est la vie
let your darker side come out to feed”

verse 3 ryan merchant  sebu simonian
i commit the crime of wastin time
always tryna rhyme
yes i am guilty
but don’t misunderstand me
i admit defeat then i move my feet
my history will never be repeated
i won’t ever be repeated
