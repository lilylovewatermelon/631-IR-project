got sixteen candles make a wish and blow them out
hoping for those three words you never say out loud
i know you play cool but i know you think about it
so make my wish come true and do something about it

chorus
all theyre ever saying is were too young to
ever fall in love but i know i want to
all theyre ever saying is were too young to
ever fall in love but i hope you want to too
toooo toooo  toooo

verse 2
i dont know why they say young hearts are such a mystery
feels like this thing weve got is part of ancient history
the way you look at me kiss me is so classic
so let the haters do their thing til they get past it

chorus
all theyre ever saying is were too young to
ever fall in love but i know i want to
all theyre ever saying is were too young to
ever fall in love but i hope you want to too
