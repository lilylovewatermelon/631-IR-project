veronica
why when you see boys fight
does it look so horrible
yet feel so right
i shouldnt watch this crap
that’s not who i am
but with this kid
damn

hey mister noname kid
so who might you be
and could you fight for me
and hey could you face the crowd
could you be seen with me and still act proud
hey could you hold my hand
and could you carry me through no mans land
its fine if you dont agree
but i would fight for you
if you would fight for me
you might also likelet them drive us underground
i dont care how far
you can set my broken bones
and i know cpr
well whoa you can punch real good
youve lasted longer than i thought you would
so hey mister noname kid
if some night youre free
wanna fight for me
