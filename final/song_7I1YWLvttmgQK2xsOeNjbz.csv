give em the old razzle dazzle
razzle dazzle em
give em an act with lots of flash in it
and the reaction will be passionate
give em the old hocuspocus
bead and feather em
how can they see with sequins in their eyes
what if your hinges all are rusting
what if in fact youre just disgusting
razzle dazzle em and theyll never catch wise

billy flynn girls
give em the old razzle dazzle
razzle dazzle em
give em a show thats so splendiferous
row after row will grow vociferous
give em the old flimflam flummox
fool and fracture em
how can they hear the truth above the roar roar roar roar
throw em a fake and a finagle
theyll never know youre just a bagel
razzle dazzle em and theyll beg you for more

give em the old razzle dazzle
razzle dazzle em
back since the days of old methuselah
everyone loves the big bamboozler
give em the old threering circus
stun and stagger em
when youre in trouble go into your dance
though you are stiffer than a girder
theyll let you get away with murder
razzle dazzle em and youve got a romance
you might also likegive em the old razzle dazzle
give em the old razzle dazzle
razzle dazzle em
show em the first rate sorcerer you are
long as you keep em way off balance
how can they spot youve got no talents
razzle dazzle em razzle dazzle em
razzle dazzle em
and theyll make you a staaaar2embed"
