am i alone in here
am i alone in here
am i alone in here
am i alone in here

verse 1
knew you were here
sister confirms suspicions
and besides the note you left on my bed
where i held you so close

verse 2
did you think id forget
couldnt be more of a mess
for to breathe used to be another way
id take you in

chorus
well its time to wake up
and separate feelings
that i keep falling into
each seems like good reasons
but i feel a breakdown
i dont care if it shows up
im praying this for you
til its answered ill say
see chevelle liveget tickets as low as 161you might also likeverse 3
now it seems theres a choice
that began with a break
so today know that never again
will i know you that way

chorus
well its time to wake up
and separate feelings
that i keep falling into
each seems like good reasons
but im gonna breakdown
i dont care if it shows up
im praying this for you
til its answered ill say

outro
am i alone in here am i alone in here
am i alone in here am i alone in here
am i alone in here am i alone in here
am i alone in here am i alone in here
am i alone in here am i alone in here
am i alone in here am i alone in here1embed"
