weve had such a great time in these past two months
i never laughed so much in my life
its been all about us
since that time we had that intimate talk
suddenly youre actin strange plus
your conversation just up and changed
is it because youre afraid that what you feelin for me
is the beginning of a new heartbreak
hear me when i say

chorus
you aint gotta give me your love oh no
you aint gotta say im your one you aint gotta no no
you aint gotta tell me where you be oh no
cause you aint obligated to me
im not sayin that you should just
rush and give me your heart
im just askin that you like me real hard
just like me real hard

verse 2
you know just like i know
weve been broken by love and we both need time to heal
thats why in this short amount of time
weve grown so close cause you relate to everything i feel
so lets not complicate things by
placing titles on you and i
but what we can do before we make the next move
we gotta find the perfect reason why
so believe me when i say
