lipstick letter cross the mirror this mornin
said goodbye baby you left without warnin
like a thief in the night you ran away with my heart

verse 2
i cant believe my eyes must be a bad dream
you always said we had a good thing
you never once let on we were fallin apart

chorus
that aint no way to go girl it just aint right
dont you think that i deserve to hear you say goodbye
that aint no way to go was it all a lie
after all this time that aint no way to go

verse 3
gettin nowhere im tired of thinkin
guess ill do a little wishful drinkin
and make a whiskey wish upon a star

verse 4
train whistle blowin down the track
lonesome sound says she aint comin back
its such a cold blow from out of the dark
see brooks  dunn liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likechorus
that aint no way to go girl it just aint right
dont you think that i deserve to hear you say goodbye
that aint no way to go now was it all a lie
after all this time…

outro
that aint no way to go now girl it just aint right
dont you think that i deserve to hear you say goodbye
that aint no way to go now was it all a lie
after all this time that aint no way to goembed"
