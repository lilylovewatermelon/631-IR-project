boys marching to war
to certain defeat
they were younger than me
guns poke through the trees
death on a whim
they were aiming at him

hook 1
and when the bullets came he didnt duck
he wrapped her pantyhose around his neck
and he could feel their magic working
keeping him from harm
away to some place mystical and warm
his lucky charm

verse 2
he got caught
no cover at all
hed breathe in her scent
not even a scratch
he didnt die
when he stepped on a mine
they were violet and soft
it didnt go off

and when her letter came
he didnt cry
he wrapped her pantyhose around his eyes
and he could feel their magic working
keeping him from harm
even though she didnt love him anymore
you cant kill a lucky charm1embed"
