theres a hundred and four days of summer vacation
and school comes along just to end it
so the annual problem for our generation
is finding a good way to spend it
like maybe

verse bowling for soup phineas  candace
building a rocket or fighting a mummy
or climbing up the eiffel tower
discovering something that doesnt exist hey
or giving a monkey a shower
surfing tidal waves creating nanobots
or locating frankensteins brain its over here
finding a dodo bird painting a continent
or driving your sister insane phineas

outro bowling for soup phineas  candace
as you can see theres a whole lot of stuff to do
before school starts this fall come on perry
so stick with us cause phineas and ferb are gonna do it all
so stick with us cause phineas and ferb are gonna do it all
