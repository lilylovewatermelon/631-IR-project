ive given up on society
up on my family
up on your social disease
ive given up on the industry
up on democracy
done with all your hypocrisy

prechorus
all of the chaos
and all of the lies
i hate it

chorus
im wasting here can anyone
wash it all away
im waiting here for anyone
to wash it all away

wash it all away

verse 2
ive given up on the media
feeds my hysteria
sick of living down on my knees
ive given up on morality
feeds my brutality
