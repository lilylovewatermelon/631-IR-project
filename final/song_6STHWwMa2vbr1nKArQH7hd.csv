sometimes i get so weird
i even freak myself out
i laugh myself to sleep
its my lullaby
sometimes i drive so fast
just to feel the danger
i wanna scream it makes me feel alive

chorus
is it enough to love
is it enough to breathe
somebody rip my heart out
and leave me here to bleed
is it enough to die
somebody save my life
id rather be anything but ordinary please

verse 2
to walk within the lines
would make my life so boring
i want to know that i have been to the extreme
knock me my feet so knock me off my feet
cmon on now give it to me
anything to make me feel alive

and leave me here to bleed

let down your defenses use no common sense
if you look you will see lalalalala
that this world is a beautiful accident turbulent
succulent opulent permanent no way  lalalalala
i wanna taste it dont wanna waste it away
