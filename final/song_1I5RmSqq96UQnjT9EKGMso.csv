lost the meaning of our stay
learn to live another day
doubt the choices that weve made
i know that we cant hide our shame
its only in disguise

verse 2
drowning in our own debris
fool our thoughts as though were free
close our eyes so we can see
the depth of all we mean to be
if only in my eyes

chorus
i dont mind read the writing on the wall
mother cries tortured voices as we crawl
find me on my better days to lose it once again
in a way

verse 3
so try and love me while you can
and take the time to understand
as long as i can touch your face
you know ill never leave this place
if only in my mind
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
i dont mind read the writing on the wall
mother cries tortured voices as we crawl
find me on my better days to lose it once again
but i seem to find no better ways
to consciously pretend

verse 4
silence all i want to say
with tendencies to run away
oh run away with you tonight
launder all my sins away
and just like that mistakes are made
you know tonight the world dies

chorus
i dont mind read the writing on the wall
mother cries tortured voices as we crawl
find me on my better days to lose it once again
but i seem to find no better ways
to consciously pretend12embed"
