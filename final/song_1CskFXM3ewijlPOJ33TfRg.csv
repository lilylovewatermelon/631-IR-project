verse 1
i thought every girl i had was the one uh huh but she was not it
ninety nine percent of bitches be thottin thottin
if i do the same thing youll say im not shit not shit
i could do the same thing youll leave me cryin cryin
she got a little deeper through the process process
still addicted to the streets cant hide it hide it
walkin round with two glizzys in my pocket
already cocked it flip a nigga like a socket socket
nigga way before the fame we was wildin
then they killed my nigga quado in the projects projects
and its a shame all the bitches that was curvin
i see the same damn names in my comments comments

chorus
she was lookin od from a side eye
said she aint an eater oh she lied oh she liedlied
woke up to three bitches in my bed
made me say it three times oh you fine oh you finefine
i aint rockin with no ho niggas or a bozo
thats a nono nigga nah nah
i know they love my fly
the way i rock dolce and gabanna
i lost my niggas to the streets when it coulda been me
its fucked up they either dead or doin fed time
boy you all about your bread so am i
if its money on your mind 45 to your hairline
and i keep it by the dresser
thats for any bitch who ever try to break my heart i wont let ya
still got blood on my denims
that was all the blood that was in him no more love in a nigga

and its probably cause im from the x where they take for respect

and if i die ima die for my respect
bury me with like a milli on my neck ah

chorus
she was lookin od from a side eye
said she aint an eater but she lie all the timetime
i woke up to three bitches in my bed
made me say it three times like you fine oh you finefine
i aint rockin with no ho niggas or a bozo
thats a nono nigga nah nah
i know they love my fly
the way i rock dolce and gabanna
i lost my niggas to the streets when it coulda been me
its fucked up they either dead or doin fed time
boy you all about your bread so am i
if its money on your mind 45 to your hairline
and i keep it by the dresser
just in case a bitch ever try to break my heart i wont let ya
i still got blood on my denims
that was the blood that was in him no more love in a nigga
verse 3
run through it all the bands that a nigga got
i wonder if the streets still care about me
long story i can never really talk about it
im numb to it i stand still when i hear shots
numb to it i stand still when i hear shots
i hear niggas talkin bout the money that they dont got
i used to be up on the corner with my young akh
now i go buy a couple pounds of the fronto
i still smoke it by the pound i get dumb high
i still smoke it by the pound like a rasta
i send money to my niggas sittin up yeah
i send money to my daughter shes a rugrat
i been through it but im not givin up yeah
i switch up on different cars now they upset21embed"
