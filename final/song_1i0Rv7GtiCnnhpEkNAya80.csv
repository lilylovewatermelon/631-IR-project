was 27 surviving my return of saturn
a long vacation didnt sound so bad
was full of secrets locked up tight like iron mountain
running on empty so out of gas

prechorus 1
thought i wasn’t enough
found i wasn’t so tough
laying on the bathroom floor
we were living on a fault line
and i felt the fault was all mine
couldn’t take it anymore

chorus
by the grace of god there was no other way
i picked myself back up i knew i had to stay
i put one foot in front of the other and i
looked in the mirror and decided to stay
wasnt gonna let love take me out that way

verse 2
i thank my sister for keeping my head above the water
when the truth was like swallowing sand
now every morning there is no more mourning
oh i can finally see myself again

i know i am enough possible to be loved
it was not about me
now i have to rise above
let the universe call the bluff
yeah the truth will set you free

chorus
by the grace of god there was no other way
i picked myself back up i knew i had to stay
i put one foot in front of the other and i
looked in the mirror and decided to stay
wasnt gonna let love take me out

bridge
oh that way no
that way no
not in the name of love in the name of love
that way no

by the grace of god
i picked myself back up
i put one foot in front of the other
