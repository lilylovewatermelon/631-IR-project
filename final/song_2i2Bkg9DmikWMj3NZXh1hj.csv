dont rock the jukebox
i wanna hear some jones
cause my heart aint ready
for the rolling stones
i dont feel like rocking
since my babys gone
so dont rock the jukebox
play me a country song

verse 1
before you drop that quarter
keep one thing in mind
you got a heartbroke hillbilly
standing here in line
ive been down and lonely
ever since she left
before you punch that number
could i make one request

chorus
dont rock the jukebox
i wanna hear some jones
cause my heart aint ready
for the rolling stones
i dont feel like rocking
since my babys gone
so dont rock the jukebox
play me a country song
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeverse 2
i aint got nothing
against rock and roll
but when your hearts been broken
you need a song thats slow
aint nothing like a steel guitar
to drown a memory
before you spend your money baby
play a song for me

chorus
dont rock the jukebox
i wanna hear george jones
cause my heart aint ready

since my babys gone
so dont rock the jukebox
play me a country song
