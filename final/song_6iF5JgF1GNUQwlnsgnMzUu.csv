verse 1
shoes took a house i took your bitch took that ho to town
played my role so good after i hit i took a bow
take some pounds for a pow take your time take it serious
im curious should i buy me a watch or a aquarium
get your sack took we gon take you for a joke
if you like that last batch bring some money take some more
wanna take em to the 8 dont know which route i wanna take it
the country wait four years we take presidents every day nigga
take me to the horse not the club bitch the porsche
ho done took off with my dick i should be takin her to court
if you take me for a ho ima take it to your porch
only fear the lord anybody else could see the morgue
give me thirty seconds with her i can get this bitch naked
one bullet out that kll leave the toughest nigga headless
dog dont need one drug to act reckless
while he sober hell up and put one in a nigga melon
one time for my dukes one time for my pops
free twink rest in peace tee fuck the opps
one time for lil cj one time for lil roc
fifty rounds in that chop niggas move niggas dropped

verse 2
shout out to my niggas cause they grind for em to shine
shoes blood red bottom like they ride under the five
in guam with my bitch we at vé khứ hồi
niggas hatin but aint never been off us soil
nigga this more than i started off my day with a map
and the prayer that i made it there and back
bro this your bitch so why she sittin on my lap
let that chop clap a pussy nigga head off his neck
was you watchin the news you saw them indictments
okay so you know im statin facts
last niggas we was beefin with uh
man i cant even think of what cemetery them niggas at
itll come to me later its on the tip of my tongue
nigga i meet gangsters crips lords and bloods
nigga i meet plugs talk over dinner bout funds
only thing you meet is the requirements for a crumb
yall pussy niggas homo yall aint got no hoes
these bitches tired of fuckin round with hobos
extendo on the glock that bitch long as a pogo
in chicago at soho fn like im roro
fuck nigga i can get you knocked off no effort
the clip hangin out tonight like it aint on tether
girl say when she with me she get so wetter
say she like to throw that ass on the low catch her
all black and its latenight assault rifle with a steak knife
big forty eat a nigga up but the doc think it was a great white
red bottoms on my feet like my shoes got brake lights
fuck her and drop her off no time for no date nights
chorus
like lil baby i can do that shit with no effort
you know i do this shit with no effort
watch me do this shit with no effort
