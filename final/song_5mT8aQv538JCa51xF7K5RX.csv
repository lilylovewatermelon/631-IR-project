in my hour of need
on a sea of grey
on my knees i pray to you
help me find the dawn
of the dying day

chorus
wont you light my way
wont you light my way
wont you light my way
wont you light my way

verse 2
a bullet is a man
from time to time he strays
i compare my life to this
to this i relate
and im willing
to listen to your answers
and im not afraid
to tell you i need you today

chorus
wont you light my way
wont you light my way
wont you light my way
wont you light my way

so when im lost
or im tired and depraved
or when my high bullet mind
goes astray
wont you light my way

bridge
dont save it for another day
dont save it for another day
dont save it for another day
dont save it for another day

chorus
wont you light my way
wont you light my way
wont you light my way
wont you light my wayembed"
