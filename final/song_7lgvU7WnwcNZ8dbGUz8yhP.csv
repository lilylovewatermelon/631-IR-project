all jokes aside come bounce with us
standin over you with a 12 gauge about to bust
its like ashes to ashes and dust to dust

when things get rough im in the club shootin with puff
bitch please you must have a mental disease
assume the position and get back down on your knees

fuck around and make me bust this heat
thats the devil they always wanna dance

what in the world gives me the right to say what i like
and walk around flippin the bird
livin the urban life like a white kid from the burbs

that somewhere deep down theres a decent human being in me
it just cant be found so the reason youve been seeing this me
is cause this is me now the recent dude whos being this mean

ask the bouncers in the club cause they know cause they know
