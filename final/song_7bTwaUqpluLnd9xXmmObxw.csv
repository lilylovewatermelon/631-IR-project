what goes around comes around
feel it breathing down heavy on you
you made that bed youre laying on
deeds that you have done now you cant undo

chorus
youve got bones in your closet
youve got ghosts in your town
ainâ€™t no doubt yeah theyre going to come out
theyre waiting for the sun to go down
you cant hide from your demons
feel them all lurking around
youre running scared cause you know theyre out there
theyre waiting for the sun to go down

verse 2
its a long hard row to hoe
when seeds that you sow grow by the wicked moon
be sure your sins will find you out
your past will hunt you down
and return to tell on you

chorus

verse 3
it all stands to reason
every dog will have his day
but your day is leaving
better hold on tight
here comes the night
