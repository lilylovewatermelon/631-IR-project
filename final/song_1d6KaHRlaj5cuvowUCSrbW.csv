cant make right mistakes weve made
cant dry your cryin eyes
for my little angels sake

i cant make the sun keep smilin
or blow away the clouds
theres some things in this ol world girl
i cant do nothin about

but i can love you
like ive always done
and when the hard times come a knockin
honey you wont ever see me run
and i wont leave you
when you need a friend
cant make the bad days that much better
baby then theyve ever been
but i can love you

cant hold back the ocean waves
or stop a sinkin ship
cant make a mountain move
or tell you how to live

but i can love you
like ive always done
and when the hard times come a knockin
honey you wont ever see me run
and i wont leave you
when you need a friend
cant make the bad days that much better
baby then theyve ever been
but i can love you

when you need a friend
cant make the bad days that much better
baby then theyve ever been
but i can love you
but i can love youembed"
