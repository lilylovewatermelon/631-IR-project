poppin them caps get to jumping like tigger

same way i rap nigga caught em slippin
hit em with stamps like iphones
im talkin the apple that look like a nigga had bit it
he dont wanna be in this real blood business
ten the lieutenant got shooters on call
if that lil boy take a stand he gon fall
play and i shoot til its empty on yall
blowing that smoke and its coming out loud
before i got five i collected me four
hollows gon rain like they taking a shower
do that boy bad then hop on the road
