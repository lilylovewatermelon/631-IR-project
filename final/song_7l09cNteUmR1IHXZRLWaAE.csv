woahoh
you know the time
you know the time it is
its time we have some make up sex

verse
lets fuck in the kitchen im tryna make sure that you with it
you know that i get it
you got a spot and you know that i hit it
you got somebody new you got somebody
and you know that that nigga he just dont hit it
cause if he hit it the way that i hit it right now you just would not be with me
you gotta keep it a buck with yourself
before i chase you ima fuck with myself
damn i dont wan fuck with myself
cause its lonely when i fuck with myself
lowkey when i fuck with myself
all of these nights of spending alone
whеn i get to endin that pussy
you know you gon lowkey havе to throw me the belt
you told me last night when we fucked this was the best head you ever got dont lie
you told me last night when we fucked this was the best sex you ever got no dont lie
im getting chills you and your latest new nigga cannot be for real
you wanna blame us fuckin on the liquor but you know you wanted to fuck on your feels
go spend your time in texas
now you just one of my exes
i aint even bout to stress it
cause when i go find me somebody better promise that its gon hurt
yeah its gon hurt

i promise that you gonna feel how i feel and thats hurt
