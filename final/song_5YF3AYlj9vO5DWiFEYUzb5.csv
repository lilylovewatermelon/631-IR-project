so upset nervous wreck
cant believe you said goodbye
sit and smoke cry and joke
about these tears in my eyes

chorus 1
how could you do what youve gone and done to me
i wouldnt treat a dog the way you treated me
but thats what i get
ive come to expect it from you

verse 2
a million times a million lines
and i bought them every one
you dont care you rip and tear
every dream ive counted on

chorus 2
i guess that i should thank my unlucky stars
that im alive and youre the way you are
but thats what i get
ive come to expect it from you

chorus 1
how could you do what youve gone and done to me

there wont be no more next time doing me wrong
youll come back this time to find out that im gone
but thats what you get
you should expect that from me
