i want to see your animal side
let it all out
i wanna see the dirt under your skin
i need your broken promises

prechorus
i want the guts and glory baby baby
this town is wasted and alone

chorus
but we are alive here in death valley
but dont take love off the table yet
cause tonight its just fire alarms and losing you
we love a lot so we only lose a little
but we are alive we are alive we are alive

verse 2
i want to see your animal side
let it all out
oh there you go undress to impress
you can wear the crown but youre no princess

prechorus
so put the d in dirt now baby baby
lets get you wasted and alone
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
cause we are alive here in death valley
but dont take love off the table yet
cause tonight its just fire alarms and losing you
we love a lot so we only lose a little
but we are alive we are alive we are alive

were going to die its just a matter of time
hard times come good times go
im either gone in an instant
or here til the bitter end i never know
what ive got will make you feel more alive
ill be your favorite drug i will get you high i will get you high

chorus
were still we are alive here in death valley
but dont take love off the table yet
cause tonight its just fire alarms and losing you
we love a lot so we only lose a little
but we are alive we are alive we are alive27embed"
