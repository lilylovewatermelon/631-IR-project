i wanted to get the hell out of portland
you wanted to stay it was more important
to be where you were raised i understand my love
i wanted to roam and see the world
you wanted a home one boy one girl
but clearly god had different plans for us

prechorus
going eighty down the interstate
i feel my heart begin to break
is this choice or is it fate well hey

chorus
maybe we were right
it was good to say goodbye
happy ever after doesnt last
we both knew it was time
to leave those times behind
lets hope that down the road
well cross our paths
so we can look back and laugh
