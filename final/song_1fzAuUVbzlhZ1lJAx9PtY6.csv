my love was as cruel as the cities i lived in
everyone looked worse in the light
there are so many lines that ive crossed unforgiven
ill tell you the truth but never goodbye

chorus
i dont wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
i dont wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
ive been sleepin so long in a twentyyear dark night
and now i see daylight i only see daylight

verse 2
luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
and so i became the butt of the joke
i wounded the good and i trusted the wicked
clearin the air i breathed in the smoke

prechorus
maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
maybe ive stormed out of every single room in this town
threw out our cloaks and our daggers because its morning now
its brighter now now

chorus
i dont wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
i can never look away
i dont wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
things will never be the same
ive been sleepin so long in a twentyyear dark night
now im wide awake
and now i see daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight

i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight

bridge
and i can still see it all in my mind
all of you all of me intertwined
i once believed love would be black and white
but its golden golden
and i can still see it all in my head
back and forth from new york sneakin in your bed
i once believed love would be burnin red
but its golden
like daylight like daylight
like daylight daylight

chorus
i dont wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
i can never look away
and i dont wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
things will never be the same
ive been sleepin so long in a twentyyear dark night
now im wide awake
and now i see daylight i see daylight i only see daylight ah

postchorus
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight ah
and i can still see it all
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
and i can still see it all back and forth from new york
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
i once believed love would be burning red
outro
like daylight
its golden like daylight
you gotta step into the daylight and let it go
just let it go let it go
spoken outro
i wanna be defined by the things that i love
not the things i hate
not the things im afraid of im afraid of
or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
i i just think that
you are what you love62embed"
