well i wanted you
i wanted no one else
i thought it through
i got you to myself
you got off
every time you got on to me
i got caught up
in favorable slavery
was it wrong was it wrong

chorus
i guess it wasnt really right
i guess it wasnt meant to be
it didnt matter what they said
cause we were good in bed
i guess i stuck around so i could watch us fight
for all the wrong reasons
no it didnt matter what i tried
its just a little hard to leave
when youre going down on me
i guess i stuck around so i could watch us fight
for all the wrong reasons

verse 2
well you know my friends
they know your enemies
id pretend
not to hear what they said to me
cause i got off
every time you got on to me
was it wrong to go along with insanity
was it wrong was it wrong

i guess it wasnt really right
i guess it wasnt meant to be
it didnt matter what they said
cause we were good in bed
i guess i stuck around so i could watch us fight
for all the wrong reasons
no it didnt matter what i tried
its just a little hard to leave
when youre going down on me
i guess i stuck around so i could watch us fight
for all the wrong reasons

postchorus
you know iâ€™m the best
when i stick it on your chest
i know you dont care
i can stick it anywhere
on the bus its the best
when i blow it on your chest
i know you dont care
i can shove it anywhere

i guess it wasnt what i wanted
wasnt really what i thought
thought it was the day i got
i want it all to go away
i guess it wasnt what i wanted
wasnt really what i thought
thought it was the day i got
i want it all to go away
i guess it wasnt what i wanted
wasnt really what i thought
thought it was the day i got
i want it all to go away
i guess it wasnt what i wanted
wasnt really what i thought
thought it was the day i got
i want it all to go away
