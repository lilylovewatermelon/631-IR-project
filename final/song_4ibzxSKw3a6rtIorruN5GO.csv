im not alone
i wish i was
cause then id know i was down because
i couldnt find a friend around
to love me like they do right now
they do right now

prechorus
im dizzy from the shopping mall
i searched for joy but i bought it all
it doesnt help the hunger pains
and a thirst id have to drown first to ever satiate

chorus
somethings missing
and i dont know how to fix it
somethings missing
and i dont know what it is
at all

verse 2
when autumn comes
it doesnt ask
it just walks in where it left you last
and you never know when it starts
until theres fog inside the glass around your summer heart
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likechorus
somethings missing
and i dont know how to fix it
somethings missing
and i dont know what it is
no i dont know what it is
at all

bridge
i cant be sure that this state of mind
is not of my own design
i wish there was an overthecounter test for loneliness
for loneliness like this

chorus
somethings missing
and i dont know how to fix it
somethings missing
and i dont know what it is
no i dont know what it is
somethings different
and i dont know what it is
no i dont know what it is

bridge 2
friends check
money check
a well slept check
opposite sex check
guitar check
microphone check
messages waiting on me when i come home check
outro
how come everything i think i need
always comes with batteries
what do you think it means
how come everything i think i need
always comes with batteries1embed"
