you keep playing with me baby until im deep in between
i know your never gonna agree love life rollercoaster
you never let the sunshine you better take it from me
and every time you sun shines you make me week in the knees
i know your never gonna agree love life rollercoaster
your mommas never gonna believe went to bed with a monster

and ill show up

and let your sunshine

crying with your green eyes im sorry baby please
