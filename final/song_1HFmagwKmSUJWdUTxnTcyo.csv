well the farmer wakes a rooster up and sees her in the sky
and a ghost can only say hello by kissing you goodbye
and a call came in without a ring and a word was never spoke
theyre laughing on the other line like someone heard that someone told a joke
like someone heard that someone told a joke

verse 2
well its the kind of night to make you crazy as the corn
just about the time you died and just as you were born
well the streets are hot and full of rage and everyones on drugs
i must be outta my head i must have lost a lot of blood

chorus
i must have lost a lot of blood
i must have lost a lot of blood
i must have lost a lot of blood

verse 3
well the lightning strikes a heavy post
smoke dressed up in diamond clothes
a clock so stiff it cant unwind
lord knows whats on the devils mind
there aint no back then no down the line
theres nothing more to this grand design
im blinded by the cameras flash
and captured waves that never crash
captured waves that never crash
see dr dog liveget tickets as low as 72you might also likechorus
i must have lost a lot of blood never crash
i must have lost a lot of blood never crash
i must have lost a lot of blood

why do i feel like i could not be closer as i slowly drift further away
and why does it feel like im at the beginning when everyone calls it a day
i wash my clothes in turpentine i shave on christmas eve
and im learning how to not exist cause thats what i thats what i believe

chorus
i must have lost a lot of blood
i must have lost a lot of blood
i must have lost a lot of blood

verse 4
well a dollar in the bottle breaks the rain is at my door
and the cops they are about as good as pennies on the floor
well i havent been home since i was a kid
what have i done whatever i did
ill be the sun that shines from afar where nobody knows nobody knows who you are

outro
nobody knows nobody knows who you are
nobody knows nobody knows who you are
nobody knows nobody knows who you are
nobody knows nobody knows who you are1embed"
