its been a long day and im trying to figure it out
the way those words left your mouth
i feel broken shattered and blue
and its all because of you
and im trying trying to figure it out

chorus
if this is love
why does it break me down
why do you break me down
if this is love
why does it break me down
why do you break me down

verse 2
its been a long time since ive felt the way that i do now
like i need you but i dont know how
its been a while since i smiled
and i meant it for all my heart
but the idea of leaving this behind it tears me apart

chorus
if this is love
why does it break me down
why do you break me down
if this is love
why does it break me down
why do you break me down
you might also likebridge
kiss me now and remind me why
i ever wanted to make you mine
and even though it hurts in this moment
ive always known it
youre the other half of my broken heart

chorus
if this is love
why does it break me down
why do you break me down
if this is love
why does it break me down
why do you break me down

outro
even though it hurts in this moment
ive always known it
youre the other half of my broken heart4embed"
