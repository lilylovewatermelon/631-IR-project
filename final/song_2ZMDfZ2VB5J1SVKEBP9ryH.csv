verse 2 ti
yeah hey gather round front and center the king finna enter

the hottest you probably too small to acknowledge you
impossible to copy like what everybody try to do

comin through this thing like james
in the air off the rim i hang

ima come hard like a boner dont i
make a nigga wanna rebound turned up all the way
