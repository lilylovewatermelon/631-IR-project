its no secret that lately there aint no escape
and that ive been waking up alone
just me and the tv and a sinking feeling
that you aint ever coming home
but today the tears aint gonna hit the floor
cause the boats in the bay and its calling my name
so im heading on out the door

chorus
cause the suns too bright the skys too blue
beers too cold to be thinking bout you
gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
save it for a rainy day

verse 2
when i turned the ignition i knew id been missing
the feel of the wind on my face
i was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
too busy taking all the blame
but a drink or two is a foolproof remedy
its a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
kinda making eyes at me

chorus
cause the suns too bright the skys too blue
beers too cold to be thinking bout you
gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
save it for a rainy day

gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
