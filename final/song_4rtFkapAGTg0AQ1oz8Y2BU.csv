see i try to hide the fact that i am just a fragile individual
so i give off this facade that im so hard
when in fact im far from unbreakable
im so afraid to talk and express myself
keepin all my feelings bottled inside
of this empty shell that i call my heart
cause i cant let love back in again

prechorus
oh i wish id known love was cold before i fell in
cause i went head on with its storm
like lightning going into sand

chorus
oh its better to have loved
than not to have loved at all
so i guess i should feel fortunate
but i dont feel that way least not in my heart
cause see love has left me broken broken like glass
so if you see me you can call me
if you see me you can call me misses glass

verse 2
now after all the lying to myself
im stuck feeling miserable
when i have forced myself to be somebody else
making me seem invisible
cause see im a woman like any other woman
and sometimes i get emotional
and it might seem hard to understand where im coming from
and you might never ever know
you might also likeprechorus
oh i wish id known love was cold before i fell in
cause i went head on with its storm
like lightning going into sand

chorus
oh its better to have loved
than not to have loved at all
so i guess i should feel fortunate
but i dont feel that way least not in my heart
cause see love has left me broken broken like glass
so if you see me you can call me
if you see me you can call me misses glass

outro
broken like glass
broken like glass
so if you see me you can call me
if you see me you can call me misses glass
misses glass
broken broken
so if you see me you can call me
if you see me you can call me misses glass1embed"
