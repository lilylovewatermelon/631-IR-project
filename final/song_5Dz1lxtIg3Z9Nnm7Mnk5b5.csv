verse
back and forth sick and tired bitch im fed up
shorty suck me in the back of the benz truck
took his bitch now he wanna catch a head up
toetotoe and if i lose hope he got a vest on

parasail with a breeze you catchin my drift
swiffer shawty wanna clean the spit off my dick
got a little bit of bread my phone aint been dry since uh
novocaine yall aint feelin my pain
take his life tryna play with my fate
sames ones tryna plot on my grave
be the same motherfuckers wanna smile in my face

counterfeit yall imitate
everybody throw stones til it ricochet home
it dont feel so good when your glass house break huh
