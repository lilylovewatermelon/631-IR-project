its bout to be big shit poppin by the time this shit is droppin
stoppin not a option im addicted its a problem
this way of life sex drugs rock and roll on the road
feelin blessed performin for soldout shows
you rappers talkin shit what you know bout those
what you know bout spittin bars and the whole crowd goes yeah
its unbelievable these people say i made it
throwin down a little henny cant believe that i dont chase it
life goes on days get brighter
im feelin like i came in with my haze no lighter
so im lookin for the missin piece
goin down in history for rippin beats
smooth game sweeter than a krispy kreme
you tune into my station hope you listening
turn it up and follow on my journey as i live my dream
allnatural whole foods that lay you back
have you straight chillin in a dope mood
and some shit is happy like a show tune
this a brand new world i can show you yeah
some people still have no clue
but they can look at all this cheese that i produce

chorus
in a world i am so happy that go round you up or you down
you in or you out you smile or you frown
just get up get up get up get up get up get up get up get up
in a world i am so happy that go round you up or you down
you in or you out you smile or you frown
just get up get up get up get up get up get up get up get up
