verse 1
ive been down in the dirt lost for so long
and pushed around beaten down
got nothing left to lose all hope is gone
got buried deep underground

prechorus
oh can you see me
oh can you hear me

chorus
can you hear me screaming for you
im afraid im gonna die down here
i cant save i cant save myself
get me out get me out of hell
im suffocating waiting for you
cause the angels dont fly down here
i need you because no one else
can get me out get me out of hell

i cant trust anyone all that i got
is another scarred broken heart
ive been stabbed in the back the bleeding wont stop
just another cut in the dark

prechorus
oh can you see me
oh can you hear me

chorus
can you hear me screaming for you
im afraid im gonna die down here
i cant save i cant save myself
get me out get me out of hell
im suffocating waiting for you
cause the angels dont fly down here
i need you because no one else
can get me out get me out of hell
chorus
