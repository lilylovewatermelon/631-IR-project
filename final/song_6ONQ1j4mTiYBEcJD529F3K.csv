im so sure what a snotty thing to say
stuck up people always get their way
they think theyre so cool
these are the kind of people that you drool over
that is because they dont really care except about their finger nails and their long pretty
hair
go up to one of these girls someday and say i think ive found your cure and ill bet
theyll turn their back on you and say im so sure

i dont wanna be like you 3x

verse 1
every time that i walk in the door
you put me down just a little bit more
you think that youre better than everyone else
but everyone knows that youre stuck on yourself
and i dont know what you want me to do
and i dont know what you want me to say
i think that i need to get away away away away away

chorus
over and over and over and over and over again
its the same old questions
over and over its over its over again
with the same suggestions
i dont wanna be like you i dont wanna be like you i dont wanna be like you
you might also likeverse 2
sometimes im wrong sometimes im right
i just need a little taste to get by
the flavors so good its much better than you
theres nothing left and theres no more to do
every time that i walk in the door you put me down just a little bit more
you think that your better than everyone else
you dont know nothing your stuck on yourself

chorus
over and over and over and over and over again
its the same old questions
over and over its over its over again
with the same suggestions
i dont wanna be like you i dont wanna be like you i dont wanna be like you

bridge
i never wanna be anything like you cause i hate you thats right
i never wanna be anything like you i dont trust you yeah
i never wanna be anything like you cause i hate you yeah
i dont trust you and i hate you i dont love you anymore
i dont trust you and theres no solution over and over and over its over its over again

now that youre gone and youre gone far away
everythings perfect everythings okay
no bitchin and fussin and fighting all day
i dont have anything left to say
chorus
over and over and over and over and over again
its the same old questions
over and over its over its over again
with the same suggestions
i dont wanna be like you cause theres no solution i dont wanna be like you i dont
wanna be like you

sick of makin pollution
cause theres no solution cause theres no solutionembed"
