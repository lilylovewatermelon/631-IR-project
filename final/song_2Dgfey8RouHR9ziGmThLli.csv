mommys in the kitchen cooking up something good
and daddys on the sofa pride of the neighborhood
my brothers in the ballet it seems hes got it set
and ill be up at midnight with my cigarette

chorus
ooh when life moves this slowly
ooh just try and let it go
ooh when life moves this slowly
ooh just try and let it go

verse 2
daddys in the basement cooking up something fine
while ricks out on the pavement flipping it for dimes
if theres anything redeeming i havent seen it yet
and im still up at midnight chewing nicorette

chorus
ooh when life moves this slowly
ooh just try and let it go
ooh when life moves this slowly
ooh just try and let it goyou might also like8embed"
