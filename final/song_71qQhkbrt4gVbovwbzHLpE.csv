fate is so unkind
now i should have known
blind leading the blind
reaping what ive sown
if it all amounts to nothing
why then am i standing in this line

verse 1
hell is still overburdened
i must stand and wait in line
i may never know for certain
when will be my time
how was i considered evil
pleasures taken in this life
someone granted me reprieval
decades spent in strife

prechorus
led to nothing
repeated in my mind
led to nothing
if only i was born another time

chorus
hell is still overburdened
i must stand and wait in line
hell is still overburdened
how have i been so determined malign
see disturbed liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeverse 2
its the closing of the curtain
in the play that was my life
countless chapters left unopened
tragedies inside
i was fighting for a reason
holy blessed homicide
seems i have committed treason
all ive sacrificed

prechorus
led to nothing
repeated in my mind
led to nothing
if only i was born another time

chorus
hell is still overburdened
i must stand and wait in line
hell is still overburdened
how have i been so determined malign

hell is still overburdened
i must stand and wait in line
hell is still overburdened
how have i been so determined malign
bridge
fate is so unkind

chorus
hell is still overburdened
i must stand and wait in line
hell is still overburdened
how have i been so determined malign

hell is still overburdened
i must stand and wait in line

how have i been so determined malign3embed"
