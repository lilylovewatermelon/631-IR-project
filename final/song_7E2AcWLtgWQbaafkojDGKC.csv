take a moment listen please
words like these dont come with ease
you took my heart and kept it low
now its time to let it go

chorus max
i want it all or nothing at all to have you here
some people fall to hold on to their tears
and if you want it all id do anything to see you through
and if i fall my heart holds on to you

verse 2 siva
just one look and i subside
when im with you my love cant hide
take a chance dont run away
with every breath i need to say

chorus max
i want it all or nothing at all to have you here
some people fall to hold on to their tears
and if you want it all ill do anything to see this through
and if i fall my heart holds on to youyou might also likeembed"
