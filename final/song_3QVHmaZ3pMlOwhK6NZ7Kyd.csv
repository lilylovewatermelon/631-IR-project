verse 1 jessie j
i can see your mouth move
but i dont hear the words
and while you dig yourself a hole
youre burying me in the blur
i can taste the fake the shame
ive heard this story before
and while you dig yourself a hole
its the same shit different girl

prechorus jessie j
when i was building a home you made a bed of your own
a perfect little life for three
but now your cover is blown you get to be on your own
and find another stupid girl like me
another stupid girl like me another stupid girl like me
another stupid girl like me another stupid girl like me

chorus jessie j
