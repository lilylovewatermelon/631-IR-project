power and control

verse 1
give a little get a lot
thats just how you are with love
give a little get a lot
yeah you may be good looking
but youre not a piece of art

chorus
power and control
im gonna make you fall
power and control
im gonna make you fall

postchorus
women and men we are the same
but love will always be a game
we give and take a little more
eternal game of tug and war

verse 2
think youre funny think youre smart
think youre gonna break my heart
think youre funny think youre smart
yeah you may be good looking
but youre not a piece of art
