damn girl looking so pretty
hows about a little drive to the city
i want to show you off

verse 1
i know you like it
that im shy and kinda quiet
but tonight i
i kinda dont want to be
the way you walked in
painted red lips
the way that red dress
is hugging up on your hips
i want the whole world to see

chorus
damn girl looking so pretty
hows about a little drive to the city
i want to show you off
tonight
hey babe spend the night with me
make the downtown boys jealous when you kiss me
i want to show you off
tonight

i know a guy who
owns a bar up
on a rooftop
close to the stars yeah

plays some country
john montgomery love the way you love me
aw but they could play anything
long as youre dancing with me

chorus
damn girl looking so pretty
hows about a little drive to the city
i want to show you off
tonight
hey babe spend the night with me
make the downtown boys jealous when you kiss me
i want to show you off
tonight
damn girl looking so pretty
hows about a little drive to the city
i want to show you off
tonight
hey babe spend the night with me
make the downtown boys jealous when you kiss me
i want to show you off
tonight
damn girl looking so pretty
hows about a little drive to the city
i want to show you off

hey babe spend the night with me
make the downtown boys jealous when you kiss me
