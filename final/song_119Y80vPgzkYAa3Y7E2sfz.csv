im not sayin nothing you dont already know
you know youre too delicious more than i can handle
lyin around late at night so luscious that i ache
baby whyd you fall asleep
im still awake

prechorus
im in love in love with a dream
my valentines gone and broke my wings
ill see in time i feel a bit weak ill see
you better be right cause you promised me

chorus 1
i must have lost my mind
i cant believe youre still inside my bed
i nearly walked away i didnt think wed still be rollin

verse 2
dressin up in your love is a dangerous thing
my sexy super lovers got a real bad sting
baby didnt want no trouble this is more than i can afford
i cant help myself keep coming back for more
for more cant help coming back for more

prechorus
im in love in love with a dream
my valentines gone and broke my wings

i must have lost my mind
i cant believe youre still inside my bed
i nearly walked away i didnt think wed still be rolling
and as i watch you sleep in the dim light i close my eyes and pray
another fluorescent night yeah

late night lovers kicking in the covers
dont need no one but you and i
cause every day is a weekend
forget what we were thinkin
another sweet fluorescent night
oohoohoh

chorus 2
i must have lost my mind
i cant believe youre still inside my bed
i nearly walked away i didnt think wed still be rolling
and as i watch you sleep in the dim light i close my eyes and pray
another fluorescent night yeah
