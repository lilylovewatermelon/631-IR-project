verse 1
life is cheap bittersweet
but it tastes good to me
take my turn crash and burn
thats how its sposed to be

chorus
so dont rain on my parade
lifes too short to waste one day
im gonna risk it all the freedom to fall
yes it sure looks good to me

verse 2
time passed by and leaves you behind
take it naturally
heaven knows theres so much more
more than what we see

chorus
so dont rain on my parade
lifes too short to waste one day
im gonna risk it all the freedom to fall
yes it sure looks good to me
hey sure looks good to me

bridge
deep in my mind im secure with getting by
i wanna see the light before i die
before i lie in an empty space
the darkness comes and ive been tellin my soul
and me and myself we turn around were gettin old
but the lightning crashing foolish emotions
are the bruises and the beauty of this moment that were feelin
and i feel like im seeing the world inside of me
but i can tell you that i know its getting easier to breathe
theres a cold in the morning endless equation
of who weve become its a complex situation
so live love life give love live love life give love
live love life give love cause who are we anyway

chorus
so dont rain on my parade
lifes too short to waste one day
im gonna risk it all the freedom to fall
yes it sure looks good to me
hey it sure looks good to me
im tellin you it sure looks good to me
yeah sure looks good to me
