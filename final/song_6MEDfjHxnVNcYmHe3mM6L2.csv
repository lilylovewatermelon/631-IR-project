the best song wasnt the single but you werent either
livin in ladera heights the black beverly hills
domesticated paradise palm trees and pools
the waters blue swallow the pill
keepin it surreal whatever you like
whatever feels good whatever takes your mountain high
keepin it surreal not sugarfree
my tv aint hd thats too real
grapevine mango peaches and limes the sweet life

prechorus
the sweet life sweet life
sweet life sweet life
the sweet sweet sweet sweet life
sweet life the sweet life
sweetie pie

chorus
youve had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
the starshine always kept you warm
so why see the world when you got the beach
dont know why see the world when you got the beach
the sweet life

verse 2
the best song wasnt the single
but you couldnt turn your radio down
satellite need a receiver cant seem to turn the signal fully off
transmitting the waves
youre catching that breeze til youre dead in the grave
but youre keepin it surreal whatever you like
whatever feels good whatever takes your mountain high
keepin it surreal not sugarfree
my tv aint hd thats too real
grapevines mango peaches and lime a sweet life
