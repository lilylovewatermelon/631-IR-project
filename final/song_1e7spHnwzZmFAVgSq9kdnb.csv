what is going on
every time i try to talk
you screaming baby
running your mouth
telling all our business i got witnesses
i cant be wrong
cause i gave you my heart
and you played me
accusing me of doing things that i would never do to you

pre chorus
you say i see other girls
i say you tripping
cause i wouldnt be the one to be found out
because im not that kinda guy
if i wanted somebody else
then id say goodbye
been trying to work it out
girl tell me

chorus
why
why
why do you keep putting me through it baby
you tell me you dont wanna go through it baby
youre believing all the lies that you heard about me
i cant take it no
you thinking that im doing you dirty baby
you better understand
ill do all i can
but if im no good for you
then baby im no good for you
so tell me why are you still here

and youre laying in bed

but now i got reservations
because youre acting strange

and ive been caught admit it admit it
say im playing dumb but dumb but
but you think you know forget it and baby you
i maybe young but i aint stupid baby stupid baby
im not gonna play the fool play the fool
and you should know by now now
that i was all for you

you got so used to the fast life
all of the things i could do for you
kept you coming back to me
always running back to me
