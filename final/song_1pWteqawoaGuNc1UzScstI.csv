somewhere between heaven and tall pine trees
heartland im missin you
guitar playin through the night
it felt pretty good yeah im feelin alright
as good as one for the price of two
its been along time gone
since the truths been told
and ive seen my home
hey curtis loew
come on save my soul
with a bar guitar and a honky tonk crowd
buy me a ticket lord put me on a train
dont matter how i go ill even walk through the rain
southland im missin you
well the sky is high and the moon is low
i found some country tunes playin on the radio
and i know that im there lord i know im there
its been a long time gone
since the truths been told
and ive seen my home
hey curtis loew
come on save my soul
with a bar guitar and a honky tonk crowd
its been a long time gone
