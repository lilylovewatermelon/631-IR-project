ohohohoh ohohoh
oh oh oh oh
oh ohohoh
oh oh oh oh

verse 1
rage in us your thirst im taking
pull the plug ill keep on shaking
and thrustin about your apartment
drowned on the blankets floral and fading huh
painful lust two aching guts
they tear through each other in the mirror
this happy vacation theres no motivation
to hold me up

chorus
you say you want to chase the moon like fire
well together we can fake our own deaths here
just wanna be alone and watch as you all just disappear
whoaohooh oh ohohoh

verse 2
ddddarker now kicked out and sleeping in your car
you roll the window down ohoh
enough to dream and makebelieve
our lights knocked out turned upside down
and im just a stupid motherfucker cant figure it out
i want devil horns i wanna breathe in your rush
i wanna leap when you want me to fly
but darling i dont mean to beg ohwhoaoh oh
but these thorns on the stem are nearly tearing up my skin
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likechorus
and now you wanna chase the moon like fire
well together we can fake our own deaths here
just wanna be alone and watch as you all just disappear
