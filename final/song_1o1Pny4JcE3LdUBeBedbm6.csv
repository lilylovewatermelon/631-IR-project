i wanna be free
i wanna just live
inside my cadillac
that is my shit
now throw it up man throw that up
thats what it is thats what it is
in my cadillac bitch biatch

verse 1 macklemore
cant see me through my tints nuhuh
im riding real slow slow motion
in my paint wet drippin shinin like my 24s umbrella
i aint got 24s nuhuh
but im on those vogues yeah
thats those big white walls rrround them hundred spokes
old school like olde english in that brown paper bag
im rollin in that same whip that my granddad had
hello haters damn yall mad
30k on the caddy now how backpack rap is that

chorus hollis
i got that offblack cadillac midnight drive
got that gas pedal leaning back taking my time
im rolling that roof off letting in sky
i shine the city never looked so bright

smilin dont pay attention to the mileage
can i hit the freeway illegally going 120
easy weavin in and out of the traffic
they cannot catch me im smashin
im duckin buckin them out here
im lookin fuckin fantastic i am up in a classic
now i know what its like under the city lights
ridin into the night drivin over the bridge
the same one wed walk across as kids
knew id have a whip but never one like this
old school old school
candy paint twoseater
yeah im from seattle theres hella honda civics
i couldnt tell you about paint either
but i really wanted a caddy so i put in the hours
and rolled on over to the dealer
and i found the car i dreamed of placed a bargain with this geezer
got the keys in as i was leavin i started screamin

chorus hollis
i got that offblack cadillac midnight drive
got that gas pedal leaning back taking my time
im rolling that roof off letting in sky
i shine the city never looked so bright
verse 3 schoolboy q
yeah uh
backwoods and dope
white hoes in the backseat snortin coke
she doing line after line like shes writing rhymes
i had her inhalin my love tryna blow her mind
cadillac pimpin my uncle was on
14 i stole his keys me and my niggas was gone
stealing portions of his liquor water in his patron
drivin smilin like i won the fucking lottery homes
fuckin lottery homes
tires with the spokes on it and the vogues too
mustard and mayonnaise keepin the buns all on
my dogs hangin out the window
young as whoosh fuckin like we ball
tryna fuck em all
never park the whip see whats poppin at the mall
meet a bad bitch slap her booty with my paw
you can smoke the pussy i was tearin down the walls
im motherfuckin awe
some swear these sights tryna hypnotize
grip the leather steerin wheel while i grip the thighs
see the lust stuck up in her eyes
maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke
or does she want it low
cause this shit a coupe de ville so youll never know
so we cruise for minutes my nigga fuck the limit
got a window tinted for sure a gangsta in it
slide til the gas is finished
