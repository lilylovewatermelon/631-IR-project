marked for demolition i’m
just a time bomb ticking inside
no hope for the hopeless i
can see the pieces all laid out
in front of me
no point even asking why
couldn’t help even if you tried
step aside or you might just be the
next contestant to feel the brutality

prechorus
devastation obliteration all to the
point of exacerbation
theres no explaining my situation
now why does this shit keep happening to me

chorus
i’ve held on too long just to let it go now
will my inner strength get me through it somehow
defying the curse that has taken hold
never surrender i’ll never be overcome

verse 2
too dark for forgiveness i
can’t seem to do anything right
when i try to rebuild i
see my humble shelter just fall
to the ground again
object of an evil eye
no point to let anyone try
take heed my friend lest you
be torn asunder like all that’s become of me

decimation disintegration
now beyond the point of imagination
theres no explaining my situation
why does this shit keep happening to me

chorus
i’ve held on too long just to let it go now
will my inner strength get me through it somehow
defying the curse that has taken hold
never surrender i’ll never be overcome

i’ve held on too long just to let it go now
will my inner strength get me through it somehow
defying the curse that has taken hold
never surrender i’ll never be overcome

i’ve held on too long just to let it go now
will my inner strength
will my inner strength get me through it somehow
