im tryna do it all tonight i got plans
i got a certain lust for life and as it stands
everything is going as right as it can
they tryna shoot down my flight before it lands before it lands
but you could miss me with all that
diss me then crawl back
i really wish yall would fall back
but gettin rich sposed to solve that
and these days women make offers
and who the hell am i to say no no no
my ex sendin late night texts
cause she dont know how to let go go go
uh she in love
and as for them pretty lightskinned models
standin in the cold ah yeah they with us
let them girls in for a drink and im all in they ear
sayin she should be the one i see every time that im here
but when am i really even here
black suburban with the tint on it
fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
the game got these old handprints on it
but imma be the one to pour cement on it
uh and start over
and show up in a margiela tux i dont really give a fuck
and we only gettin older
so what i tend to do is to think of today as the past
its funny when you comin in first but you hope that you last
you just hope that it last
