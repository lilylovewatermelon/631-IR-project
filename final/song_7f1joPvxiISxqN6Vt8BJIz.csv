im gonna take my time
i have all the time in the world
to make you mine
it is written in the stars above

by gods decree
youll be right here by my side
right next to me
you can run but you cannot hide

chorus
dont say you want me
dont say you need me
dont say you love me
its understood
dont say youre happy
out there without me
i know you cant be
cause its no good

verse 2
ill be fine
ill be waiting patiently
til you see the signs
and come running to my open arms
see chevelle liveget tickets as low as 161you might also likewill you realize
do we have to wait til our worlds collide
open up your eyes
you carry back the time

chorus
dont say you want me
dont say you need me
dont say you love me
its understood
dont say youre happy
happy without me
i know you cant be
cause its no good

outro
its noo its noo
its noo its noo
its noo nooembed"
