i saw the colossal landscape
of which i never was a part
it was a magical day oh
of which id never seen before

prechorus
the first time i saw colossal girl
the first time i saw colossal girl

verse 2
such glowing mountains before us
pillars of life all fade away
of all the things i need to say girl
all of these words are in my way

prechorus
the first time i saw colossal girl

chorus
well shes runnin to the hills again
can you tell me if shell ever return
she must be mother natures child
cause shes runnin to the call of the wild
shes talkin to the trees again
tellin me that shes one of them
lookin at the bird in the tree
though shes never gonna notice me no

outro
can you remember the first time we met
living together in colossal times
some things are given with no reason why
living together all of the time
well im just a gypsy with wondering eyes
ill tell you secrets that send you to sleep
and all i can give you is all of my love
these are the things i can give you to keep oh
and im just a gypsy with wondering eyes
and ill tell you secrets that send you to sleep
and all i can give you is all of my love
and these are the things i can give you to keep1embed"
