im boss with it authentic all yall frauds better
quit with the trash talk before you get tossed in it
yall tripping bar ripping yall sipping too much write till the palms dripping
lost in it thoughts different you dont want no drama then dont get involved in it
im in a whole different head space you making money well thats great
i got no interest in talking to people that i know are twofaced too fake get outta my face woo
what are you doing in my lane theres already too many rappers
im sick of the traffic and i aint got no brakes
i already passed you you don’t like what i’m doing who asked you
you got into music cause you think it’s fun man i’m doing this cause i have to
it’s real music chills to it feel through it real stupid
skills truest quit moving woo
if i say something i will do it yeah
i used to dream of these moments
im living em now
look up to heaven like mom are you proud
im on the way to new zealand im up in the clouds dang
i mean who woulda known this who woulda known this
this industry never told me i was welcome
i went to the house with a bat and i broke in
then told em that i would be back
i flatline all of your whack rhymes thats mine
might get away from it boy mm lp—im the bad guy last time
i have been taking it easy the games mine fame why
i dont care about none of that im just sick of the trash lines
i grew up on eminem now look where the games at
lame raps hollywood fame acts im sick of the same trash
i got no blunt in my mouth but give me a beat ima blaze that woo
give me a beat ima blaze that you and me aint in the same class
you and me aint on the same row music has always been my home
i used to call up some people that wont call me back now they blowing up my phone woo
aint it funny how that works mad perks killing the record
got blood on my black shirt im jealous in love with the music dont ever come near her
i aint from around here how you let me run it down here
if that isnt bothering none of you rappers then what are yall doing out here
that was like music to my ears might never make it i dont care
drake i love what you doing but call up the game and tell em that im here yeah
i like that might snap i laugh yall better surrender and get out your white flags
and cancel your flight plans your career isnt taking off
you sound like a hype man hit you with the mic stand
and they ask what the hypes about come and find out i mean where are you clowns at
i been training pen game is insane im done playing
this music is ground breaking lung shaking done waiting
yall taking my patience quit faking yall hating its crazy
