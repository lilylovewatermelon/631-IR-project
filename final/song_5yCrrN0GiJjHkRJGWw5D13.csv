ive got to get home theres a garden to tend
theres food on the ground and the birds have all moved back
into my attic whistling static when the young learn to fly
i will patch all the holes up again

verse 2
well i cant believe that my lime tree is dead
i thought it was sleeping i guess it got fed up with not being fed
and i would be too i keep food in my belly
and hope that my time isnt soon isnt soon

chorus
and so i tried to understand what i cant hold in my hand
and whatever i find ill find my way back to you
and if you could try to find it too
cause this place is overgrown its a waxing moon
home is wherever we are if theres love here too

verse 3
in the back of our house theres a trail that wont end
we went walking so far it grew back in
and theres no trail at all only grass growing taller
get out my machete and battle with time once again
but im bound to lose cause ill be down if time dont win

ive got to get home theres a garden to tend
all the seeds from the fruits buried and began their
own family trees teach them thank you and please
they spread their own roots then watch their young fruit grow again
and this old trail will lead me right back to where it begins

chorus
and so i tried to understand what i cant hold in my hand
and whatever i find ill find my way back to you
and if you could try to find it too
cause this place is overgrown its a waxing moon
home is wherever we are if theres love here too
i said home is wherever we are if theres love here too
well home is wherever we are if theres love here too3embed"
