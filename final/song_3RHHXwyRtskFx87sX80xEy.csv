i was biting the time zone
and we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams
and threw caution to the colourful
then we fell asleep in the car
until the bumps woke me up in your grip
and the tide took me to your mouth
and then swept me back down to your palms
its them that put me inside the reminder
that yours is the only ocean

chorus
yours is the only ocean
that i wanna swing from
yours is the only ocean
that i wanna hang on

verse 2
ive got this ego mechanic
shes always trying to give me vitamins
ah shed be frightened of your reflection
i preferred her as a cartoon
if i could be someone else for a week
id spend it chasing after you
cause shes not shattering my attitudes
no matter how she folds the potion
yours is the only ocean
you might also likechorus
yours is the only ocean
that i wanna swing from
yours is the only ocean
that i want to hang on to

bridge
potion approaching shield your eyes
potion approaching visualise
holding a token swollen in size
potion approaching shield your eyes

outro
oh but if were gonna escape though
we really ought to think it through
would you like me to build you a gokart9embed"
