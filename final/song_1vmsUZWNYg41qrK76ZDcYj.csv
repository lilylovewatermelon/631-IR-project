girl i know you didnt mean it when you said that you were leavin
i just figured that you wanted your space
of course im comin home im out here on the boat
puttin around the lake
didnt mean to start drama of course i love your mama
and i promise that well have a date night
go get your nails done and take your time honey
im a little preoccupied

chorus
well ill have to call you back baby
these fish are biting like crazy
theyre knockin the paint off this crankbait every time
feels like im reelin in an old bulldozer
sorry honey but i got to click over
i got a six pound large mouth on the other line

verse 2
yeah ill clean up the kitchen
ill do the damn dishes
baby im wrong youre right
i get the point your makin
believe me when i say it
right now my hands are tied

so ill have to call you back baby
these fish are biting like crazy
theyre knockin the paint off this crankbait every time
feels like im reelin in an old bulldozer
sorry honey but i got to click over
i got a six pound largemouth on the other line

instrumental break

chorus
well ill have to call you back baby
these fish are biting like crazy
theyre knockin the paint off this crankbait every time
feels like im reeling in an old bulldozer
i know this conversation aint over
i got a six pound largemouth on the other line
i got a six pound largemouth on the other line
