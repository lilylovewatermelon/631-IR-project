i need another story
something to get off my chest
my life gets kinda boring
need something that i can confess
til all my sleeves are stained red
from all the truth that ive said
come by it honestly i swear
thought you saw me wink no
ive been on the brink so

chorus
tell me what you want to hear
something that will light those ears
im sick of all the insincere
so im gonna give all my secrets away
this time
dont need another perfect lie
dont care if critics ever jump in line
im gonna give all my secrets away

verse 2
my god amazing how we got this far
its like were chasing all those stars
whos driving shiny big black cars
and every day i see the news
all the problems that we could solve
and when a situation rises
just write it into an album
send it straight to gold
but i dont really like my flow no

so tell me what you want to hear
something that will light those ears
im sick of all the insincere
so im gonna give all my secrets away
this time
dont need another perfect lie
dont care if critics ever jump in line
im gonna give all my secrets away

ooh

got no family i can blame
just dont let me disappear

chorus
so tell me what you want to hear
something thatll light those ears
im sick of all the insincere
so im gonna give all my secrets away
this time
dont need another perfect lie
dont care if critics ever jump in line
im gonna give all my secrets away
so tell me what you want to hear
something thatll light those ears
im sick of all the insincere
so im gonna give all my secrets away
this time
dont need another perfect lie
dont care if critics ever jump in line
im gonna give all my secrets away
