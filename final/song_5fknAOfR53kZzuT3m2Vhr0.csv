sometimes youre alive
sometimes you are dead inside
with the time to read between the lines of life and death
sometimes its okay
sometimes its the worst thing ever
hopefully you wont get caught and get a dui

verse 2
you will see that its not so bad
theres always tomorrow
bottom of the glass
at this point youve made an ass
and your friends will let you know tomorrow

outro
im so tired
one more glass to go
where this ends well never knowsee thundercat liveget tickets as low as 54you might also like2embed"
