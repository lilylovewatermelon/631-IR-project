weve been done long before it all begun
still cant give it up
lead me on but leave before the morning comes
even though its what we want cant keep this up for long

prechorus
but i just i just dont wanna leave you
might just might just throw away the reasons
why we both cant lay here
and secret secret both gotta keep it
honest honest thats just a game
we know we both cant play

chorus
for tonight im yours
so deny the truth
well stay behind closed doors
cause all i wanna do is lie with you
even though its wrong to lie with you

verse 2
weve become numb to what we know is wrong
but no one knows but us
the feelings rush every single time we touch
even though its what we want cant keep this up for long
