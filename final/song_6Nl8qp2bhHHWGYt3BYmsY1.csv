one last thing i beg you please
just before you go
ive watched you fly on paper wings
halfway round the world until they burned up in the atmosphere
sent you spiraling down
landing somewhere far from here
with no one else around
to catch you falling down
and im looking at you now

chorus
and i cant tell if youre laughing
between each smile theres a tear in your eye
theres a train leaving town in an hour
its not waiting for you and neither am i

verse 2
swing for the fences son he must have told you once
but that was a conversation you took nothing from
so raise your glass now
lets celebrate exactly what youve done
just put off another day of knowing where youre from
you can catch up with yourself if you run

chorus
and i cant tell if youre laughing
between each smile theres a tear in your eye
theres a train leaving town in an hour
its not waiting for you and neither am i

is this the life that you lead the life thats lead for you
will you take the road thats been laid out before you
will we cross paths somewhere else tonight
somewhere else tonight

chorus
and i cant tell if youre laughing
between each smile theres a tear in your eye
theres a train leaving town in an hour
its not waiting for you and neither am i

and i cant tell if youre laughing
between each smile theres a tear in your eye
theres a train leaving town in an hour
its not waiting for you and neither am i9embed"
