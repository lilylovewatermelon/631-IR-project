fell asleep in the sun
you had to move into the shade
before you fired the gun
you got a hunger for destruction
needed someone to bleed
you sealed the deal before the dawn
you let your actions proceed

prechorus
some sunny day theyre gonna come for you
some sunny day theyre gonna come for you
sooner or later said you know that its true
some sunny day theyre gonna come for you

chorus
you think youre so sly
you tried to roll by
you played the safe side
you said will somebody take me
down town
another james brown
you made the same sound
you said will somebody write this down
down
see cage the elephant liveget tickets as low as 399you might also likefighting back revenge
youve got youre face to the ground
you make excuses for the madness
youve been hanging around
you built a house up in the trees
so you could see everyone
you set the clock and had a run
you set the clock and had a run

prechorus
some sunny day theyre gonna come for you
some sunny day theyre gonna come for you
sooner or later said you know that its true
some sunny day theyre gonna come for you

chorus
you think youre so sly
you tried to roll by
you played the safe side
you said will somebody take me
down town
another james brown
you made the same sound
you said will somebody write this down
down
guitar solo

down deep youre a saint youre a sinner
youre a snake youre a snake youre a snake
but down deep down down deep
oh no youre coming after me
screams

discordant piano

prechorus
some sunny day theyre gonna come for you
some sunny day theyre gonna come for you
sooner or later said you know that its true
some sunny day theyre gonna come for you

chorus
you think youre so sly
you tried to roll by
you played the safe side
you said will somebody take me
down town
another james brown
you made the same sound
you said will somebody write this down
