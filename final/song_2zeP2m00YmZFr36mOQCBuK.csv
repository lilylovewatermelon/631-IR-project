its like sixty girls just me and gang and no one got they phone
get into it if she out with us then she wont make it home
im a tourist fuck me good tonight tomorrow ill be gone
no insurance we cant stop the car im ridin right or wrong

verse 1 lil baby
this shit serious bro just beat his couple charges he comin home
dont play period ill fuck a city girl and send her home
all my jewelry hittin gia certified on every stone
at this point aint even gotta put it on they know whats up with me
i made everybody shine together you know i fuck with gee
sell a thousand pounds of strong for real and that was in a week
ive been focused but im steady climbin im nowhere near my peak
you emotional wont go to war you know that she a freak
like to pop it if i put it on you know that it aint cheap
knock her down and then i break her off i know that shit aint free
nah for real i never paid to hit ill pay a bitch to leave
switches hot so we done stepped it up the glock 17s
i aint backin down from nothin that can talk or can bleed
bruh im somewhere at the world cup im not in your league
you was playin a game when i was on the block chasin my dreams

verse 2 est gee
i was pullin up with testers tucked to pass out to the fiends
i spent fivesomethin on a rolls truck and im fresh from out the streets
drop the price smoke smack and ice my trap a trampoline
said im trippin im still into spinnin speedin off from the scene
baby heard of me for bustin yeeks before he heard me speak yeah before he heard my raps
drop a v like flocks of geese on the island or a beast on the island
break my dog down to grits you want it raw or want it cheap
you a shiner you with me you see them diamonds on our teeth
fuck would i be scared for im sprayin somethin that weigh enough
to decapitate a werewolf a load you know im payin her
fuck here like i care or somethin i eat her i dont smell nothin
baby send me hoes i send him hoes so we be sharin em
richest nigga out my area i came and carried us
gangster im the type to spank him help pay for the burial
4pf and est me and baby james and b
niggas better stay in they league im one of the realest niggas to ever breathe
