theres a cadillac out in the dark
theres a guitar gangster lighting a smoke
and he feels the night and he feels the fire

verse 1
driving into the city unknown
ten small houses what the face in the cold
and then feel the night can you feel the fire

chorus
guitar gangsters and cadillac blood
they came from the road and out of the dark
went into a place even darker
guitar gangsters and cadillac blood

verse 2
walking into a place called the bar
people looking like a ghost had arrived
and he feels the eyes can you feel the eyes

chorus
guitar gangsters and cadillac blood
they came from the road and out of the dark
went into a place even darker
guitar gangsters and cadillac blood

chorus
guitar gangsters and cadillac blood
they came from the road and out of the dark
went into a place even darker
