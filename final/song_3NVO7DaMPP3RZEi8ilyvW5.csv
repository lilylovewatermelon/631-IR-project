i filled up maxed that discover
bought a can of snuff dropped ten for the cover
had fifteen bucks to drink down my supper
i was broke boy
then she walked in the door lookin like a million
never seen her before but man i had a feelin
shes the kind if you swing and miss
itll leave your heart broke boy
funny what you do when you got nothin to lose
so i counted to three eased on up and said

chorus
my truck is parked in the parking lot
in the back seats a halffull rack of beer
i got a spot to stop and watch a star drop
whatcha say we get there and the hell outta here
then a yes turned into an allnight kiss
on the top of a dropped tailgate
and man i couldnt help but think to myself damn
damn son you got some pretty good game for a broke boy

postchorus
broke boy whiskey in your coke boy
broke boy broke boy
you got some pretty good game for a broke boy
broke boy broke boy funny like a joke boy

and she wouldnt be saying that if i never said
