suicide a month before i met you
deep regrets i never could forget you
somehow you made your way to my decade
ayo ayo ayo ayo my girl
in the sun i see you with your guard down
number one youre moving to a hard town
do not dismiss the promise that you made me
ayo ayo ayo ayo my time
overkill you took another red pill
on the sheet is everything that you spilled
we are the ones you want to know right now
ayo ayo ayo ayo black light
come again to murder your report card
just a friend to kiss you in the courtyard
you are the one i want to be stuck with
ayo ayo ayo ayo big fight

prechorus
favor some
way too young
slave to none
way too young

chorus
say goodbye my love i can see it in your soul
say goodbye my love thought that i could make you whole
let your lover sail
death was made to fail
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 2
sticky fingers find a way to take her
crumple up another piece of paper
i know your days are numbered when it comes to
ayo ayo ayo ayo this life
slip away into the solar system
straighter rays you find a way to twist them
some like it dark and now i know where to
ayo ayo ayo ayo find you
serpentine i think she was an aussie
bloody hell a common kamikaze
give up the ghost before you go under
ayo ayo aye ayo wonder
kicking hard and looking for a rescue
watch me starve was never to impress you
i would have killed the part of me to have you
ayo ayo ayo ayo story

chorus
say goodbye my love i can see it in your soul
say goodbye my love thought that i could make you whole
let your lover sail
death was made to fail

bridge
babe i know love is a funny thing
born to die in the eternal spring
verse 3
your flickering is more than just a small flame
welcome to the party its a ball game
pick up the stick its time to get hit with
ayo ayo ayo ayo my bat
suicide is never gonna save you
when i cried it was because i came to
you are the one i want to know right now
ayo ayo ayo ayo kiss this
