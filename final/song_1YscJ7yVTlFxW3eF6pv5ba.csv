wasted on sunday
erase you on monday
allergic allergic
gave in by friday
went straight back to sideways
allergic allergic

prechorus
i took your pills and your drugs just to feel something else
cause i cant feel you no more

chorus
so sad but true
youre friends with all my demons
the only one that sees them
too bad for you
so sad but true
gave a hundred million reasons
but why cant you believe them
too bad for you

verse 2
yeah we fight and we fuck until we open the cuts
and now were soberin up but never sober enough
allergic allergic
instead of holdin me down youre only holding me up
it shouldnt be so hard this is impossible love
