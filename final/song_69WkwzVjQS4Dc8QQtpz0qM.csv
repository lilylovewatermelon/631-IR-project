you know when its twelve oclock in soho baby
its gin oclock where i wake up i dont know
and i think about you though everywhere i go
and ive done everythin and ive been everywhere you know

prechorus
ive been fed gold by sweet fools in abu dhabi
and ive danced real slow with rockettes on dodgy molly

chorus
but ive had no love like your love ooh from nobody
id be appalled if i saw you ever try to be a saint
i wouldnt fall for someone i thought couldnt misbehave
but i want you to know that ive had no love like your love

verse 2
honey when you warm the bed on wednesday
its suicide tuesday back in la
if i had the choice between hearing either noise
the excitement of a thousand or the soothing of your voice

prechorus
at first chance id take the bed warmed by the body woo
i once warmed my hands over a burnin maserati woo
see hozier liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likechorus
still ive had no love like your love from nobody
id be appalled if i saw you ever try to be a saint
i wouldnt fall for someone i thought couldnt misbehave
but i want you to know that ive had no love like your love

outro
and on the other side why should we deny the truth
we could have less to worry about honey i wont lie to you
but everything i do ive had no love like your love8embed"
