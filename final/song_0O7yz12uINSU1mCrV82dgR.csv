i leave the gas on walk the alleys in the dark
sleep with candles burning i leave the door unlocked
im weaving a rope and running all the red lights
did i get your attention cause im sending all the signs that
the clock is ticking and ill be giving my two weeks
pick your favorite shade of black youd best prepare a speech
say something funny say something sweet
but dont say that you loved me

chorus
im still breathing
but weve been dead for a while
this sickness has no cure
were going down for sure
already lost our grip
best abandon ship oh

verse 2
maybe i was too pale maybe i was too fat
maybe you had better better luck in the sack
no formal education i swore way too much
i swear you didnt care cause we were in love
so as i write this letter and shed my last tear know
its all for the better that we end this here
lets close this chapter say one last prayer
but dont say that you loved me

im still breathing
but weve been dead for a while
this sickness has no cure

oh weve been diagnosed
so lets give up the ghost
cause im still breathing
but weve been dead for a while
this sickness has no cure
were going down for sure
already lost our grip
best abandon ship oh
