eyes like a car crash
i know i shouldnt look but i cant turn away
body like a whiplash
salt my wounds but i cant heal the way i feel about you
i watch you like a hawk
i watch you like im gonna tear you limb from limb
will the hunger ever stop
can we simply starve this sin

chorus oli sykes with hannah snowdon
that little kiss you stole it held my heart and soul
and like a deer in the headlights i meet my fate
dont try to fight the storm youll tumble overboard
tides will bring me back to you

verse 2 oli sykes
and on my deathbed
all ill see is you
the life may leave my lungs
but my heart will stay with you

chorus oli sykes with hannah snowdon
that little kiss you stole it held my heart and soul
and like a ghost in the silence i disappear
dont try to fight the storm youll tumble overboard
tides will bring me back to you
you might also likebridge hannah snowdon oli sykes  both
the waves will pull us under
tides will bring me back to you
the waves will pull us under
tides will bring me back to you
the waves will pull us under
tides will bring me back to you
tides will bring me back to you

chorus oli sykes with hannah snowdon
that little kiss you stole it held my heart and soul
and like a ghost in the silence i disappear
dont try to fight the storm youll tumble overboard
tides will bring me back to you
that little kiss you stole it held my heart and soul
and like a deer in the headlights i meet my fate
dont try to fight the storm youll tumble overboard
tides will bring me back to you32embed"
