please dont let this turn into somethin its not
i can only give you everything ive got
i cant be as sorry as you think i should
but i still love you more than anyone else could

verse 2
all that i keep thinkin throughout this whole flight
is it could take my whole damn life to make this right
this splintered mast im holdin on wont save me long
because i know fine well that what i did was wrong

chorus
the last girl and the last reason
to make this last for as long as i could
first kiss and the first time
that i felt connected to anything
the weight of water the way you taught me
to look past everything i had ever learned
the final word in the final sentence
you ever uttered to me was love

verse 3
we have got through so much worse than this before
whats so different this time that you cant ignore
you say it is much more than just my last mistake
and we should spend some time apart for both our sakes
see snow patrol liveget tickets as low as 81you might also likechorus
the last girl and the last reason
to make this last for as long as i could
first kiss and the first time
that i felt connected to anything
the weight of water the way you taught me
to look past everything i had ever learned
the final word in the final sentence
you ever uttered to me was love
the last girl and the last reason
to make this last for as long as i could
first kiss and the first time
that i felt connected to anything
the weight of water the way you taught me
to look past everything i had ever learned
the final word in the final sentence
you ever uttered to me was love

outro
and i dont know where to look
my words just break and melt
please just save me from this darkness
please just save me from this darkness
and i dont know where to look
my words just break and melt
please just save me from this darkness
please just save me from this darkness3embed"
