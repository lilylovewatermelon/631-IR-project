sunday mornings were your favorite
i used to meet you down on woods creek road
you did your hair up like you were famous
even though its only church where we were going
now sunday mornings i just sleep in
its like ive buried my faith with you
im screaming at a god i dont know if i believe in
cause i dont know what else i can do

chorus
im still holding on to everything thats dead and gone
i dont wanna say goodbye cause this one means forever
now youre in the stars and six feets never felt so far
here i am alone between the heavens and the embers
oh it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
you took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

verse 2
digging through your old birthday letters
a crumpled twenty still in the box
i dont think that i could ever find a way to spend it
even if its the last twenty that ive got

chorus
oh im still holding on to everything thats dead and gone
i dont wanna say goodbye cause this one means forever
now youre in the stars and six feets never felt so far
here i am alone between the heavens and the embers
oh it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
you took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces

im still holding on holding on holding on
im still holding on holding on holding on
im still holding on holding on im still holding on
im still ooh still holding on

chorus
im still holding on to everything thats dead and gone
i dont wanna say goodbye cause this one means forever
now youre in the stars and six feets never felt so far
here i am alone between the heavens and the embers
oh it hurts so hard for a million different reasons
you took the best of my heart and left the rest in pieces5embed"
