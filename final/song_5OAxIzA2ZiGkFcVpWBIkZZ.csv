honey honey
honey you still prey on my mind
i tried thumbing freight train jumping
baby nothing leaves you behind

chorus
so i jump up find me a mountain
shake of the sheep i been counting
chase that sun til it runs out of sky
and if your memorys still too strong
ill keep moving on and get longer gone

verse 2
now there are those who
swear that i belong in a padded room
cause i cant sleep baby you keep
creeping up like the light of a crescent moon

chorus
so i jump up find me a mountain
shake of the sheep i been counting
chase that sun til it runs out of sky
and if your memorys still too strong
ill keep moving on and get longer gone
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likeverse 3
it would be easy if i never loved you
found someone new
but until i do

chorus
i jump up find me a mountain
shake of the sheep i been counting
chase that sun til it runs out of sky
and if your memorys still too strong
ill keep moving on and get longer gone

outro
honey honey
honey you still prey on my mindembed"
