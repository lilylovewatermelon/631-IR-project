lets dance in style lets dance for a while
heaven can wait were only watching the skies
hoping for the best but expecting the worst
are you gonna drop the bomb or not
let us die young or let us live forever
we dont have the power but we never say never
sitting in a sandpit life is a short trip
the musics for the sad men

chorus mr hudson  jayz
forever young i wanna be forever young
do you really want to live forever forever and ever uh
forever young young i wanna be forever young forever young
ayy may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows
do you really want to live forever forever forever young
but we aint even thinkin that far ya know what i mean

verse 1 jayz
so we living life like a video video
where the sun is always out and you never get old
and the champagnes always cold and the musics always good
and the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
and they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
without a wrinkle in today cause theres no tomorrow
just a pictureperfect day that last a whole lifetime
and it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
so lets just stay in the moment smoke some weed drink some wine
reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
leave a mark they cant erase neither space nor time
so when the director yells cut ill be fine
im forever young
