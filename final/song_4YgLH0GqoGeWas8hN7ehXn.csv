when the world is on your shoulder
gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
if you cant hang with the feelin
then there aint no room for you in this part of town

cause were the party people night and day
livin crazy thats the only way

so tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
and just enjoy yourself
