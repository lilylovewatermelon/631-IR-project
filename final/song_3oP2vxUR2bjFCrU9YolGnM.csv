something inside the cards i know is right
dont want to live somebody elses life
this is what i want to be and this is what i give to you because i get it free
she smiles while i do my time
i could die for you
oh this life i choose

verse
im here to be your only gobetween
to tell you of the sights these eyes have seen
what i really want to do is turn it into motion beauty that i cant abuse
you know that i use my senses too

bridge
you can see that its only everywhere
id take it all in then id find a way to share

prechorus
come along and go along with me
wander with me yo its all for free

chorus
i could die for you what you wanna do
oh this life i choose
i could die for you what you wanna do
oh this life i choose

come again and tell me where you wanna go
what it means for me to be with you alone
close the door and no one has to know
how we are

prechorus
come along and go along with me
wander with me yo its all for free

chorus
i could die for you what you wanna do
oh this life i choose
i could die for you what you wanna do
oh this life i choose make me wanna say
i could die for you what you wanna do
oh this life i choose
i could die for you what you wanna do
oh this life i choose8embed"
