music gets the best of me
but guess who gets the rest of me
and theres no need for jealousy
music gets the best of me

verse 1
ive got to tell you something
youre not my first ever love
men come and go ive noticed
but my first loves going strong
he swept me off my feet strong
with melody and simple beat strong
a touch and i feel complete
music is my love you see yeah

chorus
music gets the best of me
but guess who gets the rest of me
and theres no need for jealousy
music gets the best of me

verse 2
without the beat im nothing
without a song in my heart
id be a different girlfriend
but were all here so lets start
the things he says are always true start
hes never going to change his tune start
and though youre still the boy for me
music is my life you see yeah
