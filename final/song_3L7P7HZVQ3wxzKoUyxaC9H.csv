wamono theres me theres you
ホコ天
in a pedestrian paradise
where the catwalk got its claws meow
a subculture in a kaleidoscope of fashion
prowl the streets of harajuku
いらっしゃいませ

verse 1
super lovers tell me where you got yours
at the super lovers store
yohji yamamoto im hanging with the locals
where the catwalk got its claws
all you fashion knowitalls
with your underground malls
in the world of harajuku
putting on a show when you dress up in your clothes
wild hair color and cell phones
your accessories are dead on

chorus
harajuku girls you got the wicked style
i like the way that you are i am your biggest fan
harajuku girls you got the wicked style
i like the way that you are i am your biggest fan

im fascinated by the japanese fashion scene
just an american girl in the tokyo streets
my boyfriend bought me a hysteric glamour shirt
theyre hard to find in the states got me feeling couture
its really cool
whats that you got on is it comme des garçons
vivienne westwood cant go wrong
mixed up with secondhand clothes
lets not forget about john galliano no
flipped the landscape when nigo made a bathing ape
i got expensive taste oh well
i guess i better save up

chorus
harajuku girls you got the wicked style
i like the way that you are i am your biggest fan
harajuku girls you got the wicked style
i like the way that you are i am your biggest fan
harajuku girls you got the wicked style
i like the way that you are i am your biggest fan

you bring style and color all around the world
you harajuku girls
you bring style and color all around the world

verse 3
your look is so distinctive like dna
like nothing ive ever seen in the usa
your underground culture visual grammar
the language of your clothing is something to encounter
a pingpong match between eastern and western
did you see your inspiration in my latest collection
just wait till you get your little hands on lamb
cause its super kawaii
that means super cute in japanese
the streets of harajuku are your catwalk
bishoujo youre so vogue
thats what you drop
cho saikou harajuku girls
and thats what you drop thats what you drop
cho saikou harajuku girls

a fatal attraction to cuteness
