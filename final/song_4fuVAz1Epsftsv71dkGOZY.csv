your protectors coming home
keep your secrets with you girl
safe from the outside world
you walk along the stream
your head caught in a waking dream
your protectors coming home coming home

as you lay to die beside me baby
on the morning that you came

as you lay to die beside me baby
on the morning that you came
would you wait for me
the other one would wait for me

you run with the devil
