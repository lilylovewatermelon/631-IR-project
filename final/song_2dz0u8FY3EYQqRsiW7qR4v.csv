verse 1 matthew hall
im wishing on a star and trying to believe
that even though its far hell find me christmas eve
i guess that santas busy cause he never comes around
i think of him when christmas comes to town

verse 2 megan moore
the best time of the year when everyone comes home
with all this christmas cheer its hard to be alone
putting up the christmas tree with friends who come around
its so much fun when christmas comes to town

chorus meagan moore matthew hall both
presents for the children wrapped in red and green
all the things ive heard about but never really seen
no one will be sleeping on the night of christmas eve
hoping santas on his way

and all the dreams of children
once lost will all be found
