on the subject of you being gone forever
i still cant believe it i cant see it
i should just stop counting days
on the subject of the future
wouldnt it be nice to leave it open ended
and pretend it could go either way

chorus
if i could have you back again
id think about it once or twice i guess
if i could have you back
id reconsider maybe id say yes
on the other hand it would be better to have a life
without the constant indecision over
if i could have you back
if i could have you back

verse 2
on the topic of the time we spent together
i cant say i never wonder
if you ever think about those days

chorus
if i could have you back again
id think about it once or twice i guess
if i could have you back
id reconsider maybe id say yes
on the other hand it would be better to have a life
without the constant indecision over
if i could have you back

its game over youve lost this round
and now i get to turn you down
thanks for all the lessons learned
im takin in what i have heard
practice makes perfect

chorus
if i could have you back again
id think about it once or twice i guess
if i could have you back
id reconsider maybe id say yes
on the other hand it would be better to have a life
without the constant indecision
if i could have you back again
id think about it once or twice i guess
if i could have you back
id reconsider maybe id say yes
on the other hand it would be better to have a life
without the constant indecision over
if i could have you back
if i could have you backembed"
