intro
i cant help but feel neglected
changin up the schedule your calendar refreshin
time pass and we move on nobody says shit
how im posed to act when my morals aint respected
how you posed to act when your feelings aint protected
im cashin checks just to get some neck and some necklaces
whats next war and turbulence prayin on this plane
success got a taste of it never was the same

verse 1

im sick of you niggas not taking a risk
im taking advantage and taking my course kill em

my tolerance low i dont tolerate force
i protect i am the one
i rose up for the score
i gotta let my ego go
you niggas not ready to settle the war yeah
you niggas not ready to stop bein hoes
you niggas not ready to open the doors
you niggas run in take off with the drawer
you niggas not really the richest on forbes
you niggas not ready to deal with the sacrifices
and instead youre passin the torch
and check the surveillance camera at the cemetery
see me dancin on all of your corpse go

segue

part ii

verse 1 baby keem
ayy e38
got pulled over twice had to go and switch plates

and im goin home with the loot
mama goin home with a coupe

chorus rosalía  baby keem
im a hot girl

im a hot girl make me lose my mind

verse 2 baby keem
i took the lac then hopped on the flight
i cannot look towards your jaded advice
i took the torch i quit being nice
i took the torch now i gotta fight
you niggas impulsive quick to make moves
youre biting your flows a big appetite
i look at the hoes they not at your shows
i look at your shows they oprah white
you gotta be nimble and quick like a fox
i dont move in silence this shit is abrupt
im vvsed up precise in the cut
did she get a nut its not about me
as long as you good dont worry bout me
im telling my friends that you not a freak
my new nia long is kaepernick strong
and she not afraid to get on one knee
im back at the crib my memory deep
i think about mama im baby hykeem
she got that tatted before i could read
im spiritual now i pray in my sleep
twenty years long i never had dad
my dad was a fraud i had to be tough
twenty million ho thats not enough
dont ask no questions bitch go add it up
i took the light to sacrifice
i sacrificed everything i need
i could probably fuck these bitches in my sleep
young nigga know the hustle and the ps
stressing bout money turned to other things
i was in uncle crib at fourteen
cant get through to mama cause shed rather drink
facin eviction by the thirteenth
refrain baby keem
i was fifteen i was sixteen
i was fifteen i was sixteen
i was fifteen i was sixteen
i was fifteen i was sixteen

chorus rosalía  baby keem
im a hot girl
a hot girl
im a hot girl make me lose my mind
a hot girl19embed"
