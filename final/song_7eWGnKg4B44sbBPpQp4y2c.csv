i feel kinda fly standin next to you
baby girl how do i look in my durag
would you tell me the truth
stay with me and love me through the night endlessly
ima keep on all my chains when im makin love to you
hold me close and let me squeeze you tight through the night
but baby girl how do i look in my durag
would you tell me the truth

verse 2
do you like my new whip
watch me go zoom zoom
baby girl how do i look in my durag
would you tell me the truth lie to me
stay with me and love me through the night endlessly
i just wanna know how you feel
tell me am i doin it right

verse 3
i may be covered in cat hair but i still smell good
baby let me know how do i look in my durag
dont lie to me let me rock you all night long
im tryna impress you girl
let me know how do i look in my durag
im tryna get intimate
let me love you like you never been before baby ah ah

you dont have to like my video games or my comic books
but baby girl how do i look in my durag
did i tie it right
did you wear that dress just for me
cause im tryna smash
baby girl ima smash in my durag
cause its only right

verse 5
do you like the way my ice drips in the light
baby girl do you like me in my durag
let me know
would you let me know
let me know girl
lets make love until we fall asleep
i like the way you feel next to me
baby you look so good in this moonlight
stay with me and love me through the night baby
lets make love until we fall asleep17embed"
