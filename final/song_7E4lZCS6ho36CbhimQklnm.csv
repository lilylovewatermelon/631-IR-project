cmon

verse 1
i used to go out to parties and stand around
cause i was too nervous to really get down
but my body yearned to be free
i went off on the floor so somebody would choose me
no more standing upside the wall
now i got myself together baby and im having a ball
long as youre groovin theres always a chance
somebody watchin might wanna make romance
move your body ooh baby and dance all night
to the groovin feel all right
move your body owh and move your feet
cause the djs groovin owh and it sounds so sweet cmon
then just party all night long
cause this party is jumpin till the break of dawn

chorus
sexy baby sexy baby
sexy baby sexy baby baby

verse 2

goin crazy in this place tonight
