im coming up only to hold you under
im coming up only to show youre wrong
and to know you is hard we wonder
to know you all wrong we won

really too late to call so we wait for
morning to wake you is all we got
and to know me as hardly golden
is to know me all wrong they warn

at every occasion ill be ready for the funeral
at every occasion once more its called the funeral
at every occasion oh im ready for the funeral
at every occasion oh one billion day funeral
