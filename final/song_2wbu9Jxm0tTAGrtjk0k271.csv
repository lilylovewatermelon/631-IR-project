been busted for things that i did and i didnt do
i cant say im proud of all of the things that ive done
but i can say ive never intentionally hurt anyone

ive always been different with one foot over the line
winding up somewhere one step ahead or behind
it aint been so easy but i guess i shouldnt complain
ive always been crazy but its kept me from going insane

beautiful lady are you sure that you understand
the chances your taking loving a free living man
are you really sure you really want what you see
be careful of something thats just what you want it to be

ive always been crazy but its kept me from going insane
nobody knows if its something to bless or to blame
so far i aint found a rhyme or a reason to change
ive always been crazy but its kept me from going insaneyou might also like4embed"
