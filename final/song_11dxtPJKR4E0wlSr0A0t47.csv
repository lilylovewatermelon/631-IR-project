verse 1 aly
it took too long it took too long it took too long
for you to call back
and normally i would just forget that
except for the fact it was my birthday my stupid birthday
i played along i played along i played along
rolled right off my back
but obviously my armor was cracked
what kind of a boyfriend would forget that
who would forget that

prechorus aly aj
the type of guy who doesnt see
what he has until she leaves
dont let me go
cause without me you know youre lost
wise up now or pay the cost
soon you will know

chorus aly  aj
