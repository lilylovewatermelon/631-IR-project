oh look at how she listens
she says nothing of what she thinks
she just goes stumbling through her memories
staring out onto grey street
she thinks hey how did i come to this
i dream myself a thousand times around the world
but i cant get out of this place

chorus
theres an emptiness inside her
and shed do anything to fill it in
but all the colors mix together  to grey
and it breaks her heart

verse 2
how she wishes it was different
she prays to god most every night
and though she swears it doesnt listen
theres still a hope in her it might
she says i pray
but they fall on deaf ears
am i supposed to take it on myself
to get out of this place

chorus
theres loneliness inside her
and shed do anything to fill it in
and though its red blood bleeding from her now
it feels like cold blue ice in her heart
when all the colors mix together  to grey
and it breaks her heart

theres a stranger speaks outside her door
says take what you can from your dreams
make them as real as anything
itd take the work out of the courage
but she says please
theres a crazy man thats creeping outside my door
i live on the corner of grey street
and the end of the world

chorus
theres an emptiness inside her
and shed do anything to fill it in
and though its red blood bleeding from her now
its more like cold blue ice in her heart
she feels like kicking out all the windows
and setting fire to this life
she could change everything about her
using colors bold and bright
but all the colors mix together  to grey
and it breaks her heart
it breaks her heart
