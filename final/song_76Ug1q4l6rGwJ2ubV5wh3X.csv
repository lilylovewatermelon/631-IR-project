verse roots manuva
snatch a piece of my wonderin distantfar like yonderin
skin of my tooth like skin of my boot like
fly in my soup like wheres the waitress
can i take this really can i finish this
these airs and all these graces
its my mistake ill make it
jdub to the boom now make it
bounce wiggle bounce wiggle shakin all them bangs out
chemical cutthroats bound to blow the brain out
cut to the brain this aint no game
ill show no shame ill birth this blame
im twisted cain ill twist again
ill push the blade as plain as day
known to what these sayers say known to what these doers do
its you and who and youknowwhere wes about to take it there
wes about to make it clear we happy on we lonesome
the long jump the beat heart its start to finish
ten spoons of spinach the soul and the spillage
the cup that runneth over return of the ogre

close your eyes and see
when there aint no light
all youll ever be come and save the night
cause i dont believe
when the morning comes
it doesnt seem to say an awful lot to me
