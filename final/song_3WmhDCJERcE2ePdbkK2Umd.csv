well i drank till i stumbled i drank till i fell
when the drunk part was over it hurt me like hell
now i know about drinkin so i know one things true
bein drunks a lot like lovin you

verse 1
cause i loved till i stumbled i loved till i fell
when the lovin was over it hurt me like hell
now i know what a taste of the wrong love can do
bein drunks a lot like lovin you

chorus
and ive woke up some mornins and sworn off the drink
at that ive done reasonably well i think
but i havent done well swearin off you and me
at that ive failed miserably

verse 2
well ive felt the hangover of lovin all night
ive sat at the bar all alone in a fight
ive bottled up feelins and poured em out too
bein drunks a lot like lovin you

chorus
and ive woke up some mornins and sworn off the drink
at that ive done reasonably well i think
but i havent done well swearin off you and me
at that ive failed miserably

well i drank till i stumbled i loved till i fell
when the drunk part was over love hurt me like hell
now i know about drinkin so i know one things true
bein drunks a lot like lovin you

outro
though i know what a taste of the wrong love can do
sometimes i still get drunk lovin youembed"
