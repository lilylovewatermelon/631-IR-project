so vengeful and mother earth has been done wrong
and i think she sick yo shes pukin up lava
her nerves tremble along fault lines ready to drop
an entire city of filth thats been forced upon her
we built these towers of babylon and feel remorse for nadda
the momma divorced the father the children are dropping blotters
the rich get richer povertys hot under the collar
takin prayer out of schools and we tryin to raise scholars
creationism versus the theory of evolution
air water and mind body and soul pollution
kids steppin on landmines from wars we all losin
we chasin false idols and racin from our bibles
the golden rule the youth are becoming more suicidal
who teachers em you and i do no wonder they wanna fight you
raised by hypocrites youve been lied to

graffiti the land with skyscrapers
graffiti the sky with airplanes and satellites
graffiti the mind of children with your man made laws
graffiti the world i saw the writing on the wall

we got abc nbc mtv tnt
the bbc dvd vhs dsl
ae xtc mp3 fcc
thc nra gop add
the fight for free speech lack of responsibility
thieves in positions of power internet pornography
guns in the home for fear that the next knock at the door
could be death the terrorists are in the white house and overseas
racists seperatists vicious malicious
buddhists the hindus the muslims the christians
could it be our biggest barrier is language
or is oil that important that one would inflict anguish
so cars could deplete the ozone on highways
that stretch across the land where indians once raised
families were in denial the world is afraid
and you say theres no more slaves

graffiti the sky with airplanes and satellites
graffiti the mind of children with your man made laws
graffiti the world i saw the writing on the wall

were addicted to planes trains and automobiles
were addicted to addiction we dig living in fiction
for money power respect the army gotta go kill
they under contract so let the blood spill
its sorta morbid aint it the picture that i just painted
its an epiphany i had i realised just how tainted
i think it really is while in new york when i saw
a teenager being arrested for taggin a fuckin wall

graffiti the land with skyscrapers
graffiti the sky with airplanes and satellites
graffiti the mind of children with your man made laws
graffiti the world i saw the writing on the wall
