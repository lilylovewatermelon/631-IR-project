the softening of sound
draws us closed again

stay stay and watch the coals
till they cease to glow
like empty promises

why why did you go why did you go away
why why did you go why did you go away

baby

theres nothing i can say
nothing i can do
to bring you back again

this of life i know is true
its all a falling through
and so i reach for you

why why did you go why did you go away
why why did you go why did you go away

dont you care
that it may seem unfair
you steal things you ought to borrow
dont you find
that it may seem unkind
id rather breathe than drown in sorrow

why did you go away baby
why why did you go
why did you go away babyembed"
