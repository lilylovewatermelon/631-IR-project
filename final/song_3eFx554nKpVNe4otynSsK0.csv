lets go down now into the darkness of your thoughts
hurry up now were waiting for us to fall
i fall to pieces now a broken mirror in your life i fall to pieces now
the silence in black and white
falling forward as she walks towards the light

chorus jt woodruff with casey calvert
i know
im outside of your window with my radio

verse 2 jt woodruff matt ridenour
i sleep with one eye open so i can see you breathing i sleep with one eye open
i follow your chest home until i so i can see you breathing
i can see you i can hear you breathe in exhale
the silence in black and white

chorus jt woodruff with casey calvert
i know
im outside of your window with my radio
i know
im outside of your window with my radio
