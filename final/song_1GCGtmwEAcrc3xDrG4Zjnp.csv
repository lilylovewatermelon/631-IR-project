and i drive the main road
searching in the sun
for another overload
i hear you singing in the wires
i can hear you through the whine
and the wichita lineman
is still on the line

i know i need a small vacation
but it dont look like rain
and if it snows
that stretch down south
wont ever stand the strain

and i need you more than want you
and i want you for all time
and the wichita lineman
is still on the line

and i need you more than want you
and i want you for all time
and the wichita lineman
is still on the lineyou might also likeembed"
