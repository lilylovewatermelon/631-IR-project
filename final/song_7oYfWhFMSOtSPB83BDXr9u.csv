youre hidden by your good looks your fake smile
i loved you but it took me a long while
to realize you dont even care
all the feelings you had none
theres only one word that describes you
and thats hypocrite

i looked over you
i looked over me
look at you and smile
you fucking pedophile
i looked over you
i looked over me
look at you and smile
pedophile

seduction tied down
decapitation insane
oh youre not my friend
this is the end suck it
