verse 1
look
concoction of hamentashens okay
launchin a bottle rocket okay
done bein nice im here for your life and all the profits whoa
im not your conscience you nuts almonds and h√§agendazs
auction off your grandfathers watch from the holocaust okay
im iconic naked walk in the garden bird watchin
alarmin all of these cardinals like i need a pope pope
puffin that white smoke smoke get faded and play the maestro
im ice cold bunny slippers nice robe probably velvet
sneaky bitch stole my rollie last night yo night yo
i might know some dyke hoes who can fight though yeah
walkin on a tight rope underneath a microscope
but closeup we all just molecules and isotopes thats very deep
my psychic dont know the future
to live life you kids might just close your computer get some exercise
the street lights might blind you though blind you though
make a collage and look at it through a kaleidoscope

chorus
theres a bird in the sky
look at him fly why
