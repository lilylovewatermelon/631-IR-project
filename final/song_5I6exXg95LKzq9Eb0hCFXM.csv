the afternoon has settled long and heady on my shoulders
the winters light feels different on my skin
it doesnt seem to strike as far below the surface so
i have to conclude that shadow wont let it in
that shadow wont let it in shadow wont let it in

hook
december
youve always been a problem child
december
you run me down right restless and wild
and i remember when you used to be mine
december
december

verse 2
the leaves are all still changing the weather here is mild and vacant
a winters blooming on los angeles
the artificial cold is more than i was hoping for
but not enough to consume the darkened state im in
the darkened state im in the darkened state im in

hook
december
youve always been a problem child
december
you run me down right restless and wild
and i remember when you used to be mine
december
december

distill a whole year down into a day
act like we all start over with a pristine slate
but to get yourself a new life youve got to give the other one away
and im starting to believe in the power of a name
cause it cant be a mistake if i just call it change

outro
december
cant turn around now
december
break the chain cant live in circles again2embed"
