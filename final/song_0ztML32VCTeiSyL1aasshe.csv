dont leave i think i love you

verse 1
now baby dont tell me that i missed my chance
i havent heard last call would you like to dance
ive been sitting here waiting on you all night
why dont you give me that old goodtogo green light

im rushing along but at least i got to ask
i couldnt live with myself if you got away
im a love sick puppy baby what do you say

chorus

i just saw the rest of my life honey youre in it
wont you hear what i say give me a minute
dont leave i think i love you

its late and been a long night youre tired i know
aw dont break my heart baby please dont go

i got a lot to say and a short time to do it
aw dont walk away honey im just trying to
aw listen to me talking im a babbling fool

chorus
dont leave i think i love you
i just saw the rest of my life honey youre in it
wont you hear what i say give me a minute
