hadnt had a good time since you know when
got talked into goin out with hopes you were stayin in
i was feelin like myself for the first time in a long time
until i bumped into some of your friends over there talkin to mine

chorus
then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
baby without warning
i was doin alright but just your sight
had my heart stormin’
the moon went hidin’ stars quit shinin’
rain was drivin’ thunder lightnin
you wrecked my whole world when you came
and hit me like a hurricane
you hit me like a hurricane

verse 2
knew it was gonna be a long night
from the moment when
we locked eyes over whiskey on ice
started talkin bout us again
if i woulda just laid my drink down
and walked out
i wouldnt be in my truck
driving us to your house
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likechorus
but you rolled in with your hair in the wind
baby without warning
i was doin alright but just your sight
had my heart stormin’
the moon went hidin’ stars quit shinin’
rain was drivin’ thunder lightning
you wrecked my whole world when you came
and hit me like a hurricane
you hit me like a hurricane

bridge
a category 5
with your smile
blew me away
and girl it aint but midnight
you done killed the lights
bent my heart back to your bedside

chorus
then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
baby without warning
i was doing alright but just your sight
had my heart stormin
the moon went hidin’ stars quit shinin’
rain was drivin’ thunder n lightning
you wrecked my whole world when you came
and hit me like a hurricane
you hit me like a hurricane
you hit me like a hurricane9embed"
