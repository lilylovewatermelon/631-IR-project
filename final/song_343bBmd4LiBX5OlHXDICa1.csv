a devastating backstroke
all the way from france
with shiny shiny cufflinks
a shirtsleeve to enhance

chorus 1
the pinstriped men of morning
are coming forward to dance
with pure egyptian cotton
the kids dont stand a chance

verse 2
you criticize the practice
by murdering their plants
ignoring all the history
denying them romance

chorus 2
the pinstriped men of morning
are coming forward to dance
fortymillion dollars
the kids dont stand a chance

verse 3
i didnt like the business
but that was at first glance
your pillow feels so soft now
but still you must advance
see vampire weekend liveget tickets as low as 73you might also likechorus 3
the pinstriped men of morning
the partners in the dance
the papers shot to pieces
the kids dont stand a chance17embed"
