verse 1 billie joe armstrong
im the son of rage and love
the jesus of suburbia
the bible of none of the above
on a steady diet of
sodapop and ritalin
no one ever died for my sins in hell
as far as i can tell
least the ones i got away with

chorus billie joe armstrong
and theres nothin wrong with me
this is how im supposed to be
in a land of makebelieve
that dont believe in me

verse 2 billie joe armstrong
get my television fix
sitting on my crucifix
the livin room or my private womb
while the moms and brads are away
to fall in love and fall in debt
to alcohol and cigarettes and mary jane
to keep me insane
doin someone elses cocaine
see green day liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likechorus billie joe armstrong
and theres nothin wrong with me
this is how im supposed to be
in a land of makebelieve
that dont believe in me

part ii city of the damned

verse 3 billie joe armstrong
at the center of the earth in the parkin lot
of the 7eleven where i was taught
the motto was just a lie
it says home is where your heart is but what a shame
cause everyones heart doesnt beat the same
its beating out of time

chorus billie joe armstrong  mike dirnt
city of the dead hey hey
at the end of another lost highway hey hey
signs misleading to nowhere
city of the damned hey hey
lost children with dirty faces today hey hey
no one really seems to care
verse 4 billie joe armstrong
i read the graffiti in the bathroom stall
like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall
and so it seemed to confess
it didnt say much but it only confirmed
that the center of the earth is the end of the world
and i could really care less

chorus billie joe armstrong  mike dirnt
city of the dead hey hey
at the end of another lost highway hey hey
signs misleading to nowhere
city of the damned hey hey
lost children with dirty faces today hey hey
no one really seems to care hey
