how could you question gods existence
when you question god himself
why would you ask for gods assistance
if you wouldnt take the help

chorus 1
if youre gone then i need you
if youre gone then how is any of this real
when im on i believe you
when im not my knees dont even seem to feel

chorus 2
how could you tell me that im great
when they chewed me up spit me out and pissed on me
why would you tell me that its fate
when they laughed at me every day in my face

verse 2
they say the end is coming sooner
but the ends already here
i said today is but a rumor
that well laugh at in a year
or two or three or four or five whatever
