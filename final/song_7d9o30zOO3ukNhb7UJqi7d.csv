if you give a cowboy a horse and a stretch of fence
you can bet the farm hell ride all day
til the whole damn thing is fixed
hell come dragging back around along about supper time

verse 2
if you give a cowboy a truck on a friday night
hell pull a hundred dollar bill from the coffee can
spray the mud off of them tires
drop twenty dollars in the tank
save the rest for beer
so all you girls in here need to know this

chorus
if you give a cowboy a kiss hell want more
hes gonna want to give you a twist out on that hardwood floor
if you let him girl if you let him
hes gonna sit you down on his tailgate
pull out his guitar and play some george strait
pretty baby thats just the way it is
if you give a cowboy a kiss

verse 2
if you tell a cowboy he cant hell prove he can
cause there really aint nothing much
that he cant do with his two hands
he can fight his way out of corners
or he can softly lay you down
there aint no time like now to find out

if you give a cowboy a kiss hell want more
hes gonna want to give you a twist out on that hardwood floor
if you let him girl if you let him

if you give a cowboy a kiss

hear the ocean wind itll take the shore
if you take a chance on love tonight heres whats in store

chorus
if you give a cowboy a kiss
if you give a cowboy a kiss
hes gonna sit you down on his tailgate
pull out his guitar and play some george strait
pretty baby thats just the way it is
if you give a cowboy a kiss
