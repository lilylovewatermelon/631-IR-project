the words i speak are wildfires and weeds
they spread like some awful damn disease
i swear i didn’t mean what i said
i swear i didn’t mean it

verse 2
now listen close you owe me ears for dropping eaves
forget it all you caught me in a moment weak
sometimes i just can’t help myself
sometimes i can’t help myself at all

chorus
are we allies or enemies
this will be the death of me

verse 3
remember when i could tell you not to smile when you were mad
and you would always crack
and we’d both be laughing in the end
now you’re not so quick to forget

chorus
are we allies or enemies
this will be the death of me
this will be the death of me
all is fair in love and war but i can’t fight with you anymore
this will be the death of me
see the crane wives liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likebridge
what happens now do we have another go
do we bow out and take our separate roads
i’ll admit i’ve had my doubts
but i want to be let in not out
but i want to be let in not out

chorus
are we allies or enemies
this will be the death of me
this will be the death of me
all is fair in love and war but i can’t fight with you anymore
this will be the death of me
are we allies or enemies
this will be the death of me2embed"
