verse 3 pitbull
been around the world same old songs
now on stage after bras and thongs
long way from what i came from
fighting in the club for just singing a song
now my passports full im outta pages
new places new faces new fans all ages
black pink purple orange caucasians
latinos europeans and asians
in japan they knew all my lyrics it was amazing
they spoke spanish
que ma carne ni ma carne asi viene el sandwich
i guess its true what they say
music is the universal language
its a true blessing you know
to travel the globe
chorus bob
ill play across the world
across the world across the world
ill play across the world
across the world across the world
ill play across the worldembed"
