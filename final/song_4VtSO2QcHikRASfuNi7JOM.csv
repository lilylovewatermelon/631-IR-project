the seas have parted the endings started
the sky has turned to black
a killin spree through eternity
the devil stabs you in the back
its midnight now you must escape somehow
torture is his leisure
dont try to hide hell make you subside
as he exchanges pain for pleasure

chorus steve jocz
pain for pleasure
hes the hunter youre the game
pain for pleasure
satan is his name
