verse 1
get dressed in your bed
while shes asleep
it isn’t right
but it isn’t hard
tell me tell me won’t you understand
show me show me show me a better plan
it’s summer lies
its someone elses nothing
here it comes now

prechorus
you asked me to stay
you asked me to stay
you asked me to stay
but there’s a million reasons to leave

chorus
find a job
find a friend
find a home
find a dog
settle down
out of town
find a dream
shut it down
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likeverse 2
please please don’t point it that way
it’s just a trigger that goes once and you’ll be unafraid
i wish that id been noticed but it never goes that way
the silence that you brought has gone gone gone
tell me tell me won’t you understand
show me show me show me

prechorus
you asked me to stay
you asked me to stay
you asked me to stay
but there’s a million reasons to leave

bridge
show me what to say
show me what to be
show me what to see
show me what to be

chorus
find a job
find a friend
find a home
find a dog
settle down
out of town
find a dream
shut it down
outro
i don’t wanna be in there with you
i dont wanna be in there without your loving either
i waited for your thoughts
cant wait no longer17embed"
