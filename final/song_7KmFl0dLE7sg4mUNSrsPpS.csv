some folks sit and wait
on government checks
some of us have the
sun beating down on our necks
weve all got the same damn thing in mind
an all screen door that swings
neath the neon sign

chorus
nah we dont need a reason
to get down
turn the jukebox up to ten
son throw em down
keep those long necks cold on ice
before too long it sure be nice
just might have to buy
the house around
in this little all lonesome dixie town

verse 2
someone throw some cornmeal
down on the floor
so me and my baby can shuffle
just a little bit more
then i think we look funny
the way that we move
thats our thing and
we got our own groove

nah we dont need a reason
to get down

keep those long necks cold on ice
before too long it sure be nice
just might have to buy

nah we dont need a reason
