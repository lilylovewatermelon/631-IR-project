i like a woman with a future and a past
a little attitude problem all good itll make the shit last
dont make it too easy girl dont take it too fast
yeah thats it right there thats it do it just like that
only you can do it just like that
and i love it when your hair still wet cause you just took a shower
running on a treadmill and only eating salad
sound so smart like you graduated college
like you went to yale but you probably went to howard knowing you
weekend in miami tryna study by the pool
couple things due but you always get it done
mightve been a time where i loved her too
but you take that away and youve always been the one one
i wonder why the moon looks nice girl
maybe its just right for the night
you said niggas coming on too strong girl
they want you in they life as a wife
thats why you wanna have no sex why you wanna protest
why you wanna fight for your right
cause you dont love them boys
pussy run everything fuck that noise

prechorus drake
i know things get hard but girl you got it girl you got it there you go
cant you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go
wonderin whats on your mind it must be hard to be that fine
when all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
its just amazing girl and all i can say is

verse 2 nicki minaj
bbbbet i am
all of them bitches im badder than
mansions in malibu babylon
but i never mention everything i dabble in
and i always ride slow when im straddling
and my shits so wet you gotta paddle in
gotta rrrow gotta row your boat
its pink friday records and ovo
done did the pop tour im the realest still
the best legal team so the deals is ill
its mac opi and a fragrance too
apparel im dominatin every avenue
cobblestone good view little gravel too
gotta pay for the entourage travel too
cause im flflfly im flyin high
aint got time to talk just hi and bye bitch
but baby if you ask me to take a break
ill give it all away dont care what the people say
could be a million billion trillion miles away
he asked my sign i said a sag
im a star sheriff badge
whats the point if im guardin
doubled up hoes dolly parton
prechorus drake
i know things get hard but girl you got it girl you got it there you go
