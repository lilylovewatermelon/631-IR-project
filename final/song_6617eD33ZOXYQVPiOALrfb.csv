i lost her trail on a friday night
she was gone before i got home
shed been getting restless
in that big house all alone
ive been up and down these city streets
for three nights in a row
and lord its hard to find that girl
when she gets the urge to go

chorus
its kinda like a lost and found
in a border town
asking bout a diamond ring
they just look at you
like youve lost your mind
say they havent seen a thing
but i know shes been here lately
i can still smell her perfume
and she gets crazy on a full moon

verse 2
and i know shell be coming back
her car is waiting right outside
but i dont want to think about
whos taking her for a ride
and her unpredictability
is what i love about her best
lord ive got to find her quick
before she does something i regret

shes out there somewhere
burning up the night
somehow ive got to run her down
im running out of time
