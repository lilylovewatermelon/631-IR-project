you saw me lost and treading water
i looked pathetic i looked as helpless as a stinger without a bee
but underneath my presentation yeah
i knew the walls were coming down and the stones that fell were aiming away from me uh

chorus
hey what would it mean to you what would it mean to you
to know that itll come back around again
hey whatever it means to you whatever it means to you
know that everything moves in circles yeah

verse 2
i saw you standing in my headlights blink blink blink
i thought id run you down for the weight you left on me
instead i pushed rewind reversed and drove away
and seeing you disappear in my rearview brought to me the word reciprocity

chorus
hey what would it mean to you what would it mean to you
to know that itll come back around again
hey whatever it means to you whatever it means to you
know that everything moves in circles yeah
