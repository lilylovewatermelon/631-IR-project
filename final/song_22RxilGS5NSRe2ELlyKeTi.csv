in the morning when the world came awake
before you knew me i knew your name
it was painted across the day as it breaks
an impression in your window frame

chorus 1
when you saw me out your window singing from the garden
only the beginning im only getting started
i dont mind the digging baby ill work harder
ive been washing dishes singing from the bottom

verse 2
but one day ill be running this place
and one day i could take you away
but i want you to wonder whats my name
cause i need you to want me the same

chorus 1
cause when you saw me washing dishes singing from the bottom
only the beginning im only getting started
i dont mind the digging baby ill work harder
ive been in the ashes singing from the garden

verse 3
where everything reaches for the sun
still unsure of what well become
but i need you to reach out to me
see in me more than i could see cause im afraid that
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likebridge
one day is only two words we say
i dont want to let them get in the way
of all the plans that we should be making right now
right now
who took the time and where did they take it
i want to take it back i dont want to let them break it
all these plans that we should be making right now
right now

verse 2
you see now one day ill be running this place
and one day i could take you away
but i want you to wonder whats my name
cause i need you to want me the same

chorus 1
when you saw me out your window singing from the garden
only the beginning im only getting started
i dont mind the digging baby ill work harder
ive been washing dishes singing from the bottom

outro
but one day is only two words we say
i dont want to let them get in the way
all these plans that we should be making right now
right now
who took the time and where did they take it
i want to take it back i dont want to let them break it
all these plans that we should be making right now3embed"
