essentials

begin by preparing yourself to be a survivor that means preparation in every sense this section is concerned with making sure that you have the right equipment for any expedition you undertake it introduces the idea of carrying a pocketsized kit of carefully selected key survival aids—which should go with you everywhere

    a knife is your most important survival tool it must be chosen and used carefully and it must be kept in perfect condition

equally important is a personal preparedness so that you are both physically and psychologically equipped to deal with the stresses and hazards of survival conditions you must have a clear understanding of survival needs especially of the need for—and ways of obtaining—water

essentials for survival

the human species has established itself in almost every corner of the earth even in territories too inhospitable to provide a regular home mankind has found a way to exploit its resources whether by hunting or by taking wealth from the ground and has often pitted its skills against nature simply for the satisfaction of doing so

    almost everywhere nature provides the necessities for survival in some places the provision is abundant in others very meagre and it takes common sense knowledge and ingenuity to take advantage of the resources available even more important is the will to survive men and women have shown that they can survive in the most adverse situations but they have done so because of their determination to do so—without that the skills and knowledge in this book will be of little use if you find yourself really up against it

    survival is the art of staying alive any equipment you have must be considered a bonus you must know how to take everything possible from nature and use it to the full how to attract attention to yourself so that rescuers may find you how to make your way across unknown territory back to civilization if hope of rescue is not on the cards navigating without map or compass you must know how to maintain a healthy physical condition or if sick or wounded heal yourself and others you must be able to maintain your morale and that of others who share your situation
    lack of equipment should not mean that you are unequipped for you will carry skills and experience with you but those skills and experience must not be allowed to get rusty and you must extend your knowledge all the time

    we are all used to surviving on our home ground—though we may not think of our lives in that way—but the true survivor must learn how to survive when taken from familiar surroundings or when those surroundings are drastically changed by man or nature anyone young or old from whatever walk of life can find him or herself in a survival situation as more and more people fly the globe sail small boats or cross the sea in large ones walk the hills and climb mountains and take their holidays in ever more exotic places the situations to which they could become exposed are increasingly diversified

    but survival skills are not only concerned with the extremes of the air crash on a mountain peak a shipwreck in the tropics or a vehicle breakdown in the middle of a desert every time you fasten a seat belt in a car you are giving yourself a greater chance of survival checking each way before crossing a road or ensuring that an open fire is safe before you go to bed are survival techniques that you carry out instinctively it is these habits of mind that you must develop as much as acquiring skills

    the main elements of survival are food fire shelter water navigation and medicine to put these in order of priority we use the acronym plan no matter where you are in the world this will never change be it the arctic desert jungle sea or seashore

p—for protection

you must ensure that you are protected from further danger ie impending avalanche forest fire or exploding fuel always stay on the scene of the incident as long as it is safe to do so and then make sure you are protected from the elements this means making a shelter and often lighting a fire there are several reasons why you should always stay at the scene

    1 you can utilize the wreckage for shelter signaling etc

    2 it’s a bigger signature on the ground making it easier to find

    3 there are probably injured people that cannot be moved

    4 by staying where you are you conserve energy

    5 because you have booked in and out and have stayed on the route rescue time will be minimal


l—for location

the next step after building a shelter is to put out emergency signals you must draw attention to your position do this as soon as possible to help the rescuers
a—for acquisition

while waiting to be rescued look for water and food to help supplement your emergency supplies

n—for navigation
good navigation will keep you on route and will often avert a survival situation but if you find yourself stranded always stay where you are

medical

you must become your own doctor and carefully monitor yourself at all times treat blisters as they occur don’t let them become septic keep an eye on your companions and deal with any unusual problems as they arise if they are limping falling behind or behaving strangely stop and treat immediately

be prepared

the boy scouts’ motto is the right one anyone setting out on a journey or planning an expedition should follow it by discovering as much as possible about the situations likely to be faced and the skills and equipment called for it is the most basic common sense to prepare yourself to take appropriate gear and to plan as carefully as possible

    your kit could make the difference between failure and success but especially when backpacking many people initially take too much and have to learn from bitter experience what they really need and what they could have done without there is no fun in struggling with a huge pack full of superfluous items while wishing that you had a torch or can opener with you getting the right balance is not easy

equipment check list

before any journey or expedition make a check list and ask yourself the following questions

    – how long will i be away how much food do i need for this period and do i need to carry water

    – have i the right clothing for the climate and enough of it is one pair of boots enough or because of the surface conditions and the amount of walking should i take a standby pair

    – what special equipment do i need for the terrain

    – what medical kit is appropriate

    make sure that you are fit enough for what you plan to do the fitter you are the easier and more enjoyable it will be if you are going hillwalking for instance take regular exercise beforehand and wear in your hiking boots walk to and from work with a bag weighted with sand and get your muscles in condition mental fitness is another factor are you sure that you are up to the task have prepared enough and have the equipment to accomplish it eliminate any nagging doubts before you set out

    always prepare contingency plans in case anything goes wrong things rarely go quite according to plan what will you do if you are prevented from achieving your objective what will you do if a vehicle breaks down or if weather or ground conditions prove more severe than anticipated if in a party how will you regroup if separated what happens if someone becomes ill

health checks

have a thorough medical check and ensure that you have all the necessary injections for the territories through which you intend to travel there are vaccinations against yellow fever cholera typhoid hepatitis smallpox polio diptheria and tuberculosis and an antitetanus injection is a must allow plenty of time for jabs—the full antityphoid protection requires three injections over the course of six months if travelling through a malarial region take an adequate supply of antimalaria tablets you must start taking these two weeks before your journey so that resistance is in the system before you arrive in the risk area and should keep taking them for a month after your return

    go to the dentist and get your teeth inspected teeth that normally do not hurt can cause considerable pain in cold climates at least start out in sound condition

    make up a medical kit that will cover all your likely needs and if travelling with a group ensure that any particular individual medical needs are covered if a potential member of the group is not fit should they be dropped from the party a difficult decision among friends but one that must be made for it is best in the long run consider too the ability of each member of the group to deal with the challenge of hardship risk and endurance that you may meet stress often brings out the unknown side of a person and in planning any group expedition some form of selection is needed when choosing your companions

research

you can never have too much information about a place you are going to contact people who know it already read books study maps—and make sure that you have reliable and uptodate maps to take with you find out about the local people are they likely to be friendly and helpful or are they wary of strangers are there local customs and taboos

    the more detailed your knowledge of the way people live—particularly in nonwesternized societies where life is linked much more closely to the land—the more survival knowledge you will have if you come to need it local methods of shelter building and fire making wild foods herbal medicines and water sources will be based on an intimate understanding of the surroundings

    study your maps carefully get a feel for the land even before you see it and gain as much knowledge of the terrain as possible river directions and speed of flow waterfalls rapids and difficult currents how high are hills and mountains and what are their slopes like—are they snow covered which way do the ridges run what kind of vegetation can you expect what species of trees and where what might temperatures be and how different at day and night when are first and last light what is the state of the moon the time and height of tides the prevailing wind direction and strength the weather that can be expected

planning

for a group expedition get the members together for frequent discussions of what you aim to achieve nominate people for particular responsibilities medic linguist cook special equipment vehicle maintenance driver navigator and so forth ensure that everyone is familiar with the equipment and that there are spares where needed—batteries fuel and bulbs especially

    divide the project into phases entry phase objective and recovery clearly state the aim of each phase and work out a time scale plan for emergency procedures such as vehicle breakdown illness and casualty evacuation

    in estimating the rate of progress especially on foot allow plenty of time it is always better to underestimate and be pleasantly surprised by doing better pressure to keep up to an overambitious schedule not only produces tension and exhaustion but leads to errors of judgement and risktaking that are frequently the reason for things going wrong you cannot carry all your water requirement with you but must replenish supplies as you travel water sources will be a major factor in planning any route

    when the route is planned and agreed make sure that others know about it so that you can have expectations of rescue if anything goes wrong if you are hiking in the hills inform the police and local mountain rescue centre tell them your proposed plan and give times of departure and expected arrival if touring by car log the route with the respective motoring organization if sailing check with coastguard and port authorities

    always make sure that someone knows what you are planning to do and when and keep them informed at prearranged stages so that failure to contact will set alarm bells ringing boats and aircraft are strictly controlled in this respect and if overdue a search is raised and the route checked out effecting rescue get into the habit of telling people where you are going and what time you expect to return or reach your next destination

equipment

being prepared for any eventuality is a tall order if you are on foot and have to carry everything you need yourself whatever you carry you must ensure that it is up to the job versatile and robust it’s a fine balance between what you would like to carry and what you must carry when preparing for any adventure you must take into consideration what the dangers are and how you can overcome these this is what is called contingency planning

    the climate weather and time of year will all help you to determine what to carry but you must ensure that everyone with you knows how to use and maintain the specialist kit you decide to take with you armed with information from your research you will be able to select your equipment matching it to objectives and conditions

clothing

the correct choice of clothing is so important if you start out right the chances are that you will succeed man is a tropical animal and can only survive as we are born in the tropics the moment we leave this area we have to provide our bodies with this tropical environment hence the need for clothes there is no heat in clothing it only traps what the body produces

    the wind and rain are the most dangerous elements in a temperate climate and the cold in extreme areas like the polar regions if the heat that is trapped in the layers of clothing you are wearing is continuously being replaced by wind and rain you are in danger of hypothermia in cold climates layering is the answer so pull on a jersey if it turns cold and waterproofs if it rains however if you wear an anorak while carrying a heavy pack there is a danger of wearing through the shoulders and lower lumbar region allowing the ingress of water to soak the body you need a change of clothing and additional warm garments for when you stop

    in hot climates it is very difficult to get the balance right between comfort and practicality there has always been a danger of overheating in extreme conditions caused by wearing heavy clothing while carrying out physical activities when on the move wear the least amount of clothing possible and avoid walking in waterproofs if you are too hot as the condensation generated will soak the inner layers

    clothing should give good protection and be wellfitting without being restrictive it must keep you warm and dry but have plenty of ways to keep the body ventilated so you don’t overheat if it gets colder you can always put on more

    with all the great breakthroughs in recent years in fabric technology it is worth understanding the pros and cons of the different materials on offer goretex™ is an excellent material because it is breathable and so keeps you warm and dry while ventilating the body but it does have limitations breathable materials can only work if they are kept clean once they get covered in mud and accumulate grime they are less effective goretex™ is not robust or hardwearing and must be looked after the best way to use goretex™ is to walk or climb in windproof garments and when at rest put on the breathable kit

    synthetic materials such as fleece are very popular and in certain conditions outperform natural materials like wool down or cotton having a zipped front makes a fleece easy to put on and take off and they are also comfortable to walk in choose one that is windproof as this is often all that is needed in most conditions if it gets colder they can be worn under an outer waterproof giving good insulation there are also garments which act like an animal’s skin using the buffalo system they have a windproof outer with a manmade fibre pile inside when wet they perform like a wetsuit they are good for walking in coldwet conditions and are ideal for boating canoeing and caving

    as for natural fabrics wool is still an excellent choice for jumpers as it retains its warmth even when wet the downside is it stretches and becomes heavy so it’s not a good choice for socks down is the warmest and lightest of all natural insulating materials but loses all its heatretaining qualities when wet cotton acts as a wick and draws up all the moisture so it’s good to wear in the tropics but not in the coldwet regions

    footwear is an important consideration and for serious walking give your feet priority break in new boots gradually and harden up your skin with surgical spirit starting two weeks before you set off for the enthusiast the major consideration in choosing clothing is cost surplus stores are very popular for the younger adventurer who loves to parade in camouflage clothing although exmilitary kit is good and cheap it is already obsolete the big drawback of wearing camouflage or dark clothing is the risk of not being found when lost the reason soldiers wear it is so they cannot be seen which contradicts what you are trying to do if you get into trouble most outdoor clothing is blue or orange some is reversible so a contrasting colour will always stand out wherever we find ourselves buy the best clothing you can afford and take advice from a reputable outdoor shop

    remember there is no such thing as bad weather only bad clothing

sleeping bags

two types are generally available one kind uses hollow fill manmade fibre the other and more expensive is filled with down down is very light and gives much better insulation—provided it stays dry if it gets wet it loses all its insulating properties and is very difficult to dry out for conditions that are likely to be wet the manmade fibre will therefore be the better choice avoid getting your sleeping bag wet however as sleep will be seriously affected

    excellent bivouac bags made of breathable material are also available that will keep you dry in place of a tent but in the long term you cannot beat a tent which can also be used for cooking and communal activities keep your sleeping bag inside the bivy bag and stow it inside a compression sack to make it as small as possible keep the bag clean and use a kip mat or poncho to lie on

packs

you need a strong and comfortable backpack to carry all your clothing and equipment choose the very best you can afford it should have tough and fully adjustable webbing well secured to the pack’s frame or fabric heavy loads can quickly loosen poorly made webbing it must have a comfortable hip belt the secret of wearing a pack is to take the weight securely on the hips—the body’s strongest pivot—not on the shoulders and back which quickly strain and tire

    do you want a pack with an external or an internal frame internal frames are lighter and make a pack more easy to stow but external frames are stronger ensure a more even distribution of the load and are especially useful for awkward or heavy equipment—including in an emergency a sick or injured person a good external frame should carry the pack high up on your body putting less strain on hips and shoulders and it should be designed to allow an airspace between the pack and your back to minimise contact perspiration a frame adds weight and is more prone to snag on rocky projections or branches making progress through dense vegetation a little more difficult but its advantages more than compensate

    finally choose a pack made from a tough waterproof fabric preferably with a laceup hood inside the main sack to prevent water leaking in and the contents falling out side pockets are always useful but they must have secure zips rather than straps or drawstrings which do not hold equipment safely

stowing kit

if you expect to get wet stow everything in polythene bags pack so that you know where everything is and so that the first things you need are not buried at the bottom the sleeping bag is probably the last thing you need so that goes at the bottom your tent should be on the top so should heavy kit such as radios which are more easily carried there—though try not to make the pack too high if you have to cope with strong winds for a very high pack will be more difficult to balance and you will expend a lot of energy just keeping upright

    pack a stove and brewkit in a side pocket so that you have easy access when you halt make sure that foodstuffs that can be easily squashed or melted are in suitable containers in a warm climate you can carry food to eat cold and make plenty of hot drinks in a cold climate make sure that you have plenty of fats and sugars the exact rations depend on your taste but they should be chosen to give a good balance of vitamins minerals fats proteins and carbohydrates take into account the extent to which you will be able to live off the land and carry a supply of anything unlikely to be available locally

gps

a gps global positioning system is an excellent piece of equipment and has taken a lot of skill away from the navigator basically these systems receive radio signals from satellites and can locate your current position anywhere in the world and are relatively easy to use it is also useful to note that they are reported to have 95 accuracy rate however in order to work the satellite transmission must not have any obstructions in its way such as a tree branch or movement so to receive a clear signal you need to be standing still and out in the open however if we depend solely on technology our basic skills will suffer and we will become unstuck if it becomes unserviceable or is lost gps is not effective unless you can identify where you are so stick to the basics map read and navigate normally and use the gps to confirm your navigation or correct it

    when looking to buy a gps there are several considerations to think about what you’ll be using it for—if walking you will want the unit to be as light as possible and compact where you’ll be using it and if you need it to be waterproof this is usually a feature of the heavier models with extra gadgets battery life should also be taken into account some gps are more complicated than others so choose the model that you’re happy with most have the facility of being able to put in way points at sea this means the eastern and northern coordinates and on land these can be campsites rock formations etc and there are many convenient handheld versions and some are even featured on watches

    there is always a danger with any batteryoperated equipment that it lets you down when you need it most batteries always discharge faster in the cold and with age recharging facilities are difficult in the wilderness and bad connections caused by constant abuse while on the move are a real menace

    carry the gps around the neck tucked under the jacket this will minimize the risk of damage and protect it from the weather don’t place it in your pack or leave it lying around

    when planning your route from the map choose prominent points that can be used as emergency rendezvous have these at regular intervals preferably every hour of walking enter these into the gps and they will keep you on track once entered they will offer information as to where you are in relation to these points and tell you what direction to take to reach them

radios

for a long expedition in remote territory a radio is a necessity they tend to be expensive but are well worth the cost if you cannot afford the radio you cannot afford the expedition choose a model with the least amount of channels available to suit your particular needs the trouble with multichanneled sets is that people get confused and tend to use the wrong ones have a working channel that everyone uses at established schedules have a priority channel that you can switch to in an emergency so no one will break into your transmissions if working with coastguardsforest rangers etc make sure that your radio is compatible and you know the emergency channel channel 16 knowing the frequency of the world service is also useful keep your radio in a safe place ideally on a person and not in a pack

    prearrange a signals plan with scheduled calls morning and evening especially when working in a large party a signals plan entails people manning the radio at base and twoway communication is easily made make sure that the chosen frequencies will work in the areas you are going to and that at least two people in the party are familiar with the working of the radio every group on the ground must be in radio contact with base they should be allocated a call sign and frequency and a schedule of calls to be made

    discourage groups from talking to each other without going through base this will cause great confusion if not controlled listen out before transmitting otherwise you will interfere with other stations everyone has verbal diarrhoea when they talk on the radio so write down what you want to say before making contact and have pencil and paper ready to make notes and take instructions this will help to keep transmissions to a minimum and preserve the batteries

remember rsvp
rhythm – don’t talk like a darlek

speed – talk slowly

volume – speak softly

pitch – pitch voice higher
than normal and use the phonetic alphabet when spelling out place names

    in the evening give a situation report to base with your location what you have done and your future intentions in the morning receive an update on weather conditions a time check and other information that base can give you a noon time call can be used to confirm your position

be aware

signals will be weak in steep gullies and valley bottoms and good signals will be received on top of high ground or across water

    if you are tackling a dangerous aspect of the expedition you may want to arrange that base listen out for additional calls so that in an emergency you can call for help and get a response immediately

be aware

an emergency plan should always be put into operation when two consecutive calls are missed even if all is well if you have not been able to make contact this will be treated by base as an emergency you must return to or stay at the last reported location and await contact if you are really in trouble base will know where you last were and where you planned to go to and the rescue mission can follow

mobiles

the mobile phone is one of the great inventions of the twentieth century in an emergency situation it can be a real lifesaver on expeditions where the radios have failed due to bad weather or the location of the victims a mobile phone has been used to raise the alarm a group on everest got into trouble as they started their descent after summitting they tried many times to raise base camp but without success the leader phoned his wife in hong kong on a mobile phone and reported their situation she then alerted kathmandu who in turn alerted base camp everest and effected a rescue

    some phones are better than others so it’s worth doing some homework it’s also essential to check the network coverage with the service provider before going abroad keep one in the car they are priceless when help is required and a cigarette lighter is a convenient charger for the battery providing you have an adaptor charging can be a problem in the wild so use your phone wisely but small handheld manual chargers can now be bought to recharge batteries with radios and phones it takes less power to listen than to transmit so make your call and listen for a reply if nothing is heard don’t despair with all electrical kit watermoisture is the enemy the transmitting side may be working but not the receiving side make short calls on the hour someone may be picking up your signal so don’t give up once you receive confirmation that the rescue is under way keep the radiophone on listening watch

altimeters

in mountainous areas an altimeter is a good idea relating the height recorded can help you determine what contour you are on and how far it is to the ridge or summit

you never have enough kit in an emergency it’s nice to have gps phones etc but you can still manage without as long as you have the ability to improvise and adapt learn the basics and use technology for confirmation rather than depending on them whole heartedly communication is of the highest importance and must be given priority it is a safer place as long as you can communicate with the outside world

    many survival sagas begin because of bad nagivation with people getting lost always plan for the worst eventuality

be aware

when things go wrong it’s a series of events that compound the situation the weather deteriorates the radio is broken the mobile phone is lost two people have multiple injuries and you are out of water never give in plan for these situations and you will come through but always have a contingency plan imagine the worst possible scenario and train for it

vehicles

motor vehicles need special adjustment and adaptation to deal with high altitudes and extreme conditions as well as a thorough overhaul to make sure they are in tiptop working order you will need tanks for extra fuel and water as well as spares and modifications see vehicles in climate and terrain

boats and planes

whether travelling privately or on a commercial service you must take note of the emergency procedures maritime and aviation authorities rule that passengers must be informed of them and remembering them could save your life

    when you board an aircraft cabin staff point out the emergency exits and advise you on action to take in the event of an emergency on board ship you will carry out lifeboat drills and be instructed on how to abandon ship if you have to

    the safest place on an aircraft is as far back in the tail as possible in a crash this frequently breaks off and most survivors are from this portion if you are a passenger in a light aircraft ask the pilot about the trip how long will it take and what sort of ground will you be flying over attend to details—they count in an emergency also try to keep your kit with you at all times

the unexpected

how can you prepare for what you do not expect preparing for expected difficulties and dangers is difficult enough but what chance have you of equipping yourself for the totally unknown disaster yet these are the disasters that immediately spring to people’s minds—the shipwreck and the plane crash or forced landing in unfamiliar and difficult terrain

    this is the reason for this book’s existence even more important however is to know about a whole range of skills which can be applied and adapted to all kinds of situations and to develop a way of thinking that enables you to draw upon them to find the solutions to particular problems this is the preparation you can make for the unexpected

    but this is not all you can equip yourself with a few small items which will increase your chances many times over by helping you with some of the basic necessities of survival this can tip the balance between failure and success they will fit in a small container slipped into a pocket or bag and can be carried anywhere they are your survival kit if there is an emergency you will be glad you always carry it

    more bulky but still compact enough to carry on a belt whenever you are travelling are a knife and the items which will fit in your survival pouch see survival pouch

    without the basics which these two kits provide you can still improvise but they will give you a head start

survival scenario

you’re getting your kit together what is the most important item to remember to take with you

take your brain with you you can’t beat the combination of common sense and experience in high stress survival situations

survival kit
a few key items can make all the difference in the fight for survival collect the things listed below they can all be fitted into a small container such as a 2oz tobacco tin that will be hardly noticeable when slipped into an anorak pocket make a habit of always having it with you do not choose something bigger you may find it inconvenient to carry and leave it out on the one occasion you actually need it many people who roll their own cigarettes carry such a tin

    experience has proved that each item earns its place though some are more use in some situations than in others fish hooks for instance may be invaluable in the jungle but less so in the desert

    polish the inside of the lid to make a mirrorlike reflecting surface and seal it to be waterproof with a strip of adhesive tape which can be easily removed and replaced don’t then just forget the tin regularly check the contents changing any which deteriorate such as matches and medicine tablets mark all drug containers with use and dosage and a runout date when they should be replaced pack spare space in the tin with cotton wool which will keep the contents from rattling and can be used for fire lighting

matches 1

waterproof matches are useful but bulkier than ordinary nonsafety strikeanywhere matches which can be made ‘showerproof’ by dipping the heads in melted candle fat to save space snap off half of each matchstick

    it is much easier to use matches than to make fire by other methods but don’t waste them use only when improvised methods fail take them from the tin one at a time and replace the lid never leave the container open or lying on the ground

candle 2

invaluable for starting a fire as well as a light source shave square for packing if made of tallow it is also fat to eat in an emergency or to use for frying—but be sure it is tallow paraffin wax and some other candles are inedible tallow does not store well especially in hot climates

flint 3

flints will work when wet and they will go on striking long after you run out of matches invest in a processed flint with a saw striker

magnifying glass 4

can start a fire from direct sunshine and is useful for searching for splinters and stings

needles and thread 5

several needles including at least one with a very large eye that can be threaded with sinew and coarse threads choose strong thread and wrap it around the needles they can be used for repairing or making clothes in an emergency

fish hooks and line 6

a selection of different hooks in a small tin or packet add a few split lead weights remember that a small hook will catch both large and small fish but a large hook will only catch big ones include as much line as possible it will also be useful for catching birds

compass 7

a luminous button compass—but make sure you know how to read it as some small compasses can be confusing a liquidfilled type is best but check that it does not leak has no bubbles in it and is fully serviceable the pointer is prone to rust make sure it is on its pivot and swings freely

beta light 8

beta lights provide a reliable and continuous light source for about 15 years the lights are generally the size of a small coin are selfilluminating requiring no batteries and are ideal for map reading

snare wire 9

preferably brass wire—6090cm 23ft should do save for snares but could solve many survival problems

flexible saw 10

these usually come with large rings at the ends as handles these take up too much room so remove them they can be replaced by wooden toggles when you need to use it to protect from rust and breakage cover it in a film of grease flexible saws can be used to cut even quite large trees

medical kit 11

what you include depends upon your own skill in using it pack medicines in airtight containers with cotton wool to prevent rattling the following items will cover most ailments

analgesic a pain reliever for mild and moderate pain codeine phosphate is ideal for tooth ear and headaches dose one tablet every six hours as needed but can cause constipation as a sideeffect so will help in cases of loose bowels not to be taken by children asthmatics or people with liver disorders

intestinal sedative for treating acute and chronic diarrhoea immodium is usually favoured dose two capsules initially then one each time a loose stool is passed antibiotic for general infections tetracycline can be used even by people hypersensitive to penicillin dose one 250mg tablet four times daily repeated for five to seven days carry enough for a full course if taking avoid milk calcium and iron preparations or other drugs containing aluminium hydroxide

antihistamine for allergies insect bites and stings may also help in cases of a bad reaction to a drug piriton is recommended in britain benadryl in the usa sleepiness is a sideeffect of piriton so useful as a mild sleeping pill do not exceed recommended dosages or take with alcohol

water sterilizing tablets for use where water is suspect and you cannot boil follow manufacturers’ instructions

antimalaria tablets essential in areas where malaria is present there are types which require only one tablet taken monthly

potassium permanganate add to water and mix until water becomes bright pink to sterilize it deeper pink to make an antiseptic and to a full red to treat fungal diseases such as athlete’s foot

surgical blades 12

at least two scalpel blades of different sizes a handle can be made from wood when required

butterfly sutures 13

use to hold the edges of wounds together

plasters 14

assorted sizes preferably waterproof for minor abrasions and keeping cuts clean they can be cut and used as butterfly sutures see stitching wounds in health

condom 15

this makes a good waterbag—holding 1 litre 1¾pt it is easiest to fill it from a source that has an abundance of water and a degree of water pressure like a waterfall

survival pouch

in a car boat or aircraft don’t stow all your kit separately pack a survival pouch too large to carry in your pocket like your survival tin but kept where it can be grabbed quickly in an emergency if you are on foot keep it outside your backpack and carry it on your belt it should contain fuel food survival bag and signalling kit all packed into a mess tin a which protects the kit and doubles as a cooking utensil if you fancy a brew or a snack it is all there for you and in an emergency it gives you a first backup for survival anything you use from the pouch must be replenished as soon as possible

pouch
the pouch must be made from waterproof material and be large enough to take a mess tin it must have a positive fastening that will not come undone and a strong tunnel loop to hold it on your belt remember the pouch contains matches solid fuel and flares—all life savers but to be treated with care
mess tin
this is made from aluminium which is light and strong a good cooking utensil it protects kit packed inside it

fuel

preferably you should have solid hexamine fuel tablets in their own stove container 1 use sparingly when a wood fire is inconvenient they make excellent fire lighters the stove simply unfolds to form an adjustable pot stand 2 and holder for burning fuel

torch

pack a small pencillike torch 3 that takes up little room keep batteries inside it but reverse the last so that if accidentally switched on the batteries don’t run down many modern torches use lightemitting diodes led as their light source rather than conventional bulbs they use less battery power and will typically work continuously for two weeks

flares

signal flares 4 to attract attention especially in close country carry red and green miniflares 5 and a discharger 6 no bigger than a fountain pen these are explosive so pack carefully simply remove discharger and screw on to flare 7 withdraw flare and point skywards at arm’s length pull the trigger to fire

marker panel

a strip or bar of fluorescent material about 03 x 2m 1 x 6ft used to attract attention in an emergency see signaling in rescue one bar signals immediate evacuation form other signals with panels carried by others in your party pack to stop the other items in the pouch rattling a silver thermal blanket is ideal for this

matches

pack as many matches 8 as possible in a waterproof container you never have enough movement against each other can ignite nonsafety matches—pack carefully

brew kit

there is nothing like a brewup to restore morale pack tea powder and sachets of milk and sugar 9 tea quenches thirst—coffee aggravates it

food

fat is the hardest food to come by when living off the land its extra calories earn it a place in your kit—tubes of butter lard or ghee 10 are available dehydrated meat blocks 11 are nourishing and sustaining though not very good in flavour chocolate 12 is a good food but does not keep well—check regularly salt 13 must be included—or better still an electrolite powder which contains vitamins salt and other minerals that the body requires

survival bag

a large polythene bag about 200 x 60cm 7 x 2ft is a lifesaver in the cold in an emergency get inside to reduce heat loss although wet from condensation you will be warm even better is a heatinsulated bag of reflective material that keeps you warm and solves the condensation problem

survival log

keep a written log of all events do not trust your memory record discoveries of resources and of what works and what does not it becomes a valuable reference and making it helps keep up your morale

knives

a knife is an invaluable asset in a survival situation the serious adventurer will carry one always they should be packed with the luggage that you are checking in when travelling by commercial aircraft otherwise they will be confiscated current knife law in the uk states that knives where the blade folds into the handle are legal as long as the blade is shorter than 3in 762cm

choosing a knife

a multibladed folding knife is a useful tool but if you carry only one knife you need something stronger a generalpurpose blade that will do all likely tasks efficiently and comfortably from cutting trees to skinning animals and preparing vegetables some have a compass built into the handle or have the handle hollowed out so that you can carry survival kit inside it however these features will be offset by the possibility of a hollow handle breaking and a compass may soon lose its accuracy after the knife has been used on a hardwood tree if you lose this kind of knife you also lose your survival kit—much better to keep the kit in a separate pouch on your belt or on the sheath

remember you are only as sharp as your knife your knife is such an important piece of survival equipment that you must keep it sharp and ready for use don’t misuse your knife never throw it into trees or onto the ground keep it clean and if you don’t intend to use it for a while oiled and in its sheath

    when walking through close or difficult terrain get in the habit of checking your knife this should become an automatic reflex especially after negotiating difficult terrain a check of all pockets and possessions should be second nature

folding knives

a folding knife that has a serrated edge and which can be opened onehanded is valuable provided it has a good locked position always carry one a blade in a wooden handle is usually more comfortable it will not slip in a sweaty hand and if the handle is made from a single piece of wood is less likely to cause blisters

parang

this is the malayan name for a type of knife with a large curved blade like a machete it is too large to be carried in normal daily life see knives but ideal when going out into the wild

    a parang 30cm 12in in overall blade length and weighing no more than 750g 1½lb is best the blade 5cm 2in at its widest and endbolted into a wooden handle the curved blade enables maximum effort to be applied when cutting timber and the blade arrives before the knuckles so giving them protection even large trees can be cut down with a parang which is especially useful for building shelters and rafts

remember there is a danger that the cutting edge may come through the side to draw the parang never hold the sheath on the same side as the cutting edge a this is dangerous get into the habit of gripping the side away from the cutting edge
sharpening a knife

any sandstone will sharpen tools—a grey clayey sandstone being best quartz though more rarely found is good and granite can also be used rub two pieces together to make them smooth a doublefaced stone with a rough and a smooth surface is ideal and should be carried in the sheath pocket use the rough surface first to remove burrs then the smooth one to get a fine edge the object is to get an edge that will last and not chip

facing disaster

when facing a disaster it is easy to let yourself go to collapse and be consumed in selfpity but it is no use giving up or burying your head in the sand and hoping that this is a bad dream that will soon pass it won’t and with that kind of attitude it will rapidly become much worse only positive action can save you

    a healthy wellnourished person can physically tolerate a great deal provided that he or she has selfconfidence even if sick or injured a determined person can win through and recover from seemingly impossible situations to do so there are many stresses that must be overcome

survival stresses

the survival situation will put you under pressure both physical and mental you will have to overcome some or all of the following stresses

    – fear and anxiety

    – pain illness and injury

    – cold andor heat

    – thirst hunger and fatigue

    – sleep deprivation

    – boredom

    – loneliness and isolation

can you cope you have to

    selfconfidence is a product of good training and sound knowledge these must be acquired before you have to face up to a survival situation

    physical fitness plays an important part the fitter you are the better you will survive initially you may have to go without sleep to ensure that you are in a safe location or make a long march in dangerous conditions do not wait until you are forced to go without sleep to see whether you are capable of doing so prove it to yourself now by getting into training develop the resources to cope with fatigue and loss of sleep

    you will be working hard to procure food and water they will relieve hunger and thirst but finding them will tire you and you will need an adequate shelter to enable you to rest and recover from your efforts don’t overdo it rest frequently and assess the situation

    pain and fever are warning signals that call attention to an injury or physical condition they are not in themselves dangerous however distressing and discomforting pain can be controlled and overcome its biological function is to protect an injured part to prevent you using it but this warning may have to be ignored to avoid the risk of further injury or death

survival scenario

how long can the body cope without the essentials

in general the human body can survive for 3 minutes without air 3 days without water 3 weeks without food there are always exceptions to this and there are examples of people pushing these boundaries and surviving for longer periods it is amazing what the human body can endure but such a survivor’s health can suffer in the long term due to such trauma for example a person surviving for more than 9 days without water will undoubtedly suffer kidney damage or failure

basic needs

to reiterate the main elements required for survival are food fire shelter and water use plan protection location acquisition navigation to help you to prioritise your survival needs if you don’t have shelter in the desert having 2 litres 3½pts of water is of little use to you in the longer term

    it takes a healthy person quite a long time to die of starvation for the body can use up its stored resources but exposure to wind rain and cold can be fatal even in temperate climates and death comes in only minutes in the icy waters of the poles food is rarely the first priority even in those places where it is difficult to find there are usually other problems to face first shelter will often be the prime necessity in extremes of climate or temperature—not just in the frozen polar regions or the baking deserts but for walkers trapped by mist on a hillside the need for fire is closely linked

    water is something that most people in the modern world take for granted they are so used to turning on a tap that until an extreme drought causes water rationing they scarcely think about it yet the survivor at sea or after a flood though surrounded by water may be desperate for drinkable water—and there are many places where unless it rains no obvious water is available the other survival necessities are dealt with later in the book but water is universally important

water

water is essential to life a person can survive for three weeks without food but for only three days without water therefore its discovery and conservation should be prioritised over food don’t wait until you have run out of water before you look for it conserve what you have and seek a source as soon as possible preferably fresh running water though all water can be sterilized by boiling or by using chemical purifiers in a survival situation a 1 litrejug 1¾pt can be made to last 4 days but if necessary the last ¼ litre ½pt can be made to last 3 days this is achieved by dividing the last ¼ litre into three then drinking half of the day’s ration at midday and the balance at night for 3 days

    water is the coolant that keeps the body at an even temperature it is needed to keep the kidneys functioning to eliminate wastes is required for breathing and for digestion but the fluids contained in the body are limited lost water must be replaced or health and efficiency will suffer the average human requires the minimum of ¼ litre ½pt of water per day to survive

water loss

the average person loses 23 litres 3½5¼pt of water each day—even someone resting in shade loses about 1 litre 1¾pt just breathing loses fluids and loss through respiration and perspiration increases with work rate and temperature vomitting and diarrhoea increase loss further this must all be replaced to preserve the critical water balance either by actual water or water contained in food

how to retain fluids

      avoid exertion just rest

    – don’t smoke

    – keep cool stay in shade if there is none erect a cover to provide it

    – do not lie on hot ground or heated surfaces

    – don’t eat or eat as little as possible if there is no water available fluid will be taken from the vital organs to digest food further increasing dehydration fat is hardest to digest and takes a lot of fluid to break it down

    – never drink alcohol

    – don’t talk—and breathe through the nose not the mouth

finding water

the first place to look is in valley bottoms where water naturally drains if there is no obvious stream or pool look for patches of green vegetation and try digging there there may be water just below the surface which will build up in the hole even digging in gullies and dry stream beds may reveal a spring beneath the surface especially in gravelly areas in mountains look for water trapped in crevices

    on the coast digging above the high water line especially where there are sanddunes has a good chance of producing about 5cm 2in of fresh water that filters down and floats on the heavier salt water it may be brackish but is still drinkable where cliffs fall into the sea look for lush growth of vegetation even ferns and mosses in a fault in the rock formation and you may find a soak or spring

    if no freshwater can be found saltwater can be distilled see solar still and distillation this section

warning

be suspicious of any pool with no green vegetation growing around it or animal bones present it is likely to be polluted by chemicals in the ground close to the surface check edge for minerals which might indicate alkaline conditions always boil water from pools in deserts there are lakes with no outlets these become salt lakes their water must be distilled before drinking

dew and rain collection

despite the acid rain produced by industrialized countries which can cause a buildup of pollution in the soil rainwater everywhere is drinkable and only needs collecting use as big a catchment area as possible running the water off into containers of every kind a hole dug in the ground and lined with clay will hold water efficiently but keep it covered if you have no impermeable sheeting metal sheets or bark can be used to catch water in if you have any doubt about the water you have collected boil it

    in climates where it is very hot during the day and cold at night heavy dew can be expected when it condenses on metal objects it can be sponged or licked off

you can use clothing to soak up water and then wring it out one way is to tie clean cloths around the legs and ankles and walk through wet vegetation these can be sucked or wrung out

animals as signs of water
mammals

most animals require water regularly grazing animals are usually never far from water—though some kinds travel thousands of miles to avoid the dry season—as they need to drink at dawn and dusk converging game trails often lead to water follow them downhill carnivores meat eaters can go for a long period between waterings they get moisture from the animals on which they prey so are not a positive indication of local water

birds

grain eaters such as finches and pigeons are never far from water they drink at dawn and dusk when they fly straight and low they are heading for water when returning from water they are loaded with it and fly from tree to tree resting frequently plot their direction and water can be found

    water birds can travel long distances without stopping to feed or drink so do not necessarily indicate water nearby hawks eagles and other birds of prey also get liquids from their victims so cannot be taken as a sign of local water

reptiles

not an indicator of water they collect dew and get moisture from prey so can go a long time without

insects

good indicators especially bees they fly at most 65km 4 miles from their nests or hives but have no regular watering times ants are dependent upon water a column of ants marching up a tree is going to a small reservoir of trapped water such reservoirs are found even in arid areas most flies keep within 90m 100yd of water especially the european mason fly with its iridescent green body

human tracks

will usually lead to a well bore hole or soak it may be covered over with scrub or rocks to reduce evaporation replace the cover

remember ration your sweat not your water
if you have to ration water take it in sips after going a long time without water don’t guzzle when you do find it take only sips at first large gulps will make a dehydrated person vomit losing even more of the valuable liquid

condensation

tree and plant roots draw moisture from the ground but a tree may take it from a water table 15m 50ft or more below too deep to dig down to reach don’t try let the tree pump it up for you by tying a plastic bag around a leafy branch evaporation from the leaves will produce condensation in the bag

solar still

dig a hole in the ground approximately 90cm 36in across and 45cm 18in deep place a collecting can in the centre then cover the hole with a sheet of plastic formed into a cone the sun’s heat raises the temperature of the air and soil below and vapour is produced as the air becomes saturated water condenses on the underside of the plastic running down into the container this is especially effective in desert regions and elsewhere when it is hot during the day and cold at night the plastic cools more quickly than the air causing heavy condensation this kind of still should collect at least 570ml 1 pt over a 24hour period

    the still may also double as a trap insects and small snakes are attracted by the plastic they may slide down into the cone or wriggle underneath it and drop into the hole and then cannot climb out

    a solar still can be used to distill pure water from poisonous or contaminated liquids

warning

urine and sea water

never drink either—never but both can produce drinking water if distilled—and sea water will provide you with a residue of salt

distillation

distillation kits are part of the equipment of liferafts but they can be improvised to distill liquid you need to make something to do the job of a laboratory retort pass a tube into the top of a waterfilled covered container placed over a fire and the other end into a sealed collecting tin which preferably is set inside another container providing a jacket of cold water to cool the vapour as it passes out of the tube you can improvise the equipment from any tubing—pack frames for instance to avoid wasting water vapour seal around the joins with mud or wet sand

    an easier method is a variation on the desert still it takes a little longer for the water to condense but may be easier to set up

water from ice and snow

melt ice rather than snow—it produces a greater volume faster for less heat twice as much for half the heat if forced to heat snow place a little in the pot and melt that first gradually adding more to it if you put a lot of snow into the pot the lower level will melt and then be soaked up into the absorbent snow above it leaving a hollow beneath which will make the pot burn lower layers of snow are more granular than that on the surface and will yield more water

water from sea ice

sea ice is salt no good for drinking until it has aged the more recently frozen the saltier it will be new sea ice is rough in contour and milkywhite in colour old ice is bluish and has rounded edges caused by weathering

    good water can be obtained from blue ice—the bluer and smoother the better but beware of even old ice that has been exposed to salt spray

water from plants

water collectors

cupshaped plants and cavities between the leaves of bromeliads many of which are parasitic on the branches of tropical trees often collect a reservoir of water

    bamboo often holds water in its hollow joints old and yellow stems are more likely to be water bearing shake them—if you can hear water slurping around cut a notch at the bottom of each joint and tip the water out

vines

vines with rough bark and shoots about 5cm 2in thick can be a useful source of water but you must learn by experience which are the waterbearing vines because not all have drinkable water and some have a poisonous sap the poisonous ones yield a sticky milky sap when cut you will know not to try that type again—otherwise it is a matter of trial and error and worth trying any species

    some vines cause a skin irritation on contact if you suck them so it is better to let the liquid drip into your mouth rather than put your mouth to the stem and preferable to collect it in a container

    to obtain water from a vine select a particular stem and trace it upwards reach as high as possible and cut a deep notch in the stem cut off the same stem close to the ground and let the water drip from it into your mouth or into a container when it ceases to drip cut a section from the bottom and go on repeating this until the vine is drained do not cut the bottom of the vine first as this will cause the liquid to run up the vine through capillary action

roots

in australia the water tree desert oak and bloodwood have their roots near the surface pry these roots out from the ground and cut them up into 30cm 12in lengths remove the bark suck out the moisture or shave to a pulp and squeeze over the mouth

    it is not easy to find some of the most useful desert roots unless you have been shown by someone with experience australian aborigines can identify a tiny twig which grows from a footballlike bulbous root which can be a lifesaver—but unless you have been shown how to find them it is not worth expending your energy and resources looking

palms

the buri coconut and nipa palms all contain a sugary fluid which is very drinkable to start it flowing bend a flowering stalk downwards and cut off its tip if a thin slice is cut off the stalk every 12 hours the flow will be renewed making it possible to collect up to a quart each day nipa palms shoot from the base so that you can work from ground level on grown trees of other species you may have to climb up them to reach a flowering stalk

    coconut milk has considerable water content but from ripe nuts it is a powerful laxative drinking too much would make you lose more fluid

cacti
both the fruit and bodies of cacti store water but not all cacti produce liquid safe to drink—the saquarro the giant multifingered cactus of arizona is very poisonous take care to avoid contact with cactus spines they can be very difficult to remove especially the very fine hairlike ones and can cause festering sores if they stay in the skin

    the barrel cactus echinocactus grusoni see desert plants in food can reach a height of 120cm 4ft is found in the southern united states through to south america and requires considerable effort to cut through its tough spinecovered outer skin the best method is to cut off the top and chop out pieces from the inside to suck or to smash the pulp within the plant and scoop out the watery sap which varies from tasteless in some plants to bitter in others an averagesized 100cm 3½ft barrel cactus will yield about 1 litre 1¾pt of milky juice and this is an exception to the rule to avoid milkysapped plants

water from animals

animal eyes contain water which can be extracted by sucking them

    all fish contain a drinkable fluid large fish in particular having a reservoir of fresh water along the spine tap it by gutting the fish and keeping the fish flat remove the backbone being careful not to spill the liquid and then drink it

    if you need water that badly you should be careful not to suck up the other fish juices in the flesh for they are rich in protein and will use up water in digestion

    desert animals can also be a source of moisture in times of drought in northwestern australia aborigines dig in dry clay pans for the desert frogs that burrow in the clay to keep cool and survive they store water in their bodies and it can be squeezed out of them

salt

salt is essential for water retention a normal diet includes a daily intake of 10g ⅓oz the trouble starts when you start to get rid of it faster than you eat it the body loses salt in sweat and urine so the warmer the climate the greater the loss physical exertion will also increase the loss however replenishing the salt levels in your body is not always recommended and much will depend on the situation you find yourself in if you are on reduced food and or water rations salt is the first thing that should be cut from your diet because it increases dehydration

recognize the signs of dehydration

the first symptoms of salt deficiency are muscle cramps dizziness nausea and tiredness the remedy is to take a pinch of salt in half a litre ¾ pint of water salt supplements in tablet form used to be the prescribed method of increasing sodium levels but always dissolve these in water or isotonic drinks—if they are available

what happens if you do not carry salt or your supplies run out by the coast or at sea there is plenty of saltwater available—a pint of sea water contains about 15g ½oz of salt but do not just drink it as it is dilute it with plenty of fresh water evaporating sea water will leave you with salt crystals

    inland salt supplies are more problematic in farming areas you will find salt licks for cattle—but you will then be close to civilization and not likely to have reached the stage of salt deprivation however all animals need salt and observation of them may reveal a natural source in one part of africa elephants risk the dangerous depths of a dark cave to lick salt from its sides

    salt can be obtained from some plants in north america the best source is the roots of hickory trees and in southeast asia those of the nipa palm can be used in the same way boil the roots until all the water is evaporated and black salt crystals are left

    if no direct salt sources are available to you then you will have to rely on getting it secondhand through animal blood which should never be wasted as it is a valuable source of mineralsembed"
