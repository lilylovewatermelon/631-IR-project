lying next to you i got a flight in the morning
got me questioning what i think is important
i cant even lie think of you when im with her
look me in my eye tell me that you feel different
drove two hours just to stay the night with you
havent seen you in a year but i still get you
hurts to see you laugh cause i know ill fucking miss that
how could i forget that

chorus
you made me feel alive
forget them other bitches i will put em to the side
girls in la couldnt be more dry
youre so money baby you aint even have to try
now im runnin with you round east lansing
titos in your dorm were dancing
its a quarter after three
sayin everything we mean

verse 2
girl its hard to see me go so fast yeah i get that
times that we have so wild cant forget that
now im on a flight in my feels thinkin bout you
hope you know you fire fuck anyone who doubts you
life out in cali has been great im committed

girls in la couldnt be more dry
