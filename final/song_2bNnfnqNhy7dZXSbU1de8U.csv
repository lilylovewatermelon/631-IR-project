just three miles from her rest stop
and she slams on the brakes
she said i tried to be but im not
so could you please collect your things
well i dont wanna be cold i dont wanna be cruel
but i gotta find more than whats happenin with you
and if youd open up the door

chorus
she said while you were sleepin
i was listenin to the radio and wonderin what youre dreamin when
it came to mind that i didnt care
and i thought hell if its over
well i had better end it quick or i could lose my nerve
are you listening
can you hear me
have you forgotten

verse 2
just three miles from the rest stop
and my mouths too dry to rage
the light was shinin from the radio
and i could barely see her face
but she knew all the words that i never had said
she knew the crumpledup promise of this brokendown man
and as i opened up the door
see matchbox twenty liveget tickets as low as 77you might also likechorus
she said while you were sleepin
i was listenin to the radio and wonderin what youre dreamin when
it came to mind that i didnt care
and i thought hell if its over
then i had better end it quick or i could lose my nerve
are you listening
can you hear me

interlude

chorus
while you were sleepin
i was listenin to the radio and wonderin what youre dreamin when
it came to mind that i didnt care
so i thought hell if its over
well i had better end it quick or i could lose all my nerve
are you listening
can you hear me

chorus
while you were sleepin
i was listenin to the radio and wonderin what youre dreamin when
it came to mind that i didnt care
i thought hell if its over
well i had better end it quick or i could lose all my nerve
are you listening
can you hear me1embed"
