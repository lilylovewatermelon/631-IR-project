out on your own
all things i loved
but do not know
on hopewell road
these days of candy
live in your mind
those violet lines
white fenced in miles
across my eyes

a world inside you
no photograph
my natural one
the rising sun
live in your mind

just like that its gone
just like that its gone
just like that
i know it comes too soon
the universe is riding off with you

hi o out there i know
a little bit of you i keep it close to me
i know it comes too soon
the universe is riding on with you
i know it comes too soon
i know it stays for nobody
i want to know you there
the universe is riding off with youyou might also like4embed"
