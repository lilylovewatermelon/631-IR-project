cant wait til we make real love
because these conjugal visits just aint enough
im really looking forward to a future for us
baby dont worry bout it
imma beeee right here waitin on you
even took a second job
so they wont take the clause and put a lean on the
house
i know its gonna be a while before you get out ooh
baby dont worry bout it dont worry
imma beeee right here waitin on you
and them dudes you ran with are foul
they been tryna get at me ever since you been down
even my girls are tellin me i should end it all now
baby dont worry about it
imma be cell door slams

verse 2 the game
all i can think about is that honey complexion
and the way your skin glow when you slippin on them dior dresses
i know you wonderin why i got you a smith n wesson
cause them niggas in the hood is the reason we stressin
i miss that gangsta love and that lil affection
them butter soft lips when you kissin my chest and
mary i put nuttin above you
and behind that vest i got a heart ma gangstas need love too

some think the worst of you
they portray you as a menace not that far from the truth
you were caught up in the game and now its caught up to you
baby dont worry about it
imma be right here waitin on you

verse 4 the game
it used to be caramel skin tones sprewell rims on
glass house ass out jacob watch gemstones
bandanna nike airs tennis bracelet wife hair
black rag do or die 45 right here
every time i was down you was always right there
whenever visitin hours came i know my wife there
so pink diamonds right here chain hang ice there
the reason for my tattooed tear  i need you to hold me down

chorus mary j blige
ill be waiting on you illlllll
ill be waiting on you ima be right here whenever you call me babe
ill be waiting on you oooohohh
baby dont worry about it
imma be right here waitin on you

verse 5 the game
im locked up countin the days down
tryna hold my head cause the penitentiary aint no playground
im dyin in here and i dont know how you stay down
in the shootin range twice a week bustin that treypound
i would never ask you to wait around
but how do a white sandy beach in st tropez sound
and no more outta town trips on that greyhound
just me hittin like a beat from dr dre out
chorus mary j blige
ill be waiting on you ill be waiting
ill be waiting on you ima be right here for you baby
ill be waiting on you ill
baby dont worry about it dont worry babe
imma beeee right here ima be waitin on you

ill be right there ill be right therre
baby dont worry about it
