i just wanna roll with a cutie one
i aint tryna catch no feels
we can get along sometimes
we aint gotta be sincere
you aint gotta laugh so small
breathing all down my back
they aint never had what we had
they aint never felt like that
cause them summer days
never fade away
they just stay the same
in my mind my mind
and them summer days
never fade away
they just stay the same
in my mind no no

hook childish gambino
its those summer days
never fade away
it just stays the same
in my mind no no
its those summer days
never fade away
never never change
in my mind no no

okay royalty is red hot
shots from a redbone
talking bout her skin tone her color beats headphones
baby im just living right and you can say im dead wrong
but can you disagree with that versace on me
got gold on the vneck im passing every g  check
didnt fuck her for a month and never had a regret
it was just nice to have you chilling up in key west
and we was just chill i didnt really need sex
but really is we fucking yo
never serious so i make everything a fucking joke
she be pushing buttons and she push it till that button broke
then we smoke a blunt and all the drama it go up in smoke
see she just graduated got a new job
took that nose ring out her nose and went and bought a new saab
got that boyfriend that she living with and she dont smoke no more
but yo its cool i liked her when i knew her back before like

hook childish gambino
its those summer days
never fade away
it just stays the same
in my mind no no
its those summer days
never fade away
never never change
in my mind no no9embed"
