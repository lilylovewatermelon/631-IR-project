forensic weapon in court still considered a sport
on the phone with bald head while watching king of new york
tedrick shaemus case one of the greatest i ever saw
whole team turn sour when niggas trying to get off
caught slipping blicked the biscuit administered in the car
i’m a dog worst place to get hit is while in the car
bullet hole in my lip as i’m inching back to the car
bitch im with pitching a fit yelling kevin back in the car
no hospital visits im on the run trying to get it having
baby momma problems every night tryin to fix it
flashing out flipping tables broke every dish in the kitchen
the devil living in me i’m contemplating to end this
sprite facing 20 years well that’s what they try to give him
d ozi out on bail for a charge he caught with that dealing
back when we was little want us a pickle dilly
innocent making faces in the window while having dinner
whod ever think that wed grow up and turn out to be killers
barrel extensions tool is narrow and slender
compact in my jacket even flinch i might hit ya
shot too hard in the heart my emotions are ruined
too hard to trust don’t give a fuck wont open up to no woman
take my lick and keep pushing don’t try playing me pussy
ar15 with the irbeam laying down in the bushes
won’t say no name but so and so lent me a pound of them cookies
ttgthug life i’m with it
if shawty bust her pussy open no commitment i sinned it
lord forgive me i’m sinnin’ i come to you as a sinner
take all my scars take my heart turn me into a christian
bright nigga in the paint as if my last name was griffin
popeyes chicken i just want 4 legs and a biscuit
i always shout to chitowns all my niggas in folsom
stuck to the code even when the pressure on we aint folding
