sick of circling the same road
sick of bearing the guilt
so open the windows to cool off
and heat pours in instead

chorus
perfect in weakness
im only perfect in just your strength alone

verse 2
all my efforts to clean me
leave me putrid and filthy
and how can you look at me
when i cant stand myself

prechorus
im tired to be honest
im nobody

chorus
perfect in weakness
im only perfect in just your strength alone
perfect in weakness
im only running in just your strength alone

i tried to kill you
you tried to save me
you save me
you save me
you save me
you save me

chorus
perfect in weakness
im only perfect in just your strength alone
perfect in weakness
im only running in just your strength alone4embed"
