on a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
the emblem of suffering and shame
and i love that old cross where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain

chorus
so ill cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it someday for a crown

verse 2
oh that old rugged cross so despised by the world
has a wondrous attraction for me
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to bear it to dark calvary

chorus
so ill cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it someday for a crown

verse 3
in the old rugged cross stained with blood so divine
a wondrous beauty i see
for the dear lamb of god left his glory above
to pardon and sanctify me

so ill cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross

verse 4
to the old rugged cross i will ever be true
its shame and reproach gladly bear
then hell call me some day to my home far away
where his glory forever ill share

chorus
so ill cherish the old rugged cross
till my trophies at last i lay down
i will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it someday for a crownembed"
