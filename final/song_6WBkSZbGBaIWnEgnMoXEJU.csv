just open up like a page in a book

ill testify please help me to see
dont close your eyes keep your eyes on me
open up open up now so make me strong

prechorus
theres blood on my hands and the killers not my enemy
its all for the sake of love its all for you

chorus
when all we know is falling ill save something for you
you who are all alone all alone
when everything is beautiful when everythings okay
even if its not okay ill say its all for you for you for you
for you for you for you and only you
only you

these hands hold up nothing but scars underneath
from swimming these oceans and learning to breathe
