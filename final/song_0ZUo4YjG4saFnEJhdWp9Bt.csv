right now hes probably slow dancing
with a bleachedblonde tramp
and shes probably getting frisky
right now hes probably buying her some fruity little drink
cause she cant shoot a whiskey
right now hes probably up behind her with a poolstick
showing her how to shoot a combo
and he dont know

chorus
i dug my key into the side
of his pretty little souped up fourwheel drive
carved my name into his leather seats
i took a louisville slugger to both headlights
slashed a hole in all four tires
maybe next time hell think before he cheats

verse 2
right now shes probably up singing some
whitetrash version of shania karaoke
right now shes probably saying im drunk
and hes a thinking that hes gonna get lucky
right now hes probably dabbing on
three dollars worth of that bathroom polo
oh and he dont know

oh that i dug my key into the side
of his pretty little souped up fourwheel drive
carved my name into his leather seats
i took a louisville slugger to both headlights
slashed a hole in all four tires
maybe next time hell think before he cheats

bridge
i mightve saved a little trouble for the next girl
cause the next time that he cheats
oh you know it wont be on me
no not on me

chorus
cause i dug my key into the side
of his pretty little souped up fourwheel drive
carved my name into his leather seats
i took a louisville slugger to both headlights
slashed a hole in all four tires
maybe next time hell think before he cheats

oh maybe next time hell think before he cheats
oh before he cheats
