so much pressure it makes you sick
scabs on your skin that you just cant itch
from the back of your tongue with a mouthful of sex
beg for attention trade selfrespect

youve got it all in place keeping me in wait
now its time to play

i cant change the fact that ive felt your stare
is getting closer

i cant change the fact that i need you here
so come on over

so much pleasure your body aches
lips on your skin till it makes your shake
in a room full of crosses where do we begin
welcome to detention repent for your sins

youve got it all in place keeping me in wait
