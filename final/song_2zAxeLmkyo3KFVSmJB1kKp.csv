your eyes glowed like candles in the night
as you wiped the freezin tears from your eyes
i said you still love me you said i dont know
left me standing in the february snow

verse 2
we were the couple others strive to be
now youre just you and im just me
i meant every single word i said
just not the ones that got us in the end

chorus
cause i really wish that youd come back
i just cant do this on my own
cause every time i close my eyes
im underneath that street light in the cold
as you fade into that february snow

verse 3
and every night i sleep i dream of you
but i guess sometimes some dreams dont come true
i gave up on counting sheep i just stare at the door til i fall asleep
and i pray that one day you might come through

chorus
cause i really wish that youd come back
i just cant do this on my own
cause every time i close my eyes
im underneath that street light in the cold
as you fade into that february snow

cause i really wish that youd come back
i just cant do this on my own
cause every time i close my eyes
im underneath that street light in the cold
as you fade into
well as you fade into
that february snow
and damn that february snowembed"
