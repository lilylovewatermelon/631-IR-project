this time you got it all figured out
think its going to work okay
but ill make sure it wont
cause ill be standing in your way

prechorus 1
so wait a minute if you will
i aint got no time but time to kill
when the ground starts getting hot
it doesnt matter if you run or not

verse 2
this time youve seen it done before
this time youre going to get it right
once more you fail miserably and then
then you do it all over again

prechorus 1
so wait a minute if you will
i aint got no time but time to kill
when the ground starts getting hot
