hey you guys

chica chica dobe dobe dobe dobe
all the children went to heaven
wont be back til ten after eleven
are you ready ready
are you ready ready

first there was the weed sack coppin and chillin
then came the cocaine robbin and stealin stealin
i said i dropped more pounds then maternity wards
and got the gold chain from the gudda awards yup

we like that trunk knockin
roll by them ladies jockin
we blazing up the bad
we got them baggies in our pockets
yall know we drinking somethin
we know your thinking somethin
making your windows rattle
turn the corner hear me comin

chorus x2
letem know that you aint nothing to be messed with
bring the fire every time get that money dont quit
grind off shine off make it happen
get it get it
lives large come hard
if you gonna spit it spit it
see rehab liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likei rocked the living room the first day i started walkin
was rhyming spitting flames the first day i started talkin
had the class and the teacher bouncing in kindergarten
then i slapped her on her ass she said i beg your pardon
i said get get get get get it girl
one of these days im gonna rock the world
just give me a crayon and give me an a on
everything i do with a ground to play on

were on a whole nother no love for under covers
i had you suckered since i busted out my fathers rubber
give me ball caps and sneakers fresh in some jeans and tshirt
still got them children dance looking like they having seizures

chorus
kiss my acrobat my soda crack my butty butty whack
yo ma yo pa yo gritty granny with her hose in a panty
and a big behind like frankenstein rock the beat down sesame street
its your turn know lets get it on
rock that thing til the break of dawnembed"
