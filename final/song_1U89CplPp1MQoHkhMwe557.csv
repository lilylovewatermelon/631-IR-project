verse 1 yung carecrow
lickity lickity loth the butcher creepin through with that mystic style
smokin on whatever been a junkie since i was a child
every time i think of death i start to groan and crack a smile
never gave no fuck about this life—and thats me keepin it mild
killer gorilla maniac put they ashes on my blunt
the police keep hollerin where they at
buried them in front the lawn
the carecrow with silent weapons i pull the trigger and disperse
the bodies get dumped in acid so they have no need of a hearse
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeverse 2 yung plague
im staring at the window like im staring at the television
smoking just to pass the time
lick had died and christ has risen
listen to the sixes hissing tipping crucifixes
missin pieces in my wrist it seems im sleepin chest beatin ceases
ridin in the cadillac with cataracts lungs black and chapped
should have put a cap on those ashes lackin in fashion
fuck— getting cashed out bitch im lackin
youre plastic recyclable and everlasting uh
