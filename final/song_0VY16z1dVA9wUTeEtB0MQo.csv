coughs
i think im gettin sick
been in this room
like i was hidin from somethin
look ugh

verse 1 mac miller
posin a question how many been empty and holdin aggression
close to depression open your eyes and just focus a second
fuck a recession my brother my mind is my weapon
im lettin it go loaded and pointed at negative energy
tellin me stop they tellin me no dont
your aura is somethin you aint even sure of
explore the core of california whores got more to snort up
ive had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
thats a lot the feelin come after the shock
praise me id rather you not cause
its drivin me crazy the fact that you pay me amaze me
thats somethin i love
you come to the club searchin for drugs drunk fuckin these sluts
god loves me what if he does what does it mean
you wastin away doin nothin you frontin
why arent you chasin your dreams ugh
we wonder bout life but none of us willin to learn
the money we earn is somethin to burn
why wont they give me a turn ill
feed the hungry and clothe the naked
you mistaken the world is cold and its lonely aint it
when them highrollers homes in vegas raided with some home invasion
contaminatin the place with plague we just saved the day
i waste away in a room spittin these raps
yahweh put the world in my hands im givin it back yep

its a gift
our our time to be alive
no earthly vehicle
can contain this drive
its a gift
our our time to be alive
no earthly vehicle
can contain this drive

verse 2 mac miller
forfeitin the war he lays his sword down and walks away
grabs a 40 from the corner store begins to contemplate
dealin with death like he work in the morgue absorbin souls forgotten
he lost his way starin down that barrel thinkin not today
lifes so precious lord knows that life is so precious
fight to the death til theres nobody left
and you holdin your breath cause you might get infected
im animalistic instinctively thinkin of gettin ballistic
be specific to those in control we all statistics
misogynistic with a twisted mind im intertwined
my trigger finger itchin all i kill is time—bang
initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
the mind is like religion cant agree on whos its savior
the newest flavor of superhero im shootin lasers
cept im cool with vader and blowin up rooms thats full of strangers
a news anchor the youth can relate to its nature
you a hater ill deal with you later no thank ya
im just your neighbor please dont do me no favors
really doe come on homie we major
i waste away in this room spittin out raps
yahweh put the world in my hands im givin it back
chorus niki randa
its a gift
our our time to be alive
no earthly vehicle
can contain this drive
its a gift
our our time to be alive
no earthly vehicle
can contain this drive
