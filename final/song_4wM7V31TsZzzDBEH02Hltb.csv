are you lonesome tonight do you miss me tonight
are you sorry we drifted apart
does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
when i kissed you and called you sweetheart

verse 2
do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare
do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there
is your heart filled with pain shall i come back again
tell me dear are you lonesome tonight

interlude
i wonder if you are lonesome tonight
you know someone said that the worlds a stage and each must play a part
fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
act one was where we met
i loved you at first glance
you read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
then came act two
you seemed to change you acted strange
and why ive never known
honey you lied when you said you loved me
and i had no cause to doubt you
but id rather go on hearing your lies
than to go on living without you
now the stage is bare and im standing there
with emptiness all around
and if you wont come back to me
then they can bring the curtain down
you might also likeoutro
is your heart filled with pain shall i come back again
tell me dear are you lonesome tonight5embed"
