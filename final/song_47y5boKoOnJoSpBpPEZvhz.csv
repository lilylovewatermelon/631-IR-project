verse 1
i just pull up in this bitch
in the function with my clique
i stay in the back big thing on my hip
fuckin in the back i stay with a bitch
smellin like a lick smellin like margiela
seein is believin i dont see none of you fellas stevie wonder

im a dog they dont root for me in public
if i hit it then it aint worth no discussion
we the reason that our city buzzin
all my bros collect all my bros is next
who need work i could plug you with connects

what you lookin at me for should be lookin at bankroll
