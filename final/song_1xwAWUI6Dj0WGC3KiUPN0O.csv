draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
you did some bad things but im the worst of them
sometimes i wonder which onell be your last lie
they say looks can kill and i might try
i dont dress for women
i dont dress for men
lately ive been dressin for revenge

chorus
i dont start shit but i can tell you how it ends
dont get sad get even
so on the weekends
i dont dress for friends
lately ive been dressin for revenge

verse 2
she needed cold hard proof so i gave her some
she had the envelope where you think she got it from
now she gets the house gets the kids gets the pride
picture me thick as thieves with your exwife
and she looks so pretty
drivin in your benz
lately shes been dressin for revenge

chorus
she dont start shit but she can tell you how it ends
dont get sad get even
so on the weekends
she dont dress for friends
lately shes been dressing for revenge

ladies always rise above
ladies know what people want
someone sweet and kind and fun
the lady simply had enough

verse 3
while he was doin lines and crossin all of mine
someone told his whitecollar crimes to the fbi
and i dont dress for villains
or for innocents
im on my vigilante shit again

chorus
i dont start shit but i can tell you how it ends
dont get sad get even
so on the weekends
i dont dress for friends
lately ive been dressin for revenge34embed"
