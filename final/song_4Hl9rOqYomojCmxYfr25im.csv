sun stare dont care with my head in my hands
thinking of a simpler time
like sun ra feel small
but i had it under control every time

chorus
when i was a waitress wearing a white dress
look how i do this look how i got this
i was a waitress working the night shift
you were my man felt like i got this
down at the men in music business conference
down in orlando i was only nineteen
down at the men in music business conference
i only mention it cause it was such a scene
and i felt seen
mmmmmmmmmm

verse 2
summer sizzling
listening to jazz out on the lawn
listеning to white stripes when thеy were whitehot
listening to rock all day long

chorus
when i was a waitress wearing a tight dress handling the heat
i wasnt famous just listening to kings of leon to the beat
like look at how i got this look how i got this
just singing the street
down at the men in music business conference
i felt free cause i was only nineteen
such a scene

summer summers almost gone
we were talking about life we were sitting outside til dawn
but i would still go back
if i could do it all again i thought
because it made me feel made me feel like a god
cause it made me feel made me feel like a god
somehow it made me feel made me feel like a god

chorus
when i was a waitress wearing a white dress
look how i do this look how i got this
when i was a waitress working the night shift
you were my man felt like i got this
down at the men in music business conference
down in orlando i was only nineteen
down at the men in music business conference
i only mention it cause it was such a scene
and i felt seen
mmmmmmmmmm

chorus
when i was a waitress wearing a tight dress
like look how i do it look how i got this
i was a waitress wearing a tight dress
like look how i do this look how i got this
outro
it made me feel made me feel like a god
it kinda makes me feel like maybe i was better off
cause it made me feel made me feel like a god
it kinda makes me feel like maybe i was better off57embed"
