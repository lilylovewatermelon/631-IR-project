verse
ima just stick to my brothers  ’cause i know that we all that we got
lucky i got me a big chance no im not missin my shot
i been investin’ in myself stackin the wealth then head to the top
i know niggas proud of my spot i been gettin money a lot
i try to do better for niggas but they said whatever and ran after thots
not tryna get cheddar with niggas my niggas aint want it they rather the block
i think i upsetted some niggas cause niggas want handouts i do not
not speakin in general nigga but nigga the shoe fit let it rock
ima keep comin don’t stop twеntytwo off finna change shit
lately been workin’ my ass off each and еvery day is the same shit
i really plotted the shit i was locked down dreamin this fame shit
only thing left is to get to the top now i’m goin insane bitch
got what i wanted i know i cant stop now
the feeling is nameless
got what i wanted i know i cant stop now
there’s whole lotta gang shit still on the same shit
broke boy you aint speakin my language
now you see how the chain hit dont reach now you see who i came with
aint nobody want smoke no more strapped up no jokes no more
nigga know how we play that field i dont even wanna talk no more
told mama id get her a house you aint gotta live broke no more
told mama im makin it out i dont gotta sell dope no more
you dont know bout struggles i doubt i dont gotta sell soap no more
i dont got worry bout wintertime outside me havin no coat no more
i remember that time i was tryna roll kush that bro couldnt smoke no more
i remember them times ill never go back ill never go broke no more
my soul cant hurt no more still i be feelin the pain
honestly missin the gang but i can not go to the block
high profile shit changed
i gotta work on myself but i swear the love is the same
guess it just come with the fame silent ill always remain
i remember hittin the stu with my last bread i was hoppin the train
i done lost so many niggas my heart bled and it wont be the same
brodie just told me he think he might go fed he aint beatin the thing
hop in the stu and i got in my bag shit got me relivin through pain
look at the drip i aint playin
fuck is sayin i dont hear none of what you sayin
try to run up and we sprayin leave you there layin
my shooters know where you stayin
they told me i get a body for free dont worry bout payin
bro told me he catch a body for me vice versa so fuck is you sayin
keep that bitch on me when in the house while i sleep i cant even feel comfortable layin
could have really did time for shit that i did i dont even feel comfortable sayin
so much shit on my mind i think all the time it made me uncomfortable prayin
hot shit on my line i gotta decline aint tryna put another day in
i gotta make sure my family eat i gotta keep my lil bro off the streets
i gotta help my sister out in school shit i be thinkin bout really too deep
i know the kids watchin so i preach im tryna send a message they can keep
i want them trenches better on they feet hope they get inspiration off of me
dont ever limit anything you do shoot for the stars and thats where youll be
i had to find a way to make it through so many niggas was hatin on me
waitin on me tryna knock me down savages waitin and preyin on me
niggas that hated off better than me
