when there is no more room in hell
the dead will walk the earth
now you see me smilin lookin wily got a loced out face
suckas think they close to me deep inside i feel disgrace
we smoke off the ink we get blowed off the ink
we get fucked up we takin them hard pulls
now you see me smilin lookin wily got a loced out face
where tha bud at
lookin wily got a loced out face
where tha bud at
we smoke off the ink we get blowed off the ink
we get fucked up we takin them hard pulls
where tha bud at

verse 1 ramirez
sittin in a circle as were praying to the wicked one
flames arise a busta cries and everybody starts to run
lookin at the devil in his eyes dont be surprised
everybody in this bitch will die by the night

verse 2 yung plague
lightlightning strikes in front of my feet
i believe im the demon that bleeds in the color of grey ayy
winter is coming i summon the flames ayy
summer is gone im no longer yung plague ayy
noose and a blade ayy lucifers slave ayy
choosin the day ill be loose in the grave ayy
slay the sheep that pull wool over my eyes
creep in the dark im a shark in disguise
park it in drive jump out the ride
crucify me on a spike i will die right by lucifers side
bodies in a pile about a mile down the road
got a while til it snows
black and white makes the color that i glow
grow in a hole until i become whole

shoot that bitch right in his neck like executing clay morrow
then i stumble and i walk to go and grab me a shovel
yung jax teller and the concretes my jungle
smuggle a fuckboy to sacrifice into rubble
tunnel vision to murder with grey walls cavin in
crumble til im unheard of the resurrection begins
welcome to the land of six thousand degrees
feel the ferocity of fire burnin for eternity

outro lord infamous  playa fly
we smoke off the ink we get blowed off the ink
we get fucked up we takin them hard pulls
now you see me smilin lookin wily got a loced out face
where tha bud at
lookin wily got a loced out face
where tha bud at
we smoke off the ink we get blowed off the ink
we get fucked up we takin them hard pulls
where tha bud at6embed"
