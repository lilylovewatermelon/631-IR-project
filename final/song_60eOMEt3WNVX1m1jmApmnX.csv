my home is a girl with eyes like wishing wells

when i was young always gold below the midnight sun
those days are done but im still glowing

oohooh lalalalala

your family swinging from the branches of a tree
god only knows we dont need ghost stories

when youre gone goodbye so long farewell
oohooh lalalalala
