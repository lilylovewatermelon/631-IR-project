heres to the corners yet to turn
heres to the bridges yet to burn
heres to the whole thing blown apart
its open season on my heart
the days go by like flying bricks
leave gaping holes too deep to fix
id just stay home if i were smart
its open season on my heart

verse 2
i cant blame anyone but me
this reckless fool ive come to be
my tired excuses just dont fit
it dont look good from where i sit
ive tried to change without much luck
i reached the point where i get stuck
i hit the streets and the fireworks start
its open season on my heart

verse 3
i cant be something that im not
i cant give what i havent got
i dont know where or why or when
i only know the shape im in
see tim mcgraw liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likeverse 4
so heres to the clown down in the mouth
heres to the whole thing going south
my own true loves turned poison dart
its open season on my heart

outro
heres turning heartaches into art
its open season on my heartembed"
