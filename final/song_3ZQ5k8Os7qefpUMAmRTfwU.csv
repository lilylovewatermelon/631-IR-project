back me down from backing up
hold your breath now its stacking up
etched with marks but i can deal
and youre the problem and you cant feel

prechorus
try this on straightjacket feeling
so maybe i wont be alone
take back now my life youre stealing
yesterday was hell

chorus
but today im fine without you
runaway this time without you
and all i ever thought you would be
that face is tearing holes in me again

verse 2
trust you is just one defense
off a list of others you dont make sense
beg me time and time again
to take you back now but you cant win

prechorus
take back now my life youre stealing
yesterday was hell

but today im fine without you
run away this time without you
and all i ever thought you would be
that face is tearing holes in me again
but today im fine without you
run away this time without you
and all the things you put me through
im holding on by letting go of you

bridge
and when that memory slips away
there will be a better view from here
and only lonesome you remains
and just the thought of you i fear
it falls away yesterday was hell

chorus
but today im fine without you
runaway this time without you
and all i ever thought you would be
that face is tearing holes in me again
but today im fine without you
runaway this time without you
and all the things you put me through
im holding on by letting go of you1embed"
