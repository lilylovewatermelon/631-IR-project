time has gone by
i don’t know why
i’m just so stuck on you
hear my soul cry
i’ve been so high
i might nosedive over you
i don’t want the regrets
i don’t wanna feel lost
i just wanna say no but that word can’t be found
i don’t want the night sweats
i don’t want the withdraws
i just wanna be up ‘cause i’m feeling so down

chorus
i backslide
i’m an addict you’re a habit that just won’t set me free
i backslide
back to what we had now rehab’s the fix that i need
done did pills then white lines
nothing feels like you’re high
so i backslide
backslide
i’m sliding back to you

verse 2
i’ve been shaking
got me craving
i need saving from you
staying wasted
chasing pavement
can’t escape it so i use
i don’t want the heart race
i don’t want the crossfade
say i wanna get clean but i knock on your door
i just wanna find peace
i just wanna get sleep
say i wanna move on but can’t find my way forward

nothing feels like you’re high
so i backslide

i’m sliding back to you
