blood and ink stain the walls silently with bloodied knuckles
i carry on hoping its not too wrong
you said the nights were far too long
honey its just the start of it

prechorus
oh my god if only he knew if only he knew if only he knew

you gave in to me would you say the nights are far too long now
faster faster and faster

prechorus
the tеars that stain my cheek make me look weak

you gave in to me would you say the nights are far too long now
faster faster and faster
