your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
you said your mother only smiled on her tv show
youre only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
ill hope you make it to the day youre 28 years old

prechorus
youre drippin like a saturated sunrise
youre spilling like an overflowin sink
youre ripped at every edge but youre a masterpiece
and now youre tearin through the pages and the ink

chorus
everything is blue
his pills his hands his jeans
and now im covered in the colors
pulled apart at the seams
and its blue
and its blue
everything is gray
his hair his smoke his dreams
and now hes so devoid of color
he dont know what it means
and hes blue
and hes blue

you were a vision in the morning when the light came through
i know ive only felt religion when ive lied with you
he said youll never be forgiven til your boys are too
and im still waking every morning but its not with you

prechorus
youre drippin like a saturated sunrise
youre spilling like an overflowin sink
youre ripped at every edge but youre a masterpiece
and now youre tearin through the pages and the ink

chorus
everything is blue
his pills his hands his jeans
and now im covered in the colors
pulled apart at the seams
and its blue
and its blue
everything is gray
his hair his smoke his dreams
and now hes so devoid of color
he dont know what it means
and hes blue
and hes blue
bridge
you were red and you liked me because i was blue
but you touched me and suddenly i was a lilac sky
then you decided purple just wasnt for you

chorus
everything is blue
his pills his hands his jeans
and now im covered in the colors
pulled apart at the seams
and its blue
and its blue
everything is gray
his hair his smoke his dreams
and now hes so devoid of color
he dont know what it means
and hes blue
and hes blue

outro
everything is blue
everything is blue
everything is blue
everything is blue158embed"
