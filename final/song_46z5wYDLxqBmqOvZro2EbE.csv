matt and audie were a few fine folk
made love in the mornings with a few high hopes
they’d leave a note and theyd kick up dirt
in a town only good for parttime work

verse 2
they bought an astrovan and a loaded revolver
to head to montana where the weathers colder
they might steer south where the rivers red
only thing they need now is each other or death

verse 3
matt went to work nearly everyday
and in one months time they’ll be on their way
audie prepared the van you see
for a getaway bound robbery

chorus
so won’t you load up this bag because my sweet audie is tired
i promised her a life and i swear to god i’ll fire
cause her stomach it keeps turning my hands are callused rock
i’d rather die a desperate man than a man that got caught

verse 4
he made it out alive and looked her in the eyes
and he told his lover no more scraping by
we’re gonna be richer than the big machine
ill buy you diamonds bigger than the stars at sea

so won’t you load up this bag because my sweet audie is tired
i promised her a life and i swear to god i’ll fire
cause her stomach it keeps growling my hands are callused rock
i’d rather die a desperate man than a man that got caught

outro
matt and audie were a few fine folk
made love in the mornings with a few high hopes
they stand so brave in a house out east
and tonight audies cooking herself a feastembed"
