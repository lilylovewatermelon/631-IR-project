seventeen you dont think that much about life
you just live it
like kerosene dancing around a fire
but youre in it

prechorus
so you jump right in
aint afraid to fall
and you give it all

chorus
she got the best of me
she broke my heart
now all thats left of me
is beating in this guitar
every night a different town
she follows me around
so you get whats left of me
yeah you get whats left of me
cause she got the best of me

verse 2

and found something new worth living for
and a old dusty handmedown sixstring
and a couple chords

every night a different town
she follows me around
so you get whats left of me
yeah you get whats left of me
cause she got the best of me

chorus
she got the best of me
she broke my heart
now all thats left of me
is beating in this guitar
every night a different town
