verse 1
who are these people
i just woke up in my underwear
no liquor left on the shelf
i should probly introduce myself
you shoulda seen what i wore
i had a cane and a party hat
i was the king of this hologram
where theres no such thing as getting out of hand
memories tend to just pop up
drunk premeds and some rubber gloves
five thousand people with designer drugs
dont think ill ever get enough
dont think ill ever get enough

champagne cocaine gasoline
and most things in between
i roam the city in a shopping cart
a pack of camels and a smoke alarm
this night is heating up
raise hell and turn it up
saying if you go on you might pass out in a drain pipe
oh yeah dont threaten me with a good time

refrain
its a helluva feeling though
its a helluva feeling though
alright alright
its a helluva feeling though
its a helluva feeling though

verse 2
what are these footprints
they dont look very humanlike
now i wish that i could find my clothes
bedsheets and a morning rose
i wanna wake up
cant even tell if this is a dream
how did we end up in my neighbors pool
upsidedown with a perfect view
bar to bar at the speed of sound
fancy feet dancing through this town
lost my mind in a wedding gown
dont think ill ever get it now
dont think ill ever get it now
chorus
champagne cocaine gasoline
and most things in between
i roam the city in a shopping cart
a pack of camels and a smoke alarm
this night is heating up
raise hell and turn it up
saying if you go on you might pass out in a drain pipe
oh yeah dont threaten me with a good time

bridge
im a scholar and a gentleman
and i usually dont fall when i try to stand
i lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt
but i make these high heels work
ive told you time and time again
im not as think as you drunk i am
and we all fell down when the sun came up
i think weve had enough

refrain
alright alright its a helluva feeling though

alright alright its a helluva feeling though

and most things in between

this night is heating up
raise hell and turn it up

oh yeah dont threaten me with a good time58embed"
