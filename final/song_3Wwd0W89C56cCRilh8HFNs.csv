the gogetter
ill be the gogetter
yes i am ill be the gogetter
thats my plan the gogetter

verse 1
hifi boom box
pretty girl in bobby socks
after party in a hotel room
pretty soon there will be no moon
stumble home in the pourin rain
let the water ease my worried brain
some days i just cant get along
i need a head to lean my shoulders on

prechorus
palm trees the flat broke disease
and la has got me on my knees
i am the bluest of blues
every day a different different way to lose

chorus
the gogetter
the gogetter the gogetter

i got a table at the rainbow room
i told my wife id be home soon
big ships are approaching the docks
i got my hifi boom box
mashed potatoes in cellophane
i see my life goin down the drain
hold me baby and dont let go
pretty girls help to soften the blow yeah

prechorus
palm trees the flat broke disease
and la has got me on my knees
i am the bluest of blues
every day a different way to lose

chorus
the gogetter the gogetter
the gogetter ill be the the gogetter
thats my plan thats who i am
