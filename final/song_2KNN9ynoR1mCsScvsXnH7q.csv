ive been pushing all my life all my life all my life
ive been pushing all my life
ive been pushing all my life all my life all my life
ive been pushing all my life

verse 1
for someone to see right through
all the false alarms i pull
for someone to stand their ground
when i start to tear them down
for someone to outlast
the hold ups that hold me back
for someone to make it past
the guards of a cynical heart sisinging out

chorus
oh i always jump ship
but we are closer than ive ever been
i say we stay in the fire
and hope we can burn our way out
the road to my heart gets hot as hell

hook
ive been pushing all my life all my life all my life
ive been pushing all my life
ive been pushing all my life all my life all my life
ive been pushing all my life

for someone to call me out
when i start to run my mouth
for someone to talk me down
off ledges that i have found
for someone to hold me close
when im screaming to let go
for someone to make it past
the guards of a cynical heart sisinging out

chorus
oh i always jump ship
but we are closer than ive ever been
i say we stay in the fire
and hope we can burn our way out
the road to my heart gets hot as hell
ive been pushing all my life all my life all my life
ive been pushing all my life
ive been pushing all my life all my life all my life
ive been pushing all my life

bridge
i know that its not fair
to think that youll still be there
i know that its not fair
but if you leave well the pattern repeats
im pushing you away but thats not what i mean
oh im ashamed and i cannot believe
that this is what it take just to get close to me
is this what it takes just to get close to me
oh i always jump ship
but we are closer than ive ever been
chorus
oh i always jump ship
but we are closer than ive ever been
i say we stay in the fire
and hope we can burn our way out
the road to my heart gets hot as hell

hook
ive been pushing all my life all my life all my life
ive been pushing all my life
ive been pushing all my life all my life all my life
ive been pushing all my life2embed"
