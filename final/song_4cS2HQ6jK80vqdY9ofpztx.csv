sos shes in disguise
sos shes in disguise
theres a she wolf in disguise
coming out coming out coming out

verse 1
a domesticated girl thats all you ask of me
darling it is no joke this is lycanthropy
the moons awake now with eyes wide open
my bodys craving so feed the hungry

prechorus 1
ive been devoting myself to you
monday to monday and friday to friday
not getting enough retribution
or decent incentives to keep me at it
im starting to feel just a little abused
like a coffee machine in an office uh
so im gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
and tell you about it

chorus
theres a shewolf in the closet
open up and set it free ahooh
theres a shewolf in your closet
let it out so it can breathe

sitting across a bar staring right at her prey
its going well so far shes gonna get her way
nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
the moons my teacher and im her student

prechorus 2
to locate the single men i got on me a special radar
and the fire department hotline in case i get in trouble later
not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys
i just want to enjoy uh
by having a very good time
and behave very bad in the arms of a boy

chorus
theres a shewolf in the closet
open up and set it free ahooh
theres a shewolf in your closet
let it out so it can breathe

bridge
sos shes in disguise
sos shes in disguise
theres a shewolf in disguise
coming out coming out coming out
sos shes in disguise
sos shes in disguise
theres a shewolf in disguise
coming out coming out coming out
outro
theres a shewolf in the closet
let it out so it can breathe26embed"
