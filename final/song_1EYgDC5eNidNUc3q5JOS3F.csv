i thought the sun rose in your eyes
and the moon and the stars
were the gifts you gave
to the dark and the empty skies

and the first time ever i kissed your mouth
i felt the earth move in my hands
like the trembling heart
of a captive bird
that was there at my command
my love

and the first time ever i lay with you
i felt your heart so close to mine
and i knew our joy
would fill the earth
and last and last and last
till the end of time my love
the first time ever i saw your face
your face
your face
