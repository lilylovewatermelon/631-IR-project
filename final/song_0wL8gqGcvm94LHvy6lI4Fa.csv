driving with no lights on
im on mulholland drive tonight
lurking in the shadows

driving in the dark at night
all i see are the stars and the moonlight
i dont see anyone tonight tonight
just the ghost in the backseat of my ride

im on mulholland drive mulholland drive
driving fast with no lights on
with no lights on with no lights on
with no lights on with no lights on
no lights on
driving alone at night

moving fast and it feels so right feels so right
no worries on the back of my mind
lets go lets go
lets go lets go
lets go
back to mulholland drive

im on mulholland drive mulholland drive
driving fast with no lights on
with no lights on with no lights on
with no lights on with no lights on
no lights on
driving alone at night
