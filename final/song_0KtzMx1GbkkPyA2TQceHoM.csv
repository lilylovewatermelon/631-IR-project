i washed all the windows
threw away the sheets that we used
all your towels are getting laundered
all our pictures in the desk drawer
 
but i want you back in the middle of the night
i want you back in the middle of this fight
i never sleep in the middle of the night
i want you back in the middle of this fight
baby come back and fight
baby come back and fight
with me
 
i don’t do the things i used to do
and i don’t drink the way i used to
all your advice i finally took it
when you’re not round to see me do it
 
but i want you back in the middle of the night
i want you back in the middle of this fight
i never sleep and i gotta get it right
i want you back in the middle of this fight
baby come back and fight
baby come back and fight 
with me

baby come back and fight with me
i don’t want us just to be a memory
baby come back and fight with me
i don’t want us just to be a memory
baby come back and fight with me
i don’t want us just to be a memory i want you back
baby come back and fight with me
i don’t want us just to be a memory
baby come back and fight with me
i don’t want us just to be a memory i want you back
baby come back and fight with me
i don’t want us just to be a memory
baby come back and fight with me
i don’t want us just to be a memory i want you backembed"
