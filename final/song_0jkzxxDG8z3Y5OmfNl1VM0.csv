two months since you got back
how have you been and are you bored yet
the weather aint been bad
if youre into masochistic bullshit
and every photograph
thats taken here is from the summer
some guy won olympic gold
eight years ago a distance runner
and that makes a lot of sense
this place is such great motivation
for anyone tryna move
the fuck away from hibernation
yoohoo
ooh oohooh
oh no

verse 2
well im tired of dirt roads
named after high school friends grandfathers
and motherfuckers here
still dont know they caught the boston bombers
timе moves so damn slow
i swear i feel my organs failing
i stopped caring bout a month ago
sincе then its been smooth sailing
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likechorus
i would leave if only i could find a reason
im mean because i grew up in new england
i got dreams but i cant make myself believe them
spend the rest of my life with what could have been
and i will die in the house that i grew up in
im homesick
im homesick
im homesick
oh ohoh ohoh ohoh oh

chorus
i would leave if only i could find a reason
im mean because i grew up in new england
i got dreams but i cant make myself believe them
spend the rest of my life with what could have been
and i will die in the house that i grew up in
im homesick
im homesick
im homesick
im homesick
