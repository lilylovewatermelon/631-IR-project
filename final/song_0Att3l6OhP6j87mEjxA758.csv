restless nights in tokyo
wanna hear all the sounds and see all the sights
from the champsélysées to the gundam cafe
gonna eat so much fish i think im gonna be sick
gonna blow all my cash on anime yes
dont try to stop yes because im over 9000 yes
just point me to yes the pachinko machines yes
i think im kenshiro yes i think that im goku yes
can i just stay one more day

refrain
reckless nights in tokyo
oh my god its tokyo

verse 2
it was premeditated tried to get someone pregnant
it wasnt her fault im just kind of psychotic
left on my own i would never come back
id probably hide in the suicide forest shit
this all started when i was a boy
i went to the dentist and he gave me a toy
it was dragon ball z a wristslap bracelet
goku fucking ruined me
