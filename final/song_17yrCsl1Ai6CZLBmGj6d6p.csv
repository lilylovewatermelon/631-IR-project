now to the edge ill race
to the end ill make it
all the risk ill take it
head bang with my faux friends
we pour a taste out for the dead
this is the blood the body the life right now
the height right now
might be what i need
might be what i need
said you wanna hurt me now
you cant hurt me now
that might be what you need

verse
what it means to be alive on this side
said you wanna kill me now
on this side
dont let me down
on this side
down down
fuck the other side
im on this side
im on this side
im on this side
how it feels to have arrived
im inside
im inside
those are my niggas for life
mothers of us be kind
to the fathers on whom we rely
fathers of us be kind
to the mothers on whom we rely
