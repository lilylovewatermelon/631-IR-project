im from the crossroads
drells on the track
yeah ohoh

chorus
you hurt me deep when i was down to my lowest
i needed you you aint give a fuck bout me growing
all this pain ive been showing
i aint never stop just keep on flowin
it aint a thing that can break our bond ooh
if you my friend then you got trust funds
it aint no reason another man should have to raise my son
claim that you bleedin another man shouldnt have to bust your gun

verse 1
yeah fuckin on someone else and textin like you want me disrespectful
you playin with my intelligence you should be tryna better me
it aint been six months you fucked someone thеn try and bein extra
you aint a woman tellin liеs but shit i guess thats cause youre scared of me
written in my eyes pedigree
i aint in no kennel im a dog tryna feed my needs
im startin to think i drunk too much of lean
i been fallin out and crying loud no one to comfort me
suffer from somethin you dont love me
once you thug me i say fuck you
even though after i still be feelin wrong
lookin in your eyes i see trouble
i can tell that you been thuggin
i dont wanna talk to you just leave me lone

verse 2
id do anything for you anything
fuck that nigga he cant do anything for you
mistreatin me bitch you could leave i aint do you nothing
tell that you lying cause you get loud when we start fussin i aint gon hit you
if thats my brother we get money fuck another
it go up then we gon shoot this bitch down with each other
you dont fuck with me i aint takin care of you
im invested in my steppa
when i aint with you feel less than me
but stayin distanced for the better
startin to give up on stolen treasure
i make you mine how many niggas can say they been with you
i aint no different but it hit different when the women do
it fuck with me you aint right here and you know it do
cant wait til i get over you for the swearin that it be the truth
when i say i aint even notice you
chorus
