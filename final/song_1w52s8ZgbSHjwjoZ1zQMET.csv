verse 1
how you livin are you doin fine
are you gettin money do you need a ride
ive been livin off adderall for like three months straight and i
ive been trippin ive been gettin mine
ive been dippin ive been livin life
i appreciate the high life
but i just wish things were better between the ones that i love
no i dont want to try hard
just dont wanna be dont wanna be alone

stuck with just weed and no friends
weed and my pen
