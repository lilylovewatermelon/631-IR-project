iturrioz 2


the most profound silence reigned in one of the houses of the suburbs of oyarzun pedro iturrioz the head of the family a robust mountaineer of advanced age had finished his supper and his wife some years younger than he was at his side offering him a cup of warm wine and awaited that her husband should address her the chieftain made a sign and the wife placed in his hands a silver cup with a gesture of tender love and deep respect

p 81

paragraph continues she then laid on the table a basket filled with luscious fruit and sat down at the further end of the room at her wheel spinning the finest thread which later on would become converted into handkerchiefs towels and perfumed linen such as abounds in quantities in all basque homes at another corner of the kitchen two girls of singular beauty were conversing in a low tone with a youth of about fifteen years of age who stood with uncovered head

a long settle ornamented with large brass nails could be seen unoccupied beneath the wide chimney roof to the right of the hearth the gleams from the crackling fire on the hearth and the bright rays of a flambeau of hempen cord and rosin which hung from an iron ring lit up this family group the chief divided a beautiful apple and gave one half to his wife then drank twothirds of the warm wine in the cup and invited her to finish the rest this she did without saying a word the mountaineer then uncovered his venerable head and all rose up on seeing this action he made the sign of the cross murmured a prayer in which all present joined and then sat down on the settle by the fireside

one of the girls removed the supper things carefully folded the white cloth and then all the family sat clown around the fire the mistress of the house was spinning the young girls were winding skeins of thread on wooden reels the youth sharpened a woodmans knife meanwhile

p 82

that pedro iturrioz leaning his elbow on the arms of the settle appeared lost in thought the eyes of all were directed to the countenance of the old man whose eyes were gradually closing in sleep the wife made quietly a sign the conversation of the girls ceased and the young man intoned in a low voice a simple monotonous song the cadences of which were marked by the three women moving their hands the melody certainly acted with much power on the aged man for his head fell over his breast in deep sleep

through the halfopen door poured in the beams of the moon which was illuminating the magnificent landscape of luxuriant trees and gigantic mountains the ripple of the mountain stream was also heard imparting on that quiet scene a singular charm for a length of time did all things remain in this way until suddenly the old man awoke and said

tell me antonio what did you hear on the mountain

the youth threw down the knife which he was sharpening rose up and respectfully replied
i heard father that the battle proved a bloody one

do you know who were the vanquished

i was not told father

the old man remained silent the eldest girl turned deadly pale and allowed the skein she was winding to fall to the ground and gazed on her brother as though

p 83

she wished to interrogate him with her looks antonio however awaited his fathers permission to speak

tomorrow ere it is light proceed to the frontier and do not return until you learn what success the combat has had said the father

i will do so replied the youth

then approach nearer to me and listen antonio

what do you wish me to do antonio asked bending down his ear to listen to the words his father desired to speak confidentially

gil is with them he said in a deeply moved voice he is your brother and my son ask explore the camp and when you return tell me that you saw him alive or else if he is dead that you buried him in a christian manner

i will comply with your orders father

should he be living tell him from me that i forbid himdo you understand i forbid him to use his weapons against those of arpide so long as they are before the enemy continued the father
and to me do you also forbid me this

yes my son feuds and private resentments although they may lie deep should be hushed and laid aside when it is a question of saving the country cursed may he be who shall do otherwise

the old man rose up kissed the foreheads of the three women blessed antonio and slowly quitted the kitchen

p 84

paragraph continues half an hour later he was sleeping the calm sleep of the just man

scarcely had pedro iturrioz left the room than the women surrounded antonio

your father has communicated to you secret commands which are not given to me to know said the mother with saintly resignation obey him my son implicitly your father holds the place of god in this world

this you have always taught me my mother replied the youth kissing her

so it is antonio but after the father it appertains to the mother to counsel her children sit down and listen to me

the three young people sat down the mother between her two daughters one of which betrayed considerable anguish while the other was lovingly watching her antonio knelt before catalina and fixed his black eyes upon her the wife of iturrioz was caressingly playing with the curly locks of her son

antonio she said your brother is fighting on the frontier you well know his fiery character if he still lives tell him to fulfil his duty like the brave nevertheless not to attempt or risk his life in senseless heedless undertakings

i will tell him so replied the youthful antonio

tell him continued catalina that he is to forget
p 85

our private questions and only remember that he is a guipuzcoan and that his enemies are those who are enemies to the country

my brother do not forget these prudent counsels interrupted the maiden who was evidently suffering grief

what do you know of these affairs inez demanded antonio giving her a searching look

it is true replied the girl blushing that i understand but little about these things but i nevertheless believe that sound reason dictates these counsels

my mother what you have just advised me is the same as my father bade me do

god be praised replied catalina now nothing else remains to advise but that you are not to linger on the journey receive your mothers blessing and may god protect your brothers my girls let us retire

they all rose up and left the kitchen the household remained only under the protection of the laws of the country and watched and guarded by a mastiff which stretched itself before the fire

ii

the witch of zaldin

the hour of midnight was striking when the outer door of the house was slowly opened and an aged woman entered the kitchen the mastiff lifted up his head

p 86

uttered a growl approached the new comer and then turned lazily to lie down again the woman threw some dry branches on the fire and a brilliant flame lit up the hospitable room after this she imitated to perfection the screech of an owl and a light step was very soon after heard descending the stairs from the first floor dominica the youngest of the daughters of pedro iturrioz had just entered and stopped at some distance looking at the stranger with a look of fear and respect depicted on her countenance

approach dominica and come and sit by my side said the old woman

the maiden obeyed and sat on the wooden bench occupied by her interlocutor the mastiff then rose and lay at the feet of dominica placing his intelligent head between her knees that group lit up by the firelight and standing out in relief against the blackened walls partook somewhat of the weird character of witchcraft the old woman with her brown wrinkled brow round unquiet eyes red tangled hair and long pointed nose formed a strange contrast to the fresh checks beautiful expressive black eyes lithe waist and graceful smile of dominica to complete the picture we will add that the old woman drew her face close to the fair countenance of the maiden the mastiff meanwhile watching with his penetrative sight all the movements of the witch

p 87

did you send for me dominica asked the old woman in a low voice well here i am what do you want with me

i wished to know replied the girl in an agitated voice who were the vanquished in the battle fought on the frontier

nothing else questioned the witch meanwhile attentively watching dominica

nothing more replied the maiden lowering her eyes

very well open that window which looks in the direction of the camp

it is open she said throwing it back

look up to the sky

i am looking

what do you see towards the west

i see a grey cloud

what form has it taken

it appears to me to be like the skeleton of a gigantic horse

what more do you observe

i see the cloud divided in two

which side is the larger half

the side of the head

the navarrese and the french are vanquished replied the witch

dominica gave a cry of joy and approaching the witch said is this certain what you tell me

p 88

as certain as that i am standing here do you wish to know more

i would much like to know what has been the fate of my brother the girl replied

i will satisfy your curiosity come near that caldron

dominica hastened to do as she was bidden

put it on the fire and go to the fields and bring me the roots of the plant virtude

the girl left the house to seek the desired roots followed by the mastiff then the wily pythoness drew from her pocket a leathern bag and took out of it a bundle of rags she began to unfold most carefully this bundle until she discovered the hand of a child 1 in perfect preservation and around this little hand were some curls of silky golden hair out of a small earthenware

p 89

bottle she poured some drops of red liquor into the caldron which was already becoming hot over the fire and waited for the return of dominica

she had not long to wait the maiden soon returned bearing a bundle of roots in her hand and when she went near the old woman she noticed that the mastiff was pulling at her dress

be quiet moor be quiet she said to the dog it seems you like to amuse yourself out in the moonlight

she then turned to the woman and gave her the roots

did you gather these roots under the shadow the old witch asked as she took them from dominica

yes under the shadow of a walnut tree

it is well sit down on the bench and watch with all attention the caldron

the witch threw the carefully peeled roots into the cauldron the contents of which were beginning to boil a few moments after there rose up a blue flame which cast a weird reflection on the furniture of the kitchen

what do you see inquired the witch

i see my brother covered with blood and sleeping calmly i see many dead lying on the battlefield ah me she cried suddenly

what more do you see

i see juan de arpide also sleeping at some distance there are many camp fires i see sentinels

look towards your brother what is he doing

p 90

good heavens cried dominica turning pale

what is taking place asked the witch

my brother rises up unsheathes his sword and cautiously approaches juan de arpide

your brother and arpide must fight and blood will flow said the witch in a woeful tone of voice what more do you see

nothing more replied dominica trembling

turn your face towards the wall continued the witch attentively observe the figures which will be depicted on the wall

dominica obeyed and uttering a cry of anguish she covered her eyes with her hands

it is impossible for me to look the girl said greatly agitated

take your hands from your face and tell me what you see i have no time to listen to your cries and sobs

i see juan de arpide and a woman is holding him up in her arms

do you know that woman

her face is turned away from me

look attentively towards arpide what is his colour

he is pale very pale

are you satisfied asked the witch with an evil smile on her wrinkled face

my poor sister exclaimed dominica weeping

p 91

your brother has shed the blood of the lover of inez do you wish to know further about these love affairs

the mastiff howled and placed its two paws on the shoulders of the maiden and licked her face

good gracious murmured dominica

make up your mind quickly they are waiting for me elsewhere these last two hours

the girl hesitated while the dog continued to lick its young mistresss face meanwhile eyeing savagely the old woman

bah you are weakspirited then said the witch putting her bag away and preparing to depart

wait stay a moment dominica cried as she pulled at the dress of the old woman to detain her

i cannot remain longer in this house replied the old woman looking askance at the mastiff

very well then i decide said the girl

the dog gave a piteous whine and leaving the girl went to a corner and rolled itself up

take this bag now that you have made up your mind to do as you are bid and observe anew the blue flame

i will do so said dominica taking the bag and making a great effort to overcome her fear

open the bag and throw into the caldron one by one all the objects it contains

p 92

dominica obeyed but when she drew forth the mutilated member and saw it in her hand enwrapped with a curl of hair she felt such a sensation of horror that she threw it the bag and all its contents into the fire which burned on the hearth

a fearful detonation shook the house and when the girl wished to fly away she could not her knees bent under her and she fell to the ground uttering a piercing cry she saw the witch of zaldin cast herself forth out of the window transformed into a monstrous bat

the fire slowly became extinguished and the room remained in total darkness

iii

the avowal

it was at break of day when antonio dressing hurriedly prepared to leave the house at the door he was met by inez seated on the doorstep breathing nervously the fresh morning breeze

good morning inez he said kissing her on the forehead why have you risen so early

i wished to see you before you left the house

thank you my inez in this i know your love for me why is not dominica with you

she is asleep i suppose but listen antonio i am

p 93

alone because i wished to confer with you you are young i know but nevertheless the counsels of men of your age are more prudent and just than those of women at mine

antonio looked at his sister and noticed by the light of the dawn that she was very pale

are you ill my sister he affectionately asked

yes antonio sick in body and more so in the soul

poor inez what can i do for you speak for you well know that i love you tenderly

inez raised her eyes and fixed them in such a searching manner on her brother that he felt deeply wounded

do you perchance doubt my affection he asked

such a doubt on your part would wound me much

far from it my brother sweetly replied inez i am going to confide to you something which is unknown to gil or to our father

that will comfort me replied antonio sitting close to her

the hours are passing swiftly my brother and you have far to go listen to me therefore and be indulgent to me

speak inez speak i will listen attentively

inez took the hand of antonio between hers and began her narrative in the following way

you are aware of the fearful enmity which exists

p 94

between our family and that of arpide this enmity is the principal cause of my unhappiness

why so asked antonio in a tone of fear

because the case is this my brother i have met juan and the first time i saw him i flew from his presence

you did well my sister the injury his father did to our father is unpardonable

listen to me to the end from that day he never ceased to follow me if i went to oyarzun to church accompanied by my mother i was certain to meet him at the church door he would kneel close to us during mass and when we left the temple we used to find him at the porch when we returned home he always followed us at a distance

without addressing a word to you

he never dared to do so when i approached to my window i could always see him with bow slung on shoulder standing on the summit of the mountain his eyes fixed on our house

perchance does that man harbour any evil designs against us

no quickly replied inez the spring came and at daydawn when i used to open the window of my room i always found each morning a crown of flowers on the sill at first i used to throw the flowers to the ground because i felt certain that he would be concealed

p 95

somewhere in the wood and watching what i did but on the following day i would meet juan either in the woods or close to the fountain and on his countenance there was such a look of deep sadness that i could not help pitying him

antonio withdrew his hand from that of his sisters and remained pensive

listen to me brother for pitys sake his reserve and respectful conduct arrested my attention in an extraordinary manner i thought of him more frequently than i should and in spite of every effort i made to drive his image from my mind i found it impossible to do so    it was at the twilight hour i was returning from visiting the dead remains of our poor cousin lucia whom we all so dearly loved it began to snow heavily and the road was impassable on reaching the cross which stands close to the spring i saw a black form standing in the middle of the road this form had eyes which were flashing in the darkness like two flames and fixed on me i grew so alarmed that i remained rooted to the spot nor could i even cry out the form gave a terrific howl and cast itself on me

perhaps it was juan exclaimed the lad leaping to his feet wretch

no my brother it was not he it was the dreadful wolf the terror of all the district

the one which was found dead close to the fountain

p 96

paragraph continues poor sister he said taking once more the hand of his sister

my death was certain she continued shuddering when i beheld the animal close upon me grinding his teeth and howling the excess of fear made me utter a piercing scream and just as i was about to fall a prey to the clutches of the wolf i saw a human form emerge from the far end of the road place itself between the beast and myself and receive the first encounter the two then wrestled in a desperate manner and what added to the horror of the moment was the fact that neither the wolf howled nor did the man who fought with it utter a cry it was a dumb encounter yet a fierce one what i endured at that moment is simply indescribable i believed in good faith that the man who thus wrestled with the beast was gil

during the narrative of this encounter antonio pressed convulsively the hands of inez

the combat continued for nearly ten minutes continued the maiden the wolf fell down dead strangled by the iron grip of my liberator he then approached me and you may judge what my surprise must have been when i recognized in him juan de arpide

juan de arpide cried antonio in deep astonishment

yes my brother i owe him my life he besought me to allow him to see me home and to swear to him

p 97

never to tell any one what had taken place i gave the desired promise and until today i have kept my oath

and have you seen him since asked antonio

many times my brother because from that moment i found it impossible to keep from loving him

saying this she blushed and hid her face on the breast of her brother the youth felt greatly moved on hearing this tender avowal

do you know inez antonio asked after a moments pausedo you know whether he loves you

his lips have never told me his love but his eyes often do garlands of flowers adorn my window every morning and on the eve of his departure to fight against the enemy of our country instead of finding the usual crown i found only two flowers an everlasting flower and a pansy twined together

his behaviour has been a truly noble one said the youth in a solemn tone rise up poor sister inez lift up that brow pure as the first thought of a babe rise up my sister i your brother will protect you against all others should our father yield to the impulses of hatred and curse your love and should our eldest brother do the same i who know what has passed will never desist from protecting you my sister when gil and my father shall come to know what i do i have no doubt but they will bless you as the peacemaker

p 97

between the two families which never ought to have been severed they will bless you inez as i bless you

inez threw herself into the arms of her brother who warmly embraced her and covered her face with kisses

i did well to confide in you my brother she cried shedding tears of joy

yes my sister you did well i cannot forget that you have loved me with singular affection and although i partake somewhat of the disposition of my father and respect his opinion nevertheless my heart tells me that in this respect his ideas are not the most desirable ones retire now dear inez and await my return who knows what may take place

let us trust in god my brother

so be it let us trust all things to god

and that he may keep you in his holy keeping dear antonio

they once more embraced each other and the young man started to carry out the orders given to him by his father

iv

the duel

along the western skirt of the hills which form a ridge from leiza to the shores of the ocean a horseman

p 99

arrayed in armour might be seen riding along mounted on a fiery steed from the dilapidated state of his armour his crushed war helmet the rusty broken cuirass the want of feathers in the tuft worn on his casque could be inferred that the brave knight was returning from some tournament or fierce combat he rode on alone without page or shieldbearer stopping now and again to reconnoitre the country through which he passed grasping the hilt of his sword whenever the slightest noise reached his ears or unfastening the war hatchet which he carried suspended from the pommel of his saddle whenever a shepherd or traveller crossed his path he left on his right the town of goizueta he followed the path of urumea towards the immediate boundary of the stronghold of articuza a celebrated arsenal of those parts close to which is seen a sumptuous building the admiration of all who frequent those fastnesses however in those days nothing of this existed and the very narrow valley wherein the palace and arsenal were constructed was then the wildest place in all that district

when the horseman reached the summit of one of the mountains which surrounded that valley the sun was setting behind the sea and could only be descried from that spot by a golden line along the horizon far away the knight stood still for a moment to gaze upon the scene and then continued his journey descending

p 100

into the dark valley on reaching near one of the broken rocks which intercepts the flow of the stream that passes at the bottom of the valley he stopped dismounted and threw himself on the grass leaving his horse to graze quietly and prepared to enjoy a few moments of repose but when the horseman rose to continue his march the horse suddenly gave a loud neigh which was quickly replied to by another the knight leaped on his steed and prepared himself for the defensive expecting to be taken by surprise he listened for some time and it was not long before he heard the noise of hoofs trampling and the rattle of armour the darkness of night prevented him from distinguishing objects even at a short distance so that it was not until the two horsemen found themselves face to face that they were able to see one another

who goes there asked the first arrival

and who are you to ask me replied the other

i am a knight said the first

guipuzcoan or navarrese

guipuzcoan was the reply

god assist you in that case we are friends

saying this they approached nearer to one another and asked where are you going to

towards oyarzun

are you of that place

very near it

p 101

in that case your name must be well known what may it be

juan de arpide

and i am gil de iturrioz replied the second

a moments silence followed this declaration the two confronted each other the firstborn of each of those two families whose feuds dated from long years

we meet at last on neutral ground said gil to his antagonist here we have not our arms tied through respect for the laws of the country neither have we here to forget our private feuds in order to combat against the common enemy

you say well replied arpide in a sad tone nevertheless i do not see the reason why we should measure swords when there exists no reason for rancour between us

why not asked gil does juan de arpide forget that his father insulted mine or does he think that an injury done to the chieftain of the family does not bind his descendants to vengeance a graceful inheritance it would certainly be

listen to me gil replied arpide i do not deny that there have existed misunderstandings in both families since the day when my father refused the hand of his sister after he had promised it nevertheless previous to this unfortunate occurrence i have understood that there existed a close friendship between the

p 102

families very well must the remembrance of the good feeling be altogether extinguished by the recollection of an injury due perhaps to the unbridled fiery character of our parents let us be just gil the peace which our elders severed let us bind once more together let us end our feuds gil let us be brothers there are over many enemies to fight with us on the plains of our country without weakening ourselves by intestine wrestling

by my faith but you ought to fling down your armour and substitute the soutane said gil with an ironical smile i can assure you that you resemble a missionary preacher more than a knight who wears spurs

gil i do not deserve this provocation on your part you are well aware that it is not fear which induces me to speak in this way but the desire that a good understanding and harmony should exist between us

on my part i do neither desire nor contemn it when i was born these hatreds existed between the families of arpide and of iturrioz with these feuds i was brought up and with them i shall die

how wrong you do exclaimed juan in a desponding tone

that is not your affair haughtily replied gil in any case it does not devolve on you to counsel me neither do i humble myself to ask your advice

i have not attempted to become your counsellor

p 103

paragraph continues you may foster your hatred as long as you wish and may god grant it may be for a short term but let us separate at least without using our weapons

you are very prudent and discreet arpide said gil laughing perchance you are more than prudentyou are a coward

eight days have not yet elapsed since you yourself saw to the contrary replied arpide making a great effort to restrain his anger

that is true but nevertheless i believe that it is not the same thing to fight against common soldiers and french invaders as it is to fight against a son of pedro iturrioz

that is not the reason why i feel a repugnance to fight with you you are well aware that i do not fear you

what then can be your motive

i fear the consequences which will result from this duel god guard you gil i declare that i do not wish to fight against you

on concluding these words he set spurs to his horse and turned away

you do not wish it cried iturrioz in wrathful tones then i will compel you to fight

and running up to him he dealt a fierce blow with his mailed gauntlet at the face of juan de arpide

the latter stopped looked at gil dismounted and

p 104

drew his sword gil iturrioz did the same and both prepared for the combat

the spot in which they were to combat could not certainly be less fitted for fighting the surface of the ground was scarcely level for the space of two yards on three sides it was surrounded by dense tangled briars and brushwood on the fourth was a fearful chasm the night was dark and some drops of rain were falling the first to assault was gil de iturrioz whose sword fell heavily on the shoulder of juan de arpide the duel began the broken rocks and hollow places echoed the clashing of the weapons rays of lightning flashed at intervals from the summit of the cliff illuminating for brief moments the armour of the combatants and by the aid of this uncertain light it could be perceived that gil retained the fiery gleams of his eyes and that he struck furiously meanwhile that the countenance of juan revealed an expression of intense sorrow and he only maintained an attitude of defence the combat continued no other sound was heard in those solitudes but the rough clanging of arms no voice broke the stillnessnot a single word did they pronounce any one who perchance had passed the vicinity would have judged that he was witnessing some gigantic wrestling between the spirits of darkness

suddenly a heavy fall was heard and a voice which said rise up gil and let this end the duel

p 105

no by my faith although you might have killed me while i lay on the ground

nevertheless i did not do so let us therefore finish at this point and each go his way

as an only reply to this was heard anew the clashing of weapons to indicate that the fight was being continued this did not however last long a terrible blow was dealt a cry of pain was heard and then all things lapsed into deep silence

amid the shadows of the trees was seen gliding away a large form and along the stony road was heard the tread of a horse galloping at full speed

v

maitagarri 1

at nightfall an the following day juan de arpide found himself sitting in the most concealed part of the valley of articuza near him and at the foot of a broken rock his warhorse was quietly grazing he felt his limbs

p 106

so benumbed that he could not move he began to recall all the events which had taken place on the previous day and then rose to his memory the encounter he had had with gil his conversation with him the duel which had followed and its ending he looked up towards the rock at the base of which he was sitting and noticed that it was on its heights that he had fought on the previous night he then comprehended the cause of his benumbed state and the deep holes of his broken armour told the rest he felt bruised all over his neck was wounded and he was almost inanimate from want of food since he had not taken any nourishment for some thirty hours all human help seemed to him impossible in that solitary spot a canopy of verdure during summer covers this wild part the trees with their enormous growth and extended branches entwined with each other and scarcely permitted the sunbeams to pierce through the stream of pure water which flows along the base of this narrow valley bathes the trunks of the trees and preserves a delightful freshness around the vegetation there is strong magnificent and nothing more poetic can be imagined than a walk by moonlight across that calm solitude this rivulet in places forms little lakes calm and still small lagoons surrounded by reeds briars lilies and wild roses when gazing on the tranquil waters of these lakes in miniature one would almost believe that he

p 107

were gazing on a large mirror surrounded by flowers perchance some kingfisher of emeraldine hues is heard screeching or skimming with its wings the surface of the lake some stag quenches its thirst from the currents which feed the stream or a nightingale perched on the branches singing plaintively or a dove whose sad cooing invites to meditation are the only creatures which give life to the romantic landscape

juan de arpide seeing that the night was closing in and feeling that it would be impossible to bear the pangs of hunger until morning called his horse which was grazing near him and the faithful animal soon joyously neighed in response to its masters call and came to him after several vain attempts to mount him he at length succeeded and proceeded on his march juan found himself on the margin of one of the tiny lakes which we have just described at the base of the cliff from the summit of which he had rolled over on the previous night from the middle of this lake rose a diaphanous vapour long stems of climbing plants hung from the broken edges of the overhanging rocks until they dipped their ends in the waters of the lake these were covered with leaves and formed hanging curtains similar to the reed lattices which shade chinese windows long pointed reedmace grew on the margins and the branches of a weeping willow waved at the mercy of a gentle breeze like the feathers on a war helmet the

p 108

horseman fancied he perceived amid the shades of night a sudden undulation on the waters he thought also that the overhanging stems of the climbing plants were separating he saw the branches of the willow tree moving in a strange manner and at last he heard the sounds of far distant melody the mysterious echoes of which seemed to enrapture his spirit the crystalline surface of the waters became divided and enveloped in the mist which rose from the lake he saw appearing a number of maidens of incomparable beauty their brows were encircled by roses and their aerial bodies were covered with robes of white gauze stars of pale light adorned the centre of their diadems

they rose up softly above the surface of the water and taking one anothers hands the maidens began to intone the strange peculiar music which had so enthralled the attention of the horseman all their faces were pale their eyes were half closed and veiled by long eyelashes their abundant hair hung down loosely over their alabaster shoulders

soon after this singular apparition the maidens proceeded to the spot where the knight completely abstracted with this vision was gazing on and they surrounded him on all sides one held the bridle of his horse which seemed to be spellbound so quiet and motionless had the animal become another held the stirrups so that the warrior might dismount others

p 109

removed his mailed armour others again took his shield and the heavy lance and in this state disarmed and confused in mind on beholding himself served and waited upon by a bevy of such lovely maidens he allowed himself to be conducted beneath the hanging branches of the willow tree this tree with its waving overhanging branches covered the entrance to a cave whose floor carpeted with fine yellow sand was the entrance to the magic mansion of the maitagarri of the pyrenees all whatsoever the most poetic imagination of the east could invent of marvels was found collected together in the vast saloon where the maidens conducted the knight the vaulted dome shone as though it were composed of one immense polished diamond high columns of stalactites which appeared like crystal serpents twisted one with another amid garlands of flowers sustained that brilliant ceiling fringes of lilies joined together leaves of the wild vine mingled with flowers of the rosemary red as the ruby formed festoons which were truly enchanting and beneath a canopy formed by the crystallized waters was seen a throne of moss soft as the skin of the ermine yielding like the cushions upon which recline the oriental odalisques softly leaning on this couch reposed the queen of this mansion of marvels red tiny slippers covered her feet and a gauze embroidered with gold veiled her face when the warrior entered this retreat she arose and drew back her veil her jetblack

p 110

eyes were fixed on juan de arpide around her coral lips hovered a charming smile and with her exquisitely modelled hand she made a sign to the knight to come and sit by her side arpide obeyed and the maidens who had conducted him disappeared

juan de arpide she said in a melodious voice you have come in here at a forbidden hour you have surprised me in my sleep and you interrupted my feasts you were worthy of punishment

lady replied arpide astonished at beholding such exquisite beauty i was unaware of your existence in these places and if in effect i have committed the crimes you accuse me of the blame is due to my evil star

for that reason do i forgive you replied the charmer had it not been for my intervention your death would have been certain

how so do you perchance know

i know all concealed in the shadows i witnessed your combat of yesternight i guessed your grounds of complaint and when you were engaged in the duel had you not found invisible arms in the air to ward off and lessen the blows that were directed upon you your body would have been broken to pieces

and how am i to thank you lady for such a signal favour cried arpide fascinated by the looks and speech of maitagarri

you owe me nothing i saved your life that is

p 111

certain and therefore that life belongs to me for the future

lady cried the knight looking in terror to his interlocutor

do not doubt it juan i think also that you ought to thank me for this new proof of my affection i well deserve that for my love you should sacrifice that of inez de iturrioz

juan de arpide bent down his head and made no reply

maitagarri broke the silence of the knight

do you not answer me yet so must it be a being that like you penetrates into my domains never leaves it again and the enchantress assumed to the astonished eyes of the warrior the same features the same looks the same voice as inez de iturrioz

juan de arpide thought he was dreaming all the pains he had suffered in his body had left him he no longer felt the pangs of hunger he seemed to be drinking in life from the eyes of maitagarri

listen to me she continued approaching him i will make you the happiest of mortals do you desire glory speak and the crown of the conqueror will ever encircle your brow do you wish for wealth ask and you shall see palaces rising up to receive you brilliant shields to defend you costly robes to adorn you maidens and pages to serve you do you yearn for love you will possess mine eternallya love which is not to be compared with any other

p 112

oh inez inez cried the knight half distracted

the enchantress took his hand and imprinted a kiss on his brow but that hand was icy cold and her kisses had no warmth in them

juan experienced a feeling of terror mingled with pleasure coursing through his veins he felt the influence of the charmed atmosphere that it was acting upon him in a soothing manner he felt drowsy and a mist rose before his eyes a heavy slumber made his eyelids droop and he fell heavily on the bed of moss and sleep completely overpowered him

then maitagarri summoned her maidens and they sprinkled perfumed waters on his mossy bed they cooled the atmosphere by waving huge fans of gauze and upon his lips they poured some drops of red liquor

suddenly the mysterious light which had so splendidly illumined that chamber gradually began to lose its radiance the fairy queen gazed on the face of the sleeping knight and a look of deep sadness overspread her countenance as also over those of her maidens their aerial forms became more impalpable in proportion as the light waned and they quickly disappeared converted into mist which likewise dispersed leaving the cavern in complete darkness the clatter of armed knights was echoed among the rocks and the songs of the linnets filled the woods the sun was showing its rubicund face on the heights of the mountain aya

p 113

when juan de arpide awoke he found himself in the same magic chamber his head reposing at the feet of maitagarri whose velvety eyes were fixed on him as though wishful of receiving the first glance on awaking a table covered with abundant and delicate food stood in the centre of the chamber

the pilgrim

antonio wended his way to the encampment some of the soldiers told him that juan de arpide had disappeared and that his brother gil of iturrioz seeing the franconavarrese army routed and not supposing that it should ever become reorganized had departed towards home the other troops were also retiring

when the youth returned home he thought that some news must have been received of the lover of his sister and he was determined to protect her love great was his surprise when he only found gil who had brought the news that juan de arpide had died in battle

the news given unexpectedly and without any preparation inflicted a mortal wound in the heart of inez a profound sadness took possession of her and a slow obstinate fever began to undermine her existence whole days would she spend seated on the trunk of the

p 114

tree where she had seen her lover for the first time and at night she used to rise stealthily from her bed to creep away and wander along the solitary fields and woods her brow grew pale the light of her eyes became dimmed her wellformed figure wasted away to a skeleton and from a maiden of great beauty she became like a living shadow which the slightest breath of air would suffice to extinguish her life the sage counsels of her father the tender caresses of her mother and sister afforded no balm to cure and comfort that sad heart wounded to death to the wise words of her father she would listen patiently and reply by a sad smile to the tender caresses of her mother by a flood of tears

in this way passed several months it was late in the autumn the leaves of the trees were flying about in clouds impelled by the northwest winds like birds of passage when they emigrate to remote lands and climes the blue sky was covered by the first fogs of winter the days were visibly shortened and the nights were lengthening over the earth the sickness of inez was following its course her nightly walks had already ceased

one night the whole family were gathered together around the hearth the father with his venerable head uncovered was blessing the frugal meal which was laid on the rustic table gil of iturrioz was sitting at one side

p 115

of the room catalina was spanning flax casting from time to time sad looks at inez who propped up with pillows her eyelids half closed and her almost transparent hands crossed was murmuring some words and smiling to herself in such a melancholy manner that her smile drew tears from those around her dominica was weeping hiding her face in her hands antonio was convulsively clutching between his hands his woodknife with which he was carving ingenious patterns upon a walnutwood stick which was to serve as a staff for his dying sister a deep silence reigned in that apartment a storm was raging outside when suddenly some one was heard knocking at the door

go and see who is there antonio said the head of the family

a poor stranger who has lost his way and asks for shelter replied a voice at the door

god protect the traveller replied pedro iturrioz come in whoever ye may be the doors of the basque are always open to the traveller

the stranger entered the young men rose up and antonio approached the stranger to assist him catalina left her wheel and placed a plate on the table the head of the family made a sign for the stranger to sit on the settle near the firea seat of honour reserved for the oldest of the family but which is always given up to the guest or the stranger

p 116

he who had come in was dressed in the garb of a pilgrim he appeared to be about fifty years of age his heard was thick but snowwhite his face was darkcomplexioned his hair curly a distraught look in his eyes his limbs were strong and well built although he appeared tired and weary the coarse robe which covered him was torn and draggled a large felt hat covered his head and he supported himself with a long staff

at the invitation of the host the pilgrim took the seat offered him and partook of the supper with him

when supper was over pedro iturrioz asked the stranger to say night prayers for them which the traveller did in a tremulous voice scarcely had the pilgrim concluded the prayers than a deepdrawn sigh was heard which made them all turn round inez had risen up appalled her eyes had lost their brilliancy and were opened wide in a ghastly way her mouth pale and parched articulated some sounds while her outstretched hands and arms seemed as though they wished to draw some distant object towards them in this posture did she remain for some minutes to the great astonishment of all who were there then she slowly moved her head and fell back into her chair and into her former position

inez said dominica in tender accents do you wish for anything 

p 117

nothing my sister i want nothing i had a happy dream but one which will never be realized

the young woman once more returned to her usual listless silent manner

my poor daughter murmured catalina sobbing

bid me adieu my mother replied inez looking sadly at her life is fast ebbing away and i will soon go to join my darling

catalina took her daughters hands in hers and began to kiss them passionately

is your daughter ill the pilgrim asked pedro

the wrath of god has descended on this house he replied let us bless his holy name and submit to his loving will

the holy resignation of the old man visibly affected the pilgrim for his eyes were streaming with tears

can you tell me the cause of her illness asked the pilgrim

they say she is dying of love

poor child murmured the pilgrim

you say well poor child replied the old man before this unhappy event she was the pride of my old age and the joy of my heart

perhaps she was forsaken by her lover

no her lover was one of our neighbours a noble honourable man

and what became of him still asked the pilgrim

p 119

he died replied the old man bending down his head he died just as we were at the point of extinguishing the feuds which had divided the two families for years and when apprised of his noble conduct towards my daughter i was ready to admit him into my house alas hatred is a cursed passion and for having harboured that passion too long in my breast god has punished me blessed be the justice of god that he has thought meet to make us an example

can you tell me how he died insisted the pilgrim

he died the death i wish for my sonson the field of battle

the pilgrim slowly turned his head and looked towards gil who appeared taciturn and ill at ease not daring to look at his sister

did you say he died on the battlefield he asked after some moments

yes he did replied pedro

fighting against his enemies

yes fighting against the enemies of his country

once again the pilgrim looked towards gil de iturrioz

antonio had approached his father and was listening attentively to the dialogue between him and the stranger

who told you so once more asked the pilgrim

my son who saw him die

which of them the youth who is listening to us or gil whom i see so abstracted

p 119

gil replied the old man astonished at the indiscreet curiosity of the stranger and more greatly astonished still that he should know the name of his son

gil iturrioz in that case told you a lie said the pilgrim in a ringing voice

gil iturrioz never lies cried the firstborn of the family leaping to his feet and threatening the stranger with clenched fist

strike knight strike me on the facethis face so wrinkled it will then be the second time that you do it said the pilgrim bowing himself down

the arm of the young man dropped powerless by his side in presence of that evangelical humility and he covered his face with his hands

knight exclaimed the pilgrim addressing gil i accuse you before your parents of the odious crime of assassination

the bystanders shuddered on hearing these words inez drew herself up and fixed all her attention on that scene

’tis false villain cried gil in a fury you may thank your luck that you are under our roof you may thank your age that i do not pierce you through with my sword

since when do my sons forget cried pedro iturrioz with angry mien the duties which are imposed by the laws of hospitality sit down gil without another

p 120

word you are accused of a crime señor he added addressing the pilgrim you have pronounced a grave accusation can you prove it

at this very moment if you wish it replied the pilgrim

commence at once then said the old man his countenance assuming the dignity of a judge who distributes impartial justice without appeal

to you gil de iturrioz a guipuzcoan knight i address myself whom did you meet in the valley of articuza about four months ago the pilgrim asked in a loud tone

gil shuddered and looked in terror towards the stranger

what was the conversation which took place between you and juan de arpide did he not offer you terms of peace

yes replied the accused in a low voice

did he not promise you his sincere friendship

certainly

and instead of accepting it did you not insult him

that also is true replied gil abashed

and to the insult did you not add the injury of striking him in the face with your gauntlet

the young man did not reply

answer gil de iturrioz continued the pilgrim

when you grasped the weapon was it not you the only

p 121

one to attack and your antagonist did no more than defend himself by parrying off the blows without in any way wounding you

gil likewise did not reply to this question the father was casting on his son looks of wrath antonio trembled with indignation and the women appeared struck dumb with astonishment

to you now old man i address myself continued the stranger your son stumbled and fell to the ground and when juan de arpide justly irritated might have killed him as he lay there he nevertheless gave him his hand to assist him to rise he then newly proposed terms of peace with him and instead of accepting the proposals he landed a blow at him which inflicted a deep wound in his neck and then he cast him headlong from the summit of a rock down a deep chasm how will you call your son in future

gil cried the old man pointing to the door with an imperious gesture quit my house i no longer acknowledge you to be a son of mine

on hearing the curse uttered by pedro iturrioz on his firstborn and deeply impressed by the revelation made by the pilgrim inez uttered a cry and fell back insensible catalina and dominica remained terrorstricken

when gil in obedience to his fathers orders was about to leave the paternal home the pilgrim detained him

p 122

look at your sister who is nearly expiring repent of what you did and perchance there may yet be a remedy for so much evil done

the stranger approached inez who was recovering from her faintthanks to the care and attention of her motherand taking her hand he said turning towards the assembled family should juan de arpide be still living would you consent to his marriage with inez

antonio ran to the stranger and quickly removed his hat the white beard fellfor it was only a false oneand the noble countenance of the lover of inez stood revealed before them all a cry of surprise and joy rose from the lips of the assembled group inez looked at her lover she passed her hands over her eyes in silence moved her lips in prayer for some time and then throwing her arms around the neck of juan de arpide poured a flood of tears of joy without saying a word

that silence was truly sublime

gil turned pale with terror because he judged that this apparition was a supernatural one acknowledging his evil conduct he at length approached juan and in a deeply moved voice said my brother plead for me before the just tribunal of my father

                         

at the beginning of the following month the marriage of inez de iturrioz with the firstborn of the house of arpide was celebrated with signal rejoicing

p 123

epilogue

two days after the marriage of inez and juan deepdrawn sighs could have been heard about midnight issuing from the valley of articuza 1 favoured by the moonlight could be seen close to the rivulet a decrepit old woman pitifully torn and wounded in body at her side were some shadows or rather phantoms that were beating and belabouring her unpityingly and this punishment was presided over by the maitagarri of the pyrenees her countenance was expressive of wrath from her eyes shot flames of fire out of her mouth issued cries in place of words it was no longer the beauty which had so charmed juan de arpide it was a beauty of another descriptionthat of the fallen angel when perchance it ceases for a moment to endure the torments of the lower regions

cursed woman she said interrogating the old woman of what use were your philters was it for this that you asked me for a sleeping childs hand woe to me who placed more faith in the power of your amulets than in my own charms

p 124

pardon cried the witch of zaldin for it was none other this poor illused old woman

pardon indeed she replied when i would wish to tear your body to pieces die lying one as you have lived and the witch of zaldin unable to endure any longer this cruel and merciless treatment fell down dead

maitagarri with her phantom retinue disappeared in the marvellous cave out of which she did not issue again for a long time when she once more appeared the stronghold of articuza had been already erected and the noise of the colossal hammers and the immense sheets of flames and sparks which like a volcano issued from the forge impelled maitagarri to forsake those parts to inhabit others more solitarythe sierras of ahuñemendi

the lifeless body of the witch turned black like coal and a gigantic eagle took it away on the winds in its powerful clutchesembed"
