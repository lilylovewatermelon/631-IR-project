this fluid feels like pain
this stoic mood is all in vain
i reach into the dark
i tear this other me apart
how many years ago
how many deaths i cant let go
my flesh is temporary
my god extraordinary

chorus
you cant kill my mind
a man delivered
can never make his way in darkness
i know tonight will end
but i wont give this life away again

verse 2
sifting through the same debris
oh my father call to me
this smoke is in my blood
this home is just no good
save me from my bitterness
give me up i did my best
shock this system full of shit
mock this fucker lost in it
you might also likechorus 1
you cant kill my mind
a man delivered
can never make his way in darkness
and i know tonight will end
but i wont give this life away
i wont give this life away again

chorus 2
a man surrendered
can never find his own forgiveness
i know my life will end
but i wont give tonight away
i wont give tonight away again

outro
this fluid feels like pain
this ruin feels like rain
i reach into the past
my futures fading fast
how many years ago
how many i let go
my flesh is all i have
my face is happenstance
this smoke is in my blood
this life is not enough
this life is not enough
this life is not enough1embed"
