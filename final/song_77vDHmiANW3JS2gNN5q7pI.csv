verse 1
i disguise and i will lie
and i will take my precious time
as the days melt away as i stand in line
and i die as i wait as i wait on my crime
and ill try to delay what you make of my life
but i dont want your way i want mine
im dyin and im tryin but believe me im fine
but im lyin im so very far from fine

prechorus
and i i can feel the pull begin
feel my conscience wearing thin
and my skin it will start
to break up and fall apart

verse 2
every time i feel selfish ambition is takin my vision
my crime is my sentence repentance is taking commission
its takin a toll on my soul im screaming submission and
i dont know if i am dying or living
cause i will save face for names sake abuse grace
take aim to obtain a new name in a newer place
but my name is lame i cant walk and i aint the samea
and my name became a new destiny to the grave

prechorus
and i i can feel the pull begin
feel my conscience wearing thin
and my skin it will start
to break up and fall apart
