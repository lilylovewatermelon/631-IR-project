verse 1
dont know how to face it
lets go back to basics
yes say what you mean do what you say but man i hate this
i just dont know what im chasing dont know what im chasing
yes somebody told me
life is something you dont wanna play with
but i just keep on playing like life is just a playground
i go through these mood swings
watch everything slide down
i look at myself and i ask what the goal is goal is
yeah tell me what your goal is
im just so lost in emotions i dont even notice
i just slip into a place and i dont think straight
devil in my ear tryna tell me everythings great
and in a year i realize im in the same place
running in the same race same pace

verse 2
dont know how to face it
lets go back to basics
think about the words you bout to say before you say it
sin is bittersweet i taste it bittersweet i taste it
get that sickness out my mouth
i feel like my train is derailin
i can feel it
yo these words are only words until they actions
words until they actions strive on empty satisfactions
yeah the fact is i dont know know fact is i dont know know
yeah i get on these stages say that i put on a show
but yeah that show it dont mean nothing
if i dont live my lyrics if they dont feel the spirit in my songs
then they dont hear it
homie yeah that dont mean nothing nothing
this aint all about appearance
everything starts with the man in the mirror
chorus
yeah i aint sleeping lately
i aint sleeping lately
yes i know that im the only person that can change me
maybe thats why i aint changing

i got too much on my mind i guess i dont know how to face it
i just dont know how to face it
i dont know how to face it yeah
