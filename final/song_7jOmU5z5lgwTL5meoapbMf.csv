if you only once would let me
only just one time
then be happy with the consequence
with whatevers going to happen tonight
dont think were not serious
whens it ever not
the love we make is give and its take
im game to play along

prechorus
all i can say i shouldnt say

chorus
can we take a ride
get out of this place while we still have time

verse 2
all the best djs are saving their slowest song for last
when the dance is through its me and you
come on would it really be so bad
the things we think might be the same
but i wont fight for more
its just not me to wear it on my sleeve
count on that for sure

i cant say i was never wrong
but some blame rests on you
work and play theyre never okay to mix the way we do

get out of this place while we still have time
and we still have time4embed"
