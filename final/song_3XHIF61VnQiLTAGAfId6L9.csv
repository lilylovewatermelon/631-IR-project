you say you dont know me
you say you dont owe me
you say that you wont be happy waiting
you think that youre worth it
you think you deserve it
you want it all right now your way

prechorus
together were one there is no finish line
together were one why dont you realize
together were one i know that everythings gonna be fine

chorus
together were one one in a million
dont be afraid
dont say it cant play out the way that we want
its gonna be brilliant
like it or leave it i cant help but feel like im one
one in a million
im worth all the crap that im putting you through
ill be blunt
the honest truth is
like it or love it or leave it

postchorus

bridge
what was that line in that one movie
when he looked at her like it would last forever
said it to her face that hed do whatever it took
to be her love but above all what he wanted most
credits rolled curtains closed
then you whispered in my ear
together were one in a million dont be afraid
together were one in a million dont be afraid
chorus
together were one one in a million
dont be afraid
dont say it cant play out the way that we want
its gonna be brilliant
like it or leave it i cant help but feel like im one
one in a million
im worth all the crap that im putting you through
ill be blunt
the honest truth is
like it or love it or leave it

outro

dont waste my time
you decide you decide
