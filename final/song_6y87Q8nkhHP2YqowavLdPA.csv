memories broken the truth goes unspoken
ive even forgotten my name
i dont know the season or what is the reason
im standing here holding my blade
a desolate place place without any trace trace
its only the cold wind i feel
its me that i spite as i stand up and fight
the only thing i know for real

chorus
there will be blood— blood —shed shed
the man in the mirror nods his head
the only one one left left
will ride upon the dragons back
because the mountains dont give back what they take
oh no there will be blood— blood —shed shed
its the only thing ive ever known

outro
losing my identity
wondering have i gone insane
to find the truth in front of me
i must climb this mountain range
looking downward from this deadly height
and never realizing why i fightyou might also like6embed"
