verse 1
ooh oohooh oohooh
born into nixon i was raised in hell
a welfare child where the teamsters dwelled
the last one born and the first one to run
my town was blind from refinery sun

prechorus
my generation is zero
i never made it as a working class hero

chorus
21st century breakdown
i once was lost but never was found
i think im losin whats left of my mind
to the 20th century deadline

verse 2
ooh oohooh oohooh
i was made of poison and blood
condemnation is what i understood
video games to the towers fall
homeland security could kill us all
see green day liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeprechorus
my generation is zero
i never made it as a working class hero

chorus
21st century breakdown
i once was lost but never was found
i think im losin whats left of my mind
to the 20th century deadline
part ii

intro
we are the class of the class of 13
born in the era of humility
we are the desperate in the decline
raised by the bastards of 1969

verse 3
my name is no one the long lost son
born on the 4th of july
raised through the era of heroes and cons
that left me for dead or alive
i am a nation a worker of pride pride
my debt to the status quo
the scars on my hands and a means to an end
its all that i have to show
interlude
hey
hey
hey

verse 4
i swallowed my pride and i choked on my faith
ive given my heart and my soul
ive broken my fingers and lied through my teeth
the pillar of damage control
ive been to the edge and ive thrown the bouquet hey
of flowers left over the grave
i sat in the waiting room wasting my time
and waiting for judgement day

bridge
i praise liberty
the freedom to obey
its the song that strangles me
well dont cross the line
part iii

outro
oh dream america dream
i cant even sleep from the lights early dawn
oh scream america scream
believe what you see from heroes and cons22embed"
