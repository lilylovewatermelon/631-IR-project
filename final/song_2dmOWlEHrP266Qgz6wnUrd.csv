im not a rapper im a singer with a flow
ive got a habit for spittin quicker lyrics you know
youll find me rippin the writtens out of the pages they sit in
i never want to get bitten cause plagiarism is hidden
watch how i sit on the rhythm prisoner with the vision
signed to a label but didnt listen to any criticism
thought you knew but you didnt so perk your ears up and listen
studio is a system and you could say that im driven
and now its onto the next saga we drink the best lager
ill never try to win you over like your stepfather
ill do my own thing now and get respect after
and im avoidin the caine like it was get carter
for four years i never had a place to stay
but its safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
at sixteen years old yeah i moved out of my home
i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked
and went from sleepin at a subway station
to sleepin with a movie star and addin to the population
not my imagination i dont wanna relax
would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax
ill take it back now

chorus
mmm come on and take it back love
come on and take it back for us
dont you fade into the back love no
see ed sheeran liveget tickets as low as 81you might also likeverse 2
i take it back with the rhythm and blues
with my rap pack ill be singing the news
tryna act like jack black when i bring it to school
ill make a beat with my feet by just hittin the loop
bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes
ill give you the truth through the vocal booth
and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit
they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot
but then again thats what theyre supposed to do
and im supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
whisperin everything that happens is from now on
ill be ready to start again by the end of the song
and still theyre claiming that i handle it wrong
but then ive never had an enemy except the nme
but ill be selling twice as many copies as their magazines will ever be
with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree
singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids
i keep this rappin a habit and keep on fashionin magic
im battlin for respect and i dont know if ill have it
this songs from the heart covered the planet
ill take it back now

chorus
mmm come on and take it back love
come on and take it back for us
dont you fade into the back love no
ill take it back now
verse 3
now i dont ever wanna be perfect
cause im a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
and i accept the fact that someones gotta win worstdressed
taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus
puttin on a brave face like timothy dalton
considerin a name change thinkin it was hopeless
rhymin over recordings avoidin tradition
cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
now absence can make your heart ache
but drinking absinthe can change your mind state
vividly need to let my liver be
and ill say it again livin life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
its good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
and i hope to see him blowin up globally
cause thats how its supposed to be im screamin out vocally
it might seem totally impossible achievin lifes dreams but
but i just write schemes
im never havin a stylist giving me tight jeans
madison square garden is where i might be but more likely
youll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
havin a pint with mcdaid discussin records we made
and every single second knowin that well never betray
the way we were raised rememberin our background sat down
thats how we plan it out its time to take it back now
chorus
mmm come on and take it back love
come on and take it back for us
dont you fade into the back love no
mmm come on and take it back love
come on and take it back for us
dont you fade into the back love no mmm58embed"
