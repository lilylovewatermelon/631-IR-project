im at war with the world and they
try to pull me into the dark
i struggle to find my faith
as im slippin from your arms
its getting harder to stay awake
and my strength is fading fast
you breathe into me at last

chorus john cooper  jen ledger
im awake im alive
now i know what i believe inside
now its my time
ill do what i want cause this is my life
here right here right now right now
stand my ground and never back down
i know what i believe inside
im awake and im alive

verse 2 john cooper  jen ledger
im at war with the world cause i
aint never gonna sell my soul
ive already made up my mind
no matter what i cant be bought or sold
when my faith is getting weak
and i feel like giving in
you breathe into me again
