i aint scared of loving you
and baby i know youre afraid of a lot of things
but dont be scared of love cause
people will say all kinds of things
but that dont mean a damn to me
cause all i see is whats in front of me
and thats you

well ive been dragged all over the place
ive taken hits time just dont erase
and baby i can see youve been fucked with too
but that dont mean your loving days are through
cause people will say all kinds of things
but that dont mean a damn to me
cause all i see is whats in front of me
and thats you

well i may be just a fool
but i know youre just as cool
and cool kids they belong togetheryou might also like1embed"
