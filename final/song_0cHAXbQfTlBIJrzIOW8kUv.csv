say youre there when i feel helpless
if thats true why dont you help me
its my fault i know im selfish
stand alone my soul is jealous
it wants love but i reject it
trade my joy for my protection

chorus
grab my hand im drowning
i feel my heart pounding
why havent you found me yet
i hold you so proudly
traumas they surround me
i wish youd just love me back

verse 2
say youre here but i dont feel it
give me peace but then you steal it
watch them laugh at all my secrets
scream and yell but i feel speechless
ask for help you call it weakness
lied and promised me my freedom

chorus
grab my hand im drowning
i feel my heart pounding
why havent you found me yet
i hold you so proudly
traumas they surround me
i wish youd just love me back
