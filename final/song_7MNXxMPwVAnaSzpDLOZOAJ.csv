we all have our problems
we all make the same mistakes as you
we all get our hands full
nothing we can blame or tie things to
maybe if i close my eyes
i can keep a picture in my mind
to save me from the daily stress
for my mind to take a rest

chorusx2
i am holding my head in my hands
i dont care if you can understand
im stepping out of myself for now

verse 2
i finally found a moment
nothing in this world can bring me down
iâ€™ll take it and ill hold it
cuz in my head i wont even hear a sound
if only for a second in time
we can just forget these hectic binds
to life to love to time to wealth
we just need some time to ourselves
