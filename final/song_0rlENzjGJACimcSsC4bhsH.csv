mr rose is rolling hay
eighty acres down and ten to go
clouds are building in the south
he knows times a running out
and there goes that tractors radiator hose

there aint no tricks in his straw hat
he walks a quarter mile back
ms rose hears him slam that old screen door
what he sees as wasted time
is a blessing in disguise
oh hes cussing what shes been praying for

the day turned dark as night
and in her eyes he saw the light
he hadnt taken the time to notice
from heaven it poured down
on that little old farm house
lord knows what to do when love needs time for growing
he sends rain for the roses

she pulled down the window blinds
even though the sun wadnt shining
the rain tapped out a love song on that old tin roof
wrapped up in the covers
they held on to eachother
like new lovers on their honeymoon
see craig morgan liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likethe day turned dark as night
and in her eyes he saw the light
he hadnt taken the time to notice
from heaven it poured down
on that little old farm house
lord knows what to do when love needs time for growing
he sends rain for the roses

lord knows what to do when love needs time for growing
he sends rain backup
the lord sends rain
for the rosesembed"
