blue hydrangea cold cash divine
cashmere cologne and white sunshine
red racing cars sunset and vine
the kids were young and pretty

where have you been where did you go
those summer nights seem long ago
and so is the girl you used to call
the queen of new york city

chorus
but if you send for me you know ill come
and if you call for me you know ill run
ill run to you ill run to you
ill run run run
ill come to you ill come to you
ill come come come

postchorus
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
ah ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah

verse 2
the power of youth is on my mind
sunsets small town im out of time
will you still love me when i shine
from words but not from beauty
see lana del rey liveget tickets as low as 163you might also likemy fathers love was always strong
my mothers glamour lives on and on
yet still inside i felt alone
for reasons unknown to me

chorus
but if you send for me you know ill come
and if you call for me you know ill run
ill run to you ill run to you
ill run run run
ill come to you ill come to you
ill come come come

postchorus
oh oh oh oh oh
ah ah ah ah ah

bridge
and if you call ill run run run
if you change your mind ill come come come

postchorus
oh oh oh oh oh
ah ah ah ah ah

outro
blue hydrangea cold cash divine
cashmere cologne and hot sunshine
red racing cars sunset and vine
and we were young and pretty127embed"
