the wine is white and the lights are dim
they warned you dont go home with him
these guilty feetll never dance again
i know but will i ever get the chance again
ive been held in contempt for an incident
but it takes two to be intimate
so by no means was she innocent
well it wasnt a crime if i didnt witness it

they said that chivalry is dead
then why is her body body in my bed
at sunrise the morning papers read
they found a body body in my bed ahhh

ceelo green
ahhhh can nonchalance be ambiance of course
i lean toward her and whisper the choice is yours
need i remind you that ill have no remorse
i understand
heres a kiss sweetheart this wont hurt a bit
i can kill it with kindness or murder it
then i would face the time a murderer would get
or get away with it life
