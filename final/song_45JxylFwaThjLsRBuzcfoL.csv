yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
whats your name marshall
whos your daddy i dont have one

verse 1
my mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
and had me on the back of a motorcycle then crashed in
the side of locomotive with rap im
loco its like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
bout to explode all over the canvas
back with the yoda of rap in a spasm
your music usually has em
but waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasnt
follow you must rick rubin my little padawan
a jedi in training colossal brain and
thoughts are entertainin
but docile and impossible to explain and im also vain and
probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting
puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk
full of such blind rage i need a seein eye dog
cant even find the page i was writing this rhyme on
oh its on the rampage
couldnt see what i wrote i write small
it says ever since i drove a 79 lincoln with whitewalls
had a fire in my heart
and a dire desire to aspire to die hard
so as long as im on the clock punching this time card
hiphop aint dying on my watch

now sometimes when im sleepin
she comes to me in my dreams
is she taken is she mine
dont got time dont care dont have two shits to give
let me take you by the hand to promised land
and threaten everyone
cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing

postchorus sample  eminem
now whats your name marshall
whos your daddy i don’t know him but i wonder—
is he rich like me ha
has he taken any time to show you what you need to live

verse 2
no if he had
he wouldnt have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
i wouldnt be so mad my attitude wouldnt be so bad
yeah dad im the epitome and the prime
example of what happens when the power of the rhyme
falls into the wrong hands and
makes you want to get up and start dancin
even if it is charles manson
who just happens to be rappin blue lights flashin
laughin all the way to the bank lampin in my kmart mansion
i’m in the style department
with a pile in my cart rippin the aisle apart but
with great power comes
absolutely no responsibility for content
completely despondent and condescending
the king of nonsense and controversy is on a
beatkilling spree your honor
i must plead guilty cause i sparked a revolution
rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
of rap to take it to the next level boost it
but several rebuked it and whoever produced it
hiphop is the devils music
does that mean it belongs to me
cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
that dont honk but every time i speak you hear a beep
but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper
rappers better stay clear of me bitch cause its the—
chorus
its the time of the season
when hate runs high
and this time i wont give it to you easy
when i take back whats mine
with pleasured hands
and torture everyone that is my plan
my job here isnt done
cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing

postchorus sample  eminem
whats your name shady
whos your daddy i don’t give a fuck but i wonder
is he rich like me doubt it ha
has he taken any time to show you what you need to live

verse 3
so yeah dad—lets walk
lets have us a fatherandson talk
but i bet we wouldnt probably get one block
without me knocking your block off this is all your fault
maybe thats why im so bananas i appealed to all those walks
of life whoever had strife
maybe thats what dad and son talks are like
cause i related to the struggles of young america
when their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
now theyre rippin out their fuckin hair again its hysterical
i chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
yeah uhoh better beware knuckle heads
the sign of my hustle says
dont knock” the doors broken it wont lock
it might just fly open get coldcocked
you critics come to pay me a visit
misery loves company please stay a minute
kryptonite to a hypocrite
zip your lip if you dish it but cant take it
too busy gettin stoned in your glass house
to kick rocks then you wonder why i lash out
mr mathers as advertised on the flyers so spread the word
cause im promoting my passion til im passed out
completely braindead rain man
doing a bankhead in a restraint chair
so bitch shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
or get shanked in the pancreas
im angrier than all eight other reindeer
put together with chief keef cause i hate every fuckin thang yeah
even this rhyme bitch
and quit tryin look for a fuckin reason for it that aint there
but i still am a criminal
tenyearold degenerate grabbin on my genitals
the last mathers lp done went diamond
this time im predicting that this one will go emerald hehe
when will the madness end
how can it when theres no method to the pad and pen
the only message that i have to send
is dad im back at it again
outro
bitch… whos your daddy143embed"
