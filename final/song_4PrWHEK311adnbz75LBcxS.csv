nothin in the cards days
walkin in the dark days
you gotta push your way through

its a cut to the bone day
a feelin all alone day
knowin everythings gone day
missin you

most days im doin alright
im movin on with my life
i put up a pretty good fight
when these feelings come around

but baby every now and then
i let the heartache win
and when your memory knocks me to the ground

its a cant let go pain
i hit a new low pain
i wish i didnt know pain
yeah im missin you

most days im doin alright
im movin on with my life
i put up a pretty good fight
when these feelings come around
you might also likebut baby every now and then
i let the heartache win
and when your memory knocks me to the ground

its a stuck in hell day
keep remindin myself day
that tomorrow wont hurt the same
yeah im missin you

its just one of those hard days
hmmm missin you

yeah im missin youembed"
