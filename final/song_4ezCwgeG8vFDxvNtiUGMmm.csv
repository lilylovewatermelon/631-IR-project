i wish i had a thirdfloor motel room
on the dark side of the moon
up there with the satellites in the sky
if you knew anything about her youd understand why
i used to believe in love
and all that forever stuff
but now im startin to think it was one big lie
if you knew anything her youd understand why

chorus
shes a seawall on the coast in stormy weather
shes that c22 goto jukebox song
i had small town dreams of us together
but now shes gone

verse 2
i dont dance with 90 proof
or smoke weed like i used to
but right now i sure could use the high
if you knew anything about her youd understand why yeah

instrumental break

chorus
yeah shes a seawall on the coast in stormy weather
shes that c22 goto jukebox song
i had smalltown dreams of us together
but now shes gone
