only for you only for you

verse 1
they said if you dont let it out youre gonna let it eat you away
id rather be a cannibal baby animals like me dont talk anyway
feel like an ambulance chaser of faith
pray i could replace her forget the way her tears taste
oh the way her tears taste

chorus
put another x on the calendar summers on its deathbed
there is simply nothing worse than knowing how it ends
and i meant everything i said that night
i will come back to life
but only for you only for you

verse 2
the world may call it a second chance
but when i came back it was more of a relapse
anticipations on the other line
and obsession called while you were out
yeah it called while you were out

chorus
put another ex on the calendar summers on its deathbed
there is simply nothing worse than knowing how it ends
and i meant everything i said that night
i will come back to life
but only for you only for you
