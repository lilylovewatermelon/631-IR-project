though i dreamed of this day long ago
now my answer is thank you but no
look ive barely begun im hardly through
i was living in ignorant bliss
til i learned i could be more than this
and you know in a way i owe it all to you

i thought losing your love was a blow i could never withstand
but look how far i have come without anyone holding my hand
i had to find my way

the day you broke my heart
you handed me the chance
to make a brand new start
you helped me find my way
theres still so much to learn
so many dreams to earn
but even if i crash and burn ten times a day
i think im here to stay
im gonna find my way

william shakespeare wrote
to thine ownself be true
and it must follow as the night the day
thou canst not then be false to any man
i believe this wise statement best applies to a woman
a blonde woman
over the past three years she taught me and showed us all that being true to yourself never goes out of style
ladies and gentlemen our valedictorian elle woods

ladies and gentlemen of the class of two

paulette

so she said we could play where are they now
here we go

viviennes training for the peace corps

callahan ran for governor but was defeated of course
and his wife hired emmett to handle their messy divorce
