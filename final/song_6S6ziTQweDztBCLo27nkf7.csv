now its me against the sun
the day goes by and darkness grows
and its over before its done

well i know itll be alright if i just get on the road
if i run i can free my worried mind
yeah i know on the day i die i will lose my heavy load
but i wouldnt want to leave you behind

all my time keeps creeping on
now ive grown into a man
but mr child still wants to run
from the cradle to the van oh

keep thinking itll be alright if i just get on the road
if i run i can free my worried mind
keep thinking of the day i die when i lose my heavy load
but i wouldnt want to leave you behind
no i wouldnt want to leave you behind hey hey

oh keep thinking itll be alright if i just get on the road
if i run i can free my worried mind
keep thinking of the day i die when i lose my heavy load
but i wouldnt want to leave you behind
