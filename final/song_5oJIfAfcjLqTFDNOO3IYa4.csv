shes got her eyes open wide
shes got the dirt and spit of the world
her mouth on the metal
lips of a scared little girl
ive got an angel in the lobby
hes waiting to put me in line
but i wont ask forgiveness
my faith has gone dry
shes got her christian prescriptures
and death has crawled in her ear
like elevator music of songs
that she shouldnt hear

chorus
and it spins around one two three
and we all lay down four five six
some do it fast and some do it better in smaller amounts
and it spins around one two three
