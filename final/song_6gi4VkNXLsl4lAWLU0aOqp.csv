living a different way
you cant expect me to be the same
separating our lives
and wondering why

prechorus
face down
i walk away
every time i think i do the right thing
you turn your back on me

chorus
trippin into a world
that never seems too far away
too much time
too many wasted days

verse 2
how can you be this way
now im alone and cold today
im walking dead mans drive
reaching out for my life

prechorus
ive been
known to fuck up everything
in this
skin theres a broken man
see godsmack liveget tickets as low as 45you might also likechorus
trippin into a world
that never seems too far away
too much time
too many wasted days

postchorus
just another vision
just another vision
in my world

interlude
in my world
in my world

chorus
trippin into a world
that never seems too far away
too much time
too many wasted days

postchorus
just another vision
just another vision
in my world
outro
in my world
in my worldembed"
