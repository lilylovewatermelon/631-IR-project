im tired of waking up in tears
cause i cant put to bed these phobias and fears
im new to this grief i cant explain
but im no stranger to the heartache and the pain

prechorus
the fire i began is burning me alive
but i know better than to leave and let it die

chorus
im a silhouette asking every now and then
is it over yet will i ever feel again
im a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
but the more i try to move on the more i feel alone
so i watch the summer stars to lead me home

verse 2
im sick of the past i cant erase
a jumble of footprints and hasty steps i cant retrace
the mountain of things that i still regret
is a vile reminder that i would rather just forget
no matter where i go

prechorus
the fire i began is burning me alive
but i know better than to leave and let it die

im a silhouette asking every now and then
is it over yet will i ever smile again
im a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
but the more i try to move on the more i feel alone
so i watch the summer stars to lead me home

bridge
cause i walk alone
no matter where i go
cause i walk alone
no matter where i go
cause i walk alone
no matter where i go

chorus
im a silhouette asking every now and then now and then
is it over yet will i ever love again love again
im a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own
but the more i try to move on the more i feel alone
so i watch the summer stars to lead me home
i watch the summer stars to lead me home6embed"
