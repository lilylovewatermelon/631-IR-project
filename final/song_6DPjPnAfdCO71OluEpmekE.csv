if you feel like running today
you know i’d understand
you don’t but you long
it’s easier to give it away
when on the other hand
you know i i’m not much better without you
i’m like your victim and all that you need is an alibi
its one thing about you
i don’t wanna make you cry

chorus
damn girl
dry your eyes
you stole my heart and then you kicked it aside
no girl you can’t see
when he’s inside you know there’s no room for me

verse 2
if you can take a chance if you can take a chance
find you that better man
your life seethes from your quick disease
you’re giving all my loving away
tell me to understand
cause you know i i’m not much better without you
ill press your lips and i taste everyone that you’ve had tonight
its one thing about you
i don’t wanna taste tonight
