youve told me bout your family
the town that you grew up in
believe me i want to know everything about you
but ive rambled on about me
by now you know im crazy
oh we could go on all night if we wanted to
but i do not want to

chorus
oh i dont want to talk anymore
i know enough about you to know all i want to do is
find out a little bit more
i dont want to waste that moon
and the heat on the hood of this ford
i dont want to talk anymore

verse 2
that homemade wine on your lips your lips
my name under your breath your breath
under one of the best river nights you ever saw
hey that says it all

chorus
i dont want to talk i dont want to talk anymore
i know enough about you to know all i want to do is
find out a little bit more
i dont want to waste that moon
and the heat on the hood of this ford
i dont want to talk anymore

chorus
i dont want to talk i dont want to talk anymore
i know enough about you to know all i want to do is
find out a little bit more
i dont want to waste that moon
and the heat on the hood of this ford
i dont want to talk anymore
