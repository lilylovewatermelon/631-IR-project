oxymoron in my gut

verse
thats how it be
too much pride wrapped in my trust
you just blamed it all on lean
but i was right about you from the jump
it aint no thing
but it wasnt a thing like us
tatted my name all on your skin
that was the spell that got me stuck
now i dont ride around in no benz they remind me of us
x6 or the cat thats what healed me and my brothers
i move out the city for you
new york why you break my heart
my big brother called me dramatic
told me a ho gon play they part
you know its plenty more where that comes
you finessed him out of my heart

cops keep tryna race ayy
end up last place ayy
out of sight out of mind
she gon prove my case i bet
