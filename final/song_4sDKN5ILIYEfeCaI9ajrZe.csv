this doubt is screaming in my face
in this familiar place
sheltered and concealed
and if this night won’t let me rest
don’t let me secondguess
what i know to be real
put away all i know for tonight
and maybe i just might
learn to let it go
take my security from me
and maybe finally
i won’t have to know everything

chorus
and i am falling into grace
to the unknown to where you are and
faith makes everybody scared
it’s the unknown the don’t know
that keeps me hangin on and on and on to you

verse 2
i got nothing left to defend
oh i cannot pretend
that everything makes sense
but does it really matter now
if i do not know how
to figure this thing out
you might also likechorus
and i am falling into grace
to the unknown to where you are and
faith makes everybody scared
it’s the unknown the don’t know
that keeps me hangin on and on and on to you

bridge
i’m against myself again
tryna fit these pieces in
walking on a cloud of dust to
get to you

chorus
and i am falling into grace
to the unknown to where you are and
faith makes everybody scared
it’s the unknown the don’t know
that keeps me hangin on
and i am falling into grace
to the unknown to where you are and
faith makes everybody scared
it’s the unknown the don’t know
that keeps me hanging on and on and on to youembed"
