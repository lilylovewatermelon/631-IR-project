theres a beautiful girl
and a handsome guy
shes sitting all alone
hes giving her the eye
they approach one another
they dont realize the danger

verse 2
what will they say
what do you think
shell crack another smile
hell buy another drink
that isnt the important part
that happens later

chorus
you shouldve listened to your mother
dont ever talk to strangers

verse 3
lust turns to boredom
boredom to lust
diminishing returns
with each and every thrust
the energys preserved
just converted into anger
you might also likeverse 4
dont take candy
dont get in someones car
dont let anybody touch you
no matter who they are
the police are at your door
turns out the killer was your neighbor
he seemed like such a normal guy
a little quiet nothing major

chorus
you shouldve listened to your mother
dont ever talk to strangers
ooh dont ever talk to strangers3embed"
