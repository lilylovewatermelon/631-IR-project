its cold outside im sensing fear
my self control has disappeared
im spinning out at each end
could you be kind and let me in

chorus
despite the writing on the walls
my futures bleak and rather small
thats all you could ever take from me
i got nothing to lose so let me be

verse 2
well i sized you up youre not that strong
youre weak inside i knew all along
this made up army you fight in your head
destroyed your worth and pronounced you dead

chorus
despite the writing on the walls
my futures bleak and rather small
thats all you could ever take from me
i got nothing to lose so let me be

postchorus
theres no more love
theres no more love
there no more love
for me and you listen to me
no more love
theres no more love
there no more love
for me and you listen to me

the cruelest joke that has played on me
is all planned out so i cant leave
now quietly i will walk away
there is no bad blood but i cant stay

there is no more love
cause there is no more love

chorus
despite the writing on the walls
my futures bleak and rather small
thats all you could ever take from me
i got nothing to lose so let me be

chorus
despite the writing on the walls
my futures bleak and rather small
thats all you could ever take from me
i got nothing to lose so let me be

postchorus
theres no more love
theres no more love
there no more love
for me and you listen to me
no more love
theres no more love
there no more love
for me and you listen to meembed"
