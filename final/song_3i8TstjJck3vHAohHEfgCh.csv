sensation washes over me
i cant describe it
pain i felt so long ago
i dont remember
tear a hole so i can see
my devastation
feelings from so long ago
i dont remember

prechorus
holding on to let them know
whats given to me given to me
to hide behind the mask this time
and try to believe

verse 2
blind your eyes to what you see
you cant embrace it
leave it well enough alone
and dont remember
cut your pride and watch it bleed
you cant deny it
pain you know you cant ignore
i dont remember

holding on to let them know
whats given to me given to me
to hide behind the mask this time
and try to believe

chorus
if i can remember
to know this will conquer me
if i can just walk alone
and try to escape into me
