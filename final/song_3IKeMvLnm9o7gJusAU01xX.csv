as im thrown into an empty room or should i say a box
i try to turn around to leave but the door is slammed and locks
so i sing here and i think about all the evil things ive done
i lost where i was going cause i forgot where i came from

chorus
i surrender put my weapons down
i cant remember what im doing in this town
its time for me to pack my bags i will always be alone
the only thing ive ever known is out there on the road

postchorus
im a drifter
im a drifter

verse 2
now every time i look straight into my fathers eyes
i see how hurt and broken down he is from all the times
he had to watch the son he raised follow in his steps
the only option that he ever had was to hope for the best

chorus
i surrender put my weapons down
i cant remember what im doing in this town
its time for me to pack my bags i will always be alone
the only thing ive ever known is out there on the road
see falling in reverse liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likebridge
my faith is weak my soul is bound
this lonely road i travel down
i scrape my feet this jagged ground
the cuts run deep into me now
mother oh why arent you here
so young i was you disappeared
i know the truth is ugly
did you truly ever love me

chorus
i surrender curse my mothers soul
i still miss her no matter where i go
its time for me to pack my bags i will always be alone
the only thing ive ever known is a broken home1embed"
