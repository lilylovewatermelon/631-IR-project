i said to you why did you do it
touch the glass ill feel ya through it
against the wall with the bracelets on
you look bizarre in the apricot

chorus
you think that youre space ghost
youre wanted coast to coast
fuck that shit now i go
my way and you go yours
verse 2
gotta be all that coco ayy
playin too much of that gta
playin too much of that dr dre
doom quake whered you get the gun from eh
really think that metal gonna make you safe
playing peekaboo with the devil these days
black cap back with a trench coat ayy
living in the valley cuttin porno tapes
living in the valley cuttin porno

chorus
you think that youre space ghost
youre wanted coast to coast
fuck that shit now i go
my way and you go yours

were you bored of gender norms
of being alone no mama home
a bad divorce or sad we cant
afford the clothes our heroes own
remember when you stole
moms old geo metro
you wore her old bathrobe
too small to see the road

bridge
we were just two texas toddlers
pokémon and bottle rockets
dunkaroos and real monsters
capri sun straw in the bottom

chorus
you think that youre space ghost
youre wanted coast to coast
fuck that shit now i go
my way and you go yours

verse 4
heard you were lookin up the cookbook names
cut into the back of your bedroom door frame
supervillain with a manifesto dang
gotta say im pretty glad they caught you man
get back to the kickball days
scared to hold hands at school disco days
007 nintendo games
burned hot pockets in the microwave
chorus
you think that youre space ghost
youre wanted coast to coast
fuck that shit now i go
my way and you go yours
