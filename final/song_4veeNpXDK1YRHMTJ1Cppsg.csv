take the time just to listen
when the voices screaming are much too loud
take a look in the distance
try and see it all
chances are that you might find
that we share a common discomfort now
i feel im walking a fine line
tell me only if its real
still im on my way on and on it goes
vacant hope to take

chorus
hey i cant live in here for another day
darkness has kept the light concealed
grim as ever
hold onto faith as i dig another grave
meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
real as ever
and it seems ive been buried alive

verse 2
i walked the fields through the fire
taking steps until i found solid ground
followed dreams reaching higher
couldnt survive the fall
much has changed since the last time
and i feel a little less certain now
you know i jumped at the first sign
tell me only if its real
memories seem to fade on and on it goes
wash my view away

hey i cant live in here for another day
darkness has kept the light concealed
grim as ever
hold onto faith as i dig another grave
meanwhile the mice endure the wheel
real as ever

bridge
and im chained like a slave
trapped in the dark
slammed all the locks
death calls my name
and it seems ive been buried alive

verse 3
take you down now
burn it all out
throw you all around
get your fucking hands off me
whats it feel like
took the wrong route
watch it fall apart
now youre knockin at the wrong gate
for you to pay the toll
a price for you alone
the only deal youll find
ill gladly take your soul
verse 4
while it seems sick
sober up quick
psycho lunatic
crushing you with hands of fate
shame to find out when its too late
but youre all the same
trapped inside inferno awaits
evil thoughts can hide
ill help release the mind
ill peel away the skin
release the dark within

outro
this is now your life
strike you from the light
this is now your life
die buried alive
this is now your life what’s it feel like
strike you from the light let me take in your soul
this is now your life what’s it feel like
die buried alive let me take in your soul
this is now your life
die buried alive37embed"
