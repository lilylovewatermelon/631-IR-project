verse 1
just before i go
yes i know that im losing control and
i want to take things slow
put my mind in cruise control
i know im always pacing
and i blame it on the pressure im facing
i wanna take things slow
put my mind in cruise control

prechorus
im standing on your front porch saying dont go
you were lookin at me wild saying just go home and

chorus
cool out cause baby i dont think im the one for you
so just cool out cause baby i dont think im the one for you
so cool out stay high stay fresh play nice
and just cool out cause baby i dont think im the one for you
so cool out

verse 2
youre always saying that you read my sign and
always wishing that i take the time but
you know thats not my speed
only believe what i can see
i live my life in blackandwhite
i know thats not what you would like
thats all i know
i put my mind in cruise control

all the things that you detest in me
they keep you coming back for more you see
we make each other get a bit crazy
but you will always be a part of me
