intro frogg dogg
woah aget yo hands in the air
and get to clappin em and like back and forth

and check out my man he goes by the name of er uh

verse 1 eminem frogg dogg
slim shady brain dead like jim brady
im a m80 you little like that kim lady
im buzzin dirty dozen naughty rotten rhymer
cursin at you players worse than marty schottenheimer
you wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo style from
you aint gon sell two copies if you press a double album
admit it fuck it while we comin out in the open
im doin acid crack smack coke and smokin dope then
my name is marshall mathers im an alcoholic hi marshall
i have a disease and they dont know what to call it
better hide your wallet cause im comin up quick to strip yo cash
bought a ticket to yo concert just to come and whip yo ass
bitch im comin out swingin so fast itll make yo eyes spin
you gettin knocked the fuck out like mike tyson pssh
the proof is in the puddin just ask deshaun holton
ill slit yo motherfuckin throat worse than ron goldman

so when you see me on yo block with two glocks
screamin fuck the world like 2pac
i just dont give a fuck
talkin that shit behind my back dirty mackin
tellin your boys that im on crack
i just dont give a fuck
so put my tape back on the rack
go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
i just dont give a fuck
but see me on the street and duck
cause you gon get stuck stole and snuffed
cause i just dont give a fuck

verse 2 eminem
im nicer than pete but im on a search to crush a milkbone
im everlastin i melt vanilla ice like silicone
im ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
im colder than snow season when its twenty below freezin
flavor with no seasoning this is the sneak preview
ill diss yo magazine and still wont get a weak review
ill make yo freak leave you smell the folgers crystals
this is lyrical combat gentlemen hold your pistols
while i form like voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
slim shady mm was the old initials byebye
extortion snortin supportin abortion
pathological liar blowin shit outta proportion
the looniest zaniest spontaneous sporadic
impulsive thinker compulsive drinker addict
half animal half man
dumpin yo dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
with more holes than an afghan
chorus eminem
so when you see me on yo block with two glocks
screamin fuck the world like 2pac
i just dont give a fuck
talkin that shit behind my back dirty mackin
tellin your boys that im on crack
i just dont give a fuck
so put my tape back on the rack
go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
i just dont give a fuck
but see me on the street and duck
cause you finna get stuck stole and snuffed
cause i just dont give a fuck

verse 3 eminem
somebody let me out this limousine hey let me out
im a caged demon
on stage screamin like rage against the machine
im convinced im a fiend
shootin up while this record is spinnin
clinically braindead i dont need a second opinion
fuck droppin a jewel im flippin a sacred treasure
ill bite yo motherfuckin style just to make it fresher
i cant take the pressure im sick of bitches
sick of naggin bosses bitchin while im washin dishes
in school i never said much too busy havin a head rush
doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
then i went to jim beam thats when my face grayed
went to gym in eighth grade  the womens swim team
dont take me for a joke im no comedian
too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
im goin up over the curb drivin on the median
finally made it home but i dont got the key to get in
chorus eminem
so when you see me on yo block with two glocks
screamin fuck the world like 2pac
i just dont give a fuck
talkin that shit behind my back dirty mackin
tellin your boys that im on crack
i just dont give a fuck
so put my tape back on the rack
go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
i just dont give a fuck
but see me on the street and duck
cause you finna get stuck stole and snuffed
cause i just dont give a fuck

outro eminem
