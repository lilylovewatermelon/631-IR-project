okay okay i see whats happening yeah

verse 2
hey what has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
when you were waddling yay high this guy
when the nights got cold who stole you fire from down below
youre lookin at him yo

to stretch your days and bring you fun
also i harnessed the breeze youre welcome
to fill your sails and shake your trees

kid honestly i could go on and on
i could explain every natural phenomenon
the tide the grass the ground
oh that was maui just messin around
i killed an eel i buried its guts
sprouted a tree now you got coconuts
whats the lesson what is the takeaway
dont mess with maui when hes on a breakaway
and the tapestry here in my skin
is a map of the victories i win
look where ive been i make everything happen
look at that mean minimaui just ticketytappin
