said sit beside me my only son
and listen closely to what i say
and if you do this itll help you some sunny day

oh take your time dont live too fast
troubles will come and they will pass
youll find a woman and youll find love
and dont forget that there is a someone up above

and be a simple kind of man
oh be something you love and understand
baby be a simple kind of man
oh wont you do this for me son if you can

get your lust from the rich mans gold
all that you need now is in your soul
and you can do this oh baby if you try
all that i want from you my son is to be satisfied

and be a simple kind of man
be something you love and understand
baby be a simple kind of man
oh wont you do this for me son if you can

oh dont you worry youll find yourself
follow your heart and nothin else
and you can do this oh baby if you try
all that i want from you my son is to be satisfied
