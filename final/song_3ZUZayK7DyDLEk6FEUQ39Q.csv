they move too fast to be words behind your teeth
with the give and go of most of your memories
but im not the one that they need pray for
if ive got it all then what does do
oh leave it alone
oh that once little boy we used to know
are you willing well

prechorus
help
oh now off to the hell your god has sold
to find that never again will you rely

chorus
on the word of your friends in the unwritten end
for when you go they wont be following
now sell all your friends for the unwritten end
cause when you go they wont be following him

verse 2
ill move the knife to show you of my cut
with the worst of truth from here i drew no blood
so youre not as real just what i thought up
youre just a page ill burn from book
that has nothing to show
of that once little boy we used to know
am i killing you

help
oh now off to the hell your god has sold
to find that never again will you rely

chorus
on the word of your friends in the unwritten end
for when you go they wont be following
now sell all your friends for the unwritten end
cause when you go they wont be following
