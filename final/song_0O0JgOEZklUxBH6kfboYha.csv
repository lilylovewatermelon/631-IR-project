what if i told you
youre like the bullet to my holster
dangerous but i wanna hold you baby
youre there when i go through the motions you
what if i told you
i could sling you over my shoulder
just like a shotgun to a soldier
i bought you all these guns and roses

refrain
and baby dont hold nothing back from me
i want all your guns and roses

she shot me right down
she shot me right away
she shot me right down
she shot me right away
she shot me right down
she shot me right away
she shot me right down

verse 2
what if i told you
when we make love its like war is going on
dont leave me wounded in this battlefield
this fight for love is for sure to prolong
what if i told you
youre my morning cup of folgers
would you sting me with the steam baby
or be my guns and roses
you might also likerefrain
dont hold nothing back from me
i want all your guns and roses

she shot me right down
she shot me right away
she shot me right down

she shot me right down
she shot me right away
she shot me right down
