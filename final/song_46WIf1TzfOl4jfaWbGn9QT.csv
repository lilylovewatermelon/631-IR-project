witness shames parade
the pain of blame repaid
its fucking hopeless
accusations and denial

verse 1
hopeless demon of another day
colorless stoned solid gray
emptiness of promises i made
so faithless the tenants long betrayed

chorus
walk the faded line
cursed crawl of time
silence
the only promise ever kept

verse 2
familiar touch
a ritual to numb the cut
salvation in vice
anguish is realizing
what could have been but never was
its emptiness that fills the cup
devotion in
the method of my fall
pointless futility continuing
endless flowing corrupted vein
see lamb of god liveget tickets as low as 14you might also likechorus
walk the faded line
cursed crawl of time
walk the faded line
cursed crawl of time
silence
the only promise ever kept

outro
its fucking hopeless
hopeless
hopeless
its fucking hopeless
