this is the beat that puts the fire in your feet
gives you the license to be a little crazy
this is the groove that gives you swagger to move
and gets you talkin real smooth to a lady to a lady
this is the hook that gets you givin the look
that gets you gettin the number in your pocket
this is the part where the bass gonna start
and even last call cant stop it

chorus
allnight anthem
aint never gonna leave your head
allnight anthem
aint nobody goin to bed
til the drinks go down and the sun comes up
the rhythms gonna hold you for ransom
its an allnight anthem

verse 2
and this is the verse where you dont know the words
and you dont give a damn cause it feels good
put a whole generation in heavy rotation
play it over and over and its still good its still good
this is the sound of a big little town
just throwin it down where the floor is
you startin to feel the momentum build
so bring it on back to the chorus
