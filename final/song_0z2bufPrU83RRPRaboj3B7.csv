whats wrong with me
is there somebody else inside my head
that doesnt want me to be happy
i know my rights i live until i die
ive got this bed
each night i go to sleep and dream
im swimmin in the deep end
youre my buoy and im sinkin
life flies by me but im thinkin

chorus
you saved my life and now im happy
cause finally i feel i got it all
started out with nothing at all
and even when i might fall down
i know my luck come back around

verse 2
they tellin me that i should love myself
sometimes i fail
but then you hit me like a whiplash
yellin in my corner
shes a wild one yes i should warn ya
life flies by me every mornin
see imagine dragons liveget tickets as low as 120you might also likechorus
you saved my life and now im happy
cause finally i feel i got it all
started out with nothing at all
and even when i might fall down
i know my luck come back around

bridge
they tell me to write a paragraph of everything i love about me
write a paragraph and send it in the mail
to a future me thats trying desperately to start a family
teach them to love themself
teach them to love themself
teach them to love themself

chorus
im happy
cause finally i feel i got it all
started out with nothing at all
and even when i might fall down
i know my luck come back around
im happy
cause finally i feel i got it all
started out with nothing at all
and even when i might fall down
i know my luck come back around
outro
happy happy happy happy
happy happy happy happy
