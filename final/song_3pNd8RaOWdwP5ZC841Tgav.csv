catch me in the back all black
i be that shadow hovering
just like the shallow end bubblin up with blood and guts
i used to be known as the shark attack
but now im hot like the cherry on my bitchs blunt wrap
cause i am the wave
yung plague the hurricane
i am the wave as i crash on the shore flooding the trail you paved
move out my way bitch im making a stain
bleach aint the way to remove all the grey
hatin cause i took the wind out your sails
now you dried up and salty cause i am the wave
i was the shipwreck but then i sank
full moon hope you dont cry wolf
high tide in the snakes nest im the mongoose
at sunset you can see the blue sky dilute
as i blow another grey cloud hanging my noose

verse 2 yung christ
fuck do you mean we not running the scene
took us only one year to be underground kings
straight outta hell with the intent to sell
yall been doing this shit since the year 2012
fuck do you mean when you say you dont see us
that grey that surrounds you created by jesus
but jesus is me im yung christ im that leader
better be careful when threadin that needle
word around town lil lick got a murder charge
whippin cop cars while im gone off them xanny bars
dont you fuckin reach for life
bitch take this knife
tape his mouth and cut the lights
