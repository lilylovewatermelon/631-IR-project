the more i want you
somehow this feeling
just grows and grows
with every sigh i become more mad about you
more lost without you
and so it goes
can you imagine
how much ill love you
the more i see you
as years go by
i know the only one for me can only be you
my arms wont free you
my heart wont tryyou might also likeembed"
