its hard to come to terms
that things cant be taught but be learned
like feeling when you question reason
the ceiling came down this season

chorus
keep this a secret
i hope we never make it past our town
forever living with a frown

verse 2
i feel like i should be concerned
that things cant be saved
once theyre burned
but for once
i threw it in the furnace
i watched it
burn right between us

chorus
keep this a secret
i hope we never make it past our town
forever living with a frown

outro
and all along
all i ever wanted was someone
to tell me that im wrong
im wrong
im wrong
youre wrong
