power 106
la its ya girl yesi ortiz
got some brandnew music
i need yall to turn it up and let me know what you think
its lloyd called oakland on power 106
verse 1 lloyd
i was making japanese and shes watching dvds
in oakland in oakland
now im driving up the 5 and she waits til i arrive
in oakland in oakland
everything that i wanted
only gotta drive for the moment
if you tell me turn around then im on it
for the moment but you know me
you know how i get when im lonely
and i think about you and the moments
but everything you do is so oakland so oakland

chorus lloyd  childish gambino
foot on the gas im just trying to pass
all the red lights and the stop signs
im ready to go
before i get to the bay babe thats a problem
because im way too scared to call
and you might get me to stay and oh
you might also likepostchorus childish gambino  lloyd
i dont really mind the drive
but i think id rather die in oakland in oakland
with my hands on two and ten
so i guess it all depends on oakland on oakland
and im nervous truth be told
i never saw me growing old in oakland in oakland
and if i married you tonight
it would probably start a riot in oakland in oakland

verse 2 childish gambino
everything that i needed
now that i got you in your feelings
everything you wont say you tweet it
and a nigga don’t like that shit at all
so treated
can we just roll with the feeling
can we just roll for a minute
wait a minute

chorus childish gambino
foot on the gas im just trying to pass
all the red lights and the stop signs
im ready to go
but im really not ready girl thats a problem
cause im way too scared to fall
and i know you choose to stay and oh
verse 3 childish gambino
all the girlfriends saying here we go again
rich kid but he act like a gentleman
last one didnt end like it shouldve been
two dates and he still wanna get it in
and theyre saying its because of the internet
try her once and its on to the next chick
xo the o face on your exes right
and we can do the same thing if you wanna have at it
when your thoughts cant breathe and you thinking asthmatic
and you wanna be a mom and i wasnt mad at it
i was thinking bout me id be really bad at it
cause im thinking bout me weeks in dubai
fourth of july house in kauai yeah we can try
so lets try

outro childish gambino  lloyd

but you still dont have the time to kiss me just hit me
and if i left you all alone would you still pick up the phone

and well both be thirty soon in oakland in oakland
the only one i know is you
so the fuck im supposed to do in oakland in oakland
in oakland in oakland
in oakland in oakland
in oakland in oakland
in oakland in oakland
in oakland in oakland
