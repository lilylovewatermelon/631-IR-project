verse 1
beautiful prisoner left here for dead
promises made and sentences read
voices and visions are locked in my head
like a safe full of sorrow
all of the words that we dare never speak
all of our ghosts and the secrets we keep
gather them all and well bury them deep
like a safe full of sorrow

chorus
free me right now
you take me away take it from me
free me right now
you take me away take it from me

verse 2
one for forever one in your name
one to remember were one and the same
one to forget but it always remains
like a safe full of sorrow
