its not that im afraid im not enough for her
its not that i cant find the words to say
but when shes with him she seems happier
and i dont want to take that away

prechorus
how many times can i see your face
how many times will you walk away
i just have to let you know

chorus
im not tryna start a fire with this flame
but im worried that your heart might feel the same
and i have to be honest with you baby
tell me if im wrong and this is crazy
but i got you this rose
and i need to know
will you let it die or let it grow
die or let it go
