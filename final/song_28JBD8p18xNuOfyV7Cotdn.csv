ive been alone in my thoughts
cant fill this void between us
i cannot stand losin you woah woah
all these feelings intertwined oh
fighting the urge to reach out
and my stance remains unchanged baby
i cant help it im so into you

chorus
oh when youre ready
we can put this behind us
baby we can find us again i know
put this behind us
we can find us again
cause i dont wanna go
i was alone i was alone in this world
and i needed people
i know my funeral gon be lit cause of how i treated people
i dont wanna go i dont wanna

verse 2
