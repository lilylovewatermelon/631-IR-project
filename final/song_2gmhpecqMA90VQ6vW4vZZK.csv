ruff ryders
ride or die

yup yup yup
i dont really trust humans that much these days
shit fact of the matter is i trust dogs more than i trust humans
shit nothin like that dog love i tell ya
not just any dog its gotta be a pit bull
yup thats the only dog for me
you dont wanna get caught in a pit with one of them
they make good companions but even worse enemies
its all on how you take it

verse
nothin goes down i dont get a small piece of
get the picture see the beauty in the beast of
the mad man mr bad man is here
cause a nigga like me smells wreck in the air
it just aint fair the shit that i be doin to niggas
and get away with the same shit ruinin niggas
cover all ground and i roll thick like the fog
only mothafuckin friend i ever had was a dog
never ate the hog but glad to say i smoked plenty of em
the 5th precinct to name one of many of em
in one verse i beat you worse than your momma
i fuck around and eat you first like dahmers
ima play that ass out like a bomber
killed a nigga once for lookin like he wanted drama
im buggin the pain it hurts i gotta scream
ahhhhh lettin off a little steam
society was just too much couldnt hack it
six mothafuckin years in a straight jacket
yo black it wasnt wise for them to let me out the joint
i never really got better so im not on point
i just might flip quick but its too late to be bitchin
got more loose screws than the table in your kitchen
im itchin just hope you aint around when i scratch
cause like i said before i eats what i catch
searchin shit will have a nigga hurt and sick
the dirt you kick will get you in the dirt and quick
word to miz you niggas is kids dont play
im too old for the jokes youll get smoked i dont play
im wont say whats gon happen if you force my hand
someone somewhere will be like lost my man
take it to heart its about to get dark so run that
all that shit niggas talkin been there done that
what black think its an act then let me know
but he liked what im sayin so shut the fuck up and let me flow
yo you think its a game keep playin
they gon find your ass somewhere in a creek layin
its over you just aint laid down yet
and in a minute you gon be that mothafucka that they aint found yet
hold off from makin movies and make moves
stop talkin about shit that you cant prove
im the mountain you cant move so why you tryin
lookin at me stupid wonderin why you dyin
while you flyin through the air with a big ass hole in your chest
wishin you was holdin a vest
but its too late for wishin so you gettin this rest
go to sleep papa will take care of the stress
god bless and may he have mercy on your soul
poppop take these two more with you on your stroll nigga
