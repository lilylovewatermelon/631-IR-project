focus on it every single day i wanna figure out a way
to get ahead of what i think i know is comin
its obvious you got a problem if you always tryna make it seem
as if youve never been afraid then why you runnin
i could never look at what i do the way that other people can
and walk away i cant be separated from it
stickin out my neck is how i made it where im at
you wanna cut it up but cant man they can never take it from me
im outlandish take chances
gotta get it while i can with my damage
my sanity could leave but if it vanished
dont matter to me id still manage
gueguеss you could say im at an advantage
my vantage point can be quitе lavish
got so many cadences no way to pick
one which bag is my hand in
depends what mood im in
oh no im in a mood again
lord knows im a hooligan
losin it who can get gruesome with
you if it comes down to it
you can bet i shoot direct defuse the threat
and they wonder why the music has a huge effect
could it be cause ive been the goto when it comes to depth
cause im the one that they be callin when the people get fed up
and want the music with the visuals i got a vendetta
for any part of me that wanna make it hard to get set up
but take away the happiness it can be kinda pathetic
but when i look at everything thats tryna give me a headache
i gotta be honest i really been the cause of it get it
cause i can see a side of me youll never see you can tell
when im at the breakin point i finally had to sit with the devil
i went into hell and i asked him what the problem is yellin
he tried to get me to live with him even called me a sinner
and told me everything about me doesnt feel like a winner
so why continue when hes tellin me i might as well give up
i took a moment thought about it feelin caught in the middle
but got offended when he told me i would live in a kennel
and i can never leave it even if i made it to heaven
hed find a way to get me back and send a demon to get me
im like woah woah hold up i dont think so
skin and bones meet my ego
hows he look he dont eat much
let him starve i dont feed him
i just beat him i just leave him in his womb in the fetal
let him cry let him yell let him scream i dont need him
lift off when im ticked off my pitfalls i latch on to like a pit dog
i sit calm with a sick thought of a sitcom of the life i live
life i lives more like a scifi flick
i hide in wanna watch dive right in
my silence doesnt mean im dyin
just means im careful with the time i spend so
see nf liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likechorus nf

verse 2 tech n9ne  nf
tech n9na next king up
everyone knowin that im a death bringer
that lingua vexing ya
leavin a regular rapper resting bruh chyeah
this is what i give it such
an incredible wicked rush a vivid gush
of poetical livid stuff to rid his gruff
said i better go rip it rough and i lit it up
the prestige i gather from people lovin the tech speed whoop
lyrically elect me jet li
the beat it got ya bobbin until your neck bleed whoop
that is tellin me lets feed
on the bitter the bogus the hitter will focus
deliver the doses and give a critter the dopest
spitter to flow sick and now the quitter corrosive
a swig of the roguishll give your liver cirrhosis chyeah
the boogie monster reppin with nf in the hoodie
want to step into the session and fully conquer
the weapon to lessen our profession go bully bonkers chyeah
left in a wreck never checkin nor could he stomp us
take his crown
thought he was gonna make us run away in a battle with his fakeish frown
shake his ground
like im the mechagodzilla im such a killer when i break it down uh
these flows are the cheat code for the weak joes
that need those elite bros with the heat so
they can eat on the d low
off a beast yo ego got it vetoed chyeah
please close your beak foes delete scrolls
taken from me thieves chose to try to decode chyeah
reload the beat so i can reach each soul
no cease no finito release go
i am the chosen and everyone is beholdin
my energy is golden cause dominion is being broken
from enemies in the open approachin im never jokin
the remedy bein spoken im hopin that youre soakin it up chyeah
im in the motion im dope and im never chokin
my devotion to floatin like an ocean the holy ghost and
im scopin the evil folk and revokin the wicked notion
im croakin im really floatin and quotin that im closin it up chyeah
talkin behind my back
end up where n9ne is at see me and say
kinda wack you could not find the knack
hit you with a rhyme attack freely and spray
ima beat you cause im greedy and slay if youre creepy and cray
ima eat you like pbj kiwi and grapes
ima demolish em when the t be in play pray
a stunna recordin in my number three jordans
dungaree sportin the tongue on me is gonna be scorchin
the punishin hunter eat like a hungary orphan chyeah
t9 and nf are elephants
in the room without a closet for skeletons
quit embellishin a demon from hell is sent
yell it went donny youre outta your element ayy
chorus nf
