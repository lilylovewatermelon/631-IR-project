well i wish i was in the land of cotton
old times they are not forgotten
look away look away look away

verse 1
oh musket and cannon have torn his gray coat
dont he look fine and handsome
dont he look at his most
for he fought in the foxholes and at this i will boast
dont they look fine and handsome
my poor johnny boys bones

chorus
well who will bring back my johnny boys bones
to lay beneath the trees of his tennessee home
a box a box made of sturdy white oak
with his arms folded up and his blue eyes all closed

verse 2
well he died for his country and he died for his kin
and he died killing men a most honorable sin
but them mean boys in blue they done turned him in
when they laid him low with a laugh and a grin

to lay neath the trees of our tennessee home
a box a box made of sturdy white oak
with his arms folded up and his blue eyes all closed

to lay neath the trees of our tennessee home

with his arms folded up and his blue eyes all closed4embed"
