what have i done
what have i done
how could i be so blind
all is lost where was i
spoiled all spoiled all
everythings gone all wrong

what have i done
what have i done
find a deep cave to hide in
in a million years theyll find me
only dust and a plaque
that reads here lies poor old jack

but i never intended all this madness never
and nobody really understood how could they
that all i ever wanted was to bring them something great
why does nothing ever turn out like it should

well what the heck i went and did my best
and by god i really tasted something swell
and for a moment why i even touched the sky
and at least i left some stories they can tell i did

and for the first time since i dont remember when
i felt just like my old bony self again
and i jack the pumpkin king
thats right i am the pumpkin king aha ha ha
you might also likeand i just cant wait until next halloween
cause ive got some new ideas
that will really make them scream
and by god im really gonna give it all my might
uh oh i hope theres still time to set things right
