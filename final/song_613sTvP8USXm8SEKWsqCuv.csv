mac miller i love you

verse 1 mac miller
all of my homies used to get on my case like when you bout to kill em
soon as im out of millions and my girl sprout some children
but ive been murderin the game im almost out of victims
this food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons
im out here livin if you wonder where i been though
shit bro would you give it all up for these nymphos
i been broke then got rich whats inside your wallet
halfman and halfamazin but thats just me bein modest
im an honest man
my mama told me never put it on the lotto and
i work for everything i get that is my motto fam
so when i die these bitches still can fuck my hologram goddamn

prechorus mac miller
and all that drama that you comin with you blowin my high
on my way up to the function gettin dome in my ride
i got em worried that my mind fried
im goin up before i skydive

time flies
watch as time go
time flies
time moves time flows
try to catch it time flies
how do we handle these things
time flies try to catch it
i am time we are time and we have control
one thing we need to remember
is that we are all in this together

verse 2 mac miller
yeah
you cant expect the unexpected these dreams i manifested
from my head into reality they seem a bit excessive but
i dont stress it two hands to count my blessings
all the times that ive been reckless with a ego big as texas
thinkin im the man
i never let these hoes inside the plan
my room for bullshit in the crib small as a childs hands
i fill the shoes and walk the path where only giants stand
i am the fire man shit im way too fly to land yeah
im smokin weed all alone
on the road even though i know they need me at home
keep my control
from a city where its freezin and cold
each to their own
punches like this prolly beat up stallone
prechorus mac miller
and all that drama that you comin with you blowin my high
on my way up to the function gettin dome in my ride yeah
i got em worried that my mind fried
im goin up before i skydive
you can see the way that

chorus mac miller  lil b
time flies
one day we will
time flies
we will find
try to catch it time flies
we will conquer conquer with love
time flies try to catch it
while time is on our side
continue to hold to those beautiful memories
they wont be here forever but our spirit lives on
