last week kyle quit the band
now were back together uh
misunderstanding didnt understand
it doesnt matter now were back together again
halalalalala
couldnt split up kato and nash
thats true
couldnt split up tango and cash
thats also true
this is our song of exultant joy because
we only came to kick some ass
rock the fuckin house and kick some ass
what we gonna do with all the cash
smoke hash and then we thrash
well throw a big ol bash yall
and everyone is invited to the bash
and everyone youre all invited to the bash
