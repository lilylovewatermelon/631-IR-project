we global now

verse 1
word on the street they got a lil bitty hit out
really run atlanta i can make a nigga get out
if anything i have more respect for you bitches
nigga you a bitch we dont shoot and miss nah
glock19 unfold and it spit out
double r underneath the door when i get out
clutchin on my fans had to tell lil bro to chill out
how the fuck your whole gang down the road and you still out
undercover rat pussy nigga you a sellout
every show i get either packed or it sell out
i been ballin hard you on the bench you gotta sit out
know a nigga mad he cant even put a hit out
middle of the winter drop top with a mink on
bad lil vibe yeah she say thats her theme song
i done made a whole million dollars off a flip phone
no soulja boy that bitch aint even have a ringtone

chorus
skinny mike amiris like i skate
we just fuck around we dont date
i went straight up there to mars so they hate
and i got a lot of cars they all up to date
i was at the bottom literally i was boxed in
then i took off i aint have no other option
i was too gone now a nigga just pop shit
i was in japan buyin drip and blowin yen

call overseas tell them youngins to spin again
i dont throw rocks and hide my hand cause im a man
million cash in the book bag im a big dog
threw my shot at any nigga bitch i think im chris paul
sippin all these meds nigga gotta be throwed off
i was gettin head fucked around and i dozed off
rolls royce truck crank it and let the nose out
everything i said i went did it boy im the chosen child

chorus
skinny mike amiris like i skate
we just fuck around we dont date
i went straight up there to mars so they hate
and i got a lot of cars they all up to date
i was at the bottom literally i was boxed in
then i took off i aint have no other option
i was too gone now a nigga just pop shit
i was in japan buyin drip and blowin yen

verse 3
safe deposit boxes on fleek
and my bank account i dont touch it ima get it out the street
got your vibe all on my drip she say you cheap
and she know im havin money buy her titties ass and teeth
catchin three flights every day the only time i get some sleep
kept it real and they be cappin really you cant compete
i spend it all on bullets niggas dont wanna beef
got a dboy swag pull up srt
i aint playin with nobody nobody gon play with me
got a driver for my car he take me from a to z
got some homies on the yard i probablyll never see
if the money was the issue i promise theyd be free
they was sleepin on me bad they fucked around woke up a beast
switch it up i went romantic took my shawty out to greece
every city that i go to gotta link up with the street
im too humble for em guess thats why they thinkin i was sweet
chorus
skinny mike amiris like i skate
we just fuck around we dont date
i went straight up there to mars so they hate
and i got a lot of cars they all up to date
i was at the bottom literally i was boxed in
then i took off i aint have no other option
i was too gone now a nigga just pop shit
i was in japan buyin drip and blowin yen4embed"
