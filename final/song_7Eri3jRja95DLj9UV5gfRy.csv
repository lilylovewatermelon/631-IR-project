contrite commercial
arrogance leprosy
consume the bitch the fucker
mindless like a child
for pitys sake ive had all that i can take
we try but in the end well see
there are no more codes
only who is shit and whos still free
i was gonna change the world with honor and aggression
no one listened no one cared
all they saw was misdirection

chorus corey taylor  chris fehn
go ahead and disagree
im giving up again
go ahead and disagree
im giving up again
go ahead and disagree
im giving up again
go ahead and disagree
im giving up again

verse 2 corey taylor  chris fehn
i dont want you anymore i dont want you anymore
i dont need you anymore i dont need you anymore
fingerprint of god
your new religions covet
this vessel wasnt built to last
but i will live forever
youll never have to say surrender
because youre so part of it
my total honesty has no place for tomorrow
guilty pleasures give me pain
tell my people i cant follow
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likechorus corey taylor  chris fehn

bridge corey taylor
youll never censor me
you better cherish me
my reason has a voice
freedoms gone but well always have a choice
my present future tense
it doesnt make much sense
im coming after you
fuck you all im the only point of view

guitar solo jim root

break corey taylor
oh violence and dollar signs
another processed piece of shit
you hide your fault in diamonds
and give away the only
cost you cant delay the inevitable
lost dont understand the incredible path
im losing ground but i wont care when i go down
