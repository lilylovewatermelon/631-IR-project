you gotta live low before you see them fall
always a loser he lost his shine
they had no idea what kept the beast alive

they said he was broken never coming back
but frankys gonna be alright

he swore to show them outlast them all
and someday they would see him standing tall
hed never give in no not back down
i hope they never give up on his sound

cause frankys gonna be alright
yeah frankys gonna be alright
they said he was old and he couldnt hold a tune
but i think hes gonna be alright

cause frankys gonna be alright
yeah frankys gonna be alright
they said theyd be placing roses on his grave
but i think hes gonna be alright
