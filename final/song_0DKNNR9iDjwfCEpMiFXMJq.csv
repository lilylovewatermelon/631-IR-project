until the day i die
ill spill my heart for you for you
until the day i die
ill spill my heart for you

verse 1
as years go by
id race the clock with you
but if you died right now
you know that id die too
id die too
you remind me of the times
when i knew who i was
but still the second hand will catch us
like it always does
well make the same mistakes
ill take the fall for you
i hope you need this now
because i know i still do

chorus
until the day i die
ill spill my heart for you
until the day i die
ill spill my heart for you

should i bite my tongue
until blood soaks my shirt
well never fall apart
tell me why this hurts so much
my hands are at your throat
and i think i hate you
but still well say remember when
just like we always do
just like we always do

chorus
until the day i die
ill spill my heart for you
until the day i die
ill spill my heart for you
yeah id spill my heart
yeah id spill my heart for you

bridge
my hands are at your throat
and i think i hate you
we made the same mistakes
mistakes like friends do
my hands are at your throat
and i think i hate you
we made the same mistakes
until the day i die
id spill my heart for you
chorus
until the day i die
ill spill my heart for you
until the day i die
ill spill my heart for you
until the day i die
until the day i die9embed"
