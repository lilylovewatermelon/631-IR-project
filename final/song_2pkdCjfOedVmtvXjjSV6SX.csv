verse
for once my eyes are open to you everything you said
for once your web of lies is in the open
i gave you everything i had til i had nothin left
still you act as if im just a burden
finally let go

let go let go

chorus
stay silent at least for now and let me move on
cause im so done playing these games with my heart
been around the world and back for you now its time to choose

verse
ive been swallowed by this wreck you call your life
ivе been damaged from the inside ivе been broken
dont threaten me with what you think i feel you could read my mind youd be in tears

im sick of your excuses you hold me ive finally come to terms with what i am
im nothing in your eyes this will not change
im livin in a dream

chorus
stay silent at least for now and let me move on
cause im so done playing these games with my heart
been around the world and back for you now its time to choose
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likebridge
i close my eyes ill dream of a better time when ill be finally past this ill be happy on my own
ive done all i can and ive still been cast aside
all i ever wanted to be was be the one who would wipe tears from your eyes
guess ill play second best to a world that will never care about you
…never understand youre just another pretty face
tell me that you care and then run straight back to him
i can hear your voice of treason from a mile away

i dont care lets move this motherfucker

breakdown
youre such a liar tell me the truth
youre such a liar tell me the truth
you fucking liar tell me the truth
do the world a favor stop cutting your arms and slit your throatembed"
