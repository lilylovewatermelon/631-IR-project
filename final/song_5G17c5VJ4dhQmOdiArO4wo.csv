harness your heart and be still now
quiet that mind that will wander
all sorts of dark alleys
tragedy strikes your self esteem
constantly waiting for an ending
to all of this

prechorus
she opens her eyes
suddenly she cries
can we help her can we help her
and she replies

chorus
you know i fake it oh so well
that god himself can’t tell
what i mean and why my words are
less than parallel with my feet
you ask me what i need
and all i really need is to breathe

oh ah

verse 2
people they seem so interested
only a few get invested
with all the aches and pains
doctor oh doctor
please help her
i fear she may not be breathing
blue lips and doe eyes
that’s her disguise

you know i fake it oh so well
that god himself can’t tell
what i mean and why my words are
less than parallel with my feet
you ask me what i need
and all i really need is to breathe

oh
oh oh
oh
oh

verse 3
give me some space to breathe
ooooh oh
i need a little room to breathe
give me some space to breathe
all i need is a little room to breathe

chorus
i fake it oh so well
that god can’t tell

you know i fake it oh so well
that god himself can’t tell
what i mean and why my words are
less than parallel with my feet
you ask me what i need
and all i really need is to breathe
let me breatheembed"
