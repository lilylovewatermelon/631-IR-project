let me keep it real
just let me be in your life like that

im gonna be your new favorite
tell em you closing the door
i am the only for sure

hold up there shouldnt be no hold up
theres more love if you follow emotions
show up now if youre down to roll up
meet me on the west side for me
hold up there shouldnt be no hold up
theres more love if you follow emotions
show up now if youre down to roll up
meet me
