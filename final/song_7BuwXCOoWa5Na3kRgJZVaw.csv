children on the street
the cowardly and scared
and powerfully prepared
for things i dare not speak of in all of my lifetime
for i am ready

verse 2
mother nature calls
and beckons them to come
the innocent and done
to witness persecution for my privilege
for i am ready
to turn the many into some
before you run out of rhyming words for scum

chorus
whyd you act sick and pretend
pretend that youve never known it
arent you just sick of spending
all your time getting noticed
you showed me the message you sent
and act like you never wrote it
well arent you just sick of your friends
your friends with ulterior motives
cause i am everyone else
i am everyone else
i am everyone else
i am everyone else i

i love and care for you
as ugly as you are
youre precious youre a star
your energy is admirable at the most
for i am ready
to reconsider what you have
before you run out of rhyming words for chav

chorus
whyd you act sick and pretend
pretend that youve never known it

well arent you just sick of your friends
your friends with ulterior motives
cause i am everyone else
i am everyone else
i am everyone else
