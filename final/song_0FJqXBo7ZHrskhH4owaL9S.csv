break me down and beat me blue
there aint a beauty on the planet comin close to you
in the harsh heat of summer or a cool crisp fall
id rather be ruined by you than be loved at all

chorus
well my chesttalking jaywalking levi jean queen
ive been everywhere i swear and youre the finest ive seen

verse 2
break me down and beat me blue
there aint a kindness on the planet that compares to you
in the dark of the night or the light of day
ill long for you tomorrow as i did today

chorus
well my daydreaming peoplepleasing brightondarkdays girl
ive fell hard and ive loved wide and youre the rarest in the world

bridge
well ive been known to chase extremes
but in my dreams it seems im only chasin you
break me beat me tear me down and drag my ass all over town
ill whisper you these sonnets til im blue
oh ill whisper you these sonnets til im blue

break me down and beat me blue
there aint a heaven on the planet that saves me like you
the hallelujahs oh til you go on for miles
a grownass man grinnin like a child
high on the mountain or the valley low
only thing that heals my blues no matter where i goembed"
