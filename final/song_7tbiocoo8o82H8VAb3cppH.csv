they keep playing sad songs on the radio
and i feel like im so alone on this fifteenhour drive
and all the while i tell myself to just believe
cause nobody can give so much and never get anything never get anything

prechorus
everyone i used to know says they dont know what ive become
but im still the same not much has changed i still know where i came from

chorus
i fell asleep with the lights on
and i can see that youre the first one in a long time
that had some faith in me
have faith in me
tell my friends we wont be long
the florida sun begs me to come back home
and it feels like im ready for anything
if you can wait for me

verse 2
and all the while i say too much of what i think
and i cant remember what its like to find meaning in anything
for the life of me

prechorus
everyone i used to know says they dont know what ive become
but im still the same not much has changed i still know where i came from
and all i ever wanted was so far from what i need
ill write my songs theyll sing along and hope time heals everything

i fell asleep with the lights on
and i can see that youre the first one in a long time
that had some faith in me
have faith in me
tell my friends we wont be long
the florida sun begs me to come back home
and it feels like im ready for anything
if you can wait for me

breakdown
this is all i have
this is all i have its my life
this is all i have
this is all i have

interlude
i fell asleep with the lights on
and i can see that youre the first one in a long time
that had some faith in me
have faith in me
tell my friends we wont be long
the florida sun begs me to come back home
and it feels like im ready for anything
if you can wait for me
chorus
i fell asleep with the lights on
and i can see that youre the first one in a long time
that had some faith in me
have faith in me
tell my friends we wont be long
the florida sun begs me to come back home
and it feels like im ready for anything
if you can wait for me8embed"
