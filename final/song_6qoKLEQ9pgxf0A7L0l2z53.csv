when a freight train jumps off a track
and rolls down my road
and its summer time in texas
and theyre playing in the snow
when politicians everywhere stop telling lies
and only state the facts
right then thats when
ill take you back

verse 2
lets say i get bucked off a bull and fall and hit my head
and then i get amnesia and forget the things you said
i lose my better judgment and i take up smoking crack
right then thats when
ill take you back

chorus
go on keep trying
come on keep calling
you know i like it
when you come crawling
its like music
to hear you bawling
waa waa waa waa waa

when donald trump takes a part time job parking cars
when clint eastwood does ballet in a big pink leotard
and a donkey wins the derby as he takes his victory lap
right then thats when
ill take you back

chorus

verse 4
the day that old morning sun rises in the west
and they pass a law in la banning artificial breasts
when cars can run on water gasoline and oil aint worth jack
right then thats when
ill take you back

chorus

outro
its like music
to hear you bawling
waa waa waa waa waaembed"
