i believe i can see the future
cause i repeat the same routine
i think i used to have a purpose
then again that might have been a dream
i think i used to have a voice
now i never make a sound
i just do what ive been told
i really dont want them to come around oh no

chorus
every day is exactly the same
every day is exactly the same
there is no love here and there is no pain
every day is exactly the same

verse 2
i can feel their eyes are watching
in case i lose myself again
sometimes i think im happy here sometimes
sometimes yet i still pretend
i cant remember how this got started
oh but i can tell you exactly how it will end

chorus
every day is exactly the same
every day is exactly the same
there is no love here and there is no pain
every day is exactly the same

im writing on a little piece of paper
im hoping someday you might find
well ill hide it behind something
they wont look behind
i am still inside here oh
a little bit comes bleeding through
i wish this couldve been any other way oh
but i just dont know i dont know what else i can do

chorus
every day is exactly the same
every day is exactly the same
there is no love here and there is no pain every day
every day is exactly the same exactly the same every day
every day is exactly the same every day
every day is exactly the same there is no pain
there is no love here and there is no pain every day
every day is exactly the same every day is the same18embed"
