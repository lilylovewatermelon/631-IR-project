verse 3 kent jones  joe jonas
i wanna pebble i wanna marble i wanna stone i wanna rock rock right now
i rock bass so she came to get down she said in honesty he wasnt fly when i met him
she said youre separate kent youre fly on another level i call her melody cause i got her hittin falsetto
she said no strings attached so geppetto had a couple side puppets just to make her feel special my minds blown
i like girls that niggas look at on the comment
on my mama keke palmer im just bein honest
she gon play hardtoget now that she know i want it
but im sure to break her off before i break a promise
leavin memphis on my way to nash

i hate smartmouth girls that fuck the vibe up
she jumped out the window and hit the stacey dash ow
