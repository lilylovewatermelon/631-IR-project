ive got a symbol in my driveway
ive got a hundred million dollar friends
ive got you a brand new weapon
lets see how destructive we can be

verse 2
ive got a brand new set of stencils
ive been connectin all the dots
got my plans in a ziplock bag
lets see how unproductive we can be

verse 3
ive got a lightbulb full of anger
and i can switch it on and off
situations it can be so bright
i cant believe how pathetic we can be
verse 4
ive got a perfect set of blueprints
im gonna build somebody else
might cost a little more than money
but whats man without his wealth

verse 5
ive got a phosphorescent secret
but dont you tell nobody else
next thing you know the whole world will be talkin
about all the clues they got they just aint no use theyve got us fooled
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likeoutro
just got a mosquito on the nose1embed"
