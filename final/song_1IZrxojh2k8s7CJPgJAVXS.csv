a long wooden fence to a tall hickory tree
a wraparound porch with an old cedar swing
we dont get to choose but if i had my way
my road to the sky would look just like

verse 1
a walk up the driveway to grandma
sayin yall come and get it
me and granddaddy just gettin back from some fishin
dust flyin up every step that were steppin
so whenever i picture heaven

chorus
i see a long wooden fence to a tall hickory tree
a dog on the porch slowly fallin asleep
we dont get to choose but if i had my way
my road to the sky would look just like
a walk up the driveway

verse 2
a walk up the driveway to my baby
chasin after our youngins
me and my brothers talkin about baseball and huntin
the rustlin of cash crops with a sunsettin backdrop
them gold streets are nice yeah but my paradise is
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likechorus
that long wooden fence to a tall hickory tree
the leaves blowin round on a cool autumn breeze
we dont get to choose but if i had my way
my road to the sky would look just like
a walk up the drivewayembed"
