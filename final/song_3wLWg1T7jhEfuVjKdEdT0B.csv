i heard somebody speak her name
they said she still was looking fine
and i could feel that same old flame
i once felt when she was mine

always thought that i was missing something
but i found out much too late
therell never be another wholl love me that way

chorus
id like to have that one back
ive never known someone so true
and a love that pure and sweet is one a man should never lose

and if my lips had said im sorry
she might have stopped right in her tracks
but now i find my poor heart saying id like to have that one back

verse 2
i can almost see her standing there
tears rolling down her face
as she packed away her memories
in that old worn out suitcase

if id only known then what i know now
id never open that door
they just dont make hearts like hers anymore
see george strait liveget tickets as low as 104you might also likechorus
id like to have that one back
ive never known someone so true
and a love that pure and sweet is one a man should never lose

and if my lips had said im sorry
she might have stopped right in her tracks
i wouldnt hear my poor heart saying id like to have that one back

outro
i wouldnt hear my poor heart saying
id like to have that one backembed"
