youre a bad bitch and you know it
thats why you dont care
you make it all too easy
its so unfair
i would lick your whole plate clean girl i swear
im dedicated to trying to make your team this year

chorus
right about now
you should be wrapped up in clouds pretty lady
right about now
you should be feeling my love in your heart
your heart
cause my daddy always told me basic math would come in handy sometimes
and now i finally understand why
two nickels aint the same as one dime

verse 2
im holding back what i want to say
and its driving me crazy
maybe i just dont know where to start
its not the no im scared of girl
yeah its the maybe
that you might fuck around end up breaking my heart
