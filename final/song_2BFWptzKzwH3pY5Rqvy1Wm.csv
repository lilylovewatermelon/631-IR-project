just the way you are just a dream chloe becca
oh her eyes her eyes
make the stars look like theyre not shining
her hair her hair falls perfectly without her trying
shes so beautiful and i tell her every day
i was thinking bout her thinking bout me
i know i know
thinking bout us what we gon be
when i compliment her she wont believe me
open my eyes yeah it was only just a dream
its so its so sad to think that she dont see what i see
but every time she asks me do i look okay
it was only just a dream
i say

just the way you are just a dream chloe aubrey  becca
when i see your face
so i traveled back down that road
will she come back no one knows
theres not a thing that i would change
i realize yeah it was only just a dream
because youre amazing just the way you are
it was only just a dream
when i see your face
so i traveled back down that road
will she come back no one knows
theres not a thing that i would change
i realize yeah it was only just a dream
because youre amazing just the way you are
it was only just a dream
