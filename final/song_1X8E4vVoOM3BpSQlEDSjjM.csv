if young metro dont trust you— trust you

verse 1
i cant take one percocet start tonight off i just took a 60
burberry on me shoot you in your back you just got pretty ricky
i tie the chanel runners then i get back to running the city
and i know that its hell coming i aint worried my niggas they with me
gotta put the narcotics down i can feel em fucking up my kidney
and punching my liver
if i let it kill me my mamall never forgive me
aint numbing my feelings if i let it kill em my baby will never forgive me
this remind me of hell sometimes i wonder if thats where god really sent me

chorus
hands up in the fire burn burn burn burn
hands up in the fire burn burn burn burn
i pray to god for some water to wash down these percs
i been cursed since birth guess i never learn
hands up in the fire burn burn burn burn
hands up in the fire burn burn burn burn
i pray to god for some water to wash down these percs
i been cursed since birth guess i never learn

verse 2
the truth hurts let it bleed out if they hurt you let em leave
my heart hurtin let me bleed out only way ill find peace
im tryna get set free but these chains on me
choke me i cant breathe whats reality
uh detached from myself
uhhuh numb the pain with my wealth
uh a bag from chanel match the double c on my belt uh
bands in my pants i barely be holdin my pants up
but the money aint the answer
im just tryna reach some new highs
mix this with that bet it feel nice
codeine only sip if i got ice
look my girl in her eyes tell her i wont die
i fell asleep too deep that one time
woke up to your cry girl im fine
but i lied
had a dream i wasnt gon wake up this time
