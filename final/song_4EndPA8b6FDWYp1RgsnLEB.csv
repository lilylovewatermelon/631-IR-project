verse 1 kanye west
on the bathroom wall i wrote
id rather argue with you than to be with someone else
i took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it
and i went and found somebody else
fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
yo id rather be by my fuckin self
til about 2 am and i call back
and i hang up and i start to blame myself
somebody help

verse 2 kanye west
you werent perfect but you made life worth it
stick around some real feelings might surface
been a long time since i spoke to you in a bathroom
grippin you up fuckin and chokin you
what the hell was i supposed to do
i know you aint gettin this type of dick from that local dude
and if you are i hope you have a good time
cause i definitely be havin mine
and you aint finna see a mogul get emotional
every time i hear about other niggas is strokin you
lie and say i hit you he sittin there consoling you
runnin my name through the mud whos provoking you
you should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
now you noticeable and cant nobody get control of you
1 am and cant nobody get a hold of you
im callin your brothers phone like what was i supposed to do
even though i knew he never told the truth
he was just gon say whatever that you told him to
at a certain point i had to stop asking questions
yall got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
i heard he bought some coke with my money that aint right girl
you gettin blackmailed for that white girl
you always said yeezy i aint your right girl
youll probably find one of them i like arttype girls
all of the lights she was caught in the hype girl
and i was satisfied bein in love with a lie
now who to blame you to blame
me to blame for the pain
and it poured every time when it rained
chorus john legend
lets play the blame game i love you more
lets play the blame game for sure
interlude kanye west
things used to be now they not
anything but us is who we are
disguising ourselves as secret lovers
weve become public enemies
we walk away like strangers in the street
gone for eternity
we erased one another
so far from where we came
with so much of everything
how do we leave with nothing
lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of love
hatred and attitude tear us entirely
chloe mitchell

chorus kanye west
lets play the blame game i love you more
lets play the blame game for sure
lets call out names names i hate you more
lets call out names names for sure

bridge kanye west
i cant love you this much i cant love you this much
i cant love you this much i cant love you this much
i cant love you this much no i cant love you this much
i cant love you this much i cant love you this much
outro kanye west
and i know that you are somewhere doing your thing
and when the phone called it just ring and ring
you aint pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
and i heard the whole thing
i heard the whole thing whole thing whole thing whole thing
