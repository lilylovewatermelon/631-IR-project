chorus
two shots of whatever two shots of whatever
its like tugofwar tryna pull myself together
i could probably do better but probablys like never
im a pimp under pressure leave my money on the dresser

verse 1
goons in this bitch leave a nigga on a stretcher
its all there papa you aint even got to measure
laughing at how all my old bitches look jealous
well what goes around comes around propellers
money over bitches mob goodfellas
cut our ears off aint shit you could tell us
write your name on the bullet thats a fuckin love letter
if i aint a trendin topic im a fuckin trendsetter

chorus
im on two shots of whatever two shots of whatever
man its like tugofwar tryna pull myself together
i could probably do better but probablys like never
im a pimp under pressure leave my money on the dresser

verse 2
if youre scared go to church mason betha
sometimes the paper chase could be like chasin a leopard
the pussy wetter wetter than its ever been
but she gon probably try to cross the line like a mexican
i aint on that bullshit shorty fine as fuck though
now she kiss me on my neck i hope she aint cutthroat
cut down on the syrup cause it made me fuck slow
shoot so many times imma choke off the gunsmoke
life death love hate pleasure pain
pay me no mind but i dont have change
i cock back and aim at your membrane
broad day no mask close range
bopbop
see lil wayne liveget tickets as low as 80you might also likechorus
you can get two shots from wherever two shots from whoever
it be like a puzzle tryna put you back together
i should probably do better but probably whatever

verse 3
your bullshit is stinkin up the place
me no tek bad up me a done de place
cant let these bitch niggas slide and touch base
i make her cum so many times call her nutcase
its young money baby take your clothes off
give me them three holes bowlin ball
two shots of whatever
keep them bitches cummin and she gon do whatever

chorus
two shots of whatever two shots of whatever
its like tugofwar tryna pull myself together
i could probably do better but probablys like never
im a pimp under pressure leave my money on the dresser
