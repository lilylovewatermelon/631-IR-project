you say your hearts been broken
and you just cant win
you say that youll never love again
let me tell you friend
you cant give up on love
thats the one thing weve got to keep going
cause it dont come easy and its so hard to hold
but you cant give up on lovelooked out my window and what did i see
its another broken family
the kids are stayin with mama at home
daddys livin in a house all alone

chorus
you cant give up on love
thats the one thing weve got to keep going
cause it dont come easy and its so hard to hold
but you cant give up on love

bridge
troubled times make it hard to stay
so many lovers take the easy way
but dont go crazy and jump ship too soon
cause every day cant be a honeymoon

chorus
you cant give up on love
thats the one thing weve got to keep going
cause it dont come easy and its so hard to hold
but you cant give up on love
