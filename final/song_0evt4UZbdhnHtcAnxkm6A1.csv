illa illa illa
yeahyeah yeahyeah
yo yo how do i keep
man i dont know what’s up with these hoes man
gettin in relationships like this im just sayin’
maybe it says somethin about me yeah yup
should i look in the mirror

chorus
i just want you to be normal
why cant you bitches be normal
always gotta be so extra
why you always need a lecture
my ex hates to talk shes a texter
even when im in bed layin right next to her
wants to get back together
said not til she gets her act together

verse 1
she thinks im bein’ mean and now
she starts to scream and shout
she’s about to let the demons out
she dont wanna see me with other females out
i tell the bitch to beat it take the scenic route
she retaliates by tryin’ to leave the house
in an evening gown with her cleavage out
weve been down this road too many times for me to count
and all i can think is how—

i just want you to be normal
why cant you bitches be normal
always gotta be so extra
like a fuckin terrestrial
guess it comes with the territory
my ex girl she just declared war
therefore i better prepare for it
i guess bein’ weirds normal

verse 2
and i dont know whats got a hold of me
most notably ive been zonin to jodeci
im totally open hopelessly devoted
so much so that i bet you she dont even know that shes
the first thing i think of when i wake up
and the last thing i think of fore i go to sleep
sike hope she dont notice me goin through her purse
i know she cheats so do i im soulless shes heartless
no wonder were partners
both got hundreds of charges
domestic disputes but weve always
swept it under the carpet
even when 911 gets the call that
i slipped up and busted her jaw with
a louisville slugger cause alls it
really does is make our love
for each other grow stronger
she won me over the second she tried to run me over
told her id keep it a hun we over
kicked her out called her back now shes coming over
but why is she so wicked
and how the fuck did i get so twisted
up with someone so unlikable and shifty
were like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
ignitable liquids but im finally seeing
shes only mine for the time being
thats why i keep bringin up that one time she
tried to twotime me
and throw it up in her face til i dry heave
how could i be so naive
should i leave or turn this entire evening
to a motherfucking crime scene
maybe im just too ugly to compete with him
you werent sposed to agree you fucking bitch
specially when youre the one cheated first
now the argument immediately becomes heated
you dont want me to flip little conceited cunt
eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
slut treat it just like a drum beat it
complete it and once youve succeeded repeat it
i love you but i hope you fuckin die though
in our business your friends like to pry so
youve got em all under cover just like moles
hopin theyll come back with intel
but im the one whos thrown into the spiral
cause now the roles are reversed so here i go
thinkin im sly as i scroll through your iphone
who the fucks milo
the guy at work who drives a hilo
i put a tracking device on your chrysler
and follow you while you drive home
but like a cyclone i just got my disguise blown
you recognized me and had milo flip me off
right out the passenger side window beepbeep
i hit a light pole you skirt off
and then pull up at 5 am in the drive in a stretched white limo
stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with milos demo ow ah
but like a drunk bum what do i know
lets sleep on it like they did revival
i told you youre the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole
outro
just wanna be normal
why cant you be normal yeah
i just wanna be normal
why cant you be normal135embed"
