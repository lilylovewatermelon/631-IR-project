hey up in the backwoods down in the holler
old boys feelin like a dog on a collar
keepin that chain pulled tight
waitin on saturday night
put on the smellgood put on skynyrd
head into to town like a nascar winner
cruisin back an forth to the tastyfreeze
everywhere you look all you see is

chorus
hillbilly deluxe slick pickup trucks
big timin in a small town
stirrin it up right about sundown
black denim and chrome
to the bone with a little homegrown
a country girl cuddled up
hillbilly deluxe

verse 2
yeah couple cute sweet things drivin a fastback
shoot em a cool smile hopin that they smile back
hey baby whats your name
burn a little rubber when the red lights change
here come the blue lights here come barney
hide all the beer yall lets move the party
gotta go but thats all right
do it all again next friday night
