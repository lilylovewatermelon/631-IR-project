verse 1 kendrick lamar
i place blame on you still place shame on you still
feel like you aint shit feel like you dont feel
confidence in yourself breakin on marble floors
watchin anonymous strangers tellin me that im yours
but you aint shit im convinced your tolerance nothin special
what can i blame you for nigga i can name several
situations ill start with your little sister bakin
a baby inside just a teenager where your patience
where was your antennas
where was the influence you speak of
you preached in front of onehunnidthousand but never reached her
i fuckin tell you fuckin failure—you aint no leader
i never liked you forever despise you—i dont need ya
the world dont need ya dont let them deceive ya
numbers lie too fuck your pride too thats for dedication
thought money would change you made you more complacent
fuckin hate you i hope you embrace it i swear—

verse 2 kendrick lamar
and you the reason why mom and them leavin
no you aint shit you say you love em i know you dont mean it
i know you irresponsible selfish in denial cant help it
your trials and tribulations a burden everyone felt it
everyone heard it multiple shots corners cryin out
you was deserted where was your antennas again
where was your presence where was your support that you pretend
you ain’t no brother you ain’t no disciple you ain’t no friend
a friend never leave compton for profit or leave his best friend little brother
you promised you’d watch him before they shot him
where was your antennas on the road bottles and bitches
you facetimed him one time thats unforgiven
you even facetimed instead of a hospital visit
guess you thought hed recover well
third surgery they couldnt stop the bleeding for real
then he died god himself will say you fuckin failed you aint try

verse 3 kendrick lamar
i know your secrets nigga mood swings is frequent nigga
i know depression is restin on your heart for two reasons nigga
i know you and a couple block boys aint been speakin nigga
yall damn near beefin i see it and youre the reason nigga
and if this bottle could talk gulping
i cry myself to sleep bitch everything is your fault
faults breakin to pieces earthquakes on every weekend
because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
i know your secrets dont let me tell em to the world
about that shit you thinkin and that time you gulping im bout to hurl
im fucked up but i aint as fucked up as you
you just cant get right i think your heart made of bullet proof
shouldve killed yo ass long time ago
you shouldve felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
and if these mirrors could talk itd say you gotta go
and if i told your secrets the worldll know money cant stop a suicidal weakness449embed"
