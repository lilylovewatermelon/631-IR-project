0D0hntFnPGhcqlexHeudeV,Opening Up - Finale,Waitress Original Broadway Company,1E1tdqqLmyi03P0TJhGuw8,"1 contributorepilogue lyricsduring nineteen fiftynine when the public was becoming aware of the muslims after the new york telecast the hate that hate produced i was in san francisco about to retire after twenty years in the us coast guard a friend returned from a visit to her detroit home and told me of a startling black mans religion the nation of islam to which to her surprise her entire family was converted i listened with incredulity to how a mad scientist mr yacub had genetically grafted the white race from an original black people the organizations leader was described as the honorable elijah muhammad and a minister malcolm x was apparently chief of staff

when i entered a civilian writing career in new york city i collected around harlem a good deal of provocative material and then proposed an article about the cult to the readers digest visiting the muslim restaurant in harlem i asked how i could meet minister malcolm x who was pointed out talking in a telephone booth right behind me soon he came out a gangling tall reddishbrownskinned fellow at that time thirtyfive years old when my purpose was made known he bristled his eyes skewering me from behind the hornrimmed glasses youre another one of the white mans tools sent to spy he accused me sharply i said i had a legitimate writing assignment and showed him my letter from the magazine stating that an objective article was wanted one that would balance what the muslims said of themselves and what their attackers said about them malcolm x snorted that no white mans promise was worth the paper it was on he would need time to decide if he would cooperate or not meanwhile he suggested that i could attend some of the harlem temple number 7 meetings temples have since been renamed mosques which were open to nonmuslim negroes

around the muslims restaurant i met some of the converts all of them neatly dressed and almost embarrassingly polite their manners and miens reflected the spartan personal discipline the organization demanded and none of them would utter anything but nation of islam clich√©s even excellent weather was viewed as a blessing from allah with corollary credit due to the honorable elijah muhammad

finally minister malcolm x told me that he would not take personal responsibility he said that i should talk about an article with mr muhammad personally i expressed willingness an appointment was made and i flew to chicago the slightly built shyacting softvoiced mr muhammad invited me to dinner with his immediate family in his mansion i was aware that i was being carefully sized up while he talked primarily of fbi and internal revenue service close surveillance of his organization and of a rumored forthcoming congressional probe but i have no fear of any of them i have all that i need  the truth mr muhammad said the subject of my writing an article somehow never got raised but malcolm x proved far more cooperative when i returned

he would sit with me at a whitetopped table in the muslim restaurant and answer guardedly any questions i asked between constant interruptions by calls from the new york press in the telephone booth when i asked if i could see muslim activities in some other cities he arranged with other ministers for me to attend meetings at temples in detroit washington and philadelphia

my article entitled mr muhammad speaks appeared in early 1960 and it was the first featured magazine notice of the phenomenon a letter quickly came from mr muhammad appreciating that the article kept my promise to be objective and malcolm x telephoned similar compliments about this time dr c eric lincolns book the black muslims in america was published and the black muslims became a subject of growing interest during 1961 and 1962 the saturday evening post teamed me with a white writer al balk to do an article next i did a personal interview of malcolm x for playboy magazine which had promised to print verbatim whatever response he made to my questions during that interview of several days duration malcolm x repeatedly exclaimed after particularly blistering antichristian or antiwhite statements you know that devils not going to print that he was very much taken aback when playboy kept its word

malcolm x began to warm up to me somewhat he was most aware of the national periodicals power and he had come to regard me if still suspiciously as one avenue of access occasionally now he began to telephone me advising me of some radio television or personal speaking appearance he was about to make or he would invite me to attend some black muslim bazaar or other public affair

i was in this stage of relationship with the malcolm x who often described himself on the air as the angriest black man in america when in early 1963 my agent brought me together with a publisher whom the playboy interview had given the idea of the autobiography of malcolm x i was asked if i felt i could get the now nationally known firebrand to consent to telling the intimate details of his entire life i said i didnt know but i would ask him the editor asked me if i could sketch the likely highlights of such a book and as i commenced talking i realized how little i knew about the man personally despite all my interviews i said that the question had made me aware of how careful malcolm x had always been to play himself down and to play up his leader elijah muhammad

all that i knew really i said was that i had heard malcolm x refer in passing to his life of crime and prison before he became a black muslim that several times he had told me you wouldnt believe my past and that i had heard others say that at one time he had peddled dope and women and committed armed robberies

i knew that malcolm x had an almost fanatical obsession about time i have less patience with someone who doesnt wear a watch than with anyone else for this type is not timeconscious he had once told me in all our deeds the proper value and respect for time determines success or failure i knew how the black muslim membership was said to increase wherever malcolm x lectured and i knew his pride that negro prisoners in most prisons were discovering the muslim religion as he had when he was a convict i knew he professed to eat only what a black muslim preferably his wife betty had cooked and he drank innumerable cups of coffee which he lightened with cream commenting wryly coffee is the only thing i like integrated over our luncheon table i told the editor and my agent how malcolm x could unsettle nonmuslims  as for instance once when he offered to drive me to a subway i began to light a cigarette and he drily observed that would make you the first person ever to smoke in this automobile

malcolm x gave me a startled look when i asked him if he would tell his life story for publication it was one of the few times i have ever seen him uncertain i will have to give a book a lot of thought he finally said two days later he telephoned me to meet him again at the black muslim restaurant he said ill agree i think my life story may help people to appreciate better how mr muhammad salvages black people but i dont want my motives for this misinterpreted by anybody  the nation of islam must get every penny that might come to me of course mr muhammads agreement would be necessary and i would have to ask mr muhammad myself

so i flew again to see mr muhammad but this time to phoenix arizona where the nation of islam had bought him the house in the hot dry climate that relieved his severe bronchial condition he and i talked alone this time he told me how his organization had come far with largely uneducated muslims and that truly giant strides for the black man could be made if his organization were aided by some of the talents which were available in the black race he said and one of our worst needs is writers  but he did not press me to answer he suddenly began coughing and rapidly grew worse and worse until i rose from my seat and went to him alarmed but he waved me away gasping that he would be all right between gasps he told me he felt that allah approves the book he said malcolm is one of my most outstanding ministers after arranging for his chauffeur to return me to the phoenix airport mr muhammad quickly bade me goodbye and rushed from the room coughing

back east malcolm x carefully read and then signed the publication contract and he withdrew from his wallet a piece of paper filled with his sprawling longhand this is this books dedication he said i read this book i dedicate to the honorable elijah muhammad who found me here in america in the muck and mire of the filthiest civilization and society on this earth and pulled me out cleaned me up and stood me on my feet and made me the man that i am today
the contract provided that all monies accruing to malcolm x shall be made payable by the agent to muhammads mosque no 2 but malcolm x felt this was insufficient he dictated to me a letter to type for his signature which i did any and all monies representing my contracted share of the financial returns should be made payable by the literary agent to muhammads mosque no 2 these payments should be mailed to the following address mr raymond sharrieff 4847 woodlawn avenue chicago 15 illinois

another letter was dictated this one an agreement between him and me nothing can be in this books manuscript that i didnt say and nothing can be left out that i want in it

in turn i asked malcolm x to sign for me a personal pledge that however busy he was he would give me a priority quota of his time for the planned 100000word as told to book which would detail his entire life and months later in a time of strain between us i asked for  and he gave  his permission that at the end of the book i could write comments of my own about him which would not be subject to his review

malcolm x promptly did begin to pay me two and threehour visits parking his blue oldsmobile outside the working studio i then had in greenwich village he always arrived around nine or ten at night carrying his flat tan leather briefcase which along with his scholarly look gave him a resemblance to a hardworking lawyer inevitably he was tired after his long busy day and sometimes he was clearly exhausted

we got off to a very poor start to use a word he liked i think both of us were a bit spooky sitting right there and staring at me was the fiery malcolm x who could be as acid toward negroes who angered him as he was against whites in general on television in press conferences and at muslim rallies i had heard him bitterly attack other negro writers as uncle toms yard negroes black men in white clothes and there i sat staring at him proposing to spend a year plumbing his innermost secrets when he had developed a near phobia for secrecy during his years of crime and his years in the muslim hierarchy my twenty years in military service and my christian religious persuasion didnt help either he often jeered publicly at these affiliations for negroes and although he now would indirectly urge me to write for national magazines about the muslims he had told me several times in various ways that you blacks with professional abilities of any kind will one of these days wake up and find out that you must unite under the leadership of the honorable elijah muhammad for your own salvation malcolm x was also convinced that the fbi had bugged my studio he probably suspected that it may even have been done with my cooperation for the first several weeks he never entered the room where we worked without exclaiming testing testing  one two three    

tense incidents occurred one night a white friend was in the studio when malcolm x arrived a little earlier than anticipated and they passed each other in the corridor malcolm xs manner during all of that session suggested that his worst doubts had been confirmed another time when malcolm x sat haranguing me about the glories of the muslim organization he was gesturing with his passport in his hand he saw that i was trying to read its perforated number and suddenly he thrust the passport toward me his neck flushed reddish get the number straight but it wont be anything the white devil doesnt already know he issued me the passport

for perhaps a month i was afraid we werent going to get any book malcolm x was still stiffly addressing me as sir and my notebook contained almost nothing but black muslim philosophy praise of mr muhammad and the evils of the white devil he would bristle when i tried to urge him that the proposed book was his life i was thinking that i might have to advise the publisher that i simply couldnt seem to get through to my subject when the first note of hope occurred i had noticed that while malcolm x was talking he often simultaneously scribbled with his redink ballpoint pen on any handy paper sometimes it was the margin of a newspaper he brought in sometimes it was on index cards that he carried in the back of a small redbacked appointment book i began leaving two white paper napkins by him every time i served him more coffee and the ruse worked when he sometimes scribbled on the napkins which i retrieved when he left some examples are these

here lies a ym killed by a bm fighting for the wm who killed all the rm decoding that wasnt difficult knowing malcolm x ym was for yellow man bm for black man wm for white man and rm was for red man

nothing ever happened without cause cause bm condition wm wont face wm obsessed with hiding his guilt

if christianity had asserted itself in germany six million jews would have lived

wm so quick to tell bm look what i have done for you no look what you have done to us

bm dealing with wm who put our eyes out now he condemns us because we cannot see

only persons really changed history those who changed mens thinking about themselves hitler as well as jesus stalin as well as buddha    hon elijah muhammad   
it was through a clue from one of the scribblings that finally i cast a bait that malcolm x took woman who cries all the time is only because she knows she can get away with it he had scribbled i somehow raised the subject of women suddenly between sips of coffee and further scribbling and doodling he vented his criticisms and skepticisms of women you never can fully trust any woman he said ive got the only one i ever met whom i would trust seventyfive percent ive told her that he said ive told her like i tell you ive seen too many men destroyed by their wives or their women

i dont completely trust anyone he went on not even myself i have seen too many men destroy themselves other people i trust from not at all to highly like the honorable elijah muhammad malcolm x looked squarely at me you i trust about twentyfive percent

trying to keep malcolm x talking i mined the woman theme for all it was worth triumphantly he exclaimed do you know why benedict arnold turned traitor  a woman he said whatever else a woman is i dont care who the woman is it starts with her being vain ill prove it something you can do anytime you want and i know what im talking about ive done it you think of the hardestlooking meanestacting woman you know one of those women who never smiles well every day you see that woman you look her right in the eyes and tell her i think youre beautiful and you watch what happens the first day she may curse you out the second day too  but you watch you keep on after a while one day shes going to start smiling just as soon as you come in sight

when malcolm x left that night i retrieved napkin scribblings that further documented how he could be talking about one thing and thinking of something else

negroes have too much righteousness wm says i want this piece of land how do i get those couple of thousand bm on it off

i have wife who understands or even if she doesnt she at least pretends

bm struggle never gets open support from abroad it needs unless bm first forms own united front

sit down talk with people with brains i respect all of us want same thing do some brainstorming

would be shocking to reveal names of the bm leaders who have secretly met with them the capitalized letters stood for the honorable elijah muhammad

then one night malcolm x arrived nearly out on his feet from fatigue for two hours he paced the floor delivering a tirade against negro leaders who were attacking elijah muhammad and himself i dont know what gave me the inspiration to say once when he paused for breath i wonder if youd tell me something about your mother

abruptly he quit pacing and the look he shot at me made me sense that somehow the chance question had hit him when i look back at it now i believe i must have caught him so physically weak that his defenses were vulnerable

slowly malcolm x began to talk now walking in a tight circle she was always standing over the stove trying to stretch whatever we had to eat we stayed so hungry that we were dizzy i remember the color of dresses she used to wear  they were a kind of fadedout gray    and he kept on talking until dawn so tired that the big feet would often almost stumble in their pacing from this streamofconsciousness reminiscing i finally got out of him the foundation for this books beginning chapters nightmare and mascot after that night he never again hesitated to tell me even the most intimate details of his personal life over the next two years his talking about his mother triggered something

malcolm xs mood ranged from somber to grim as he recalled his childhood i remember his making a great point of how he learned what had been a cardinal awareness of his ever since its the hinge that squeaks that gets the grease when his narration reached his moving to boston to live with his halfsister ella malcolm x began to laugh about how square he had been in the ghetto streets why im telling you things i havent thought about since then he would exclaim then it was during recalling the early harlem days that malcolm x really got carried away one night suddenly wildly he jumped up from his chair and incredibly the fearsome black demagogue was scatsinging and popping his fingers rebopdebopblapblam   and then grabbing a vertical pipe with one hand as the girl partner he went jubilantly lindyhopping around his coattail and the long legs and the big feet flying as they had in those harlem days and then almost as suddenly malcolm x caught himself and sat back down and for the rest of that session he was decidedly grumpy later on in the harlem narrative he grew somber again the only thing i considered wrong was what i got caught doing wrong i had a jungle mind i was living in a jungle and everything i did was done by instinct to survive but he stressed that he had no regrets about his crimes because it was all a result of what happens to thousands upon thousands of black men in the white mans christian world
his enjoyment resumed when the narrative entered his prison days let me tell you how id get those white devil convicts and the guards too to do anything i wanted id whisper to them if you dont ill start a rumor that youre really a light negro just passing as white that shows you what the white devil thinks about the black man hed rather die than be thought a negro he told me about the reading he had been able to do in prison i didnt know what i was doing but just by instinct i liked the books with intellectual vitamins and another time in the hectic pace of the world today there is no time for meditation or for deep thought a prisoner has time that he can put to good use id put prison second to college as the best place for a man to go if he needs to do some thinking if hes motivated in prison he can change his life

yet another time malcolm x reflected once a man has been to prison he never looks at himself or at other people the same again the squares out here whose boat has been in smooth waters all the time turn up their noses at an excon but an excon can keep his head up when the squares sink

he scribbled that night i kept both my notebooks and the paper napkins dated this wm created and dropped abomb on nonwhites wm now calls red and lives in fear of other wm he knows may bomb us

also learn wisdom from the pupil of the eye that looks upon all things and yet to self is blind persian poet

at intervals malcolm x would make a great point of stressing to me now i dont want anything in this book to make it sound that i think im somebody important i would assure him that i would try not to and that in any event he would be checking the manuscript page by page and ultimately the galley proofs at other times he would end an attack upon the white man and watching me take the notes exclaim that devils not going to print that i dont care what he says i would point out that the publishers had made a binding contract and had paid a sizable sum in advance malcolm x would say you trust them and i dont you studied what he wanted you to learn about him in schools i studied him in the streets and in prison where you see the truth

experiences which malcolm x had had during a day could flavor his interview mood the most wistful tender anecdotes generally were told on days when some incident had touched him once for instance he told me that he had learned that a harlem couple not black muslims had named their newborn son malcolm after him what do you know about that he kept exclaiming and that was the night he went back to his own boyhood again and this time recalled how he used to lie on his back on hectors hill and think that night too ill never forget the day they elected me the class president a girl named audrey slaugh whose father owned a car repair shop nominated me and a boy named james cotton seconded the nomination the teacher asked me to leave the room while the class voted when i returned i was the class president i couldnt believe it

any interesting book which malcolm x had read could get him going about his love of books people dont realize how a mans whole life can be changed by one book he came back again and again to the books that he had studied when in prison did you ever read the loom of language he asked me and i said i hadnt you should philology its a tough science  all about how words can be recognized no matter where you find them now you take caesar its latin in latin its pronounced like kaiser with a hard c but we anglicize it by pronouncing a soft c the russians say czar and mean the same thing another russian dialect says tsar jakob grimm was one of the foremost philologists i studied his grimms law in prison  all about consonants philology is related to the science of etymology dealing in root words i dabbled in both of them

when i turn that page in my notebook the next bears a note that malcolm x had telephoned me saying im going to be out of town for a few days i assumed that as had frequently been the case before he had speaking engagements or other muslim business to attend somewhere and i was glad for the respite in which to get my notes separated under the chapter headings they would fit but when malcolm x returned this time he reported triumphantly i have something to tell you that will surprise you ever since we discussed my mother ive been thinking about her i realized that i had blocked her out of my mind  it was just unpleasant to think about her having been twentysome years in that mental hospital he said i dont want to take the credit it was really my sister yvonne who thought it might be possible to get her out yvonne got my brothers wilfred wesley and philbert together and i went out there too it was philbert who really handled it

it made me face something about myself malcolm x said my mind had closed about our mother i simply didnt feel the problem could be solved so i had shut it out i had built up subconscious defenses the white man does this he shuts out of his mind and he builds up subconscious defenses against anything he doesnt want to face up to ive just become aware how closed my mind was now that ive opened it up again thats one of the characteristics i dont like about myself if i meet a problem i feel i cant solve i shut it out i make believe that it doesnt exist but it exists

it was my turn to be deeply touched not long afterward he was again away for a few days when he returned this time he said that at his brother philberts home we had dinner with our mother for the first time in all those years he said shes sixtysix and her memory is better than mine and she looks young and healthy she has more of her teeth than those who were instrumental in sending her to the institution

when something had angered malcolm x during the day his face would be flushed redder when he visited me and he generally would spend much of the session lashing out bitterly when some muslims were shot by los angeles policemen one of them being killed malcolm x upon his return from a trip he made there was fairly apoplectic for a week it had been in this mood that he had made in los angeles the statement which caused him to be heavily censured by members of both races

ive just heard some good news  referring to a plane crash at orly field in paris in which thirtyodd white americans mostly from atlanta georgia had been killed instantly malcolm x never publicly recanted this statement to my knowledge but much later he said to me simply thats one of the things i wish i had never said

anytime the name of the present federal judge thurgood marshall was raised malcolm x still practically spat fire in memory of what the judge had said years before when he was the naacp chief attorney the muslims are run by a bunch of thugs organized from prisons and jails and financed i am sure by some arab group the only time that i have ever heard malcolm x use what might be construed as a curse word it was a hell used in response to a statement that dr martin luther king made that malcolm xs talk brought misery upon negroes malcolm x exploded to me how in the hell can my talk do this its always a negro responsible not what the white man does the extremist or demagogue accusation invariably would burn malcolm x yes im an extremist the black race here in north america is in extremely bad condition you show me a black man who isnt an extremist and ill show you one who needs psychiatric attention

once when he said aristotle shocked people charles darwin outraged people aldous huxley scandalized millions malcolm x immediately followed the statement with dont print that people would think im trying to link myself with them another time when something provoked him to exclaim these uncle toms make me think about how the prophet jesus was criticized in his own country malcolm x promptly got up and silently took my notebook tore out that page and crumpled it and put it into his pocket and he was considerably subdued during the remainder of that session

i remember one time we talked and he showed me a newspaper clipping reporting where a negro baby had been bitten by a rat malcolm x said now just read that just think of that a minute suppose it was your child wheres that slumlord  on some beach in miami he continued fuming throughout our interview i did not go with him when later that day he addressed a negro audience in harlem and an incident occurred which helen dudar reported in the new york post

malcolm speaking in harlem stared down at one of the white reporters present the only whites admitted to the meeting and went on now theres a reporter who hasnt taken a note in half an hour but as soon as i start talking about the jews hes busy taking notes to prove that im antisemitic

behind the reporter a male voice spoke up kill the bastard kill them all the young man in his unease smiled nervously and malcolm jeered look at him laugh hes really not laughing hes just laughing with his teeth an ugly tension curled the edges of the atmosphere then malcolm went on the white man doesnt know how to laugh he just shows his teeth but we know how to laugh we laugh deep down from the bottom up the audience laughed deep down from the bottom up and as suddenly as malcolm had stirred it so skillfully and swiftly he deflected it it had been at once a masterful and shabby performance

i later heard somewhere or read that malcolm x telephoned an apology to the reporter but this was the kind of evidence which caused many close observers of the malcolm x phenomenon to declare in absolute seriousness that he was the only negro in america who could either start a race riot  or stop one when i once quoted this to him tacitly inviting his comment he told me tartly i dont know if i could start one i dont know if id want to stop one it was the kind of statement he relished making

over the months i had gradually come to establish something of a telephone acquaintance with malcolm xs wife whom i addressed as sister betty as i had heard the muslims do i admired how she ran a home with then three small daughters and still managed to take all of the calls which came for malcolm x surely as many calls as would provide a job for an average switchboard operator sometimes when he was with me he would telephone home and spend as much as five minutes rapidly jotting on a pad the various messages which had been left for him

sister betty generally friendly enough on the phone with me sometimes would exclaim in spontaneous indignation the man never gets any sleep malcolm x rarely put in less than an eighteenhour workday often when he had left my studio at four am and a fortyminute drive lay between him and home in east elmhurst long island he had asked me to telephone him there at nine am usually this would be when he wanted me to accompany him somewhere and he was going to tell me after reviewing his commitments when and where he wanted me to meet him there were times when i didnt get an awful lot of sleep myself he was always accompanied either by some of his muslim colleagues like james 67x the 67th man named james who had joined harlems mosque number 7 or charles 37x or by me but he never asked me to be with him when they were i went with him to college and university lectures to radio and television stations for his broadcasts and to public appearances in a variety of situations and locations

if we were driving somewhere motorists along the highway would wave to malcolm x the faces of both whites and negroes spontaneously aglow with the wonderment that i had seen evoked by other celebrities no few airline hostesses had come to know him because he flew so much they smiled prettily at him he was in turn the essence of courtly gentlemanliness and inevitably the word spread and soon an unusual flow of bathroom traffic would develop passing where he sat whenever we arrived at our destination it became familiar to hear theres malcolm x where the tall one passersby of both races stared at him a few of both races more negroes than whites would speak or nod to him in greeting a high percentage of white people were visibly uncomfortable in his presence especially within the confines of small areas such as in elevators im the only black man theyve ever been close to who they know speaks the truth to them malcolm x once explained to me its their guilt that upsets them not me he said another time the white man is afraid of truth the truth takes the white mans breath and drains his strength  you just watch his face get red anytime you tell him a little truth

there was something about this man when he was in a room with people he commanded the room whoever else was present even out of doors once i remember in harlem he sat on a speakers stand between congressman adam clayton powell and the former manhattan borough president hulan jack and when the street rally was over the crowd focus was chiefly on malcolm x i remember another time that we had gone by railway from new york city to philadelphia where he appeared in the philadelphia convention hall on the radio station wcau program of ed harvey you are the man who has said all negroes are angry and i am the angriest of all is that correct asked harvey on the air introducing malcolm x and as malcolm x said crisply that quote is correct the gathering crowd of bystanders stared at him riveted

we had ridden to philadelphia in reserved parlor car seats i cant get caught on a coach i could get into trouble on a coach malcolm x had said walking to board the parlor car we had passed a dining car toward which he jerked his head i used to work on that thing riding to our destination he conversationally told me that the fbi had tried to bribe him for information about elijah muhammad that he wanted me to be sure and read a new book crisis in black and white by charles silberman  one of the very few white writers i know with the courage to tell his kind the truth and he asked me to make a note to please telephone the new york posts feature writer helen dudar and tell her he thought very highly of her recent series  he did not want to commend her directly

after the ed harvey show was concluded we took the train to return to new york city the parlor car packed with businessmen behind their newspapers commuting homeward after their workdays was electric with malcolm xs presence after the whitejacketed negro porter had made several trips up and down the aisle he was in the middle of another trip when malcolm x sottovoced in my ear he used to work with me i forget his name we worked right on this very train together he knows its me hes trying to make up his mind what to do the porter went on past us pokerfaced but when he came through again malcolm x suddenly leaned forward from his seat smiling at the porter why sure i know who you are the porter suddenly said loudly you washed dishes right on this train i was just telling some of the fellows you were in my car here we all follow you

the tension on the car could have been cut with a knife then soon the porter returned to malcolm x his voice expansive one of our guests would like to meet you now a young cleancut white man rose and came up his hand extended and malcolm x rose and shook the proffered hand firmly newspapers dropped just below eyelevel the length of the car the young white man explained distinctly loudly that he had been in the orient for a while and now was studying at columbia i dont agree with everything you say he told malcolm x but i have to admire your presentation

malcolms voice in reply was cordiality itself i dont think you could search america sir and find two men who agree on everything subsequently to another white man an older businessman who came up and shook hands he said evenly sir i know how you feel its a hard thing to speak out against me when you are agreeing with so much that i say and we rode on into new york under now a general open gazing

in washington dc malcolm x slashed at the governments reluctance to take positive steps in the negros behalf i gather that even the white house took notice for not long afterward i left off interviewing malcolm x for a few days and went to the white house to do a playboy interview of the then white house press secretary pierre salinger who grimaced spontaneously when i said i was writing the life story of malcolm x another time i left malcolm x to interview the us nazi party commander george lincoln rockwell who frankly stated that he admired the courage of malcolm x and he felt that the two of them should speak together across the united states and they could thus begin a real solution to the race problem  one of voluntary separation of the white and black races with negroes returning to africa i reported this to malcolm x who snorted he must think im nuts what am i going to look like going speaking with a devil yet another time i went off to atlanta and interviewed for playboy dr martin luther king he was privately intrigued to hear littleknown things about malcolm x that i told him for publication he discussed him with reserve and he did say that he would sometime like to have an opportunity to talk with him hearing this malcolm x said drily you think i ought to send him a telegram with my telephone number but from other things that malcolm x said to me at various times i deduced that he actually had a reluctant admiration for dr king

malcolm x and i reached the point ultimately where we shared a mutual camaraderie that although it was never verbally expressed was a warm one he was for me unquestionably one of the most engaging personalities i had ever met and for his part i gathered i was someone he had learned he could express himself to with candor without the likelihood of hearing it repeated and like any person who lived amid tension he enjoyed being around someone another man with whom he could psychically relax when i made trips now he always asked me to telephone him when i would be returning to new york and generally if he could squeeze it into his schedule he met me at the airport i would see him coming along with his long gangling strides and wearing the wide toothy goodnatured grin and as he drove me into new york city he would bring me up to date on things of interest that had happened since i left i remember one incident within the airport that showed me how malcolm x never lost his racial perspective waiting for my baggage we witnessed a touching family reunion scene as part of which several cherubic little children romped and played exclaiming in another language by tomorrow night theyll know how to say their first english word  nigger observed malcolm x

when malcolm x made long trips such as to san francisco or los angeles i did not go along but frequently usually very late at night he would telephone me and ask how the book was coming along and he might set up the time for our next interview upon his return one call that i never will forget came at close to four am waking me he must have just gotten up in los angeles his voice said alex haley i said sleepily yes oh hey malcolm his voice said i trust you seventy percent  and then he hung up i lay a short time thinking about him and i went back to sleep feeling warmed by that call as i still am warmed to remember it neither of us ever mentioned it

malcolm xs growing respect for individual whites seemed to be reserved for those who ignored on a personal basis the things he said about whites and who jousted with him as a man he moreover was convinced that he could tell a lot about any person by listening theres an art to listening well he told me i listen closely to the sound of a mans voice when hes speaking i can hear sincerity the newspaper person whom he ultimately came to admire probably more than any other was the new york times m s handler i was very happy when i learned that handler had agreed to write this books introduction i know that malcolm x would have liked that the first time i ever heard malcolm x speak of handler whom he had recently met he began i was talking with this devil  and abruptly he cut himself off in obvious embarrassment its a reporter named handler from the times  he resumed malcolm xs respect for the man steadily increased and handler for his part was an influence upon the inner malcolm x hes the most genuinely unprejudiced white man i ever met malcolm x said to me speaking of handler months later i have asked him things and tested him i have listened to him talk closely

i saw malcolm x too many times exhilarated in afterlecture giveandtake with predominantly white student bodies at colleges and universities to ever believe that he nurtured at his core any blanket whitehatred the young whites and blacks too are the only hope that america has he said to me once the rest of us have always been living in a lie

several negroes come to mind now who i know in one way or another had vastly impressed malcolm x some others come to mind whom i know he has vastly abhorred but these i will not mention particularly high in his esteem i know was the great photographer usually associated with life magazine gordon parks it was malcolm xs direct influence with elijah muhammad which got parks permitted to enter and photograph for publication in life the highly secret selfdefense training program of the black muslim fruit of islam making parks as
far as i know the only nonmuslim who ever has witnessed this except for policemen and other agency representatives who had feigned joining the black muslims to infiltrate them his success among the white man never has made him lose touch with black reality malcolm x said of parks once

another person toward whom malcolm x felt similarly was the actor ossie davis once in the middle of one of our interviews when we had been talking about something else malcolm x suddenly asked me do you know ossie davis i said i didnt he said i ought to introduce you sometime thats one of the finest black men in malcolm xs long dealings with the staff of the harlem weekly newspaper amsterdam news he had come to admire executive editor james hicks and the star feature writer james booker he said that hicks had an open mind and he never panics for the white man he thought that booker was an outstanding reporter he also was highly impressed with mrs booker when he met her

it was he who introduced me to two of my friends today dr c eric lincoln who was at the time writing the book the black muslims in america and louis lomax who was then writing various articles about the muslims malcolm x deeply respected the care and depth which dr lincoln was putting into his research lomax he admired for his ferreting ear and eye for hot news if i see that rascal lomax running somewhere ill grab my hat and get behind him malcolm x said once because i know hes onto something author james baldwin malcolm x also admired hes so brilliant he confuses the white man with words on paper and another time hes upset the white man more than anybody except the honorable elijah muhammad

malcolm x had very little good to say of negro ministers very possibly because most of them had attacked the black muslims excepting reluctant admiration of dr martin luther king i heard him speak well of only one other the reverend eugene l callender of harlems large presbyterian church of the master hes a preacher but hes a fighter for the black man said malcolm x i later learned that somewhere the direct forthright reverend callender had privately cornered malcolm x and had read him the riot act about his general attacks upon the negro
clergy malcolm x also admired the reverend adam clayton powell in his congressman political role id think about retiring if the black man had ten like him in washington he had similar feelings about the naacp lawyer now a new york state assemblyman percy sutton and later sutton was retained as his personal attorney among negro educators of whom malcolm x met many in his college and university lecturing i never heard him speak well of any but one dr kenneth b clark theres a black man with brains gone to bed malcolm x told me once briefly lapsing into his old vernacular he had very distinct reservations about negro professional intelligentsia as a category they were the source from which most of the black muslims attackers came it was for this reason that some of his most bristling counterattacks against these socalled educated uncle thomases phd were flung out at his audiences at negro institutions of higher learning

where i witnessed the malcolm x who was happiest and most at ease among members of our own race was when sometimes i chanced to accompany him on what he liked to call my little daily rounds around the streets of harlem among the negroes that he said the socalled black leaders spoke of as black masses statistics on these tours malcolm x generally avoided the arterial 125th street in harlem he plied the side streets especially in those areas which were thickest with what he described as the black man down in the gutter where i came from the povertyridden with a high incidence of dope addicts and winos

malcolm x here indeed was a hero striding along the sidewalks he bathed all whom he met in the boyish grin and his conversation with any who came up was quiet and pleasant its just what the white devil wants you to do brother he might tell a wino he wants you to get drunk so he will have an excuse to put a club up beside your head or i remember once he halted at a stoop to greet several older women sisters let me ask you something he said conversationally have you ever known one white man who either didnt do something to you or take something from you one among that audience exclaimed after a moment i sure aint whereupon all of them
joined in laughter and we walked on with malcolm x waving back to cries of hes right

i remember that once in the early evening we rounded a corner to hear a man shabbily dressed haranguing a small crowd around his speaking platform of an upturned oblong wooden box with an american flag alongside i dont respect or believe in this damn flag its there because i cant hold a public meeting without it unless i want the white man to put me in jail and thats what im up here to talk about  these crackers getting rich off the blood and bones of your and my people said malcolm x grinning hes working

malcolm x rarely exchanged any words with those negro men with shiny processed hair without giving them a nudge very genially ahhhh brother the white devil has taught you to hate yourself so much that you put hot lye in your hair to make it look more like his hair

i remember another stoopful of women alongside the door of a small grocery store where i had gone for something leaving malcolm x talking across the street as i came out of the store one woman was excitedly describing for the rest a malcolm x lecture she had heard in mosque number 7 one sunday oooooh he burnt that white man burnt him up chile    chile he told us we descendin from black kings an queens  lawd i didnt know it another woman asked you believe that and the first vehemently responded yes i do

and i remember a lone almost ragged guitarist huddled on a side street playing and singing just for himself when he glanced up and instantly recognized the oncoming striding figure huhho the guitarist exclaimed and jumping up he snapped into a mock salute my man

malcolm x loved it and they loved him there was no question about it whether he was standing tall beside a street lamp chatting with winos or whether he was firing his radio and television broadsides to unseen millions of people or whether he was titillating small audiences of sophisticated whites with his smalltalk such as my hobby is stirring up negroes thats spelled kneegrows the way you liberals pronounce it  the man had charisma and he had power and i was not the only one who at various times marveled at how he could continue to receive such an awesome amount of international personal publicity and still season liberally practically everything he said both in public and privately with credit and hosannas to the honorable elijah muhammad often i made side notes to myself about this i kept in effect a doubleentry set of notebooks once noting me switching from one to the other malcolm x curiously asked me what for i told him some reason but not that one notebook was things he said for his book and the other was for my various personal observations about him very likely he would have become selfconscious you must have written a million words by now said malcolm x probably i said this white mans crazy he mused ill prove it to you do you think id publicize somebody knocking me like i do him

look tell me the truth malcolm x said to me one evening you travel around have you heard anything

truthfully i told him i didnt know what he had reference to he dropped it and talked of something else

from malcolm x himself i had seen or heard a few unusual things which had caused me some little private wonder and speculation and then with nothing to hang them on to i had dismissed them one day in his car we had stopped for the red light at an intersection another car with a white man driving had stopped alongside and when this white man saw malcolm x he instantly called across to him i dont blame your people for turning to you if i were a negro id follow you too keep up the fight malcolm x said to the man very sincerely i wish i could have a white chapter of the people i meet like you the light changed and as both cars drove on malcolm x quickly said to me firmly not only dont write that never repeat it mr muhammad would have a fit the significant thing about the incident i later reflected was that it was the first time i had ever heard him speak of elijah muhammad with anything less than reverence

about the same time one of the scribblings of malcolm xs that i had retrieved had read enigmatically my life has always been one of changes another time this was in september 1963 malcolm x had been highly upset about something during an entire session and when i read the amsterdam news for that week i guessed that he had been upset about an item in jimmy bookers column that booker had heard that elijah muhammad and malcolm x were feuding booker was later to reveal that after his column was written he had gone on vacation and on his return he learned that malcolm x stormed into the amsterdam news with three followers    i want to see jimmy booker i dont like what he wrote there is no fight between me and elijah muhammad i believe in mr muhammad and will lay down my life for him

also now and then when i chanced to meet a few other key muslims mainly when i was with malcolm x but when he was not immediately present i thought i detected either in subtle phrasing or in manner something less than total admiration of their famous colleague  and then i would tell myself i had misinterpreted and during these days dr c eric lincoln and i would talk on the phone fairly often we rarely would fail to mention how it seemed almost certain that seeds of trouble lay in the fact that however much malcolm x praised elijah muhammad it was upon dramatic articulate malcolm x that the communications media and hence the general public focused the great bulk of their attention i never dreamed though what malcolm x was actually going through he never breathed a word at least not to me until the actual rift became public

when malcolm x left me at around two am on that occasion he asked me to call him at nine am the telephone in the home in east elmhurst rang considerably longer than usual and sister betty when she answered sounded strained choked up when malcolm x came on he too sounded different he asked me have you heard the radio or seen the newspapers i said i hadnt he said well do and that he would call me later

i went and got the papers i read with astonishment that malcolm x had been suspended by elijah muhammad  the stated reason being the chickens coming home to roost remark that malcolm x recently had made as a comment upon the assassination of president kennedy

malcolm x did telephone after about an hour and i met him at the black muslims newspaper office in harlem a couple of blocks further up lenox avenue from their mosque and restaurant he was seated behind his light brown metal desk and his brown hat lay before him on the green blotter he wore a dark suit with a vest a white shirt the inevitable leapingsailfish clip held his narrow tie and the big feet in the shined black shoes pushed the swivel chair pendulously back and forth as he talked into the telephone

im always hurt over any act of disobedience on my part concerning mr muhammad    yes sir  anything the honorable elijah muhammad does is all right with me i believe absolutely in his wisdom and authority the telephone would ring again instantly every time he put it down mr peter goldman i havent heard your voice in a good while well sir i just should have kept my big mouth shut to the new york times sir yes  he suspended me from making public appearances for the time being which i fully understand i say the same thing to you that i have told others im in complete submission to mr muhammads judgment because i have always found his judgment to be based on sound thinking to cbs i think that anybody who is in a position to discipline others should first learn to accept discipline himself

he brought it off the image of contriteness the best he could  throughout the harshly trying next several weeks but the back of his neck was reddish every time i saw him he did not yet put into words his obvious fury at the public humiliation we did very little interviewing now he was so busy on telephones elsewhere but it did not matter too much because by now i had the bulk of the needed life story material in hand when he did find some time to visit me he was very preoccupied and i could feel him rankling with anger and with inactivity but he tried hard to hide it

he scribbled one night you have not converted a man because you have silenced him john viscount morley and the same night almost illegibly i was going downhill until he picked me up but the more i think of it we picked each other up

when i did not see him for several days a letter came i have cancelled all public appearances and speaking engagements for a number of weeks so within that period it should be possible to finish this book with the fast pace of newly developing incidents today it is easy for something that is done or said tomorrow to be outdated even by sunset on the same day malcolm x

i pressed to get the first chapter nightmare into a shape that he could review when it was ready in a readable rough draft i telephoned him he came as quickly as he could drive from his home  which made me see how grinding an ordeal it was to him to just be sitting at home inactive and knowing his temperament my sympathies went out to sister betty

he pored over the manuscript pages raptly the first time then drawing out his redink ballpoint pen he read through the chapter again with the pen occasionally stabbing at something you cant bless allah he exclaimed changing bless to praise in a place that referred to himself and his brothers and sisters he scratched red through we kids kids are goats he exclaimed sharply

soon malcolm x and his family flew to miami cassius clay had extended the invitation as a sixth wedding anniversary present to malcolm x and sister betty and they had accepted most gratefully it was sister bettys first vacation in the six years of the taut regimen as a black muslim wife and it was for malcolm x both a saving of face and something to do

very soon after his arrival he telegraphed me his phone number at a motel i called him and he told me i just want to tell you something im not a betting man anymore but if you are you bet on cassius to beat liston and you will win i laughed and said he was prejudiced he said remember what i told you when the fights over i received later a picture postcard the picture in vivid colors being of a chimpanzee at the monkey jungle in miami malcolm x had written on the reverse side one hundred years after the civil war and these chimpanzees get more recognition respect and freedom in america than our people do bro malcolm x another time an envelope came and inside it was a clipping of an irv kupcinet column in the chicago suntimes malcolm xs red pen had encircled an item which read insiders are predicting a split in the black muslims malcolm x ousted as no 2 man in the organization may form a splinter group to oppose elijah muhammad alongside the item malcolm x had scribbled imagine this

the night of the phenomenal upset when clay did beat liston malcolm x telephoned me and sounds of excitement were in the background the victory party was in his motel suite malcolm x told me he described what was happening mentioned some of those who were present and that the new heavyweight king was in the next room my bedroom here taking a nap after reminding me of the fight prediction he had made malcolm x said that i should look forward now to clays quick development into a major world figure i dont know if you really realize the world significance that this is the first muslim champion

it was the following morning when cassius clay gave the press interview which resulted in national headlines that he was actually a black muslim and soon after the newspapers were carrying pictures of malcolm x introducing the heavyweight champion to various african diplomats in the lobbies of the united nations headquarters in new york city malcolm x toured clay about in harlem and in other places functioning he said as clays friend and religious advisor

i had now moved upstate to finish my work on the book and we talked on the telephone every three or four days he said things suggesting that he might never be returned to his former black muslim post and he now began to say things quietly critical of elijah muhammad playboy magazine asked me to do an interview for them with the new champion cassius clay and when i confidently asked malcolm x to arrange for me the needed introduction to clay malcolm x hesitantly said i think you had better ask somebody else to do that i was highly surprised at the reply but i had learned never to press him for information and then very soon after i received a letter dear alex haley a quick note would you prepare a properly worded letter that would enable me to change the reading of the contract so that all remaining proceeds now would go to the muslim mosque inc or in the case of my death then to go directly to my wife mrs betty x little the sooner this letter or contract is changed the more easily i will rest under the signature of malcolm x there was a ps how is it possible to write ones autobiography in a world so fastchanging as this

soon i read in the various newspapers that rumors were being heard of threats on malcolm xs life then there was an article in the amsterdam news the caption was malcolm x tells of death threat and the story reported that he had said that former close associates of his in the new york mosque had sent out a special squad to try to kill me in cold blood thanks to allah i learned of the plot from the very same brothers who had been sent out to murder me these brothers had heard me represent and defend mr muhammad for too long for them to swallow the lies about me without first asking me some questions for their own clarification

i telephoned malcolm x and expressed my personal concern for him his voice sounded weary he said that his uppermost interest was that any money which might come due him in the future would go directly to his new organization or to his wife as the letter he had signed and mailed had specified he told me i know ive got to get a will made for myself i never did because i never have had anything to will to anybody but if i dont have one and something happened to me there could be a mess i expressed concern for him and he told me that he had a loaded rifle in his home and i can take care of myself

the muslim mosque inc to which malcolm x had referred was a new organization which he had formed which at that time consisted of perhaps forty or fifty muslims who had left the leadership of elijah muhammad

through a close associate of cassius clay whom malcolm x had finally suggested to me my interview appointment was arranged with the heavyweight champion and i flew down to new york city to do the interview for playboy malcolm x was away briefly sister betty said on the phone  and she spoke brusquely i talked with one black muslim lady whom i had known before she had joined and who had been an admirer of malcolm x she had elected to remain in the original fold but ill tell you brother what a lot in the mosque are saying you know its like if you divorced your husband youd still like to see him once in a while during my interviews with cassius clay in his threeroom suite at harlems theresa hotel inevitably the questions got around to clays muslim membership then to a query about what had happened to his formerly very close relationship with malcolm x evenly clay said you just dont buck mr muhammad and get away with it i dont want to talk about him no more

elijah muhammad at his headquarters in chicago grew emotionally affected whenever the name of malcolm x had to be raised in his presence one of the muslims in clays entourage told me mr muhammad reportedly had said brother malcolm got to be a big man i made him big i was about to make him a great man the faithful black muslims predicted that soon malcolm x would be turned upon by the defectors from mosque number 7 who had joined him they will feel betrayed said others a great chastisement of allah will fall upon a hypocrite mr muhammad reportedly had said at another time malcolm is destroying himself and that he had no wish whatever to see malcolm x die that he would rather see him live and suffer his treachery

the general feeling among harlemites nonmuslims with whom i talked was that malcolm x had been powerful and influential enough a minister that eventually he would split the mosque membership into two hostile camps and that in new york city at least elijah muhammads unquestioned rule would be ended

malcolm x returned he said that he had been in boston and philadelphia he spent ample time with me now during the day in room 1936 in the hotel americana his old total ease was no longer with him as if it was the most natural thing in the world to do at sudden intervals he would stride to the door pulling it open he would look up and down the corridor then shut the door again if im alive when this book comes out it will be a miracle he said by way of explanation im not saying it distressingly  he leaned forward and touched the buff gold bedspread im saying it like i say thats a bedspread

for the first time he talked with me in some detail about what had happened he said that his statement about president kennedys assassination was not why he had been ousted from the muslims it wasnt the reason at all nobody said anything when i made stronger statements before the real reason he said was jealousy in chicago and i had objected to the immorality of the man who professed to be more moral than anybody

malcolm x said that he had increased the nation of islam membership from about four hundred when he had joined to around forty thousand i dont think there were more than four hundred in the country when i joined i really dont they were mostly older people and many of them couldnt even pronounce mr muhammads name and he stayed mostly in the background

malcolm x worked hard not to show it but he was upset there is nothing more frightful than ignorance in action goethe he scribbled one day he hinted about cassius clay a couple of times and when i responded only with anecdotes about my interview with clay he finally asked what clay had said of him i dug out the index card on which the question was typed in advance and clays response was beneath in longhand malcolm x stared at the card then out of the window and he got up and walked around one of the few times i ever heard his voice betray his hurt was when he said i felt like a blood bigbrother to him he paused im not against him now hes a fine young man smart hes just let himself be used led astray

and at another time there in the hotel room he came the nearest to tears that i ever saw him and also the only time i ever heard him use for his race one word he had been talking about how hard he had worked building up the muslim organization in the early days when he was first moved to new york city when abruptly he exclaimed hoarsely we had the best organization the black mans ever had  niggers ruined it

a few days later however he wrote in one of his memo books this which he let me read children have a lesson adults should learn to not be ashamed of failing but to get up and try again most of us adults are so afraid so cautious so safe and therefore so shrinking and rigid and afraid that it is why so many humans fail most middleaged adults have resigned themselves to failure

telephone calls came frequently for malcolm x when he was in the room with me or he would make calls he would talk in a covert guarded manner clearly not wishing me to be able to follow the discussion i took to going into the bathroom at these times and closing the door emerging when the murmuring of his voice had stopped  hoping that made him more comfortable later he would tell me that he was hearing from some muslims who were still ostensibly elijah muhammads followers im a marked man he said one day after such a call ive had highly placed people tell me to be very careful every move i make he thought about it just as long as my family doesnt get hurt im not frightened for myself i have the impression that malcolm x heard in advance that the muslim organization was going to sue to make him vacate the home he and his family lived in

i had become worried that malcolm x bitter would want to go back through the chapters in which he had told of his black muslim days and reedit them in some way the day before i left new york city to return upstate i raised my concern to malcolm x i have thought about that he said there are a lot of things i could say that passed through my mind at times even then things i saw and heard but i threw them out of my mind im going to let it stand the way ive told it i want the book to be the way it was

then  march 26 1964  a note came from malcolm x there is a chance that i may make a quick trip to several very important countries in africa including a pilgrimage to the muslim holy cities of mecca and medina beginning about april 13th keep this to yourself

while abroad malcolm x wrote letters and postcards to almost everyone he knew well his letters now were signed elhajj malik elshabazz

then in midmay sister betty telephoned me her voice jubilant malcolm x was returning i flew to new york city on may 21 the phone rang in my hotel room and sister betty said just a minute please  then the deep voice said how are you

well elhajj malik elshabazz how are you

he said just a little bit tired he had arrived on a panamerican

airlines flight at 430 he was going to have a press conference at seven pm at the hotel theresa ill pick you up at 630 at 135th and lenox on the uptown side  all right

when the blue oldsmobile stopped and i got in elhajj malcolm broadly beaming wore a seersucker suit the red hair needed a barbers attention and he had grown a beard also in the car was sister betty it was the first time we had ever seen each other after more than a year of talking several times a week on the telephone we smiled at each other she wore dark glasses a blue maternity suit and she was pregnant with what would be her fourth child

there must have been fifty still and television photographers and reporters jockeying for position up front and the rest of the skyline ballroom was filling with negro followers of malcolm x or his wellwishers and the curious the room lit up with flickering and flooding lights as he came in the door squiring sister betty holding her arm tenderly and she was smiling broadly in her pride that this man was her man i recognized the times m s handler and introduced myself we warmly shook hands and commandeered a little twochair table the reporters in a thick semicircle before malcolm x seated on the podium fired questions at him and he gave the impression that all of his twelve years oratorical practice had prepared him for this new image

do we correctly understand that you now do not think that all whites are evil

true sir my trip to mecca has opened my eyes i no longer subscribe to racism i have adjusted my thinking to the point where i believe that whites are human beings  a significant pause  as long as this is borne out by their humane attitude toward negroes

they picked at his racist image im not a racist im not condemning whites for being whites but for their needs i condemn what whites collectively have done to our people collectively

he almost continually flashed about the room the ingratiating boyish smile he would pick at the new reddish beard they asked him about that did he plan to keep it he said he hadnt decided yet he would have to see if he could get used to it or not was he maneuvering to now join the major civil rights leaders whom he had previously bitterly attacked he answered that one sideways ill explain it this way sir if some men are in a car driving with a destination in mind and you know they are going the wrong way but they are convinced they are going the right way then you get into the car with them and ride with them talking  and finally when they see they are on the wrong road not getting where they were intending then you tell them and they will listen to you then what road to take he had never been in better form weighing parrying answering the questions

the times handler beside me was taking notes and muttering under his breath incredible incredible i was thinking the same thing i was thinking some of the time that if a pebble were dropped from the window behind malcolm x it would have struck on a sidewalk eight floors below where years before he had skulked selling dope

as i resumed writing upstate periodic notes came from malcolm x i hope the book is proceeding rapidly for events concerning my life happen so swiftly much of what has already been written can easily be outdated from month to month in life nothing is permanent not even life itself smile so i would advise you to rush it on out as fast as possible another note special delivery had a tone of irritation with me he had received from the publisher a letter which indicated that he had received a 2500 check when the book contract was signed and therefore i will be expected to pay personal income tax on this as you know it was my repeated specification that this entire transaction was to be made at that time directly with and to the mosque in fact i have never seen that check to this very day

the matter was straightened out and i sent malcolm x some rough chapters to read i was appalled when they were soon returned redinked in many places where he had told of his almost fatherandson relationship with elijah muhammad telephoning malcolm x i reminded him of his previous decision and i stressed that if those chapters contained such telegraphing to readers of what would lie ahead then the book would automatically be robbed of some of its building suspense and drama malcolm x said gruffly whose book is this i told him yours of course and that i only made the objection in my position as a writer he said that he would have to think about it i was heartsick at the prospect that he might want to reedit the entire book into a polemic against elijah muhammad but late that night malcolm x telephoned im sorry youre right i was upset about something forget what i wanted changed let what you already had stand i never again gave him chapters to review unless i was with him several times i would covertly watch him frown and wince as he read but he never again asked for any change in what he had originally said and the only thing that he ever indicated that he wished had been different in his life came when he was reading the chapter laura he said that was a smart girl a good girl she tried her best to make something out of me and look what i started her into  dope and prostitution i wrecked that girl

malcolm x was busy busy busy he could not visit my hotel room often and when he did it shortly would get the feeling of grand central station it seemed that when the telephone was not ringing for him he was calling someone else consulting the jotted numbers in his everready memorandum book now he had begun to talk a great deal with various people from the middle east or africa who were in new york some of these came to see him at the hotel room at first i would sit by the window engrossed in reading while they talked by the rooms door in low tones he was very apologetic when this occurred and i told him i felt no sensitivity about it then afterwards i would generally step out into the hallway or perhaps take the elevator down to the lobby then watch the elevators until i saw the visitor leave one day i remember the phone had rung steadily with such callers as cbs abc nbc every new york city paper the london daily express and numerous individuals  he and i had gotten no work at all accomplished then a television camera crew arrived and filled the room to tape an interview with malcolm x by abcs commentator bill beutel as the crew was setting up its floodlights on tripods a dayton

ohio radio station called wishing to interview malcolm x by telephone he asked me to ask them to call him the following day at his sister ellas home in boston then the ghana ministry of information called i turned with a note to malcolm x to whom the commentator beutel had just said i wont take much of your time i just have a few probably stupid questions glancing at my note malcolm x said to beutel only the unasked question is stupid and then to me tell them ill call them back please then just as the television cameras began rolling with beutel and malcolm x talking the telephone rang again and it was life magazine reporter marc crawford to whom i whispered what was happening crawford undaunted asked if the open receiver could be placed where he could hear the interview and i complied relieved that it was one way to let the interview proceed without interruption

the manuscript copy which malcolm x was given to review was in better shape now and he pored through page by page intently and now and then his head would raise with some comment you know he said once why i have been able to have some effect is because i make a study of the weaknesses of this country and because the more the white man yelps the more i know i have struck a nerve another time he put down upon the bed the manuscript he was reading and he got up from his chair and walked back and forth stroking his chin then he looked at me you know this place here in this chapter where i told you how i put the pistol up to my head and kept pulling the trigger and scared them so when i was starting the burglary ring  well he paused i dont know if i ought to tell you this or not but i want to tell the truth he eyed me speculatively i palmed the bullet we laughed together i said okay give that page here ill fix it then he considered no leave it that way too many people would be so quick to say thats what im doing today bluffing

again when reading about the period when he had discovered the prison library malcolm xs head jerked up boy i never will forget that old aardvark the next evening he came into the room and told me that he had been to the museum of natural history and learned something about the aardvark now aardvark actually means earth hog thats a good example of root words as i was telling you when you study the science of philology you learn the laws governing how a consonant can lose its shape but it keeps its identity from language to language what astonished me here was that i knew that on that day malcolm xs schedule had been crushing involving both a television and radio appearance and a live speech yet he had gone to find out something about the aardvark

before long malcolm x called a press conference and announced my new organization of afroamerican unity is a nonreligious and nonsectarian group organized to unite afroamericans for a constructive program toward attainment of human rights the new oaaus tone appeared to be one of militant black nationalism he said to the questions of various reporters in subsequent interviews that the oaau would seek to convert the negro population from nonviolence to active selfdefense against white supremacists across america on the subject of politics he offered an enigma whether you use bullets or ballots youve got to aim well dont strike at the puppet strike at the puppeteer did he envision any special area of activity im going to join in the fight wherever negroes ask for my help what about alliance with other negro organizations he said that he would consider forming some united front with certain selected negro leaders he conceded under questioning that the naacp was doing some good could any whites join his oaau if john brown were alive maybe him and he answered his critics with such statements as that he would send armed guerrillas into mississippi i am dead serious we will send them not only to mississippi but to any place where black peoples lives are threatened by white bigots as far as i am concerned mississippi is anywhere south of the canadian border at another time when evelyn cunningham of the pittsburgh courier asked malcolm x in a kidding way say something startling for my column he told her anyone who wants to follow me and my movement has got to be ready to go to jail to the hospital and to the cemetery before he can be truly free evelyn cunningham printing the item commented he smiled and chuckled but he was in dead earnest

his fourth child yet another daughter was born and he and sister betty named the baby gamilah lumumbah a young waitress named helen lanier at harlems twenty two club where malcolm x now often asked people to meet him gave him a layette for the new baby he was very deeply touched by the gesture why i hardly know that girl

he was clearly irked when a new york times poll among new york city negroes reflected that threefourths had named dr martin luther king as doing the best work for negroes and another onefifth had voted for the naacps roy wilkins while only six percent had voted for malcolm x brother he said to me do you realize that some of historys greatest leaders never were recognized until they were safely in the ground

one morning in midsummer 1964 malcolm x telephoned me and said that he would be leaving within the next two or three days for a planned six weeks abroad i heard from him first in cairo about as the predicted long hot summer began in earnest with riots and other uprisings of negroes occurring in surburban philadelphia in rochester in brooklyn in harlem and other cities the new york times reported that a meeting of negro intellectuals had agreed that dr martin luther king could secure the allegiance of the middle and upper classes of negroes but malcolm x alone could secure the allegiance of negroes at the bottom the negroes respect dr king and malcolm x because they sense in these men absolute integrity and know they will never sell them out malcolm x cannot be corrupted and the negroes know this and therefore respect him they also know that he comes from the lower depths as they do and regard him as one of their own malcolm x is going to play a formidable role because the racial struggle has now shifted to the urban north    if dr king is convinced that he has sacrificed ten years of brilliant leadership he will be forced to revise his concepts there is only one direction in which he can move and that is in the direction of malcolm x i sent a clipping of that story to malcolm x in cairo

in washington dc and new york city at least powerful civic private and governmental agencies and individuals were keenly interested in what malcolm x was saying abroad and were speculating upon what would he say and possibly do when he returned to america in upstate new york i received a telephone call from a close friend who said he had been asked to ask me if i would come to new york city on an appointed day to meet with a very high government official who was interested in malcolm x i did fly down to the city my friend accompanied me to the offices of a large private foundation well known for its activities and donations in the civil rights area i met the foundations president and he introduced me to the justice department civil rights section head burke marshall marshall was chiefly interested in malcolm xs finances particularly how his extensive traveling since his black muslim ouster had been paid for i told him that to the best of my knowledge the several payments from the publisher had financed malcolm x along with fees he received for some speeches and possible donations that his organization received and that malcolm x had told me of borrowing money from his sister ella for the current trip and that recently the saturday evening post had bought the condensation rights of the book for a substantial sum that was soon to be received marshall listened quietly intently and asked a few questions concerning other aspects of malcolm xs life then thanked me i wrote to malcolm x in cairo that night about the interview he never mentioned it

the saturday evening post flew photographer john launois to cairo to locate malcolm x and photograph him in color the magazines september 12 issue appeared and i sent a copy by airmail to malcolm x within a few days i received a stinging note expressing his anger at the magazines editorial regarding his life story the editorials opening sentence read if malcolm x were not a negro his autobiography would be little more than a journal of abnormal psychology the story of a burglar dope pusher addict and jailbird  with a family history of insanity  who acquires messianic delusions and sets forth to preach an upsidedown religion of brotherly hatred i wrote to malcolm x that he could not fairly hold me responsible for what the magazine had written in a separate editorial opinion he wrote an apology but the greatest care must be exercised in the future

his return from africa was even more auspicious than when he had returned from the hajj pilgrimage to mecca a large group of negroes his followers and wellwishers kept gathering in the overseas arrival building at kennedy airport when i entered white men with cameras were positioned on the second level taking pictures of all the negroes who entered and almost as obvious were negro plainclothesmen moving about malcolms greeters had draped across the glass overlooking the us customs inspection line some large cloth banners on which were painted in bold letters welcome home malcolm

he came in sight stepping into one of the customs inspection lines he heard the cheering and he looked up smiling his pleasure



malcolm x wanted to huddle with me to fill me in on details from his trip that he wanted in the book he said that he was giving me only the highlights because he felt that his carefully kept diary might be turned into another book we had intensive sessions in my hotel room where he read what he selected from the diary and i took notes what i want to stress is that i was trying to internationalize our problem he said to me to make the africans feel their kinship with us afroamericans i made them think about it that they are our blood brothers and we all came from the same foreparents thats why the africans loved me the same way the asians loved me because i was religious

within a few days he had no more time to see me he would call and apologize he was beset by a host of problems some of which he mentioned and some of which i heard from other people most immediately there was discontent within his organization the oaau his having stayed away almost three times as long as he had said he would be gone had sorely tested the morale of even his key members and there was a general feeling that his interest was insufficient to expect his followers interest to stay high i heard from one member that a growing disillusion could be sensed throughout the organization

in harlem at large in the bars and restaurants on the street corners and stoops there could be heard more blunt criticism of malcolm x than ever before in his career there were variously expressed two primary complaints one was that actually malcolm x only talked but other civil rights organizations were doing all hes ever done was talk core and sncc and some of them people of dr kings are out getting beat over the head the second major complaint was that malcolm x was himself too confused to be seriously followed any longer he doesnt know what he believes in no sooner do you hear one thing than hes switched to something else the two complaints were not helping the old firebrand malcolm x image any nor were they generating the local public interest that was badly needed by his small young oaau

a court had made it clear that malcolm x and his family would have to vacate the elmhurst house for its return to the adjudged legal owners elijah muhammads nation of islam and other immediate problems which malcolm x faced included finances among his other expenses a wife and four daughters had to be supported along with at least one fulltime oaau official upon his return from africa our agent for the book had delivered to me for malcolm x a check for a sizable sum soon afterward malcolm x told me laughing wryly its evaporated i dont know where

malcolm x plunged into a welter of activities he wrote and telephoned dozens of acceptances to invitations to speak predominantly at colleges and universities  both to expound his philosophies and to earn the 150300 honorariums above traveling expenses when he was in new york city he spent all the time he could in his oaaus sparsely furnished office on the mezzanine floor of the hotel theresa trying to do something about the oaaus knotty problems im not exposing our size in numbers he evaded the query of one reporter you know the strongest part of a tree is the root and if you expose the root the tree dies why we have many invisible members of all types unlike other leaders ive practiced the flexibility to put myself into contact with every kind of negro in the country

even at mealtimes at his favorite twenty two club or elsewhere in harlem he could scarcely eat for the people who came up asking for appointments to discuss with him topics ranging from personal problems to his opinions on international issues it seemed not in him to say no to such requests and aides of his volunteering their time as often as not had to wait lengthy periods to get his ear for matters important to the oaau or to himself often even then he most uncharacteristically showed an impatience with their questions or their suggestions and they chafed visibly and at least once weekly generally on sunday evenings he would address as many negroes as word of mouth and mimeographed advertising could draw to hear him in harlems audubon ballroom on west 166th street between broadway and st nicholas avenue near new york citys famous columbiapresbyterian medical center

malcolm x for some reason suddenly began to deliver a spate of attacks against elijah muhammad making more bitter accusations of religious fakery and immorality than he ever had very possibly malcolm x had grown increasingly incensed by the imminence of the courts deadline for him to have to move his wife and four little daughters from the comfortable home in which they had lived for years in elmhurst and sister betty was again pregnant a home is really the only thing ive ever provided betty since weve been married he had told me discussing the courts order and they want to take that away man i cant keep on putting her through changes all shes put up with  man ive got to love this woman

a rash of death threats were anonymously telephoned to the police to various newspapers to the oaau office and to the familys home in elmhurst when he went to court again fighting to keep the house he was guarded by a phalanx of eight oaau men twenty uniformed policemen and twelve plainclothes detectives the courts decision was that the order to vacate would not be altered when malcolm x reached home in long island one of his followers telephoning him there got instead a telephone company operator who said that the ol 16320 number was disconnected a carload of his oaau followers racing to long island found malcolm x and his family perfectly safe inquiry of the telephone company revealed that a mrs small had called and requested that the service for that number be disconnected for vacation the oaau followers drove back to harlem there was an ensuing confrontation between them and followers of elijah muhammad in front of the black muslim restaurant at 116th street and lenox avenue the incident wound up with policemen who rushed to the scene finding two guns in the oaau car and the six oaau men were arrested

malcolm x had a date to speak in boston but he was too busy to go and he sent an oaau assistant who spoke instead the car returning him to the boston airport was blocked at the east boston tunnel by another car reportedly men with knives rushed out of the blockade car but the malcolm x forces showed a shotgun and the attackers dispersed

malcolm x steadily accused the black muslims as the source of the various attacks and threats there is no group in the united states more able to carry out this threat than the black muslims he said i know because i taught them myself asked why he had attacked the black muslims and elijah muhammad when things had seemed to be cooled down he said i would not have revealed any of this if they had left me alone he let himself be photographed in his home holding an automatic carbine rifle with a full double clip of ammunition that he said he kept ready for action against any possible assassination efforts i have taught my wife to use it and instructed her to fire on anyone white black or yellow who tries to force his way inside

i went to new york city in december for malcolm xs reading of final additions to the manuscript to include the latest developments he was further than i had ever seen him from his old assured self it seemed to me he kept saying that the press was making light of his statements about the threats on his life they act like im jiving he brought up again the saturday evening post editorial you cant trust the publishing people i dont care what they tell you the agent for the book sent to my hotel a contract dealing with foreign publication rights which needed malcolm xs and my signature i signed it as he observed and handed the pen to him he looked suspiciously at the contract and said i had better show this thing to my lawyer and put the contract in his inside coat pocket driving in harlem about an hour later he suddenly stopped the car across the street from the 135th street ymca building withdrawing the contract he signed it and thrust it to me ill trust you he said and drove on

with christmas approaching upon an impulse i bought for malcolm xs two oldest daughters two large dolls with painted brown complexions the kind of dolls that would walk when held by the left hand when malcolm x next came to my room in the hotel wellington i said ive gotten something for you to take to attallah and qubilah for christmas gifts and i walked out the dolls amazement then a wide grin spread over his face well what do you know about that well how about that he bent to examine the dolls his expression showed how touched he was you know he said after a while this isnt something im proud to say but i dont think ive ever bought one gift for my children everything they play with either betty got it for them or somebody gave it to them never me thats not good i know it ive always been too busy

in early january i flew from upstate new york to kennedy airport where i telephoned malcolm x at home and told him that i was waiting for another plane to kansas city to witness the swearingin of my younger brother george who had recently been elected a kansas state senator tell your brother for me to remember us in the alley malcolm x said tell him that he and all of the other moderate negroes who are getting somewhere need to always remember that it was us extremists who made it possible he said that when i was ready to leave kansas to telephone him saying when i would arrive back in new york and if he could we could get together i did this and he met me at kennedy airport he had only a little while he was so pressed he said he had to leave that afternoon himself for a speaking engagement which had come up so i made reservations for the next flight back upstate then we went outside and sat and talked in his car in a parking lot he talked about the pressures on him everywhere he turned and about the frustrations among them that no one wanted to accept anything relating to him except my old hate and violence image he said the socalled moderate civil rights organizations avoided him as too militant and the socalled militants avoided him as too moderate they wont let me turn the corner he once exclaimed im caught in a trap

in a happier area we talked about the coming baby we laughed about the four girls in a row already this one will be the boy he said he beamed if not the next one when i said it was close to time for my plane to leave he said he had to be getting on too i said give my best to sister betty he said that he would we shook hands and i got outside and stood as he backed the blue oldsmobile from its parking space i called out see you and we waved as he started driving away there was no way to know that it was the last time i would see him alive

on january 19 malcolm x appeared on the pierre berton television show in canada and said in response to a question about integration and intermarriage

i believe in recognizing every human being as a human being  neither white black brown or red and when you are dealing with humanity as a family theres no question of integration or intermarriage its just one human being marrying another human being or one human being living around and with another human being i may say though that i dont think it should ever be put upon a black man i dont think the burden to defend any position should ever be put upon the black man because it is the white man collectively who has shown that he is hostile toward integration and toward intermarriage and toward these other strides toward oneness so as a black man and especially as a black american any stand that i formerly took i dont think that i would have to defend it because its still a reaction to the society and its a reaction that was produced by the society and i think that it is the society that produced this that should be attacked not the reaction that develops among the people who are the victims of that negative society

from this it would be fair to say that one month before his death malcolm had revised his views on intermarriage to the point where he regarded it as simply a personal matter

on the 28th of january malcolm x was on twas flight no 9 from new york that landed at about three pm in los angeles a special police intelligence squad saw malcolm x greeted by two close friends edward bradley and allen jamal who drove him to the statlerhilton hotel where malcolm x checked into room 1129 said bradley as we entered the lobby six men came in right after us i recognized them as black muslims when malcolm x returned downstairs to the lobby he practically bumped into the muslim entourage the muslims were stunned malcolms face froze but he never broke his gait then we knew we were facing trouble malcolm xs friends drove him to pick up two former secretaries of elijah muhammad who had filed paternity suits against him and they went to the office of the colorful los angeles attorney gladys root mrs root said that malcolm x made accusations about elijah muhammads conduct with various former secretaries

after dinner malcolm xs two friends drove him back to the hotel black muslims were all over the place bradley related some were in cars and others stood around near the hotel they had the hotel completely surrounded malcolm sized up the situation and jumped out of the car he warned me to watch out and ran into the lobby he went to his room and remained there for the rest of his stay in los angeles

the car in which malcolm x left the hotel bound for the airport was followed said bradley hardly had we got on the freeway when we saw two carloads of black muslims following us the cars started to pull alongside malcolm picked up my walking cane and stuck it out of a back window as if it were a rifle the two cars fell behind we picked up speed pulled off the airport ramp and roared up to the front of the terminal the police were waiting and malcolm was escorted to the plane through an underground passageway then i saw malcolm to the plane

chicago police were waiting when the plane landed at ohare airport that night at eight oclock driven to the bristol hotel malcolm x checked in and the adjoining suite was taken by members of the police force who would keep him under steady guard for the next three days in chicago malcolm x testified at the office of the attorney general of the state of illinois which had been investigating the nation of islam another day he appeared on the television program of irv kupcinet he described attempts that had been made to kill him he said he had on his desk a letter naming the persons assigned to kill him when police returned malcolm x to his hotel at least fifteen grimfaced negroes were loitering nearby whispered malcolm x to detective sergeant edward mcclellan those are all black muslims at least two of them i recognize as being from new york elijah seems to know every move i make later in his room he told the detective its only going to be a matter of time before they catch up with me i know too much about the muslims but their threats are not going to stop me from what i am determined to do after that night spent in the hotel malcolm x was policeescorted back to ohare where he caught a plane to new york citys kennedy airport

right away he was served with a court order of eviction from the elmhurst home he telephoned me upstate his voice was strained he told me that he had filed an appeal to the court order that on the next day he was going to alabama and thence to england and france for scheduled speeches and soon after returning he would go to jackson mississippi to address the mississippi freedom democratic party on february 19 then he said  the first time he had ever voiced to me such an admission  haley my nerves are shot my brains tired he said that upon his return from mississippi he would like to come and spend two or three days in the town where i was and read the books manuscript again you say its a quiet town just a couple of days of peace and quiet thats what i need i said that he knew he was welcome but there was no need for him to tax himself reading through the long book again as it had only a few very minor editing changes since he had only recently read it i just want to read it one more time he said because i dont expect to read it in finished form so we made a tentative agreement that the day after his projected return from mississippi he would fly upstate to visit for a weekend with me the projected date was the saturday and sunday of february 2021

jet magazine reported malcolm xs trip to selma alabama on the invitation of two members of the student nonviolent coordinating committee dr martin luther king was in a selma jail when malcolm xs arrival sent officials of dr kings southern christian leadership conference into a tailspin quickly the sclcs executive director reverend andrew young and reverend james bevel met with malcolm x urging him not to incite any incidents and cautioning him that his presence could cause violence he listened with a smile said miss faye bellamy secretary of the sncc who accompanied malcolm x to a negro church where he would address a mass meeting remember this nobody puts words in my mouth he told miss bellamy he told her that in about two weeks he planned to start southern recruiting for his harlembased oaau at the church where he would speak malcolm x was seated on the platform next to mrs martin luther king to whom he leaned and whispered that he was trying to help she told jet he said he wanted to present an alternative that it might be easier for whites to accept martins proposals after hearing him malcolm x i didnt understand him at first said mrs king he seemed rather anxious to let martin know he was not causing trouble or making it difficult but that he was trying to make it easier    later in the hallway he reiterated this he seemed sincere   

addressing the mass meeting malcolm x reportedly shouted i dont advocate violence but if a man steps on my toes ill step on his    whites better be glad martin luther king is rallying the people because other forces are waiting to take over if he fails

returned to new york city malcolm x soon flew to france he was scheduled to speak before a congress of african students but he was formally advised that he would not be permitted to speak and moreover that he could consider himself officially barred forever from france as an undesirable person he was asked to leave  and he did fuming with indignation

he flew on to london and reporters of the british broadcasting corporation took him on an interviewing tour in smethwick a town near birmingham with a large colored population numerous residents raised a storm of criticism that the bbc was a party to a fanning of racism in the already tensionfilled community on this visit he spoke also at the london school of economics

malcolm x returned to new york city on saturday february 13th he was asleep with his family when at about a quarter of three the following sunday morning a terrifying blast awakened them sister betty would tell me later that malcolm x barking commands and snatching up screaming frightened children got the family safely out of the back door into the yard someone had thrown flaming molotov cocktail gasoline bombs through the front picture window it took the fire department an hour to extinguish the flames half the house was destroyed malcolm x had no fire insurance

pregnant distraught sister betty and the four little daughters went to the home of close friends malcolm x steeled himself to catch a plane as scheduled that morning to speak in detroit he wore an opennecked sweater shirt under his suit immediately afterward he flew back to new york monday morning amid a flurry of emergency rehousing plans for his family malcolm x was outraged when he learned that elijah muhammads new york mosque number 7 minister james x had told the press that malcolm x himself had firebombed the home to get publicity

monday night malcolm x spoke to an audience in the familiar audubon ballroom if he had possessed the steel nerves not to become rattled in public before now he was ive reached the end of my rope he shouted to the audience of five hundred i wouldnt care for myself if they would not harm my family he declared flatly my house was bombed by the muslims and he hinted at revenge there are hunters there are also those who hunt the hunters

tuesday february 16th malcolm x telephoned me he spoke very briefly saying that the complications following the bombing of his home had thrown his plans so awry that he would be unable to visit me upstate on the weekend as he had said he would he said he had also had to cancel his planned trip to jackson mississippi which he was going to try and make later he said he had to hurry to an appointment and hung up i would read later where also on that day he told a close associate i have been marked for death in the next five days i have the names of five black muslims who have been chosen to kill me i will announce them at the meeting and malcolm x told a friend that he was going to apply to the police department for a permit to carry a pistol i dont know whether they will let me have one or not as i served time in prison

on thursday he told a reporter in an interview which did not appear until after his death im man enough to tell you that i cant put my finger on exactly what my philosophy is now but im flexible

the blackboard in the oaau office counseled members and visitors that bro malcolm speaks thurs feb 18 wins station 1030 pm earlier thursday malcolm x discussed locating another home with a real estate dealer on friday he had an appointment with gordon parks the life magazine photographerauthor whom he had long admired and respected he appeared calm and somewhat resplendent with his goatee and astrakhan hat parks would report later in life much of the old hostility and bitterness seemed to have left him but the fire and confidence were still there malcolm x speaking of the old mosque number 7 days said that was a bad scene brother the sickness and madness of those days  im glad to be free of them its a time for martyrs now and if im to be one it will be in the cause of brotherhood thats the only thing that can save this country ive learned it the hard way  but ive learned it   

parks asked malcolm x if it was really true that killers were after him its as true as we are standing here malcolm x said theyve tried it twice in the last two weeks parks asked him about police protection and malcolm x laughed brother nobody can protect you from a muslim but a muslim  or someone trained in muslim tactics i know i invented many of those tactics

recalling the incident of the young white college girl who had come to the black muslim restaurant and asked what can i do and he told her nothing and she left in tears malcolm x told gordon parks well ive lived to regret that incident in many parts of the african continent i saw white students helping black people something like this kills a lot of argument i did many things as a muslim that im sorry for now i was a zombie then  like all muslims  i was hypnotized pointed in a certain direction and told to march well i guess a mans entitled to make a fool of himself if hes ready to pay the cost it cost me twelve years

saturday morning he drove sister betty to see a real estate man the house that the man then showed them that malcolm x particularly liked in a predominantly jewish neighborhood also on long island required a 3000 down payment sister betty indicated her approval too and malcolm x told the real estate man he thought they would take it driving sister betty back to the friends home where she was staying with the children they estimated that it would cost them about another 1000 to make the move he stayed until midafternoon with sister betty at the friends home talking he told her that he realized that she had been under protracted great strain and that he was sorry about it when he got his hat to leave to drive into manhattan standing in the hallway he told sister betty well all be together i want my family with me families shouldnt be separated ill never make another long trip without you well get somebody to keep the children ill never leave you so long again

i couldnt help but just break out grinning sister betty would later tell me

she figured that he must have stopped at a nearby drugstore to use the telephone booth when i later told her that malcolm x had telephoned me upstate at about 330 that afternoon

for the first time in nearly two years i did not recognize immediately that the voice on the other end of the phone belonged to malcolm x he sounded as if he had a heavy deep cold he told me that in the middle of the night he and some friends had helped a moving companys men take out of the other house all of the familys furniture and other belongings salvageable after the firebombing  before a sheriffs eviction party would set the things out on the sidewalk betty and i have been looking at a house we want to buy  he tried a chuckle  you know nobodys going to rent not to me these days he said all ive got is about 150 and that he needed a 3000 down payment plus 1000 moving costs he asked if i thought the publisher would advance him 4000 against the projected profits from the book i said that when our agents offices opened on monday morning i would telephone and i knew that he would query the publisher to see if it couldnt be arranged then monday night i would call him back and let him know

he said that he and sister betty had decided that although they were going to pay for the house to avoid possible trouble they had gotten the agreement of his sister ella who lived in boston to let the house be bought in her name he said that he still owed 1500 to his sister ella which she had loaned him to make one trip abroad eventually they would change the houses title into sister bettys name he said or maybe into the name of their oldest daughter attilah

he digressed on the dangers he faced but you know im going to tell you something brother  the more i keep thinking about this thing the things that have been happening lately im not all that sure its the muslims i know what they can do and what they cant and they cant do some of the stuff recently going on now im going to tell you the more i keep thinking about what happened to me in france i think im going to quit saying its the muslims

then  it seemed to me such an odd abrupt change of subject you know im glad ive been the first to establish official ties between afroamericans and our blood brothers in africa and saying goodbye he hung up

after that telephone call malcolm x drove on into manhattan and to the new york hilton hotel between 53rd and 54th streets at rockefeller center he checked the blue oldsmobile into the hotel garage and then in the lobby he checked himself in and was assigned a twelfthfloor room to which a bellman accompanied him

soon some negro men entered the giant hotels busy lobby

they began asking various bellmen what room malcolm x was in the bellmen of course never would answer that question concerning any guest  and considering that it was malcolm x whom practically everyone who read new york city newspapers knew was receiving constant death threats the bellmen quickly notified the hotels security chief from then until malcolm x checked out the next day extra security vigilance was continuously maintained on the twelfth floor during that time malcolm x left the room only once to have dinner in the hotels lobbylevel dimly lit bourbon room

sunday morning at nine oclock sister betty in long island was surprised when her husband telephoned her and asked if she felt it would be too much trouble for her to get all of the four children dressed and bring them to the two oclock meeting that afternoon at the audubon ballroom in harlem she said of course it wont on saturday he had told her that she couldnt come to the meeting he said to her you know what happened an hour ago exactly at eight oclock the phone woke me up some man said wake up brother and hung up malcolm x said goodbye to sister betty

and four hours later malcolm x left his room and took an elevator down to the lobby where he checked out he got his car and in the clear warm midday of sunday february 21 he drove uptown to the audubon ballroom

the audubon ballroom between broadway and st nicholas avenue on the south side of west 166th street is a twostory building frequently rented for dances organization functions and other affairs a dark slender pretty young lady occupationally a receptionist and avocationally a hardworking oaau assistant to malcolm x has since told me that she arrived early about 130 pm having some preliminary work to do entering she saw that the usual four hundred wooden chairs had been set up with aisles on either side but no center aisle the young lady she wishes to be nameless noticed that several people were already seated in the front rows but she gave it no thought since some always came early liking to get seats up close to the stage to savor to the fullest the dramatic orator malcolm x on the stage behind the speakers stand were eight straight brown chairs arranged in a row and behind it was the stages painted backdrop a mural of a restful country scene the young ladys responsibilities for this day had included making arrangements and subsequent confirmations with the scheduled cospeaker the reverend milton galamison the militant brooklyn presbyterian who in 1964 had led the two oneday negro boycotts in new york city public schools protesting racial imbalance she had similarly made arrangements with some other prominent negroes who were due to appeal to the audience for their maximum possible contributions to aid the work of malcolm x and his organization

the people who entered the ballroom were not searched at the door in recent weeks malcolm x had become irritable about this saying it makes people uncomfortable and that it reminded him of elijah muhammad if i cant be safe among my own kind where can i be he had once said testily for this day also he had ordered the press  as such  barred white or black he was angry at what he interpreted as slanted press treatment recently he felt especially that the newspapers had not taken seriously his statements of the personal danger he was in united press international reporter stanley scott a negro had been admitted he later said when a malcolm lieutenant decided as a negro you will be allowed to enter as a citizen if you like but you must remove your press badge the same criterion had applied to wmca newsman hugh simpson both he and scott came early enough so that they obtained seats up near the stage

malcolm x entered the ballroom at shortly before two oclock trudging heavily instead of with his usual lithe strides his young lady assistant has told me by this time several other of his assistants were filtering in and out of the small anteroom alongside the stage he sat down sideways on a chair his long legs folded around its bottom and he leaned one elbow on a kind of counter before a rather rickety makeup mirror that entertainers used when dances were held in the ballroom he wore a dark suit white shirt and narrow dark tie he said to a little group of his assistants that he wasnt going to talk about his personal troubles i dont want that to be the reason for anyone to come to hear me he stood up and paced about the little room he said he was going to state that he had been hasty to accuse the black muslims of bombing his home things have happened since that are bigger than what they can do i know what they can do things have gone beyond that

those in the anteroom could hear the sounds of the enlarging audience outside taking seats the way i feel i ought not to go out there at all today malcolm x said in fact im going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself  thats all a part of the white mans big maneuver to keep us fighting among ourselves against each other im not fighting anyone thats not what were here for he kept glancing at his wrist watch anticipating the arrival of reverend galamison whenever you make any appointment with a minister he said to his young lady assistant you have to call them two or three hours before time because they will change their mind this is typical of ministers

i felt bad i felt that it was my fault the young lady told me it was time for the meeting to start too she turned to malcolm xs stalwart assistant benjamin x known as a highly able speaker himself brother will you speak she asked  then turning to malcolm x is it all right if he speaks and maybe he could introduce you malcolm x abruptly whirled on her and barked you know you shouldnt ask me right in front of him then collecting himself quickly he said okay brother benjamin x asked how long he should speak malcolm x said glancing again at his wristwatch make it half an hour and brother benjamin x went through the door leading onto the stage they heard him expertly exhorting the audience about what is needed today by the black man here in these united states

the reverend galamison and other notables due hadnt arrived by three oclock brother malcolm looked so disappointed the young lady says he said to me i dont think any of them are coming either i felt so terrible for him it did seem as if no one cared i told him oh dont worry theyre just late theyll be here it was also reported by another source that galamison unable to come to the meeting did telephone earlier and that malcolm x was told of this before he went out to speak

then brother benjamin xs halfhour was up and the young lady and malcolm x alone back there in the anteroom could hear him entering the introduction and now without further remarks i present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you a man who would give his life for you  i want you to hear listen to understand  one who is a trojan for the black man

applause rose from the audience at the anteroom door malcolm x turned and looked back at his young lady assistant youll have to forgive me for raising my voice to you  im just about at my wits end

oh dont mention it she said quickly i understand

his voice sounded far away i wonder if anybody really understands   and he walked out onto the stage into the applause smiling and nodding at brother benjamin x who passed him en route to the anteroom

the young lady had picked up some paperwork she had to do when benjamin x came in perspiring she patted his hand saying that was good through the anteroom door just ajar she and benjamin x heard the applause diminishing then the familiar ringing greeting asalaikum brothers and sisters

asalaikum salaam some in the audience responded

about eight rows of seats from the front then a disturbance occurred in a sudden scuffling a mans voice was raised angrily take your hand out of my pocket the entire audience was swiveling to look hold it hold it dont get excited malcolm x said crisply lets cool it brothers  

with his own attention distracted it is possible that he never saw the gunmen one woman who was seated near the front says the commotion back there diverted me just for an instant then i turned back to look at malcolm x just in time to see at least three men in the front row stand and take aim and start firing simultaneously it looked like a firing squad numerous persons later said they saw two men rushing toward the stage one with a shotgun the other with two revolvers said upi reporter stanley scott shots rang out men women and children ran for cover they stretched out on the floor and ducked under tables radio station wmca reporter hugh simpson said then i heard this muffled sound i saw malcolm hit with his hands still raised then he fell back over the chairs behind him everybody was shouting i saw one man firing a gun from under his coat behind me as i hit it the floor too he was firing like he was in some western running backward toward the door and firing at the same time

the young lady who was in the backstage anteroom told me it sounded like an army had taken over somehow i knew i wouldnt go and look i wanted to remember him as he was

malcolm xs hand flew to his chest as the first of sixteen shotgun pellets or revolver slugs hit him then the other hand flew up the middle finger of the left hand was bulletshattered and blood gushed from his goatee he clutched his chest his big body suddenly fell back stiffly knocking over two chairs his head struck the stage floor with a thud

in the bedlam of shouting screaming running people some ran toward the stage among them sister betty scrambled up from where she had thrown her body over her children who were shrieking she ran crying hysterically my husband theyre killing my husband an unidentified photographer snapped shots of malcolm x supine on the stage floor with people bent over him snatching apart his bloody shirt loosening his tie trying to give him mouthtomouth artificial respiration first a woman then a man said the woman who identified herself only as a registered nurse i dont know how i got up on the stage but i threw myself down on who i thought was malcolm  but it wasnt i was willing to die for the man i would have taken the bullets myself then i saw malcolm and the firing had stopped and i tried to give him artificial respiration then sister betty came through the people herself a nurse and people recognizing her moved back she fell on her knees looking down on his bare bulletpocked chest sobbing they killed him

patrolman thomas hoy 22 was stationed outside the audubon ballroom entrance i heard the shooting and the place exploded

he rushed inside he saw malcolm x lying on the stage and then some people chasing a man patrolman hoy grabbed the suspect

louis michaux the owner of the nationalist memorial bookstore at 125th street and seventh avenue in harlem said i was arriving late at the meeting where malcolm x had invited me i met a large number of people rushing out

sergeant alvin aronoff and patrolman louis angelos happened to be cruising by in their radio car when they heard shots when we got there said aronoff the crowds were pushing out and screaming malcolms been shot and get im get im dont let him go the two policemen grabbed by the arms a negro who was being kicked as he tried to escape firing a warning shot into the air the policemen pushed the man into their police car not wanting the angry crowd to close in and drove him quickly to the police station

someone had run up to the columbiapresbyterian hospitals vanderbilt clinic emergency entrance at 167th street and grabbed a polesandcanvas stretcher and brought it back to the audubon ballroom stage malcolm x was put on the stretcher and an unidentified photographer got a macabre picture of him with his mouth open and his teeth bared as men rushed him up to the hospital clinic emergency entrance a hospital spokesman said later that it was about 315 pm when malcolm x reached a thirdfloor operating room he was either dead or in a deathappearing state said the spokesman

a team of surgeons cut through his chest to attempt to massage the heart the effort was abandoned at 330 pm

reporters who had descended upon the hospital office fired questions at the spokesman who kept saying brusquely i dont know then he took the elevator upstairs to the emergency operating room a small crowd of friends and sister betty had also pushed into the hospital office when the hospital spokesman returned collecting himself he made an announcement the gentleman you know as malcolm x is dead he died from gunshot wounds he was apparently dead before he got here he was shot in the chest several times and once in the cheek

the group filed out of the hospital office the negro men were visibly fighting their emotions one kept smashing his fist into the other cupped palm among the women many were openly crying

moments after the news flashed throughout harlem and throughout the entire world a crowd began to gather outside the hotel theresa where malcolm xs oaau had its headquarters they learned over transistor radios that the man whom the two policemen had taken from the murder scene initially identified himself as thomas hagan 22 he was later identified as talmadge hayer in whose right trousers pocket the policemen had found a 45 caliber cartridge clip containing four unused cartridges and then at jewish memorial hospital doctors had reported that hayer had been shot in the left thigh his forehead was bruised and his body was beaten if we hadnt gotten him away they would have kicked him to death sergeant aronoff had said and hayer had been taken to the bellevue hospital prison ward

by five pm the crowd in front of the theresa hotel had been quietly carefully dispersed and the black muslim mosque number 7 and its restaurant around the corner at 116th street and lenox avenue had been ordered closed as a precautionary measure on the orders of the local 28th precincts captain lloyd sealy new york citys first negro to command a precinct when reporters telephoned the black muslim restaurant a mans voice stated no one is available to make any statement when the oaau office in the theresa hotel was tried the telephone kept ringing unanswered precinct captain sealy soon appeared walking by himself along 125th street swinging his nightstick and conversing with people he met

at the 28th precinct station house on west 123rd street the forty policemen who were to have gone off duty at four pm had been told they must remain on duty and two full busloads of the highly trained new york city police tactical patrol force had arrived at the precinct various high police officials made press statements a tactical patrol force captain harry kaiser said no unusual occurrences had been noted and he anticipated no trouble deputy police commissioner walter arm said that hundreds of extra policemen would be put into the harlem area including some members of the bureau of special services an assistant chief inspector harry taylor speculated that the assassins had not rushed from the ballroom among the crowd but had kept running past the stage and escaped on 165th street in the early evening the police departments chief of detectives philip j walsh quit a vacation he was on to join the hunt for the killers and he said he looked forward to a longdrawnout investigation police and reporters at the shooting scene had pictures taken of the stage with white chalk marks now circling five bullet holes in the speakers stand there were other holes in the stages mural backdrop indicating slugs or shotgun pellets which had either missed malcolm x or passed through him police declined to discuss a rumor sweeping harlem that they had some motion pictures which had been taken in the audubon ballroom as the murder took place another rumor that gained swift momentum was that when sister betty had leaned over her husbands body she had removed from his coat pocket a paper on which he had written the names of those he had supposedly learned were assigned to execute him

deputy police commissioner walter arm stressed that the department had made efforts to protect malcolm x twenty different times the department had offered protection to malcolm x or to some of his assistants and the protection was refused said commissioner arm and seventeen times uniformed police guards had been offered for the oaau meetings at the audubon ballroom the most recent time being last sunday asked about the pistol permit that malcolm x had said publicly he planned to request commissioner arm said that as far as he knew malcolm x had never actually filed a request

a number of questions have been raised the suspect arrested by patrolman hoy as he was being chased from the meeting has at present writing not been identified publicly deputy police commissioner walter arms statement that malcolm x refused police protection conflicts directly with the statements of many of his associates that during the week preceding his assassination malcolm x complained repeatedly that the police would not take his requests for protection seriously finally although police sources said that a special detail of twenty men had been assigned to the meeting and that it had even been attended by agents of the bureau of special services these men were nowhere in evidence during or after the assassination and talmadge hayer rescued from the crowd and arrested as a suspect immediately after the assassination was picked up by two patrolmen in a squad car cruising by

on longdistance telephones reporters reached the chicago mansion headquarters of elijah muhammad he would not come to the telephone but a spokesman of his said that muhammad has no comment today but he might have something to say tomorrow no statement could be obtained either from malcolm xs oldest brother wilfred x the black muslim minister of mosque number 1 in detroit at his home a woman told reporters that minister wilfred x was not there that he had not gone to new york and she didnt believe he had any plans to do so minister wilfred x reached later said that he anticipated attending the black muslim convention in chicago on the following sunday and regarding his brother my brother is dead and there is nothing we can do to bring him back

as dark fell many negro men and women assembled before louis michauxs bookstore where most of harlems black nationalist public activity centered a small group of oaau members opened their hotel theresa headquarters and sat in the room and would not make any statements to reporters

the new york daily news came onto the newsstands with its cover page devoted to malcolm x murdered over the photograph of him being borne away on the stretcher and a subcaption gunned down at rally in long island where she had been taken just after her fathers murder sixyearold attallah carefully wrote a letter to him dear daddy i love you so o dear o dear i wish you wasnt dead

in chicago where policemen were watching all bus depots railways terminals ohare airport and highway entrances elijah muhammad under heavy guard in his threestory mansion said malcolm died according to his preaching he seems to have taken weapons as his god therefore we couldnt tolerate a man like that he preached war we preach peace we are permitted to fight if we are attacked  thats the scripture the koran and the bible too but we will never be the aggressor i dont have the right to be frightened because i was chosen by allah if allah gives me up to the hands of the wicked i am satisfied my life is in the hands of allah the grounds outside the mansion were patrolled by both chicago police and fruit of islam bodyguards more of both patrolled before the university of islam high school and the offices of the newspaper muhammad speaks

harlem was mostly asleep when around the black muslim mosque number 7 on the top floor of a fourstory building at 116th street and lenox avenue an explosive sound at 215 am ripped the night firemen were instantly summoned by the four policemen who had been guarding the sidewalk entrance to the mosque within a few minutes flames burst through the buildings roof and leaped thirty feet into the air for the next seven hours firemen would pour water into the building on an adjacent roof they found an empty fivegallon gasoline can a brown gasolinestained shopping bag and oily rags southbound irt subway service was rerouted for a while also three bus lines at the spectacular fivealarm fires height a wall of the building collapsed it smashed two fire engines at the curb and injured five firemen one seriously and also a pedestrian who had been across the street buying a newspaper by daybreak when the fire was declared under control the black muslim mosque and the gethsemane church of god in christ on the floor beneath it were gutted and seven streetlevel stores including the black muslim restaurant were total losses fire department sources said that replacing the ruined equipment would cost around 50000 joseph x of the black muslims who once had been the immediate assistant of malcolm x said that elijah muhammads followers had two alternative mosques to meet in one in brooklyn and the other in queens long island both these mosques were under continuous police guard

across the nation in san francisco on tuesday afternoon two policemen discovered a fire beginning in the san francisco black muslim mosque and quickly extinguished it kerosene had been splashed on the sidewalk and door and set afire

the body of elhajj malik elshabazz originally had been scheduled to go on public view at 230 pm tuesday crowds stood in line behind police barricades waiting to be admitted and the policemen wherever one looked included numerous patrol cars and even sharpshooters on the roofs around the unity funeral home but the telephoned bomb threats which had begun shortly after noon made necessary two evacuations of the funeral home for bombsquad searches which proved futile a search was conducted even in the 43rd street offices of the new york times after a man telephoned complaining of an editorial about malcolm x and said your plant will be destroyed at four oclock

at the funeral home in harlem policemen inspected all packages and floral pieces being delivered as well as the large handbags of women mourners it was 615 pm when a cordon of policemen arrived flanking sister betty and four close relatives and friends who entered the funeral home in a glare of flashbulbs shes a black jacqueline kennedy observed a white reporter she has class she knows what to do and when she handles herself beautifully

it was 710 pm when the family party emerged and left after ten minutes the first of the waiting public was admitted between then and an hour before midnight two thousand people including scores of whites had filed past the open coffin in which the body lay dressed in a dark business suit a white shirt and dark tie with a small oblong brass plate above it inscribed elhajj malik elshabazz  may 19 1925  feb 21 1965


malcolm x followers had been canvassing with growing anxiety for a harlem church that would accept the saturday funeral officials of several churches had refused including a spokesman for the communitys largest church abyssinian baptist of which congressmanreverend adam clayton powell is the pastor others which turned down requests according to the amsterdam news included the williams cme church and the refuge temple of the church of our lord jesus christ then the funeral was accepted by bishop alvin a childs for the faith temple church of god in christ located at 147th street and amsterdam avenue the faith temple a former movie theater which had been converted fifteen years previously could seat a thousand in its auditorium and another seven hundred in its basement bishop childs who in 1964 had been elected as harlems locality mayor told the press that it was as a humanitarian gesture that he made his church available and of malcolm x he said    a militant and vocal person i did not agree with all of his philosophy but this did not affect our friendship shortly after the news became known bishop childs and his wife began to receive the first of a succession of bomb threats telephoned both to the church and to their home

prominent negro figures were being quoted by the various press media the famed psychologist dr kenneth b clark told jet magazine i had a deep respect for this man i believe that he was sincerely groping to find a place in the fight for civil rights on a level where he would be respected and understood fully i looked forward to his growth along those lines it doesnt matter so much about his past it is tragic that he was cut down at the point when he seemed on the verge of achieving the position of respectability he sought a new york times correspondent in a london press conference quoted the author and dramatist james baldwin who thought the death of malcolm x was a major setback for the negro movement pointing at white reporters baldwin accused you did it    whoever did it was formed in the crucible of the western world of the american republic european rape of africa began racial problems and was therefore the beginning of the end for malcolm x baldwin said

the bookstore owner in harlem louis michaux a major voice in the community told the amsterdam news its things like the murder of malcolm x that drive the masses closer together he died in the same manner that patrice lumumba met his death in the congo    we must unite not fight

malcolm x caused many young negroes to take a new vision of themselves said bayard rustin a main figure in organizing the march on washington in 1963 a third party was suspected of killing malcolm x by cores national director james farmer who said malcolms murder was calculated to produce more violence and murder and vengeance killings a few days later asked for his opinion of a rumor circulating about that a red chinese plot brought about the murder farmer said i would not say it is impossible

for the negroes in america the death of malcolm x is the most portentous event since the deportation of marcus garvey in the 1920s said dr c eric lincoln author of the black muslims in america who talked to the press at brown university in providence ri where he was a visiting professor and research fellow i doubt there are international implications in the slaying the answer is closer to home the answer is in the local struggle among contending rivals for leadership of the black masses which are potentially the most volatile subgroup in america said roy wilkins executive secretary of the national association for the advancement of colored people master spellbinder that he was malcolm x in death cast a spell more farflung and more disturbing than any he cast in life

the new york city police investigators who were pursuing the case were unhappy that malcolms followers had not come forward to aid the investigation at police request the press printed a telephone number sw 58117 for strictly confidential information that anyone might offer concerning the slaying the police had picked up and were holding reuben francis described as a malcolm x bodyguard who was believed to be the person who had shot the suspected assassin talmadge hayer during the melee the previous sunday at the audubon ballroom hayer remained in the bellevue prison ward awaiting surgery

as thousands continued viewing the body of the slain malcolm x amid intermittent new bomb threats telephoned to the funeral home and to the faith temple where his funeral was scheduled for saturday a new organization the federation of independent political action threatened to picket all harlem business establishments which would not close from thursday afternoon until monday morning in tribute to malcolm x the fipas spokesman was jesse gray the wellknown rentstrike leader harlem pedestrians began to be handed printed sheets reading in part if the stores refuse to close they identify with our enemy  therefore we must close them  pass them by those that shop along 125th street during the hours that the stores are to be closed identify with the murderous stooge that allowed the power structure to use his hands to kill brother malcolm at a late evening fipa rally before louis michauxs bookstore jesse gray declared that in 1965 a negro should run for mayor of new york in the name of malcolm and speculated that such a candidate should receive 100000 votes shortly after the fipa rally merchants and other members of the uptown chamber of commerce met and swiftly passed a resolution urging all harlem stores to remain open and continue to serve their customers and recommendation was made that full pay be given to any store employees who might wish to attend malcolm xs funeral on saturday morning then one after another harlem leaders sharply criticized the fipa proposal as irresponsible finally nearly all of the harlem stores kept their doors open for business the fipa got together about twenty pickets who patrolled for a while before harlems largest store blumsteins leading the pickets were two white men carrying signs reading all stores should close honor malcolm x

the weather had turned very cold icicles hung from the collapsed roof of the fireruined building that had housed black muslim mosque number 7 the amsterdam news its offices barely a block down eighth avenue from the funeral home where malcolm xs body lay editorialized steady eddie saying that orderly tributes to malcolm x would confound his critics who would like nothing better than to see black people rioting over his remains

the fear of serious mass rioting set off by some unpredictable spark hung steadily in the air an increasing number of harlem leaders declared that the principal reason for this was the downtown white press media sensationalizing what was going on in a calm dignified community finally the harlem ministers interfaith association would issue a formal accusation the screaming headlines of many of our newspapers make it seem as if all of harlem was an armed camp ready to explode at any moment the vast majority of the citizens of the harlem community is not involved in the unfortunate acts of violence that have been grossly overplayed by the press many times the slanting of the news is able to bring about an atmosphere through which a few depraved and reckless individuals can take advantage

malcolm x died broke  that headline in harlems amsterdam news came as a shock to many in the community few had reflected that malcolm x upon becoming a black muslim minister had signed an oath of poverty so that for twelve years he never acquired anything in his own name somewhere i have read that malcolm x in his black muslim days received about 175 weekly to cover his living and other expenses exclusive of travel he left his four daughters and pregnant wife with no insurance of any kind no savings and no income the amsterdam news story said and it might have added that he never drew up a will he had made a february 26th appointment with his lawyer  five days after his death within the week two groups had organized and were asking harlemites for contributions to help sister betty raise and educate the children since organized as the malcolm x daughters fund at harlems freedom national bank 275 west 125th street

in boston malcolm xs halfsister mrs ella mae collins told a news conference that she would choose the leaders of the oaau to succeed malcolm x mrs collins operated the sarah a little school of preparatory arts where she said children were taught arabic swahili french and spanish in 1959 she too had broken away from elijah muhammads black muslims to which she had originally been converted by malcolm x

far from harlem in lands where malcolm x had traveled the press had given the murder a coverage that had highly irritated the director of the united states information agency carl t rowan himself a negro in washington addressing the american foreign service association rowan said that when he first heard of the murder he knew it would be grossly misconstrued in some countries where people were unaware what malcolm x represented and he said the usia had worked hard to inform the african press of the facts about malcolm x and his preachments but still there had been a host of african reaction based on misinformation and misrepresentation

said usia director rowan mind you here was a negro who preached segregation and race hatred killed by another negro presumably from another organization that preaches segregation and race hatred and neither of them representative of more than a tiny minority of the negro population of america   rowan held up some foreign newspapers all this about an exconvict exdope peddler who became a racial fanatic continued rowan i can only conclude that we americans know less about what goes on in the minds of other peoples than we thought or the need to inform is even greater than we in usia thought it to be

the daily times of lagos in nigeria had said like all mortals malcolm x was not without his faults    but that he was a dedicated and consistent disciple of the movement for the emancipation of his brethren no one can doubt    malcolm x has fought and died for what he believed to be right he will have a place in the palace of martyrs the ghanaian times accra called malcolm x the militant and most popular of afroamerican antisegregationist leaders and it added his name to a host of africans and americans ranging from john brown to patrice lumumba who were martyred in freedoms cause also in accra the daily graphic the assassination of malcolm x will go down in history as the greatest blow the american integrationist movement has suffered since the shocking assassinations of medgar evers and john f kennedy

the pakistan hurriyet of karachi said a great negro leader the pakistan times said his death is a definite setback to the negro movement for emancipation the peking china peoples daily said the killing happened because malcolm x    fought for the emancipation of the 23000000 american negroes according to correspondents reports the first algerian headline said the ku klux klan assassinated malcolm x the procommunist alger republicans editorial on the slaying accused american fascism and the times algerian correspondent said algerians showed signs of raising malcolm x to martyrdom the us consulate in georgetown british guiana was marched on by pickets accusing american imperialists another peking china paper jenmin jihpao said that the death showed that in dealing with imperialist oppressors violence must be met with violence pravda in moscow carried only brief stories and no editorial comment the new york times moscow correspondent said and another in poland said there was no noticeable reaction of any kind and that few poles had heard of malcolm or were interested in the racial issue reportedly the murder was only routinely reported with little special interest by the press in cairo beirut new delhi and saigon in paris and western europe the story was essentially a oneday sensation with the west german press handling it as if it were in the chicago gangster tradition the new york times said the london newspapers have probably played the story harder and longer than most giving continuing emphasis to the police work on the murder the london times and the london daily telegraph both carried editorial comments but neither treated malcolm x as a major figure also reported by the new york times london correspondent was that a london group calling itself the council of african organizations had violently attacked the united states over the murder this group is made up of students and other unofficial african representatives here a press release described malcolm as a leader in the struggle against american imperialism oppression and racialism it said the butchers of patrice lumumba are the very same monsters who have murdered malcolm x in cold blood

friday morning new york city press headlines concerning malcolm xs slaying were devoted to the police departments apprehension of a second slaying suspect he was a stocky roundfaced twentysixyearold karate expert named norman 3x butler allegedly a black muslim and a week later this was followed by the arrest of thomas 15x johnson also allegedly a black muslim both men had been earlier indicted in the january 1965 shooting of benjamin brown a new york city correction officer and a black muslim defector both men were indicted along with hayer for the murder of malcolm x on march 10

with the news announcement of butlers arrest and his at least tentative identification as a member of elijah muhammads organization tension reached a new high among all who had any role in the feud the black muslim national convention was scheduled to begin that friday in chicago to last for three days early friday morning in new york at the kennedy airport dozens of policemen spent forty minutes searching a plane belonging to capital airlines which back in december 1964 had accepted a mosque number 7 charter flight to chicago and return at a fee of 517554 which the mosque had subsequently paid in increments

altogether about three thousand black muslims from their mosques in most sizable cities were in chicago for their annual saviours day convention regarded by them as similar to the holiday of christmas in the order of arrival each group from the different mosques and cities assembled outside the big sports coliseum south of chicagos business district the brothers of all ages dressed in neat dark suits and white shirts and the sisters garbed in flowing silk gowns and headdresses  and every individual was filtered through an intense security check that chicago police sources said was unprecedented in chicago except for a visiting president

searched even more closely were the relatively few nonmuslim negroes who came to be spectators and the press representatives both white and black take off your hat show some respect snapped a black muslim guard at a white reporter as each person was cleared a fruit of islam man ushered him or her to a specific seat in the drafty interior of the 7500seat coliseum later muslim sources would blame the halffull house upon the white mans dividing of negroes but observers who recalled the packed coliseum in 1964 said that bombing fears kept away many nonmuslim negroes the audience sat lightly murmuring under the two huge hanging banners proclaiming welcome elijah muhammad  we are glad to have you with us and we must have some of this land referring to elijah muhammads demand that one or more states be turned over to the 23 million socalled negroes in america as partial reparation for over a century of our free blood and sweat as slaves which helped to develop this wealthy nation where still today you show us you do not wish or intend to accept us as equals in front of the wide raised speakers platform were two nearly lifesized photographic blowups of elijah muhammad standing between the stage and the audience were fruit of islam guards others were prowling the aisles scanning rows of faces with intermittent peremptory demands for identification what mosque brother still more fruit of islam men were inspecting the coliseums vacant balcony backstage downstairs and rafters and roof

the ghost of malcolm x was in the coliseum first in a high drama for the muslims elijah muhammads son wallace delaney muhammad who once had sided with malcolm x faced the audience and begged forgiveness for his defection next two brothers of malcolm x wilfred and philbert both of them black muslim ministers urged unity with elijah muhammad said minister wilfred x of the detroit mosque we would be ignorant to get confused and go to arguing and fighting among ourselves and forget who the real enemy is said minister philbert x of the lansing mosque malcolm was my own blood brother next to me    i was shocked no man wants to see his own brother destroyed but i knew that he was traveling on a very reckless and dangerous road i made attempts to change his course when he was living i tried to keep him living now that he is dead there is nothing i can do indicating the seated elijah muhammad minister philbert x declared where he leads me i will follow  and then he introduced the black muslim leader to make his address

only the head of elijah muhammad was visible above the grimfaced fruit of islam men in a living wall cassius clay among them crescents stars moons and suns were in gold thread embroidery on the small fez that elijah muhammad wore he said in his speech for a long time malcolm stood here where i stand in those days malcolm was safe malcolm was loved god himself protected malcolm    for more than a year malcolm was given his freedom he went everywhere  asia europe africa even to mecca trying to make enemies for me he came back preaching that we should not hate the enemy    he came here a few weeks ago to blast away his hate and mudslinging everything he could think of to disgrace me    we didnt want to kill malcolm and didnt try to kill him they know i didnt harm malcolm they know i loved him his foolish teaching brought him to his own end    

both physically and emotionally worked up often elijah muhammad would begin coughing take it easy take your time his audience pleaded with him he had no right to reject me elijah muhammad declared he was a star who went astray    they knew i didnt harm malcolm but he tried to make war against me he said that malcolm x would have been given the most glorious of burials if he had stayed with the black muslims and had died a natural death instead we stand beside the grave of a hypocrite    malcolm who was he leading who was he teaching he has no truth we didnt want to kill malcolm his foolish teaching would bring him to his own end i am not going to let the crackpots destroy the good things allah sent to you and me

elijah muhammad drove his frail energy to speak for about an hour and a half he challenged any wouldbe assassins if you seek to snuff out the life of elijah muhammad you are inviting your own doom the holy quran tells us not to pick a fight but to defend ourselves we will fight it was midafternoon when elijah muhammad turned back to his seat with some three thousand black muslim men women and children shouting yes sir    so sweet    all praise to muhammad

in the unity funeral home in the harlem community of new york city in the midafternoon the publics viewing of the body of malcolm x was interrupted by the arrival of a party of about a dozen people whose central figure was a whiteturbaned darkrobed elderly man whose white beard fell to his chest and who carried a forked stick when reporters rushed to attempt interviews another man in the party waved them away saying a silent tongue does not betray its owner the man was sheik ahmed hassoun a sudanese a member of the sunni moslems who had taught in mecca for thirtyfive years when he had met malcolm x there and then had soon come to the united states to serve as malcolm xs spiritual advisor and to teach at the muslim mosque inc

sheik hassoun prepared the body for burial in accordance with moslem ritual removing the western clothing in which the body had been on display sheik hassoun washed the body with special holy oil then he draped the body in the traditional seven white linen shrouds called the kafan only the face with its reddish mustache and goatee was left exposed the mourners who had come with sheik hassoun filed to the bier and he read passages from the koran then he turned to a funeral home representative now the body is ready for burial soon the sheik and his retinue left and the viewing by the public resumed when the word spread numbers of persons who had come before returned for another wait in the long slowly moving line wanting to see the moslem burial dress

it was late during this friday afternoon that i got into the quietly moving line thinking about the malcolm x with whom i had worked closely for about two years blueuniformed policemen stood at intervals watching us shuffle along within the wooden graypainted police barricades just across the street several men were looking at the line from behind a large side window of the lone star barber shop eddie johns prop william ashe mgr among the policemen were a few press representatives talking to each other to pass the time then we were inside the softly lit hushed cool large chapel standing at either end of the long handsome bronze coffin were two big dark policemen mostly looking straight ahead but moving their lips when some viewer tarried within minutes i had reached the coffin under the glass lid i glimpsed the delicate white shrouding over the chest and up like a hood about the face on which i tried to concentrate for as long as i could all i could think was that it was he all right  malcolm x move on  the policemans voice was soft malcolm looked to me  just waxy and dead the policemans hand was gesturing at his waist level i thought well  goodbye i moved on

twentytwo thousand people had viewed the body when the line was stopped that night for good at eleven pm quietly between midnight and dawn a dozen police cars flanked a hearse that went the twentyodd blocks farther uptown to the faith temple the bronze coffin was wheeled inside and placed upon a platform draped in thick dark red velvet in front of the altar and the coffins lid was reopened as the hearse pulled away policemen stood at posts of vigil both inside and outside faith temple it was crispy cold outside

about six am people began forming a line on the east side of amsterdam avenue by nine am an estimated six thousand persons thronged the nearby blocks behind police barriers and faces were in every window of the apartment buildings across the street some stood shivering on fire escapes from 145th street to 149th street policemen had blocked off all automobile traffic except for their own cars the newspapers cars and the equipment trucks for radio and television onthespot coverage there were hundreds of policemen some on the rooftops in the immediate area combing the crowds edges were reporters with microphones and notebooks he was fascinating a remarkably fascinating man thats why im here a white girl in her midtwenties told a new york times man and a negro woman im paying my respects to the greatest black man in this century hes a black man dont say colored another woman noticing steel helmets inside a television network car laughed to the driver you getting ready for next summer

when the faith temple doors were opened at 920 a corps of oaau members entered within the next quarterhour twenty of the men had ushered in six hundred seatholders fifty press reporters photographers and television cameramen clustered beneath religious murals to the rear of the altar and some stood on chairs to see better a negro engineer monitored recording equipment between the altar and the coffin which was guarded by eight uniformed negro policemen and two uniformed negro policewomen one negro plainclothes policeman sat on either side of heavily veiled sister betty in the second row the raised lid of the coffin hid the faith temples brass tithe box and candelabra the head of the islamic mission of america in brooklyn sheik alhaj daoud ahmed faisal had counseled that any hint of christianity in the services would make the deceased a kafir an unbeliever the sheik had also dissented with the days of public exhibition of the body death is a private matter between allah and the deceased

before the services began oaau ushers brought in one floral wreath  a twobyfive arrangement of the islamic star and crescent in white carnations against a background of red carnations

first the actor ossie davis and his wife actress ruby dee read the notes telegrams and cables of condolence they came from every major civil rights organization from individual figures such as dr martin luther king from organizations and governments abroad such as the africapakistanwestindian society of the london school of economics the panafrican congress of southern africa the nigerian ambassador from lagos the president of the republic of ghana dr kwame nkrumah the death of malcolm x shall not have been in vain

next omar osman stood a representative of the islam center of switzerland and the united states we knew brother malcolm as a blood brother particularly after his pilgrimage to mecca last year the highest thing that a moslem can aspire to is to die on the battlefield and not die at his bedside  he paused briefly to wait out the applause from among the mourners those who die on the battlefield are not dead but are alive the applause was louder and cries rose right right omar osman then critically commented upon the remarks which usia director carl rowan had made in washington dc about the foreign press reaction to the death of the deceased from the audience then hisses rose

again the actor ossie davis stood his deep voice delivered the eulogy to malcolm x which was going to cause davis subsequently to be hailed more than ever among negroes in harlem

here  at this final hour in this quiet place harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its brightest hopes  extinguished now and gone from us forever   

many will ask what harlem finds to honor in this stormy controversial and bold young captain  and we will smile    they will say that he is of hate  a fanatic a racist  who can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle

and we will answer and say unto them did you ever talk to brother malcolm did you ever touch him or have him smile at you did you ever really listen to him did he ever do a mean thing was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance for if you did you would know him and if you knew him you would know why we must honor him malcolm was our manhood our living black manhood this was his meaning to his people and in honoring him we honor the best in ourselves    and we will know him then for what he was and is  a prince  our own black shining prince  who didnt hesitate to die because he loved us so

brief speeches were made by others then the family the oaau members and other muslims present stood and filed by the coffin to view the body for the last time finally the two plainclothes policemen ushered sister betty to have her last sight of her husband she leaned over kissing the glass over him she broke into tears until then almost no crying had been heard in the services but now sister bettys sobs were taken up by other women

the services had lasted a little over an hour when the three minutes of prayers said for every muslim who is dead were recited by alhajj heshaam jaaber of elizabeth new jersey at the phrase allahu akbar  god is most great  all muslims in the audience placed their opened hands at the sides of their faces

an official cortege with the hearse of three family cars eighteen mourners cars twelve police cars and six press cars  followed by about fifty other cars  briskly drove the eighteen miles out of manhattan and along the new york thruway then off its exit 7 to reach the ferncliff cemetery in ardsley ny all along the route negroes placed their hats or hands over their hearts paying their final respects at each bridge crossing to manhattan police cars stood watch the westchester county police had stationed individual patrolmen at intervals en route to the cemetery

over the coffin final moslem prayers were said by sheik alhajj heshaam jaaber the coffin was lowered into the grave the head facing the east in keeping with islamic tradition among the mourners the moslems knelt beside the grave to pray with their foreheads pressed to the earth in the eastern manner when the family left the gravesite followers of malcolm x would not let the coffin be covered by the white gravediggers who had stood a little distance away waiting instead seven oaau men began dropping bare handfuls of earth down on the coffin then they were given shovels and they carried dirt to fill the grave and then mound it

the night fell over the earthly remains of elhajj malik elshabazz who had been called malcolm x who had been called malcolm little who had been called big red and satan and homeboy and other names  who had been buried as a moslem according to the koran the new york times reported the bodies of the dead remain in their graves until the last day the day of judgment on this day of cataclysm the heavens are rent and the mountains ground to dust the graves open and men are called to account by allah

the blessed  the godfearing the humble the charitable those who have suffered and been persecuted for allahs sake or fought in religious wars for islam  are summoned to the garden of paradise

there according to the teaching of mohammed the prophet they live forever by flowing streams reclining on silken cushions and enjoying the company of darkeyed maidens and wives of perfect purity

the damned  the covetous the evildoer the follower of gods other than allah  are sent to eternal fire where they are fed boiling water and molten brass the death from which ye flee will truly overtake you the koran says then will ye be sent back to the knower of things secret and open and he will tell you the truth of the things that ye did

after signing the contract for this book malcolm x looked at me hard a writer is what i want not an interpreter i tried to be a dispassionate chronicler but he was the most electric personality i have ever met and i still cant quite conceive him dead it still feels to me as if he has just gone into some next chapter to be written by historians
