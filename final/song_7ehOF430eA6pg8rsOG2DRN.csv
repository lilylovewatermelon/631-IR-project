its better than sippin something strong
the way my name rolls off your tongue
the way the light it hits your eyes and makes me come alive
it moves me more than any song
when you got that shade of lipstick on
across the room or by my side

chorus
baby i can feel my heartbeat heartbeat
pound in my chest
you in that dress
makin it jump like a kick drum on repeat on repeat
i love the way you make my heartbeat heartbeat
theres no mistakin
right now its racin
every time that you get close to me close to me
baby i can feel my heartbeat

verse 2
you make me feel like i could fly
like some old rollercoaster ride
the way you flip your hair
oh girl it gets me every time
you drive me that perfect kind of crazy

and baby i can feel my heartbeat heartbeat
pound in my chest
you in that dress
makin it jump like a kick drum on repeat on repeat
i love the way you make my heartbeat heartbeat
theres no mistakin
right now its racin
every time that you get close to me close to me
baby i can feel my heartbeat

bridge
in the middle of the floor were swayin
and your favourite song is playin

chorus
i can feel your heartbeat heartbeat
pound in your chest
there in that dress
makin it jump like a kick drum on repeat
i love the way you make my heartbeat heartbeat
theres no mistakin
right now its racin
every time that you get close to me close to me
baby i can feel my heartbeat heartbeat heartbeat heartbeat

baby i can feel your heartbeat heartbeat heartbeat heartbeat
baby i can feel our hearts beat1embed"
