i used to take your breath away
i used to make your laugh about anything
i used to be your getaway
your getaway your dream i was every thing you needed
you used to lean your eyes on me
you used to open up and share your world
you used to lose yourself in me
let the hours pass all running by so fast

prechorus
but now what im doing
i dont know what im doing

chorus
cause i dont even feel it
bodies growing colder with the distance now
and i dont even mean it
got my hands all over you but not a sound
im always so in love all in
til i start going numb thinking
thought youd make me feel it
thought that id be different this time around
this time around

verse 2
we started out as lonely hearts
we started with a promise built on highs
you said i was the missing part
looked into my eyes said youre my fix for life
