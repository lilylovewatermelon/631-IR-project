verse 1 trippie redd
yeah big blunts i like to roast up

chillin with the gang i like to post up
get up off the block if i dont know you
you dealin with some soldiers that ride with the motherfuckin pole bruh
i ride with the motherfuckin pole bruh
i rise with the motherfuckin pole bruh
and you know a motherfucker pop a sealy pop a pilly
pop a nigga head like amoxicillin
im a villain really dont show no pity
im high saditty to these bitches

and if you dont like it then fuck nigga eat a ittybitty cock yeah
eenymeenymineymoe catch a thottie by her toe

verse 2 chris king
i stack the paper like a binder she slimy she not a rider
a nigga got bars whos your service provider
still searching for a lighter too many that sound just like us
we get rewarded for the likeness get too many plaques like gingivitis
got the touch like king midas i eat the beat i get the itis
createaplayer i ball its like i turned up all the sliders
okay pop a sealy like amoxicillin
when i pop the trigger drop a nigga
then he shook his body like a macarena
mop a stranger he was starin straight catchin improper angles
god cant save you slap my bitch from the back call it palms angels
i bet when a nigga hop up bitches theyll be all angry
i told trippie three years ago that this game was ours nigga
bathing ape face mask like these rappers got sars nigga
i be in the background you can see that im a star nigga
i got where i am being exactly who i are nigga
you aint protected at the garage out your car nigga
im the bomb just like a warhead go to war just like a jarhead
give this dog a bone and think i wasnt gon catch it like that shit was farfetched
young nigga stayin on point just like a bayonet
we rollin top down bummin on the main street then i sprayed the vette
just a young nigga but i been doin it for so long they gotta praise the vet
for my niggas on lockdown and the crimies that really plead the fifth
pourin lean inside the booth yeah i am multitasking make multimillions
