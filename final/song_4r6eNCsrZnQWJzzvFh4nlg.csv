do you ever feel like a plastic bag
drifting through the wind wanting to start again
do you ever feel feel so paperthin
like a house of cards one blow from cavin in
do you ever feel already buried deep
six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
do you know that theres still a chance for you
cause theres a spark in you

prechorus
you just gotta ignite the light
and let it shine
just own the night
like the fourth of july

chorus
cause baby youre a firework
come on show em what youre worth
make em go awe awe awe
as you shoot across the skyyy
baby youre a firework
come on let your colors burst
make em go awe awe awe
youre gonna leave em all in awe awe awe

you dont have to feel like a waste of space
youre original cannot be replaced
if you only knew what the future holds
after a hurricane comes a rainbow
maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
so you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
like a lightning bolt your heart will glow
and when its time youll know

prechorus
you just gotta ignite the light
and let it shine
just own the night
like the fourth of july

chorus
cause baby youre a firework
come on show em what youre worth
make em go awe awe awe
as you shoot across the skyyy
baby youre a firework
come on let your colors burst
make em go awe awe awe
youre gonna leave em all in awe awe awe

boom boom boom
even brighter than the moon moon moon

and now its time to let it thrououough

chorus
cause baby youre a firework
come on show em what youre worth
make em go awe awe awe
as you shoot across the skyyy
