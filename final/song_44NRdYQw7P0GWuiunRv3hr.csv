ive told you this once before
cant control me
if you try to take me down
youre gonna break
i feel your every nothing
that youre doin for me
im thinking you oughta
make your own way

chorus
i stand alone
inside
i stand alone
stand alone stand alone

verse 2
youre always hiding behind
your socalled goddess
so what you dont think
that we can see your face
resurrected back before
the final falling
ill never rest until
i can make my own way

im not afraid of fading

chorus
i stand alone
feeling your sting down inside me
im not dying for it
i stand alone
everything that i believe is fading
i stand alone
inside
i stand alone

bridge
and now its my time now its my time
its my time to dream its my time to dream
dream of the skies dream of the skies
make me believe that this place
isnt plagued by the poison in me
and help me decide if my fire will burn out
before you can breathe
breathe into me

chorus
i stand alone inside
i stand alone
i stand alone
feeling your sting down inside me
im not dying for it
i stand alone
everything that i believe is fading
i stand alone inside
i stand alone inside
i stand alone inside
i stand alone inside7embed"
