every part of my memory
lives inside a night when you were mine
round and round
the feeling is beating now
still running down
still running down
its playing all the time

prechorus
your song remains the same
spinning on the airwaves

chorus
i am the dj
and you are the record that i play
and when i scratch the surface
does it still make you nervous
i am the dj
and youre still my favorite mistake
so when you get that feeling
keep dancing
keep dancing
cause i am the dj
i am the dj

every beautiful melody
is tuned to say i miss you when youre gone
sing to me sing to me sweetly
before the music dies
and were left with fragments of a song

prechorus
your song remains the same
still spinning on the airwaves

chorus
i am the dj
and you are the record that i play
and when i scratch the surface
does it still make you nervous
i am the dj
and youre still my favorite mistake
so when you get that feeling
keep dancing
keep dancing

bridge
nevermind i hear you all the time
lovely and amazing and completely underwhelmed
tell me why you switched to satellite
the records in your hands
please play my song again
every part of my memory
lives inside the night

chorus
i am the dj
and you are the record that i play
and when i scratch the surface
does it still make you nervous
i am the dj
and youre still my favorite mistake
so when you get that feeling
keep dancing
keep dancing
cause i am the dj
i am the dj
i am the dj
i am the dj
i am the dj
i am the dj
i am the djembed"
