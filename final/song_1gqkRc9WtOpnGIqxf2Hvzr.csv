verse 1 kanye west
yeezy season approachin
fuck whatever yall been hearin
fuck what fuck whatever yall been wearin
a monster about to come alive again
soon as i pull up and park the benz
we get this bitch shaking like parkinsons
take my number and lock it in
indian hair no moccasins
its too many hoes in this house of sin
real nigga back in the house again
black timbs all on your couch again
black dick all in your spouse again
and i know she like chocolate men
she got more niggas off than cochran hah

verse 2 kanye west
baby girl tryna get a nut
and her girl tryna give it up

thats when david grutman kicked her out
