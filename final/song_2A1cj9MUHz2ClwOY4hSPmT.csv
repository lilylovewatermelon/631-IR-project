who knows how long ive been lost in the dark
followed closely by the footsteps of my failures
what can i do to alter my perception
of the way and the truth

hook 1
let this burden drift away

verse 2
who knows how long the void has swallowed me
i only wish for nothing more than peace to find me
how can this be weve come so far
to let the weight destroy our grand design

hook 2
let this burden drift away
my pledge remains faithful to you

prechorus
and my heart still beats your name

chorus
drowning once again
will i live another day
to reach the surface
let this burden drift away

drowning once again
will i live another day
to reach the surface
let this burden drift away

bridge
drowning choking fading life
is this the moment where i leave the blackness
is this the moment of my rebirth

let this burden drift away

outro
drowning again
reach the surface
let it drift awayembed"
