aka  screwston  os and xs
and you plexas leavin in stretchers

swanger and a swerver
with a jar that say gurba
i aint the biggest im the baddest
servin dope addicts bad temper bad
manners and bad habits
it dont matter muthafucka if you need it
i can send them to the valley pick ‘em up and retrieve ‘em
association by affiliation
about to hit 200 on the freeway when you see me racing

in the hilla with my killa
blowin hogwa
see me comin in the benz or the jaguar
and them niggas say “uch thats a bad car”
young gangsta but heading like haggler
and tell them money aint the answer to your problem
got the monkey on my back and i cant drop ‘em
in the city where the cop can get wiggy
everybody do this to the piggy
if you want to sip one the remy
i appreciate the love that you give me
so tonight ima chill and write lyrics
and smoke dro with my girlfriends parents
follow me

im a screwston sipper
microphone ripper
ima come home with my shirt full of glitter
jump my 45er
race car driver
smoke so much kill i got no more saliva
love for the south sider and the north sider
i might accidently get you for your lighter
ima street fighter
some dont like the
boy that got more snow flake than tony the tiger
ima get a viper
who wants the benz
ima represent  suc and dead endz
fall in the place
fine hoes in my face
peace to engrando and the dh
love for the east side
and the south west
ecko on my chest
and i sit on the guess
packin my pump
pass me the blunt
fuck goin gold
im just trying to win the cannibus cup
what
