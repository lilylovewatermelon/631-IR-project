wishes bounce me weightless
the infrared scope on pointlessness
the bulls are sedated
and this fights fixed
dont feel bad for the suicidal cats
gotta kill themselves nine times before they get it right
the pa system keeps my heart heart
beatin tonight yeahâ€¦

chorus patrick stump and debbie harry
oh hell yes im a nervous wreck
oh hell yes the drugs just make me reset
knock once for the father twice for the son
three times for the holy ghost

verse 2 patrick stump
come on in the waters warm
come on in like a sugar cube but with a kick in the head
like putting wings on lead
and your eyes are blockin my starlight
im the last of my kind and thats all that should matter ttto you
follow the disorganized religion of my head
and well never get through customs lets just take off again instead
got my degree in the gutter my heart broken in the dorms of the ivy league
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus patrick stump and debbie harry
