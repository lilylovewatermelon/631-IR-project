well it mustve been 100 in that summer sun
and ive been in it all day
putting up with that prick of an owners son
making me some hillbilly pay

working right through lunch busting my hump
helping his daddy stay rich
so when he kept me behind to pull some overtime
i told that little son of a bitch

prechorus
hey ive been punching your clock giving all i got
putting up with your pain in the rear
adios im done you can find me son
between a hottie and an ice cold beer

chorus
hey ive been breaking my hump but its never enough
arenâ€™t a part of me that doesnt hurt
hey but lucky for me you can easily see
i still got a finger that works

verse 2
yea ive been dragging home almost every night
bout the time that youre going out
wearing something way too short and tight
leaving me and the dog on a couch
see blake shelton liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeyea now words getting round youve been sneaking downtown
dancing way too risky
well i got a few dirty dance moves too
and a cute little one finger wave
