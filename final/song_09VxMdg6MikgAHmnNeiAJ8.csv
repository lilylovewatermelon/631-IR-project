yes i am
i hope you think you read me
hope i start talking crazy before you understand me
are we through
you think that im beneath you
but you like the things that i do
wrap em up and take em with you

verse 2
im alright hope i can sleep for one night
if not to cool my insides
maybe to calm my backside
rain on me i got a weakness in me
i think that weakness feeds me
i dont think you think you need me

prechorus 1
sunshine youre the best time
i ever ever had
but i think i made you feel bad
the black fly on your necktie
time after time

chorus
but when the sun starts sinkin on your beautiful soul
make me cry cry baby make you feel so cold
dont you know its alright
sometimes you just got to show how you feel
cause thats you baby
hell youre so real
see matchbox twenty liveget tickets as low as 77you might also likeverse 3
run this round in your head
like you dont know whats on the inside
you dont know me too well
you aint seen my bad side
shame on me shame on the things that id be
if you could complicate me
if you could get inside me

prechorus 2
sometimes youre the best time
ive ever ever known
a pretty girl with a wicked smile on
but ive cried for the last time
something just dont feel right

chorus
and when the sun starts sinkin on your beautiful soul
make me cry cry baby make you feel so cold
dont you know its alright
sometimes you just got to show how you feel
cause thats you baby
hell youre so real

bridge
you always know just who you are
you never needed someone else
to realize yourself
chorus
and when the sun starts sinkin on your beautiful soul
make me cry cry baby make you feel so cold
dont you know its alright
sometimes you just got to show how you feel
cause thats you baby
hell youre so real
