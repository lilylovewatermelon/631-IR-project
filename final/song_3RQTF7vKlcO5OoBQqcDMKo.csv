with one or two i get used to the room
we go slow when we first make our moves
by five or six bring you out to the car
number nine with my head on the bar
and its sad but true out of cash and ious
i got desperate desires and unadmirable plans
my tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent
bring you back to the bar get you out of the cold
my sober straight face gets you out of your clothes
and theyre scared that we know all the crimes theyll commit
who theyll kiss before they get home

chorus
i will lie awake and lie for fun
and fake the way i hold you
let you fall for every empty word i say

verse 2
barely conscious in the door where you stand
your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands
you laugh at every word trying hard to be cute
i almost feel sorry for what im gonna do
and your hair smells of smoke
who will cast the first stone
you can sin or spend the night all alone
brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
in the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone
youre using all your looks that youve thrown from the start
if you let me have my way i swear ill tear you apart
cause its all you can be
youre a drunk and youre scared
its ladies night all the girls drink for free

i will lie awake and lie for fun
and fake the way i hold you
let you fall for every empty word i say
