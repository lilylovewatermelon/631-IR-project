chorus
i seen the reap come
live my life i had to roll dice hmm
been through strife my heart is cold as ice hmm
double cup i pour a four tonight
hold tight low light but im so bright
how you trappin make it happen aint got no white
cold light cold sight had a pole fight
im a star im just hidden in the low light

verse 1
i just wanted my blue strips never wanted fame
seen bad bitches thatll fuck a lame
keep all my brothers like fraternities
she dont speak no englo like im overseas

i know they aint about to rat all on me
my dawgs tongue got the padlock
horsepower bought an engine just to mash out
im bout to smash out lean out the window with rags out yeah yeah

verse 2
i was starin at the stars seen a ufo
i was high i was high really high really high

i cant lie cant lie no lie no lie
i never force a bye im going up more high high
i remember when moms cried she wanted me to be law abiding
at his neck like a violin
got my brothers we aint buyin friends
it started feelin like my time again
stay strong dont fold dont bend
told her bend over ima buy this benz
