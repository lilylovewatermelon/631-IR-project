just a little longer
stall your mother
disregard your fathers words
close the laundry door
tiptoe across the floor
keep your clothes on
i got all that i can take
teach me how to use
the love that people say you made
stop your parents car
i just saw a shooting star
we can wish upon it
but we wont share the wish we made
but i cant keep no secrets
i wish that you would always stay
last night i dreamt the whole night long
i woke with a head full of songs
i spent the whole day
i wrote em down but its a shame
tonight ill burn the lyrics
cause every chorus was your name
see the avett brothers liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likebreak this tired old routine
and this time dont make me leave
i am a breathing time machine
ill take you all for a ride2embed"
