starting to see it in your eyes

and now id rather know ahead of time

chorus
you said i love you too fast
so much for that girl summer just started
and were already done

verse 1
yeah you say i led you on but you followed me
i follow one of your friends you unfollow me
then you block them so they cant see

i expected more from you honestly
said you want a simple life and thats not me
how you go from that to endin up with someone just like…

and be warm with me when its freezing outside
