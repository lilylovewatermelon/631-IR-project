there are no fingerprints deep under water
nothing to tie one to a crime
and if you seek vengeance
all you need are instruments of pain

verse 3
hold your breath swim and strain
smell the deth cant escape
blood will cloud and drift away
attract the murders of murmaids
its so cold they all know
what youve done you cant run
vengeance is the law for thee
a thousand leagues below the sea

verse 4
youve been tracked youve been seen
murdering their next of kin
ate their hearts drank their blood
washed your fins in blackened mud
try to swim try to hide
heart beats faster from inside
thought it was a big charade
your life is ended by murmaids
