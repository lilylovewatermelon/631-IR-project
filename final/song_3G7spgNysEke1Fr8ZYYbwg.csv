here here in the moonlight
hold me while i sing to you
my teenage sonata
of my love
eternally true
its written and filled with devotion
from deep in my heart
and with my teenage sonata
comes a prayer that well never part

and as long as we love it will stay
well hear it on our wedding day
whoaaaa

my lips can only kiss you
they can explain how you make me feel
but my teenage sonata
will tell you that my love is real
my love is real
my love is realyou might also like1embed"
