todays the macys day parade
the night of the livin dead is on its way
with a credit report for duty call
its a lifetime guarantee
stuffed in a coffin ten percent more free
red light special at the mausoleum

chorus
can give me somethin that i need
with satisfaction guaranteed to you
whats the consolation prize
economy sized dreams of hope

verse 2
when i was a kid i thought
i wanted all the things that i havent got
ohoh but i learned the hardest way
then i realized what it took
to tell the difference between thieves and crooks
a lesson learned to me and you

chorus
can give me somethin that i need
with satisfaction guaranteed
cause im thinkin bout a brand new hope
the one ive never known
cause now i know its all that i wanted
see green day liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeinterlude

chorus
whats the consolation prize
economy sized dreams of hope
can give me somethin that i need
with satisfaction guaranteed
cause im thinkin bout a brand new hope
the one ive never known and where it goes
and im thinkin bout the only road
the one ive never known and where it goes
and im thinkin bout a brand new hope
the one ive never known
cause now i know its all that i wanted7embed"
