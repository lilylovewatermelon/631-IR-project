woah woah
wowooah mmm

verse 1
if i could make a living from walking in the woods
you can bet id be sitting pretty good
high on a hill looking at a field downwind
if i could make a nickel off a turning em bass
never worry about the price of gas
id be wheeling and dealing and sittin there reeling em in

chorus
huntin fishin and lovin every day
thats the prayer that a country boy prays
thank god he made me this way
huntin fishin and lovin every day
early in the morning late in the evening
im getting red dirt rich and flint river paid
huntin and fishin and lovin every day

verse 2
id get a little farm pond bus
sound of gravel when im backin up
pulling the string on a nine point nine two stroke mercury
i love it when my baby wants to roll with me
throws her boots on climbs in a tree
tuckin her hair in my hat and shes ready to go
see luke bryan liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
we get to huntin fishin and lovin every day
thats the prayer that a country boy prays
thank god he made me this way
huntin fishin and lovin every day
early in the morning late in the evening
im getting red dirt rich flint river pay
huntin and fishin and lovin every day

bridge
so while yall are up there
breathin in that old dirty air
ill be down here knee deep in the muckalee
huntin fishin and lovin every day
i wanna see them tall pines sway
yall close them eyes
lets go there in our mind

chorus
huntin fishin and lovin every day
thats the prayer this country boy prays
thank god he made me this way
huntin fishin and lovin every day
black coffee in the morning dark whiskey in the evening
i get red dirt rich and flint river pay
huntin and fishin and lovin every day
come on
outro
wont you come along with me
wont you come along with me
i know you wanna see
huntin and fishin and lovin every day
