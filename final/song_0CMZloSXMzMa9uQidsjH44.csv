it ain’t backstage sex
it ain’t lines of cocaine on a private jet
it ain’t havin’ a posse full of hangers on following you around
it ain’t long hair tattoos playin’ too loud
no

it ain’t a middle finger on a tshirt
the establishments tryin’ to sell
it’s a guy with the balls who told the establishment
to go to hell
it ain’t about the money you make when a record gets sold
it’s about doin’ it for nothin’ cause it lives in your soul

that’s damn rock and roll
that’s damn rock and roll

it’s a rock through a window
it’s a riot in the street
it’s a rebel revolution
it’s fightin’ for pieces
burn baby burn
it’s a brick in the wall
it’s the first one to stand
and the last one to fall
it’s a hip shaking devil on the stage in tupelo
it’s doing what ya want instead of doin’ what your told
it’s a preacher burning records tellin’ folks they oughta pray
cause the shepherd bought a gibson and led the flock astray
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likethat’s damn rock and roll
give all ya got ‘till there ain’t nothin’ left
that’s damn rock and roll

the clash crashed the party
and the party got loud
and the party turned into an angry crowd
drowning demons feel no pain
found nirvana wasted shame
gone too soon just like a song
hendrix joplin what went wrong
need some answers right or wrong
need something to blame it on
blame it on
blame it on
blame it on
blame it on
blame it on
blame it on
blame it on
blame it on
blame it on
blame it on

that’s damn rock and roll
give all ya got till there ain’t nothing left
that’s damn rock and roll

another day in another town
loadin’ the stage and the lights and the sound
here they come boys
they’ve opened doors
count us off now craig
1 2 3 4

that’s damn rock and roll
give all ya got till there ain’t nothin left
that’s damn rock and roll
gather round ‘till you’ve broken a sweat
that’s damn rock
that’s damn rock and roll
rock and roll
rock and roll
rock and roll
rock and roll
