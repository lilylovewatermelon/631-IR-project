hey baby wont you take a little ride with me
have a look around see what we can see

come on baby i know shell float

chorus
well go rolling on the river of love
well go rolling on the river of love

verse 2
drift away from all these city lights
might rock a little bit so hold on tight
lets get carried away with the gentle flow
might get caught up in its undertow

chorus
well go rolling on the river of love
lets go rolling on the river of love

instrumental bridge

verse 3
i got a little ukulele let me sing you a song
got a stream of kisses about ten miles long
dancing on the water in the moonlight beach
sparkling down through the sea of dreams
