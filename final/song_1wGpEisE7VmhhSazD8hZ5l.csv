ill be your role model
dont leave the house tomorrow
i gotta meet with audemars
tell me what you want
you say you had enough cause my time aint enough
girl its never enough for you
but you can wait until after tomorrow
flawless lawless baby what you call this
if this shit dont involve money im off it
i can be your role model jimi hendrix
pop a pill with me before we end it

verse 1
no more ghosts wraiths or gt3s no
no more award shows no mtv no
so you always doubleback after you leave oh
bitch where you gon go after you been with me
i done seen it all fore i turned twentythree
i could teach you how to ball if you just let a nigga be
we be so high thats why we so lowkey
she wanna fly out with you lets make three

chorus
ill be your role model

but you can wait until after tomorrow
flawless lawless baby what you call this
if this shit dont involve money im off it
i can be your role model jimi hendrix
pop a pill with me before we end it

chorus
