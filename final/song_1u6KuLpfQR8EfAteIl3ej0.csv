verse 1
coming up i aint have much i wanted a lot
i had paper for a hooptie but i wanted a drop
so you know i had to make something out of nothing
like turn an empty spot into a crack spot pumping
hustled hard at nineteen i bought a benz i did
the older niggas really wasnt feeling the kid
trying to find where i live so they could run in my crib
but you cant hustle a hustler i peeped it and slid
back then niggas used to call me boo
in six months i sold a million gold tops on guy brewer
country came around hes into clapping and
country left same shit started happening
like he shot rob for some ends rob shot joe over some skins
cory shot you and we was friends money turned boys into men
the cycle never changes shit just starts again
