youve been gone for a long long time
youve been in the wind youve been on my mind
you are the purest soul ive ever known
in my life
take your time let the rivers guide you in
you know where you can find me again
ill be waiting here till the stars fall out
of the sky

verse 2
when you left i was far too young
to know youre worth more than the moon and the sun
you are still alive when i look to the sky
in the night
i would wait for a thousand years
i would sit right here by the lake my dear
you just let me know that youre coming home
and ill wait for you

bridge
years have gone but the pain is the same
i have passed my days by the sound of your name
well they say that youre gone and that i should move on
i wonder how do they know baby ohho

i wonder how do they know baby ohho
