i figured all the years we shared were proof enough
to extend my hand and help you
i know that getting started can be rough
enthused smile you seemed grateful
i felt real good about myself
thats until the day you showed me
you dont need anybody else

chorus
whyd you have to go
and make me say these things about you
whyd you have to turn around
after all that weve been through

verse 2
i figured all the memories were proof enough
to maybe open your eyes
from the people you think hold your trust
do you ever smile and find it shameful
cause you dont know who you are
i am glad you never told me
you needed anybody else

chorus
whyd you have to go
and make me say these things about you
whyd you have to turn around
after all that weve been through

what will you do
when theres no one to fall back on
i wont be there
ive learned my lesson
what will you do when theres no friends to fall back on
because theyve all been stepped on

chorus
whyd you have to go
and make me say these things about you
whyd you have to turn around
after all that weve been through
after all that weve been through
whyd you have to go
whyd you have to turn around
after all that weve been through

outro
what will you do
when theres no one to fall back onembed"
