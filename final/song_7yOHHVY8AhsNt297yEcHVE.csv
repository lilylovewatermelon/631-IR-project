our day has come
its drawn in the sky
so dont shed a tear now
be thankful for the time
life wouldnt be so precious dear
if there never was an end

chorus
children still play in the garden
dance as the sun slips away

verse 2
we stand on the edge now
weve come so far
and through all the dust it becomes clear
you will always be my heart
theres no death no end of time
when im facing it with you

chorus
children still play in the garden
dance as the sun slips away
not even stars last forever
cleanse us acid rain
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likebridge
stand near to me
dont look
be brave
over the blackened moon
im carrying you away
through the planets we fly

chorus
children still play in the garden
dance as the sun slips away
not even stars last forever
cleanse us acid rain

outro
send us home
send us home
send us home
send us home16embed"
