youre not easy to love no

why do you make it hard to love you
oh i hate it
cause if you really wanna be alone i
will throw my hands up cause baby i tried
but everything with you is so complicated

verse 1
sometimes i get you
sometimes i dont understand
sometimes i love you
sometimes its you i cant stand
sometimes i wanna hug you
sometimes i wanna push you away
most times i wanna kiss you
other times punch you in the face
cause every minute you start switching up
and you say things like you dont give a fuck
then i say im through with you take my heart from you
and you come running after me and baby im back with you oh
