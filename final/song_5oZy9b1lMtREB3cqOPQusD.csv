evened the scores then i let it all go fall apart fall apart
and every step forward put a little more sword in your heart yeah
looking sideways when i say im okay with the past with the past
but im afraid of what i might say if you ask

prechorus
gave you way too many chances you ran through em all
got everything i could want but it wasnt enough
nobody left for me to talk to nobody to call
got everything i could want but i still wanted more
yeah i still wanted more

chorus
theres not another way dont let me go
dont dig another grave today
ill make the same mistakes ill never know
who i was before i faded away
into the grey

verse 2
all of this time sittin inside sittin in the dark in the dark
and every night i can see why you could never stop yeah yeah
lying is hard and the truth comes out anyway anyway
youre going way too far gonna drop dead at this rate

got everything i could want but i still wanted more

dont dig another grave today
ill make the same mistakes ill never know
who i was before i faded away
into the grey
