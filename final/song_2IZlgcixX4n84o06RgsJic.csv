i got my mind on my money and that money on my mind
and bitches aint shit cause all they do is waste time
but i still love you baby i just gotta get my grind
and yeah i know you miss me cause i stay up on yo mind
and yeah i know im wrong and you tired of all my lies
but its all good baby gone and open up them thighs
and let me hit it good  and eat you like some apple pies
i know you love a nigga girl you aint gotta lie
and this is for the goddesses to play while they high
and you can sip my drink when yo mouth get dry
and yeah its medicated now you feelin like i
and she be like damn and she take a deep sigh
and shed away them tears girl you aint gotta cry
and stop with all that frontin cause i dont wanna say bye
she said okay and looked me right into my eyes
i know she wanna fuck she aint gotta say that line

hook
i ride around my city and she blowin up my phone
she dont want a nigga there but miss me when im gone
and i dont give a damn cause im gone off the strong
but a nigga head back cause i dont want her alone
i ride around my city and she blowin up my phone
she dont want a nigga there but miss me when im gone
and i dont give a damn cause im gone off the strong
but a nigga head back cause i dont want her alone

and thats why im rappin cause i wont make it dealin
and yeah she respect that thats why a nigga love her
she down with a nigga and she down for the struggle
and yeah thats my baby and she get it from her mother
but i dont be too close cause she know that i dont trust her
and if she ever cross me then she know its mothafuck em
and she be gettin drunk and wonderin why i dont fuck her

and she my main bitch so of course i dont drug her
but she be gettin high cause she be thinkin i dont love her
and thats a damn lie cause girl we fuck undercovers
