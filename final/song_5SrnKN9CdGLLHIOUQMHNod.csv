one time a thing occurred to me
whats real and whats for sale
blew a kiss and tried to take it home

chorus
isnt you isnt me
search for things that you cant see
going blind out of reach
somewhere in the vasoline

verse 2
two times and it has rendered me
punch drunk and without bail
think id be safer all alone

prechorus
flies in the vasoline we are
sometimes it blows my mind
keep gettin stuck here all the time

chorus
isnt you isnt me
search for things that you cant see
going blind out of reach
somewhere in the vasoline

youll see the look and youll see the lies
youll eat the lies and you will
