trapped in a box of tremendous size
it distorts my vision it closes my eyes
attracts filthy flies and pollutes in the skies
it sucks up our lives and proliferates lies
trapped in a box

verse 2
trapped in a box four walls as sky
got a screen for a window about two feet wide
my mind rides and slides as my circuits are fried
no room for thought use the box as my guide
trapped in a box

chorus
oooh trapped in a box
watch the world as it flocks
to lifes paradox
and were all trapped in a box

verse 3
oh trapped in a box im not alone
i know of others with a box as their home
light only enters from a crack or a hole
oh this is not enough for a human to grow
trapped in a box
see no doubt liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likechorus
oooh trapped in a box
watch the world as it flocks
to lifes paradox
and were all trapped in a box

bridge
always wanting a different view
instant gratification for you
reality gone with a single click
i just hope that that switch wont stick

verse 4
ah trapped in a box my life becomes void
and all of the thought for myselfs now destroyed
controlling my mind what to eat what to buy
subliminal rules how to live how to die
trapped in a box

chorus
ooh trapped in a box
watch the world as it flocks
to lifes paradox
and were all trapped in a box
ooh trapped in a box
watch the world as it flocks
to lifes paradox
and were all trapped in a box
outro
were all trapped in a box
ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh
were all trapped in a box1embed"
