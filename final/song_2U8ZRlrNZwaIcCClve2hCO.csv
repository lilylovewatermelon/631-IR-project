living on tight ropes
running with your feet off the ground
it used to be magic
but now its only getting you down

i miss the sunshine
that was a good friend of mine
cant stand it as my life goes by
waiting for something
but nothings gonna happen tonight

walking down a oneway road
but you still dont know which way to turn

just hold on
just hold on
when youre feeling like you cant go on
just hold on
just hold on

riding lifes rollercoaster
youre making the most of
what you can and what you cant have
hoping for someone
to show you to another pain
you might also likewalking down a oneway road
but you still dont know which way to turn

just hold on
just hold on
when youre feeling like you cant go on
just hold on
just hold on

when you think you cant make it
just hold on
just hold on
just hold on
just hold on

when you feeling like you cant go on
just hold onembed"
