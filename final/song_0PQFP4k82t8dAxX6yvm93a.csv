baby youre a wrecking ball
crashing into me
nothing i can do but fall
piece by piece
you broke down every part of me
that ever thought id never need you baby

chorus
its twisted messed up
and the more i think about it
its crazy but so what
i may never understand it
im caught up and im hanging on
im gonna love you even if its wrong

verse 2
everybodys telling me
im over my head
if they dont feel you loving me
they all say that ive gone crazy
maybe but its too late now to save me
im too tangled

chorus
its twisted messed up
and the more i think about it
its crazy but so what
i may never understand it
im caught up and im hanging on
im gonna love you even if its wrong
even if its twisted

chorus
its twisted messed up
and the more i think about it
its crazy but so what
i may never understand it
