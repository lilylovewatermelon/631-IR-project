verse tyler the creator
um excuse me mister but can you please turn down the lights
i dont really like all these cameras man
and this shit just dont feel right
and i dont really wanna be rude to you sir
but fuck you mean i cant wear my hat in here
and you got me fucked up if you think i care nigga
i hope you little niggas is listening
them golf boys is in this bitch like an infant
the blind niggas used to make fun of my vision
and now i pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition
so special the teacher asked if i was autistic
and now im making plates you just washing the dishes
so if you dont mind get the fuck out of my kitchen
but keep your ego there so i can butt fuck your opinion
but in the meantime brainwashing millions of minions
leader of the new school ha im in my own school
and you would never catch me in none of their fucking shindigs
i hope you fucking niggas is angry pissed and offended
in search of did more for me than illmatic
thats when i realized we aint cut from the same fabric
i made my own shit you went out and bought yours
man i got too much drive motherfucker i hate traffic
ladidadi im going harder
than coming out the closet to conservative christian fathers
when its a lot at stake carne asada but lets be honest im really morphing
named my album cherry bomb because greatest hits sounded boring
i dont like to follow the rules
she said that i must i dont have any armpits
she wanted to talk whos in charge of this golf shit
i said howdy do how are you im the sergeant
and who i are isnt really important
my heart is as dark as a window with car tint
so hop in with your friends gal and ill unpark it
and ill do donuts until the fat one is carsick
its young t

i dont like to follow the rules
and thats just who i am
i hope you understand
and i dont really think yall cool
so give yourself a hand
no no give yourself a hand
better pose for that camera
you better pose boy you better pose
and its your life nigga i suppose
for the lights for the camera and the action
now your face is meltin from the flash of the big ol lights
nigga you ask for this life

outro
welcome to death camp
yeah welcome to death camp
yeah welcome to death camp
kissing on my bean bag
your lips highfive my tongue
and my fingers moonwalk through your hair
for the lights and the camera and the action
this is fun i can tell
i dont know if youll handle it well
welcome to hell camp
lights and the camera and the action
you should be mine in a way tonight
for the lights and the camera and the action130embed"
