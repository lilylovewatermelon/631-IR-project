some day when im awfully low
when the world is cold
i will feel a glow just thinking of you
and the way you look tonight
youre lovely with your smile so warm
and your cheeks so soft
there is nothing for me but to love you
and the way you look tonight

chorus
with each word your tenderness grows
tearing my fears apart
and that laugh that wrinkles your nose
it touches my foolish heart
lovely never ever change
keep that breathless charm
wont you please arrange it
cause i love you just the way you look tonight

instrumental break

chorus
with each word your tenderness grows
tearing my fears apart
and that laugh that wrinkles your nose
it touches my foolish heart
lovely dont you ever change
keep that breathless charm
wont you please arrange it
cause i love you just the way you look tonight
you might also likeoutro
ooh tonightembed"
