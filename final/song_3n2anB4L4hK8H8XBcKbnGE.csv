too many words i confuse what i say
calling the victims a probable cause
give me the keys and get out of this box

keep both hands up on the wheel
destination anywhere
keep both hands up on the wheel
take control

i cant let myself fall down
i cant help myself right now
i cant let myself fall down
if i cant be myself i fall down

somebody help me get out of this place
too many fools with a smile and a face
somebody help the prescription is wrong
im never awake unless i fake it

i cant let myself fall down
i cant help myself right now
i cant let myself fall down
if i cant be myself right now

keep your head on straight
make the kids behave
keep your mind awake
if i cant be myself i fall down
you might also likekeep both hands up on the wheel
destination anywhere

i cant let myself fall down
i cant help myself right now
i cant let myself fall down
if i cant be myself right now

keep your head on straight
make the kids behave
keep your mind awake
if i cant be myself i fall down

fall downembed"
