chorus
they been killin legends i refuse to put my pole up
foenem trigger happy bet them bullets fuck his soul up
with this shit since birth cause this the lifestyle that chose us
the streets dont love you back but thats some shit they never told us
in my neighborhood we reckless bitch the police cant control us
we too hardbody get in that jam and we wont fold up
new i8 got wings i hop out fresh and let them doors up
they know who i am just off my name i bet them hoes fuck

verse 1
never know whats next up in this shit just gotta play it out
mama told me watch them niggas theyll take you out
why everybody on my dick whats all the hate about
allergic to the fake they get too close i might start breaking out
goofy talking bout fuck one of my guys but he cant say it now
he was dropping ts is you stupid left him stanking now
like a date at ruths chris we lurking we been staking out
we gon take him on a field trip to come see what this danger bout
was tryna do them drivebys but now we on the paper route
they flexed on me with rolls shit dont compare to what im makin now
never had shit every chance i get pull them blue faces out
runnin up them commas bitch im best friends with my bank account
she played me back in high school wanna fuck because im famous now
she ate a plan b pussy too good for me to take it out
at first they aint believe they see the pictures that im paintin now
i was the underdog i got em claiming im they favorite now

verse 2
every time i drop apply that pressure i aint lettin up
i heard durb say nothin spazzin im like bet it up
that boy think he on my ass he just catchin up
if we see them lights we do the dash bitch you aint catchin us
we enforcin shit know how we rockin who gon question us
let her meet the gang this my lil bro is you gon let him fuck
posted on the strip a hundred shots we got them weapons tucked
if he get out of line like pool parties we gon wet him up
big 30 on me splash brothers like i play with klay
deep up in that water its piranhas hollows ate his face
they tried to tell me i couldnt do it but i made a way
now i got a few ms in the vault just for a rainy day

chorus
