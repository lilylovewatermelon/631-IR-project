yeah bringing you another disturbing creation
from the mind of one sick animal who cant tell the difference
and gets stupified

verse 1
ive been waiting my whole life for just one fuck
and all i needed was just one fuck
how can you say that you dont give a fuck
i find myself stupified coming back again
all i wanted was just one fuck
one tiny little innocent fuck
and when i feel like im shit out of luck
i find myself stupified coming back again

prechorus
why do you like playing around with
my narrow scope of reality
i can feel it all start slipping
i think im breaking down
why do you like playing around with
my narrow scope of reality
i can feel it all start slipping away

chorus
see but i dont get it
dont you think maybe we could put it on credit
dont you think it can take control when i dont let it
i get stupified its all the same you say
live with it but i dont get it
dont you think maybe we could put it on credit
dont you think it can take control when i dont let it
i get stupified i get stupified

all the people in the left wing rock
and all the people in the right wing rock
and all the people in the underground rock
i find myself stupified coming back again
all the people in the highrise rock
and all the people in the projects rock
and all la gente in the barrio rock
i find myself stupified coming back again

prechorus
why do you like playing around with
my narrow scope of reality

why do you like playing around with
