a charcoal heart that you cant ignore
cuz youve been burned before
you tell me everything thats good will end
you were building castles in the air
but they fell to the ground there was nothing there
you said youll never get so close again

prechorus
and lately
its yellow lights and youre breaking
say you just wanna wait and
see it all unfold
but baby
when you find what youre seeking
something you can believe in
you just gotta go

chorus
so lets not take is slow
lets not take it slow
i dont wanna take it slow
lets not take it slow

verse 2
i dont wanna rush your love
but i can never get get enough
im sitting outside your door
ill give you everything you need
sunshine the world and all your dreams
so what are we waiting for

prechorus
but lately

chorus

bridge
waiting for
the perfect storm
