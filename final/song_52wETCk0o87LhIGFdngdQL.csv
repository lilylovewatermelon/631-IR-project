verse 1
i come through your hood stuntin in my yellow lam
murcielago top down nigga damn
im the biggest crook from new york since son of sam
cruising bumping bucks shit ruger in my hand
thinking the east aint enough its time to expand
i plan to head out west and plant my feet down
a nigga big as king kong in the street now
i do a little house shopping and buy me a crib
its palm trees and pretty bitches out in cali kid
i touch the hollywood paper go and shoot me some flicks
have some supermodel bitches come and suck on some dick
mamad turn in her grave if i married a white chick
but beckyll suck the chrome off a chevy and shit
niggas be wearing fake shines im rocking a lil charm
30 carats on the pinky kiss the ring on the don
crack open that cali bud stuff the weed in the palm
see 50 cent liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likehook 50 cent
nigga you hustle but me ill hustle harder
i got what you need them trees that hard that powder
my niggas move gpacks every hour on the hour
they shoot when i say shoot so im in a position of power
you fuck around if you wanna

verse 2
where im from you learn to blend in or get touched
i dont need niggas for support i dont walk with a crutch
niggas know my steez they dont fuck with me son
you got a appetite for hollowtips i feed you my gun
this is that ferrari f50 shit its real laid back
type shit you recline to in the maybachs
i got two shooters now on the run from the fuzz
you get the same shit for ten bodies you get from one cuz
i live life in the fast lane hundred miles an hour
chrome and some wood grain
you know a nigga still really tryin to move caine
make a little extra money on the side mayne i aint playing
im up early with the birds word putting that work in
pirellis on the porsche chirping im making moves
i got a hundred mil from music a hundred grand from crack
gonna see my jeweler so i can blow a stack

chorus
nigga you hustle but me ill hustle harder
i got what you need them trees that hard that powder
my niggas move gpacks every hour on the hour
they shoot when i say shoot so im in a position of power
you fuck around if you wanna9embed"
