i know that it never goes away
all i feel everything im not today
so i try and i try to make everything right
i dont feel like im doing it it affects me

chorus
you wouldnt listen even if i told you
who the fuck am i to say
youre too busy with the lies they sold you
another cure to fix your day
open wide for all the shit they feed you
while the tv defecates
and blindly walk wherever they will lead you
while the edges slowly fray

verse 2
i know that everything can change
what i need is to open up again
so never again will i look back in vain
cause todays not the past i dont need to relive it

chorus
you wouldnt listen even if i told you
who the fuck am i to say
youre too busy with the lies they sold you
another cure to fix your day
open wide for all the shit they feed you
while your tv defecates
and blindly walk wherever they will lead you
while the edges slowly fray

are you satisfied
ive given all i can
and are you pacified
or do you want more from me

chorus
you wouldnt listen even if i told you
who the fuck am i to say
youre too busy with the lies they sold you
another cure to fix your day
open wide for all the shit they feed you
while the tv defecates
and blindly walk wherever they will lead you
while the edges slowly fray

bridge 2
ive learned that this lifes not just a game
just a line between the pleasures and the pain

chorus
you wouldnt listen even if i told you
who the fuck am i to say
and youre too busy with the lies they sold you
another cure to fix your day
open wide for all the shit they feed you
while the tv defecates
and blindly walk wherever they will lead you
while the edges slowly frayembed"
