he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said thats a lie
just a boy in a chevy truck
that had a tendency of gettin stuck
on backroads at night

prechorus
and i was right there beside him all summer long
and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

chorus
but when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me

verse 2
september saw a month of tears
and thankin god that you werent here
to see me like that
but in a box beneath my bed
is a letter that you never read
from three summers back
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likeprechorus
its hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
and lookin back on all of that its nice to believe

chorus
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me

bridge
and im back for the first time since then
im standin on your street
and theres a letter left on your doorstep
and the first thing that youll read

chorus
is when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
someday youll turn your radio on
i hope it takes you back to that place
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
outro
oh think of me mmm
he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said thats a lie25embed"
