dollar signs
said fuck this shit you know whats on my mind
stay on your hustle you be on your grind
rip out your heart and left it on the line
you running out of time
you lose your mind you lose your fuckin mind
you lose your mind you lose your fuckin mind
you close your eyes youre seeing dollar signs dollar signs

dollar signs
i told you once aint gotta tell you twice
if lifes a game im throwing loaded dice
these other girls aint really what you like what you like
feeling like running away
stressing bout nothing all day
money and hoes come and they go
let them go fuck em away
everything aint what it seems
if its all just a dream
i believe it i believe it

love is something vicious
still it isnt right
seeing all them secrets in your eyes
meet me in the middle
underneath the lights
you know i aint got no chill tonight
no chill no chill no
got no chill tonight
no chill no chill no
got no chill tonight
no chill no chill no
got no chill tonight
no chill no chill no
got no chill tonight
