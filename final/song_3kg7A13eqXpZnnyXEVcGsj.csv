in every dream i have youre in the car
youre not with him no more yes its just us
in every dream i have youre at the bar
drinking white russians with me its just us

chorus
i need you like a fire needs a log
jupiter couldnt keep me from you
oh im yours
i want you like a dog wants a dog
jupiter couldnt keep me from you
oh im yours

verse 2
you say hello and im nothing at all
i wanna be the screen you always touch
and id even be an ulcer in your mouth
just to be close to you im just so far

chorus
i need you like a fire needs a log
jupiter couldnt keep me from you
oh im yours
i want you like a dog wants a dog
jupiter couldnt keep me from you
oh im yours
