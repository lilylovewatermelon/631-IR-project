i laid cuts with jay and rocked rhymes with run
a couple mil in the bank and i aint even done
i got platinum plaques i write platnum tracks
i got it all from raps and thats the platinum face uh
all that and there aint nothing i fear yet
sippin champagne up in company leer jets
five star meals caribbean vacations
everythings plush deluxe accomodations
nationwide the stations vibe
to the cat who covers tracks like the lace on thighs
my ace is high there aint gonna be no guessin
im the illest motherfucker on the block no question
i aint destined i dont fuck with fate

see uncle kracker liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likei shot dice with the devil on many occasion
drank shots with god in an old gas station
a couple accountants that count my statements
cribs all paid for no car payments
rocked in basements for gas and beer
and now i get all that and big loot to appear
i couldnt steer so i got me a chauffer
hired a chef cause i was tired of stouffers
i got over and people showed envy
cause i couldnt choose between a lincoln and a benzy
fendi shades and topless maids
i dont worry about clothes cause thier custom made
i drink crushed up grapes that have been aged for years
your smokin ops drinkin threetwo beer
ive already done everything you wanna do
so what makes you think i give a fuck about you
