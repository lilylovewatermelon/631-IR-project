somewhere waitin for me
my lover stands on golden sands
and watches the ships that go sailin

somewhere beyond the sea
shes there watchin for me
if i could fly like birds on high
then straight to her arms ill go sailin

its far beyond the stars
its near beyond the moon
i know beyond a doubt
my heart will lead me there soon

well meet beyond the shore
well kiss just like before
happy we will be beyond the sea
and never again ill go sailin

instrumental interlude

i know beyond a doubt
my heart will lead me there soon
oh well meet i know well meet beyond the shore
well kiss just as before
happy we will be beyond the sea
and never again ill go sailin
see robbie williams liveget tickets as low as 204you might also likeno more sailin
so long sailin sailin
no more sailin

goodbye farewell my friend
no more sailin
so long sailin
no more sailin

no more farewell
auf wiedersehen adieu to ya and ya

no more sailing no more
oh no more sailing
no more no more
no more sailing

no more
one more time
no more sailingembed"
