intro

i thinkâ€” i think i see where youre goin with this one e

verse 1
hey hey
been around the world and back yeah i did that
still kick raps that cause impact so where my kids at
these mufuckers hatin soundin funnier than sinbad
im ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse
this that the other kiss your mother with that mouth
we the assholes that she warned you about
we just storm in your house open doors through a cloud
got an assortment of style just be sure that its wild
630 in the mornin and there still aint signs of slowin down
twin sisters gettin wasted so they both are down
its goin down i thought i told you man
if you tryna party let me see you raise your hand

chorus
theres a party on fifth ave party on fifth ave
hit me if you tryna go hit me if you tryna go
i can be there in like twenty ima honk it and come runnin
cause we gotta hit the road we gotta hit the road
make you sure you got a clean shirt clean pants new shoes new shoes
or just hitch a ride there you choose you choose
theres a party on fifth ave tonight
and thats what im tryin to do
