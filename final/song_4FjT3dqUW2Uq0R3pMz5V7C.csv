talk to me and watch me crumble
you will see me come undone
faithfully i will look over
there ill find what youve become
what youve become

chorus
you help me lose my mind
and you bring me something i cant define
help me lose my mind
make me wonder what i felt before
keep biding my time
how much longer have i been waiting for

verse 2
jealousy will be washed over
carefully we will come through
could it be easy to start over
somehow i will bring you to
what youve become

chorus
you help me lose my mind
and you bring me something i cant define
help me lose my mind
make me wonder what i felt before
keep biding my time
how much longer have i been waiting for

and you bring me something i cant define
