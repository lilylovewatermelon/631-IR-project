maybe one day i wont sing about you
ill sing a song about someone new
but right here right now you are on my mind
and i think about you all the time

prechorus
im sendin a message to you
and im hopin that it will get through

chorus
when it was good it was bittersweet honey
you made me sad till i loved the shade of blue
i know you dont wanna talk to me so this is what i will do
maybe youre listenin so heres one last song for you
heres one last song for you

verse 2
and i hope it makes you feel
and i hope it makes you burn
and i hope it reminds you of how much it hurt
