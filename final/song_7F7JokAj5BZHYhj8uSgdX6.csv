judge asked me how do you plead
guilty your honor have mercy on me
threw me inside the penitentiary
charged me on a count of armed robbery

chorus
punishment fit the crime
ill be here for a while just doin time

verse 2
well i aint lookin forward to the light of day
put me in the middle of a rowdy chain gang
blooded hands just swingin away
breakin up dirt in that texas clay

chorus
punishment fit the crime
ill be here for a while just doin time

instrumental break

verse 3
well two yеars have come and two years havе gone
swear two years never felt so long
hopin and aprayin for a shot at parole
bein here been drainin my soul

punishment fit the crime
ill be here for a while just doin time

punishment fit the crime
ill be here for a whileembed"
