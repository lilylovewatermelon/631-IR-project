i threw a wish in the well
dont ask me ill never tell
i looked to you as it fell
and now youre in my way
i trade my soul for a wish
pennies and dimes for a kiss
i wasnt looking for this
but now youre in my way

prechorus
your stare was holdin
ripped jeans skin was showin
hot night wind was blowin
where you think youre going baby

chorus
hey i just met you and this is crazy
but heres my number so call me maybe
its hard to look right at you baby
but heres my number so call me maybe
hey i just met you and this is crazy
but heres my number so call me maybe
and all the other boys try to chase me
but heres my number so call me maybe

you took your time with the call
i took no time with the fall
you gave me nothin at all
but still youre in my way
i beg and borrow and steal
at first sight and its real
i didnt know i would feel it
but its in my way

prechorus
your stare was holdin
ripped jeans skin was showin
hot night wind was blowin
where you think youre going baby
