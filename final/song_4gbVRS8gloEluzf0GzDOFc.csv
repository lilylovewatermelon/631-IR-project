i miss the taste of a sweeter life
i miss the conversation
im searching for a song tonight
im changing all of the stations
i like to think that we had it all
we drew a map to a better place
but on that road i took a fall
oh baby why did you run away

i was there for you in your darkest times
i was there for you in your darkest night

chorus
but i wonder where were you
when i was at my worst down on my knees
and you said you had my back
so i wonder where were you
when all the roads you took came back to me

postchorus

the map that leads to you

the map that leads to you
aint nothing i can do
the map that leads to you

cause something strange has come over me
and now i cant get over you
