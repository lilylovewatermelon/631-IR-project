i sat outside my front window this storys going somewhere
hes well hung and i am hanging up
theres a song on the radio that says
lets get this party started so lets get this party started

prechorus
what you do on your own times just fine
my imaginations much worse i just never wanna know
what meant the world had folded like legs and fingers holding onto
what escapes me what he has a better kiss that never lasts

chorus
you said
between your smiles and regrets
dont say its over
dead and gone dead and gone yeah

postchorus
the calm before the storm set it off
and the sun burnt out tonight
reception less than warm set it off
and the sun burnt out too

verse 2
this is me standing in the arch of the door
hating that look thats on your face
that says theres another fool like me
theres one born every minute theres one born every minute
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeprechorus
what you do on your own times just fine
my imaginations much worse i just never wanna know
what meant the world imploded inflated then demoted all my
oxygen to product gas and suffocated my last chance

chorus
to say
between your smiles and regrets
dont say its over
dead and gone dead and gone yeah whoa
