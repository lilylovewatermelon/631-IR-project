someway baby its part of me apart from me
youre laying waste to halloween
you fucked it friend its on its head it struck the street
youre in milwaukee off your feet

prechorus
and at once i knew
i was not magnificent

chorus
strayed above the highway aisle
jagged vacance thick with ice
i could see for miles miles miles

verse 2
third and lake it burnt away the hallway
was where we learned to celebrate
automatic bought the years youd talk for me
that night you played me lip parade
not the needle nor the thread the lost decree
saying nothing thats enough for me

prechorus
and at once i knew
i was not magnificent

hulled far from the highway aisle
jagged vacance thick with ice
i could see for miles miles miles
verse 3
christmas night it clutched the light the hallow bright
above my brother i and tangled spines
we smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
now to know it in my memory

prechorus
and at once i knew
i was not magnificent

chorus
high above the highway aisle
jagged vacance thick with ice
i could see for miles miles miles62embed"
