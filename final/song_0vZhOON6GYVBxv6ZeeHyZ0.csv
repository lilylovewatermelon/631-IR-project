dont feel it all talk slow and leveled
foot off the pedal
same shirt and perfume on
the two of us were accidental
but so good together
now all i feel is

prechorus 1
so bad about it
i barely left my bed
we talk around it all for nothing

chorus
so if that’s all it was
if youre good giving in giving up i hope
so if thats all it was
hope you feel better now
and if that’s what you want
if you dont wanna see me at all now
so if thats all it was
hope you feel better

verse 2
its been a while
old clothes fit larger
youre looking smaller
what happened when i left
you might also likeprechorus 2
im not mad about it
but youve barely left my head
we talk around it all for nothing

chorus
so if thats all it was
if you’re good giving in giving up i hope
so if that’s all it was
hope you feel better now
and if thats what you want
if you don’t wanna see me at all now
so if thats all it was
hope you feel better

bridge
id turn the car around if youd let me
if you’d let me youd let me you know
id cry my eyes out til im empty
til im empty im empty oh

chorus
so if thats all it was
if youre good giving in giving up i hope
so if thats all it was
hope you feel better now
and if thats what you want
if you dont wanna see me at all now
so if thats all it was
hope you feel better now

hope you feel better now
hope you feel betterembed"
