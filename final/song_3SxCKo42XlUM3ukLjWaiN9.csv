im not a savior and im not a saint
the man with the answers i certainly aint
i wouldnt tell you whats right or whats wrong
im just a singer of songs

verse 1
but i can take you for a walk along a little country stream
i can make you see through lovers eyes and understand their dreams
i can help you hear a babys laugh and feel the joy it brings
yes i do it with the songs that i sing

chorus
im not a prophet and im not a priest
im not a wise man whos come from the east
i wouldnt tell you whats right or whats wrong
im just a singer of songs

verse 2
but i can take you to a city where a man was crucified
i can tell you how he lived and i can tell you why he died
i can help proclaim the glory of this mighty king of kings
yes i do it with the songs that i sing

chorus
im not a great man i dont claim to be
but when i meet my maker and he questions me
i wont hang my head i will stand proud and strong
and say i was a singer lord i was a singer
yes i was a singer of songsyou might also likeembed"
