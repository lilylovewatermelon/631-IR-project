fuck on my bae pack my suitcase im finna hit the road
jump off the plane straight to the stage i go collect my dough
back to that bottom stackin guala with my main niggas
bought my house on top of the hill but my heart in them trenches
bitches be thirty forty years old still in my business
they quick to talk about the shit that theyd be doing different
three years ago i was a joke they aint wan take me serious
now they be mad cause they see we went from rags to riches
cant leave the house without my glizzy niggas out to get me
before i get caught up without it i get caught up with it
my ho the sickest so i turned her to my baby mama
want her position so they quick to confront her with drama
niggas do all that talking and typing like its a problem
