you take a lot of chances with your feelings
no one really knows what you feel
and fiction is the only way youre dealing
you turn your pretty head if it gets real

chorus
oh you oh you
you take it so slowly
and your eyes look so lonely
its only when you think about me
oh yeah
when you think about me
think about me

verse 2
and i got a head dont let me sleep
you got a secret i cant keep
you see a little stranger in your mirror
the girl you never knew is what you fear

chorus
oh you you
you take it so slowly
and your eyes look so lonely
its only when you think about me
oh yeah
when you think about me
think about me
see the goo goo dolls liveget tickets as low as 59you might also likebridge
and all you want is something i cant be
all you want from me is what you need

outro
and im saying
you take it so slowly
and your eyes look so lonely
but its only but its only
oh you oh you
you take it so slowly
its only its only
about me
when you think about me
