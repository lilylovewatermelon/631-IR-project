ooh new york
ooh new york

verse 1
grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
noise is always loud there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
if i can make it here i can make it anywhere thats what they say
seein my face in lights or my name on marquees found down on broadway

prechorus
even if it aint all it seems come on
i got a pocketful of dreams come on

chorus
baby im from new york oh yeah
concrete jungle where dreams are made of oh come on
theres nothin you cant do come on
now youre in new york oh yeah
these streets will make you feel brandnew oh come on
big lights will inspire you big shine
hear it for new york uh new york yeah new york uh

verse 2
on the avenue there aint ever a curfew ladies work so hard
such a meltin pot on the corner sellin rock preachers pray to god
hail a gypsy cab takes me down from harlem to the brooklyn bridge
someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge
