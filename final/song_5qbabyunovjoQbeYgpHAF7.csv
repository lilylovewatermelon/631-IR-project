the window is open sos that door
i didnt know they did that anymore
who knew we owned eight thousand salad plates
for years ive roamed these empty halls
why have a ballroom with no balls
finally theyre opening up the gates

prechorus anna
therell be happy similing people
itll be totally strange
but wow am i so ready for this change

chorus anna
for the first time in forever
therell be music therell be light
for the first time in forеver
ill be dancing through the night
dont know if im еlated or gassy
but im somewhere in that zone
cause for the first time in forever
i wont be alone

verse 2 anna
tonight imagine me gown and all
fetchingly draped against the wall
the picture of sophisticated grace
i suddenly see him standing there
a beautiful stranger tall and fair
i wanna stuff some chocolate in my face
you might also likeprechorus anna
but then we laugh and talk all evening
which is totally bizarre
nothing like the life ive led so far

chorus anna
for the first time in forever
therell be magic therell be fun
for the first time in forever
i could be noticed by someone
and i know it is totally crazy
to dream id find romance
but for the first time in forever
at least i gotta a chance

bridge anna  elsa
dont let them in dont let them see
be the good girl you always have to be
conceal dont feel
put on a show
make one wrong move and everyone will know
but its only for today its only for today
its agony to wait its agony to wait
tell the guards to open up the gate the gate

chorus anna  elsa
for the first time in forever
dont let them in dont let them see
im getting what im dreaming of
be the good girl you always have to be
a chance to change my lonely world conceal
a chance to find true love
conceal dont feel dont let them know
i know it all ends tomorrow so it has to be today
cause for the first time in forever
for the first time in forever
nothings in my wayembed"
