look out

alright pops still feel like charging me for that meal
one look at his featureless face
one look was enough to ensure his safety
as years passed he became even more bitter and angry
burning with vengeance against the world
finally amidst hidden scrolls he found what hed been seeking
then clothed in a suit of invulnerable armor and possessing the worlds greatest secrets of science and magic he returned to his homeland
and there he has remained
scheming dreaming planning
plotting his mad campaign to conquer the entire world
i cant believe it
alright alright dont make a big deal about it
i warn you doom youve gone too far
yeah
thatll do it doom get your machine1embed"
