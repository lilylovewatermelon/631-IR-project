emotions probably telling her she can stay tonight
but her friends all call us crazy they don’t give her good advice
satellites satellites never really made love never really made love

i was shot through the heart
just on the dlo luca brasi sellin kilos
gotta shop outta town and got a spot just around the way
let’s be specific
if im the nigga you feelin am i wrong for showin interest in these women surroundin
ima straight dick her down and go no time to lounge with hoes
on the grind all the time i done been down this road
strictly need my cnotes can you keep up with my lingo
some would say life is a gamble which means love is a casino
everybody just playin to win think i made it again
dont many ladies pretend hopin this aint what it is
aint no wastin time hustle every night
promise every thing is alright
chorus

in my car going hard going far in the stars in a club in a bar going big going large
