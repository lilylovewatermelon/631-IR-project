verse 1

and im not gettin over it
darling is it cool

if youre getting yourself wet for me
i guess youre all mine
when youre sleeping in this bed with me

verse 2
its you
dont know why but it feels so right to me
something in the way you move

you all the time time time
in doses at night night night
no roof on the drive
dust off the high
and go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep
