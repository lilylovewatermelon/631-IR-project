verse 1
i see you in the park youre always wearing dodger blue
mad doggin me and anyone from any other crew
i am small but im strong ill get it on with you
if you want me to what else can i do
everyone would take a cue from anything you do
if you want them to what else can they do
i dont want to fight i want to get along with you
this time of nights for singing songs about the local news

chorus

verse 2
ill come around and make peace get down have a barbeque
lets keep the moon awake and do electric boogaloo
i am small but im strong you see im just like you
if you only knew that im just like you
all the world would take a cue from anything you do
if you only knew that theyre just like you
i dont want to fight i want to get along with you
this time of nights for singing songs about the local news
i dont want to fight i want to get along with you
this time of nights for singing songs about the local news
