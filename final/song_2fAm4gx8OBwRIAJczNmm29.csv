ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy thats probably tago
goddamn bj with another one

chorus rod wave
say when love comes around naturally
youll miss it my friend if you blink
now youre just a memory
tried to tell you but now you just remember me
i was tryna let you know yeah uh
i was tryna let you know yeah
i was tryna let you know woah
i was tryna let you know
fore i let you go woah yeah

verse 1 rod wave
i was tryna hold on hold on to ease the pain
but why hold on if i wasnt ready to change
and now youre just a memory
dont mistake my cries for cries of sympathy
i was just so young so young didnt know the difference
mama said dont make excuses son cause thatll never fix it
mama said just take your losses son and then grow with it
mama said just next time you get this far do it different
and i tried to do it different when i fell in love
but sittin waitin on karma had me scared enough
like this time no next time itll be fair enough
in the inside im tearing up

verse 2 kevin gates
i still think about you cause i was your first
first real one that ever was
hurt still come when not on drugs
love to see you smile got you a purse from out the dirt
and the work still come from out the slums
you from my turf im the first real one you ever loved
and i been lookin for you inside somebody else
it been so hard to find
room full of crowded people i feel lost sometimes
know you in a relationship but still i gotta call sometimes
i was just thinking about you i tapped your line you crossed my mind

chorus rod wave
say when love comes around naturally
youll miss it my friend if you blink
