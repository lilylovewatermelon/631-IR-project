verse 1
well youre the first car in an hour or so
im glad you stopped in its sure been slow around here today
just like every day
well i couldnt help but notice your california plates
and i thought i recognized that name on your credit card
youre a movie star
well i cant wait to get back home and tell all my buddies
that i met one of the most famous people in the country

ive been thinking bout doing some acting some day
if i ever do make it out to la
