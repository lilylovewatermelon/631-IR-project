ive got a life out there somewhere its waiting
lined with palm trees and only new faces
if i could look past the present and get there
well baby its worth a shot
just enough time to plan an escape route
i put my map on the wall in the basement
not quite a victory to run from your problems
but its the only plan that i got
its the only plan that i got

chorus
and if you try to find me now oh oh oh
im in all the echoes that have faded out so
im moving on cause i just want to feel for once that i belong
and thats whats going on thats whats going on

verse 2
crossed the state line and called out a warning
not too long now ill breathe california
paid my dues and i tried to be loyal
but now im done with all that
where im going is everyones story
we want new lives wed love to start over
its not a question of who are we really
its who we wanna be

and if you try to find me now oh oh oh
im in all the echoes that have faded out so
im moving on cause i just want to feel for once that i belong
and thats whats going on

bridge
all thats in between
a brand new life and i is time
but time has not been kind
its not been kind to me
its winding backwards
time has not been kind
its crawling by
so slowly

chorus
and if you try to find me now oh oh oh
im in all the echoes that have faded out so
im moving on cause i just want to feel for once that i belong
and thats whats going on
and if you try to find me now oh oh oh
im in all the echoes that have faded out so
im moving on cause i just want to feel for once that i belong
and thats whats going on13embed"
