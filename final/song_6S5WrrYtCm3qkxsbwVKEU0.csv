mr merry cries in his coffin oh
for days he says he can remember
and through the town the pallbearers sing old songs
of a beautiful and purple mountain

from every walk of life weve come
to see the last great american

verse 2

friends he was a man of men a man of gold
he had a how do you say ethical like sense
thats when the president started to giggle

chorus 2
then the children gave the blessing
though the service werent half done
each of them sued the other one
for the last great american

verse 3
merry reaches up and we bow our heads
he pulls the lid on down as his stone is read
here lies our merry the man with the heart so spent
that in this day and age is sick of living
