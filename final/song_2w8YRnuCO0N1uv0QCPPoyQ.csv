when’s the day you start again
and when the hell does you’ll get over it begin
i’m looking hard in the mirror but i don’t fit my skin
it’s too much to take it’s too hard to break me from the cell i’m in

prechorus
oh from this moment on
i’m changing the way i feel yeah
from this moment on
it’s time to get real

chorus
cause i still don’t know how to act don’t know what to say
still wear the scars like it was yesterday
but you’re long gone and moved on
but you’re long gone
but i still don’t know where to start still finding my way
still talk about you like it was yesterday
but you’re long gone and moved on
but you’re long gone you moved on

verse 2

yeah
i’m barely used to saying me instead of us
the elephant in the room keeps scaring off the guests
it gets under my skin to see you with him and its not me that you’re with
