its the spirit of the season
you can feel it in the air
you can hear it if you listen
everywhere so much care like a prayer
whatever it is you need to share it
its the spirit of the season
you can feel it in the air

verse 1
people smile as they pass you by
the day will be here soon
dreams are dancing in the childrens eyes
hearts are singing bells are ringing too

chorus
its the spirit of the season
filling hearts with love and care
let the shining star increase it
everywhere feeling there like a prayer
whatever it is you need to share it
its the spirit of the season
its the spirit of the season

verse 2
snow is falling as you rush downtown
the city seems to glow
laughter reaches from the happy sounds
hearts are singing bells are ringing too
you might also likechorus
its the spirit of the season
healing hearts with love and care
like a shining star it glistens
everywhere feeling there like a prayer
whatever it is you need to share it
its the spirit of the season
you can hear it in the air
its the spirit of the season
you can hear it everywhere
