it was fun playin with knives
until a blade stuck in the left side of my chest

no more watchin the world from my doorstep passin me by
passin me by

and i’ll just keep changin these colors colors colors colors
im not in the same place that i was i was i was i was

but if somebody tells me ill go back to my old ways
im gonna say no way
im out of the doorway
im hearin them all say ill go back to my old ways
not goin back to my old ways

postchorus
not goin back to my old ways
not goin back to my old ways

verse 2
now i know whats good for me
all that i need
and i cant wait to sink my teeth in and take another bite
and the best part about it is im the only one who can do somethin about it
i fill the well with some water its overflowin
black into gold
who knew itd be so bright without the blindfolds
