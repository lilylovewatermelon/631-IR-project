can you feel it
the expectancy
of our deepest desires
in one moment
in one second
watch it all burn

verse 2
you and i
will stand as one
you and i will be transformed
this is the promise
this is the gift
we hold this truth
go

prechorus
shed the weight of this world
the burden has been lifted
let it all fall
let it all fall

chorus
set this world ablaze
we alone remain
dont fear what awaits
we alone remain

will stand as one
you and i will be transformed

prechorus
shed the weight of this world
the burden has been lifted

chorus
set this world ablaze
we alone remain
dont fear what awaits
we alone remain

verse 3
let the skies turn black
let the infection burn
this is the new beginning
embrace eternity
let it all fall

outro
set this world ablaze
let it all fall
set this world ablaze
let it all fall
set this world ablaze
let it all fall
set this world ablaze
let it all fall
set this world ablaze
let it all fall1embed"
