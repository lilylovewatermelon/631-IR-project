fuck the industry im in the streets
i aint never been to hollywood
im not hollywood im hollyhood
i dont wanna go to hollywood

verse 1
i got kicked out of elementary
started rapping making melodies
listening to beats on my mp3
now my video on mtv
i got the bb gun in my bag
brought the bb gun in my class
call my momma and she sounded mad
say when i get home she gon whoop my ass
i just dropped me off for 50 packs
im the youngest nigga in the trap
im the youngest nigga with that sack
fuck your plug i got that sack

chorus
fuck the industry im in the streets
i aint never been to hollywood
im not hollywood im hollyhood
i dont wanna go to hollywood

i should have been a president
young nigga with plenty sense
i can teach a little young nigga plenty shit
all these games i aint selling it
all this gas i shoulda be selling it
lately ive been really out of my element
these niggas be snitching them crackas dont really be having no evidence
and i aint even sick so why the hell am i sipping on medicine
might get deported cause i be working like a mexican
i just made a little power move and i ainâ€™t been broke ever since
dropped out of school run around finessin shit
running with some recklessass lil niggas we be wrecking shit

chorus
fuck the industry im in the streets
i aint never been to hollywood
im not hollywood im hollyhood
i dont wanna go to hollywood7embed"
