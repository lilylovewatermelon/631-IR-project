if you love somebody
better tell them while theyre here cause
they just may run away from you
youll never know quite when well
then again it just depends on
how long of time is left for you
ive had the highest mountains
ive had the deepest rivers
you can have it all but life keeps moving

prechorus
now take it in but dont look down

chorus
cause im on top of the world hey
im on top of the world hey
waiting on this for a while now
paying my dues to the dirt
ive been waiting to smile hey
been holding it in for a while hey
take you with me if i can
been dreaming of this since a child
im on top of the world

verse 2
ive tried to cut these corners
try to take the easy way out
i kept on falling short of something
i couldve gave up then but
then again i couldnt have cause
ive traveled all this way for something
