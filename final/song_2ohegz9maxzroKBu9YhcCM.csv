we once had things in common
now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
ice cold baby i told you im ice cold ice cold
you out here flyin high high
go head fly that thing
high high yeah
but fly alone

verse 1
you always smokin in the house
what if my mother comes over
you cant get up and get a job
cause this little hustles getting you by
youre the dealer and the stoner
with the sweetest kiss ive ever known

chorus
i know what i was on
i had a pilot jones what you know about it
she took me high oh did she now
then she took me home we talkin bout
pilot jones pilot jones

verse 2
tonight she came stumblin across my lawn again
i just dont know why i keep on tryin to keep a grown woman sober
see there you go reachin up your blouse
and no i dont want a child
but i aint been touched in a while
by the dealer and the stoner
with the sweetest kiss ive ever known ever known

verse 3
in the sky up above the birds
i saw the sky like i never seen before
you thought i was above you
above this in so many ways
but if i got a condo on a cloud
then i guess you can stay at my place
ima get one
i need ya
admit it
youre my pilot jones54embed"
