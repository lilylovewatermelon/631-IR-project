my head was warm my skin was soaked
i called your name till the fever broke
when i awoke the moon still hung
the night so black that the darkness hums
i raised myself my legs were weak
i prayed my mind be good to me
an awful noise filled the air
i heard a scream in the woods somewhere

chorus
ooh oohooh oohooh

verse 2
a womans voice i quickly ran
into the trees with empty hands
a fox it was he shook afraid
i spoke no words no sound he made
his bone exposed his hind was lame
i raised a stone to end his pain
what caused the wound how large the teeth
i sure knew eyes were watchin me

chorus
ooh oohooh oohooh
see hozier liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likeverse 3
the creature lunged i turned and ran
to save a life i didnt have
dear in the chase there as i flew
forgot all prayers of joining you
i clutched my life and wished it kept
my dearest love im not done yet
how many years i know ill bear
i found something in the woods somewhere

chorus
ooh oohooh oohooh
ooh oohooh oohooh22embed"
