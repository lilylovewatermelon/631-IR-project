im fucking gone right now
im fucking gone right now
listen listen

verse 1
from the morning to the evening
complaints from the tenants
got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
drinking alizé with our cereal for breakfast
girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
skys getting cold were flying from the north
rockin with our city like a sold out show
house full of pros that specialize in the hoin
make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
order plane tickets
cali is the mission
visit every month like im split life living
let the world listen
if a haters caught slipping
then my niggas stay tight
got my back like pippen
fast life gripping
yeah we still tippin
codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
fakes try to mimic
get girls timid
but behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

all that money the money is the motive
all that money the money is the motive
all that money the money she be folding
girl put in work girl girl put in work
girl put in work girl girl put in work
girl put in work

verse 2
push it to the limit
push it through the pain
i push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
a virgin to that money
a virgin to the fame
so this my only chance
and when im over only pray
that i flow from the bottom
closer to the top
the higher that i climb
the harder ima drop
these pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
so i tell them use a debit
watch they image start to lessen
i warn them like discretion
why these niggas testing
always fucking testing
why these niggas testing
shit that i got them on straight bar hopping
to the music of the ambiance
get shit popping
zombies of the night zombies of the night
niggas aint talking if they hyping to the crew
get it in like pockets
downtown loving
when the moon coming
only place to find bassheads and hot women
chorus
all that money the money is the motive
all that money the money is the motive
all that money the money she be folding
girl put in work girl girl put in work
girl put in work girl girl put in work
girl put in work

verse 3
better slow down
shell feel it in the morning
aint the kind of girl youll be seeing in the morning
too damn raw aint no nigga with her rollin
aint no nigga that she holding
man her love is too damn foreign
look at all that money
the money is the motive the money is the motive
all that money
the money she be folding the money she be folding
girl put in work girl girl put in work
girl put in work girl girl put in work

chorus
all that money the money is the motive
all that money the money is the motive
all that money the money she be folding
girl put in work girl girl put in work
girl put in work girl girl put in work
girl put in work248embed"
