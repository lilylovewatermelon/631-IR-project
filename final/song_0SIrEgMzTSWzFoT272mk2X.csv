please dont make me hide ive been putting up a fight
whats the use of it now when i get pulled down anyways
ive been hiding my expression you cant blame the reflections
and the ripples on the ground i might as well have drowned

chorus
so im keeping busy work twice as hard as you
want you to believe me that i can pick and choose
said youd let me drive your car as long as im with you
then youd wait till we get far to tell me that youll be gone soon

verse 2
feels too late right now ive been holding back
causе im afraid that im too loud six feet underground
i feel alone again stuck between my friеnds
i guess ill figure my way through them not sure how i do it
but im sure now the people would listen as the water glistens
and i see my reflection so much clearer

chorus
so im keeping busy work twice as hard as you
want you to believe me that i can pick and choose
said youd let me drive your car as long as im with you
then youd wait till we get far to tell me that youll be gone soonyou might also like1embed"
