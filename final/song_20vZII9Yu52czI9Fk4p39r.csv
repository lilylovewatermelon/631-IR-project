open the skies over me
i am waiting patiently
ill wait for a sign
as conspiracies unwind
will you slam shut or free your mind
or stay hypnotized

chorus 1
when the zetas fill the skies
will our leaders tell us why
and fully loaded satellites
will conquer nothing but our minds

and im waiting patiently
and ill wait for the sign

verse 2
carried through the centuries
secrets locked up and loaded on my back
well it weighs me down

chorus 2
when the zetas fill the skies
its just our leaders in disguise
fully loaded satellites
will conquer nothing but our minds
