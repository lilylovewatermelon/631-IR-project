i heard them steppers coming after me i heard the one im lovin let em in
i heard that money bring a lot of power seem like im running out of friends

verse
im on xans and im leaning hoping i dont fall
it could go that way we wont say nothing back we gon shoot at yall
praying that the living aint fall and ive been here through it all
come round i wont fuck with you often
baby i aint got no reason i think i need you
stay down turn your phone off right now dont need it
now take your clothes off and do what i say
i aint got no diamonds on
crosses round my neck come from out of saks
comme des gar√ßons i spent another bag
got alarms inside the home but keep a hundred straps
