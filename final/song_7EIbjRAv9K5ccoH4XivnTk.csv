id love to know just what youre thinkin
every little river runnin through your mind
you give and you take
you come and you go
you leave me here wonderin if ill ever know
how much you care or how much you dont
whatever you need whatever you want

chorus
if youre gonna be somebodys heartbreak
if youre gonna be somebodys mistake
if youre gonna be somebodys first time
somebodys last time baby be mine
if youre lookin to be somebodys just friends
a little laughin little lovin never callin again thats just fine
if youre gonna be somebodys heartbreak
be mine yeah
oh be mine

verse 2
i guess that all im tryin to tell ya
is a minute with you is better than two without
oh i wont be a fool but i cant play it cool
so im playin it safe and im breakin the rules
im wishin i had what i know that you got
so if youre comin my way then please dont stop
