and just be like—

verse 1
she walks down the stairs feeling herself
lookin like she just won a court case
hes got a funny way of using the same
four chords for every song he makes
hes called bill and he plays with words
like a skill yeah hes pretty great
he said his official friend died cause of a officiate
yeah shes called hannah and she plays the joanna
grade eight but shes got no soul
johns obsessed with fat ass and hеs ten years old
oh dads an otis redding at a wеdding type guy
with the best voice you ever heard
he said give me a date i can work on my heart hurts

chorus
i get home on the twentythird
ill drive up on the twentythird

verse 2
and i bumped into julie in the coop
she asked how the familys been
i said alex is a sculptor and olivias been a vegan since ten
while vin wears dresses while debbie coalesces in a fleece that doesnt work
and ill be givin my chair to my mum cause her back hurts
