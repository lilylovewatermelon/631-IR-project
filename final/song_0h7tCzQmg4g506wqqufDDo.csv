jd on tha track big bag dont mean everything wavy
i got 99 problems like jayz
caught a felony judge tried to slave me
lost my grandmother rip mavy
protegebeatz i got money and niggas moved shady

chorus
bodies drop all the time i dont feel nothing
swear to god yall gon make me go kill something
told my shooters no mercy or chill button
i done been through so much i dont feel nothing

they be watching me clocking my movements
they be plotting on catching me snoozing
bodies drop all the time i dont feel nothing

verse 2
dream big ima get to the top
niggas waiting the tape bout to drop
told my mother that im destined to pop
yall aint think i would get what i got
but i stayed true to myself
no losing myself
improving myself
im on the road to the riches
im asking the lord for forgiveness
i got two or three opps on the hit list
yall be talking but aint never did shit
youd be better off minding your business
hardheaded i just dont like to listen
mezclando i stay in the kitchen
money coming in my palms is itching
yall niggas aint no competition
prechorus
big bag dont mean everything wavy
i got 99 problems like jayz
caught a felony judge tried to slave me
lost my grandmother rip mavy
i got money and niggas moved shady
with my brother i put that on baby
my first car i might cop a mercedes
at the stu every day cant be lazy

chorus
bodies drop all the time i dont feel nothing
