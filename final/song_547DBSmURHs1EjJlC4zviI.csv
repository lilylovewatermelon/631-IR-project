the beautiful days are long gone
i cant seem to breathe
feels like it hasnt been that long
since you walked away from me
now i can try to act real strong
but you and i both know i still think of you that way
and you should know that
the beautiful lights the starfilled nights
they dont mean a thing
cause you were my star so it dont seem right
without you here with me
now i can try to act real strong
but you and i both know its hard for me to say
you were my soul

chorus
now i could say that i dont love you no more
and i could say that ive closed the door for our love
and i can tell you i feel its time for us to go our separate ways
but baby i just wouldnt be the same
cause girl your love is still on my brain

verse 2
now when youre in love it takes time to heal
when someones broken your heart it changes how you feel
girl i thought that youd never do me that way
but even after all i still think of you that way
