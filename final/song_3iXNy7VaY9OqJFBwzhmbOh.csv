i met a man in a rock n roll band he said wont you come with me
i let him know that i could not go you see i get mine for free

chorus
we are all just soldiers in this battlefield of life
one thing thats for certain is my burning appetite

verse 2
step inside the emotional ride i could use some company
illusionary is so damn scary i call my best friend flea

chorus
this ticonderoga is an element that shines
connected by the great unknown between us there are lines

bridge
yes i told her that im the older cat
can i scratch your back all day i would not have it any other way well
means so much to me can you see the we
what are we ever gonna do when all i wanna be is next to you

verse 3
i took a girl from the underworld and i held her way too tight
when its all been said and done she was not up for the fight
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus
we are all just soldiers in this open field of time
hoping to get with you when you get right with your mind

bridge
its my favorite so i savor it
i must report that life is short so of your love ill take ten quarts well
theres no end to this dont pretend to miss
you and you would not repent for sitting on my elephant and
am i crazy to join the lazy zoo
all these human butterflies and cactus flowers swollen eyes and
i want the devils share of you i do declare
again im asking can i do when all these animals want
to be just like you

verse 4
i met a girl with long black hair and she opened up so wide
a daffodil growing in brazil and i picked her for my bride

chorus
we are all just soldiers in this epic loving flight
and no one that i know has ever really done it right

outro
done it right
done it right
done it right
done it right1embed"
