verse 2
the sun is fun the land is dandy
i only talk to dogs because they dont understand me
my teeth are yellow hello world
would you like me a little better if they were white like yours
i need to purge my urges shame shame shame
i need an alibi to justify somebody to blame
its a halibut party bitch give it a name and say hey hey
