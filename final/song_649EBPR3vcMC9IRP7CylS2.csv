as time was ticking we were winning
and it all was going as planned
politicians stand between the
lines of making headlines street signs
saying youre going the wrong way
fading faster now

chorus
you can try to break us
and make us fall apart
but the fires in our hearts
reminisce on memories cause were gone
and dont forget to
hold back your thoughts and live like robots
cause we all know what goes on
reminisce on memories cause were gone
were gone so gone

verse 2
fallen soldiers all around us
but were still standing strong
embarrassing and contradicting
cause now were making headlines primetime
saying what a story
billboards packed tours
dont forget

you can try to break us
and make us fall apart
but the fires in our hearts
reminisce on memories cause were gone
and dont forget to
hold back your thoughts and live like robots
cause we all know what goes on
reminisce on memories cause were gone
were gone so gone

bridge
and game over youre done
out of left field we won
pack our bags
yeah well run
hollywood here we come

chorus
you can try to break us
and make us fall apart
the fires in our hearts
reminisce on memories cause were gone
and dont forget to
hold back your thoughts and live like robots
cause we all know what goes on
reminisce on memories cause were gone
were gone
outro
you can try to break us
and make us fall apart
but the fires in our hearts
reminisce on memories cause were gone1embed"
