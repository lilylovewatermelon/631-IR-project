thats what its like when you love me and you leave me this way
like a dove cryin out when hes lost the will to fly yeah
shackled down to the earth by your long chained lies well

ill forgive you tomorrow if the sun doesnt shine
let you back into my life when the oceans are dry
take you back when every shade of the rainbow turns gray
but i just cant do it today
i cant do it today

well i can see you dancin in that strangers arms
my world hasnt stopped turnin but its fallin apart
every breath that i takes a little closer to sane yeah
they say that time is a healer but its still a long long ways away
yeah

ill forgive you tomorrow if the sun doesnt shine
let you back into my life when the oceans are dry
take you back when every shade of the rainbow turns gray
but i just cant do it today
i cant do it today

dont wanna do it today
theres a part of me that wishes i could just forget
but i havent found the mercy yet
no mercy yet

let you back into my life when the oceans are dry
take you back when every shade of the rainbow turns gray
but i just cant do it today

i just cant do it today

wanna do it today
cant do it today
