crowded streets are cleared away
one by one
hallowed heroes separate
as they run
youre so cold
keep your hand in mine
wise men wonder while strong men die

chorus
show me how it ends its alright
show me how defenseless you really are
satisfy an empty inside
thats alright lets give this another try

verse 2
if you find your family
dont you cry
in this land of make believe
dead and dry
youre so cold but you feel alive
lay your hand on me one last time

chorus
show me how it ends its alright
show me how defenseless you really are
satisfy an empty inside
thats alright lets give this another try
show me how it ends its all right
show me how defenseless you really are
satisfied and empty inside
well thats alright lets give this another try
