i keep purple stuff all in my cup 84s when im rollin up
i got them tv screens fallin down
purple stuff all in my cup 84s when im rollin up
get high ride whip swervin side to side

juicy j
get high ride whip swervin side to side
on a sunday afternoon you can see it in my eyes
i been chiefin like an indian player this the shit
ridin down to the park strip hollan at a bitch
put your foot on the brakes then hit the gas and make it flick
then watch the hoes start lookin but they cant off in my tint
cause its some players out this motherfucker ridin in the backseat
but before you wanna get off in my whip you gotta suck me

crunchy black
you got me leanin to the right you got me leanin to the left
i done sipped so much syrrrp i might not think i need some help
you mix three fuckin hoes and a two liter of player
then you better go get you a freaky little girl
you ask her do she smoke weed and that bitch holla yeah
she pulled out some cigars and some weed with purple hairs
then my kinfolks call and say that he got purple dank
and i turned that fuckin corner headed to the purple drank
