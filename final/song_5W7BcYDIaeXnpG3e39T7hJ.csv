cut the music up
a little louder yeah

chorus
you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
never really had luck couldn’t never figure out
how to love how to love
you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
now you in a corner tryna put it together
how to love how to love
for a second you were here now you over there
its hard not to stare the way youre moving your body
like you never had a love never had a love

verse 1
when you was just a youngin your looks were so precious
but now youre grown up so fly its like a blessing
but you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
without you being insecure
you never credit yourself so when you got older
it seems like you came back ten times over
now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

chorus
see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
never really had luck couldn’t never figure out
how to love how to love
see you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
now you in a corner tryna put it together
how to love how to love
for a second you were here now you over there
its hard not to stare the way youre moving your body
like you never had a love had a love
see lil wayne liveget tickets as low as 80you might also likeverse 2
you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
the fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
but it wasn’t your fault wasnt in your intentions
to be the one here talking to me be the one listening
but i admire your poppin bottles and dippin
just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
baby so don’t be mad nobody else trippin
you see a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

chorus
you see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
never really had luck couldn’t never figure out
how to love how to love
see you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
now you in this corner tryna put it together
how to love how to love

bridge
see i just want you to know that you deserve the best
you’re beautiful you’re beautiful
yeah and i want you to know
you’re far from the usual far from the usual

chorus
you see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
never really had luck couldn’t never figure out
how to love how to love
see you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
now you in this corner tryna put it together
how to love how to love
see you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
never really had luck couldn’t never figure out
how to love how to love yeah
you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
now you in this corner tryna put it together
