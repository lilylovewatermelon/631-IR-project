we are the ones who survive
this is the sound that brings us together
you are the one by our side

and through it all and through it all the spirits alive
and through it all your spirits alive

you are the memory that lives on forever
the shadow that stands by our side
this is the sound that keeps us together
we are the ones who survive

and through it all and through it all the spirits alive
and through it all your spirits alive

farewell my brother youre off to the big rink in the sky
the good lords between the pipes
and youve got bavis and ace on the wing

we are the ones who will never be broken
we are the ones who survive

and through it all and through it all the spirits alive
and through it all your spirits alive
