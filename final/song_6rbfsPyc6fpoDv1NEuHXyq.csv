see me i put in work man i been doing dirt
for so long them niggas get laid out laid out
niggas run through my crib to holla at the kid
thats when i start bringing them thangs out thangs out
then we go through the strip hanging up out the whip
dumping clips off at they whole clique mane clique mane
when witnesses around they know how we get down
so when the cops come they aint see shit mane shit mane
my soldiers slanging caine sunny snowy sleet or rain
come through the hood and you can cop that cop that
im sittin on some change gunit thats the gang
come through here stunting youll get popped at popped at

verse 3 50 cent
my twenty inches spinning you always see me grinning
and you hear niggas call me grimy grimy
they hit me with them bricks and i aint pay em shit
im outta town they cant find me find me
when i come back around man ima back em down
i run up busting that tec mane tec mane
if you aint got a gun and you cant fucking run
my advice is you hit the deck mane deck mane
but if you get away and come back another day
my soldiersll leave you wet mane wet mane
cause we know where you be and we know where you stay
and well come checking through your set mane set mane
man you heard what i said now get it in your head
i aint paying no fucking debt mane debt mane
cause yous a middle man what you dont understand
yous a fucking fakeass connect mane connect mane
