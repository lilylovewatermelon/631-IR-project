jack and diane painted a picture of my life and my dreams
suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
well i heard it today and i couldnt help but sing along
because every time i hear that song

chorus
i go back to a two toned short bed chevy
driving my first love out to the levee
living life with no sense of time
and i go back to the feel of a fifty yard line
a blanket a girl some raspberry wine
wishing time would stop right in its tracks
every time i hear that song i go back
i go back

verse 2
i used to rock all night long to keep on rocking me baby
frat parties college bars just trying to impress the ladies
well i heard it today and i couldnt help but sing along
because every time i hear that song

chorus
and i go back to the smell of an old gym floor
and the taste of salt on a carolina shore
after graduation and drinking goodbye to friends
and i go back to watchin summer fade to fall
growin up too fast and i do recall
wishin time would stop right in its tracks
everytime i hear that song i go back
i go back
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likebridge
we all have a song that somehow stamped our lives
takes us to another place and time

chorus
so i go back to a pew preacher and a choir
singing bout god brimstone and fire
and the smell of sunday chicken after church
and i go back to the loss of a real good friend
and the sixteen summers i shared with him
now only the good die young stops me in my tracks
every time i hear that song
i go back

verse 3
i go back
to the feel of a fifty yard line
a blanket a girl some raspberry wine
i go back i go back
to watching summer fade to fall
growing up too fast and i do recall
i go back i go back
to the loss of a real good friend
and the sixteen summers i shared with him
i go back i go back i go back3embed"
