it ain’t rained in four months
one cigarette spark’ll burn the whole town up
that ole well is plum dry
city put a limit on the water you can buy
we don’t mind cause round here
we save water and drink beer

chorus
ice cold genuine raise ‘em up drip ‘em dry
hollar and swaller ya’ll support your local wildlife
do your part around here
just save water and drink beer

verse 2
we’re going green hey look at us
we’re maybe even doing just a little too much
poppin’ tops getting’ tans
and that’s the price we’ll pay
til the long drought ends
we help the world ‘round here
we save water and drink beer
