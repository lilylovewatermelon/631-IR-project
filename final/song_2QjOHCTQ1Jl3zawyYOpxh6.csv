and all i am is a man
i want the world in my hands
i hate the beach but i stand
in california with my toes in the sand
use the sleeves of my sweater lets have an adventure
head in the clouds but my gravitys centered
touch my neck and ill touch yours
you in those little highwaisted shorts oh

prechorus
she knows what i think about
and what i think about
one love two mouths
one love one house
no shirt no blouse
just us you find out
nothing that i wouldnt wanna tell you about no

chorus
cause its too cold for you here and now
so let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater

verse 2
and if i may just take your breath away
i dont mind if theres not much to say
sometimes the silence guides a mind
to move to a place so far away
the goosebumps start to raise
the minute that my left hand meets your waist
and then i watch your face
put my finger on your tongue cause you love the taste yeah
these hearts adore
everyone the other beats hardest for
inside this place is warm
outside it starts to pour

one love two mouths
one love one house
no shirt no blouse
just us you find out
nothin that i wouldnt wanna tell you about
no no no
