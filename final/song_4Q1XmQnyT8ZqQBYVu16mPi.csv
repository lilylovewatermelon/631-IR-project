if someone else showed you the way
would you take the wheel and steer
it hurts me that youre not ashamed
of what youre doing here
if they jumped off a bridge
would you meet them on the ground
or would you try to claim
that it never made a sound

chorus
everyone plays the hand theyre dealt
and learns to walk through life themselves
not everything in life is handed on a plate
when people think your words are true
it doesnt matter what you do
i sold my soul to get here how about you

verse 2
so you choose to force your hand
what a strange way to make friends
and you always change the rules
so the drama never ends
and you blindly go through life
judging only by its worth
just try not to forget
that the meek inherit earth

everyone plays the hand theyre dealt
and learns to walk through life themselves
not everything in life is handed on a plate
when people think your words are true
it doesnt matter what you do
i sold my soul to get here how about you

bridge
so please dont take offense
this is just a point of view
cause im the only one who
will say these things to you

chorus
everyone plays the hand theyre dealt
and learns to walk through life themselves
not everything in life is handed on a plate
when people think your words are true
it doesnt matter what you do
i sold my soul to get here how about you1embed"
