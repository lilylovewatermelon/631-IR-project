she likes it when i call in sick to work
spend the whole day hangin with her
i might get fired but thats alright
im doin what she likes
she likes it when i bring home fresh fajitas
and mix up a pitcher of margaritas
catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
doin what she likes

chorus
she likes hearin how good she looks in them blue jeans
little kisses sweeter than sweet tea
things i whispered in her ear oh my
i like doin what she likes
like runnin my fingers through her long hair
lightin watermelon candles upstairs
lettin them burn and holdin her all night
i like doin what she likes

verse 2
she likes it when i get past second gear
sees gravel flyin in the rearview mirror
sometimes im pushin 95
doin what she likes
and she likes it when i find a road thats dark
can we pull up somewhere and park
turn the radio on and turn off the lights
keep doin what she likes
see blake shelton liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likechorus
she likes hearin how good she looks in them blue jeans
little kisses sweeter than sweet tea
things i whispered in her ear oh my
i like doin what she likes
like runnin my fingers through her long hair
lightin watermelon candles upstairs
lettin them burn and holdin her all night
i like doin what she likes

bridge
she likes it when i sing her old silly songs
and throwin words where they dont belong
sometimes we laugh til we almost cry
doin what she likes
doin what she likes

chorus
she likes hearin how good she looks in them blue jeans
little kisses sweeter than sweet tea
things i whispered in her ear oh my
i like doin what she likes
like runnin my fingers through her long hair
lightin watermelon candles upstairs
lettin them burn and holdin her all night
i like doin what she likes
outro
