and just how much i loved her
i wrote a song about her
how wrong could i be

oh well she went and found another
found another lover
she didnt even bother
to say goodbye to me

things have changed
shes found another
yes things have changed
shes found another lover

things have changed
she didnt say goodbye
instead she made me cry
diana

ill learn to live without her
yes ill forget about her
just wait and see

things will change ill find another lover
things will change ill learn to live without her
things will change im gonna make her cry
im gonna say goodbye to diana
