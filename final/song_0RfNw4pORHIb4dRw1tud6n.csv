attention attention everyone
i got a couple of things i would like to get off of my chestâ€‹
ha ha friends who the fuck needs them
you know who you are

verse 1
caught like a fly in a web of your lies
its truth be told now or its meet your demise
so how did it feel when you held the knife
that you stuck right in my back a thousand times

verse 2
your grandfather would probly roll in his grave
if he knew of that person that you had became
oh i will not just lay down and take this
not again not again

prechorus
oh you have left my heart black and blue
oh just like your father did to you

chorus
how does it feel knowing youre barely alive
seeing through bloodshot eyes youre left empty inside
where i was strung out and drug through the mud
i must agree youre just like me
see falling in reverse liveget tickets as low as 105you might also likeverse 3
and when you die i wont be at your wake
no eulogy from me just a smile on my face
and while god might be busy with judging your soul
i will have slept with the girl that you love most

prechorus
you have left my heart black and blue
just like your father did to you

chorus
how does it feel knowing youre barely alive
seeing through bloodshot eyes youre left empty inside
where i was strung out and drug through the mud
i must agree youre just like me

guitar solo

instrumental break

chorus
now how does it feel knowing youre barely alive
seeing through bloodshot eyes youre left empty inside
where i was strung out and drug through the mud
i must agree youre just like me
outro
im no fucking saint but at least i will fucking sing about it
oh the audacity8embed"
