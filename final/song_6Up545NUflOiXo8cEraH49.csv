i keep fighting voices in my mind that say im not enough
every single lie that tells me i will never measure up
am i more than just the sum of every high and every low
remind me once again just who i am because i need to know
ooh oh

chorus
you say i am loved when i cant feel a thing
you say i am strong when i think i am weak
and you say i am held when i am falling short
and when i dont belong oh you say i am yours
and i believe i oh i believe i
what you say of me i
i believe

verse 2
the only thing that matters now is everything you think of me
in you i find my worth in you i find my identity

and you say i am held when i am falling short
