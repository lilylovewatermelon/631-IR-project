swirling noise uncertainty
shut my eyes you pulled me in
deep into a dark current

drown me slowly in the night
lies reflecting in your eyes

trapped inside a fantasy
sinking in my misery
you know only to deceive
love can be illusory

don’t say sorry i won’t cry
lies reflecting in your eyes

there is no transparency
you’re just a faded memory
empty words you never meant
i’ll never let you in again

drown me slowly in the night
lies reflecting in your eyesyou might also likeembed"
