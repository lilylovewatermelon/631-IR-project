i was on my way to the center of the sun
when i lost my wings and i fell into a crowd
and they carried me to a hole in the ground
and they buried me where no one could see
and no one would be around

chorus
i am a virus
i live in silence

verse 2
i was on my way to a city in the clouds
when i lost my mind and i had to settle down
then i had a dream of an island in the sea where the lepers die
where no one survives and no one can hear the cries

chorus
i am a virus
i live in silence

verse 3
just like heathens thinking
on our feet well believe in god
with one step two steps three steps toward the graveyard
on the high road to remembering
it seems that we forgot

i am a virus
i live in silenceembed"
