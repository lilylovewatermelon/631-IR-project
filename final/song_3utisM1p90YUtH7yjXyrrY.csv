intro the last poets
radar sonar laser beams
jets tanks submarines
megathons hbombs napalm ga—

verse 1
i got the shit you would light with a lighter
fuck a lighter i could light on the stove
dark at night ill drop a log on the fire
wander in the woods out in the cold
i got the shit you could play for your mama
i got the shit you could play for the hoes
i got the shit you could sell to the trappers
in decatur with the k and the colt
i know some rappers that—how ima say this
i know some rappers who paid but broke
lotta money but you played your soul
you played yourself you played the role
i know some niggas from down the street
some of my niggas been down the road
lost a nigga that was down with me
you know what they say it rains it pours

chorus
it rains it pours
ooh we have a penalty flag thrown at the thirty yard line
personal foul unsportsmanlike conduct number six on the defense fifty it rains it pours
it rains it pours
you might also likeverse 2
they got the shit they could pull out
i know it could blow out a back yeah
they got the cure to the vax
facts you know where its at
they put the money the crack in a sack
they got the axis they got the atlas they got the maps
i got a real real real bad bitch
i just told her to come to the back oh man
they got the people in office
them crackers that had us in chains
they make the laws they goin hard
dang they even started a gang
how you gon win in a losable game
make a change man niggas say the same thing
every day complain and the sun shine
and the cloud rain but wont lift a finger
in the danger niggas been endangered
been indentured now my niggas got business ventures
with my 9 im like ten avengers
snap a finger i could end adventures
rapper singer no killer nigga
you a cop or you a nigga killer woah

outro
it rains it pours
it rains it pours ooh we have a penalty flag thrown at the thirtyyard line
personal foul unsportsmanlike conduct
it rains it pours
number 6 on the defense
it rains it pours
part ii

intro
man they wont understand man oh shit
and man they wont understand man fucked up
and man they wont understand uh
i live in harmony and peace
and the sun will once again rise up in the east see

verse
somebody told me when i was small
that the pride cometh right before the fall
god son died for us all
so for mine im running through a wall
lost a battle its still a war
ima steal the cattle then burn the farm
we could travel but the journey long
i prefer we get a lil murder on
drop the top on your convertible
how we feelin should concern you
we been speakin but aint never been heard
so now we screamin at you wordforword
everything a nigga learned gotta burn
my lil nigga in a hearse i was hurt
fuck a rap and fuck a verse i could blur it
tryna see how many urns i could earn
are you entertained or are you concerned
id be afraid id be in church
id say a pray i pray i say i say i shade
they play like god no playbyplay
we take our charge we take our place
itll take our hearts itll take our faith
but we need the majority to make shit shake
ima get me a quarter ima get in a car
and ima get on a call and go statebystate
and im picking the target then im picking them off
you better be beyoncé if you say my name
orange ambient sunlight and daylight savings
might save a niggas life
it aint never too bright to broad day a nigga
night time vampires and theyll slay a nigga
its not like landslide so you can take their slide
im a canine straight in the pack lookin for jiddy hes takin it back
crackin a whip whippin the crack
just like them crackers that did to the blacks
just like they thought i was finished attacking
a beast awoken i peel at the crackin
they inferior and fear when im rappin
but i aint rappin this is spiritual
shed a tear so itll curate when miracles happen huh
mirror mirror why the fuck is you laughing
dear dear let me volunteer cause im not in fear
ima jump in the ashes ooh
oh shit its getting weird
nah shit is weird what the hell is heaven on this hemisphere
if them bitches sell it ima end it here
if we come together we can send a message
but i know they never gonna land it here
so i got the method one do you better
do you want better
bitch you wont do it lets bet i will
collect my stones ho collect my gems
protect my stronghold respect my shield
until im long gone but while im here
i can snap my fingers theyll disappear boom
