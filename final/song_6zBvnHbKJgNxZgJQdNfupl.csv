if i survey all the good things that come to me from above
if i count all the blessings from the storehouse of love
id simply ask for the favor of him beyond mortal king
and im sure he would grant it again

chorus
i want to stroll over heaven with you some glad day
when all our troubles and heartaches are vanished away
then well enjoy the beauty where all things are new
i want to stroll over heaven with you

verse 2
so many places of beauty we long to see here below
but time and treasures have kept us from making plans as you know
but come the morning of rapture together well stand a new
while i stroll over heaven with you

chorus
i want to stroll over heaven with you some glad day
when all our troubles and heartaches are vanished away
then well enjoy the beauty where all things are new
i want to stroll over heaven with yousee alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeembed"
