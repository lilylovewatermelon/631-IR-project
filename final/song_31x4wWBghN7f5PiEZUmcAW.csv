smooth
like a tennessee walker
just a walking on the water
youre smooth
like a sunday morning elvis singing gospel
its a hell of a
groove
like the lines on her mercury
girl youre put together perfectly

chorus
good lord almighty
girl you go down good
you aint even trying
cause you wrote the book
there aint nobody
that do me like you
the way you move that body
girl youre so smooth

verse 2
like cat daddy driving a caddy from cali baby
youre smooth
like young love buzzing
off an old camp bottle by the
moon
blackberry jam fingerlicking
off your hand flying out the window
you might also likechorus
good lord almighty
girl you go down good
you aint even trying
cause you wrote the book
there aint nobody there aint nobody
that do me like you do me like you
the way you move that body the way you move that body
girl youre so smooth so smooth
smooth smooth

bridge
youre a stroke on the canvas
a brick road to kansas
my little summer time jam jam jam

chorus
good lord almighty
girl you go down good
you aint even trying
cause you wrote the book
there aint nobody there aint nobody
that do me like you do me like you
the way you move that body the way you move that body
girl youre so smooth so smooth
smooth smooth you so smooth
