like a flower waiting to bloom
like a lightbulb in a dark room
im just sitting here waiting for you
to come on home and turn me on

verse 2
like the desert waiting for the rain
like a schoolkid waiting for the spring
im just sitting here waiting for you
to come on home and turn me on

verse 3
and my poor heart its been so dark
since youve been gone
after all youre the one who turns me off
but youre the only one who can turn me back on

verse 4
my hifi is waiting for a new tune
my glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes
im just sitting here waiting for you
to come on home and turn me on
