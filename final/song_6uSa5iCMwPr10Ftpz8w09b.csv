love
so many things ive got to tell you
but im afraid i dont know how
cause theres a possibility
that youll look at me differently
love
ever since the first moment i spoke your name
from then on i knew that by you being in my life
things were destined to change cause

chorus
love
so many people use your name in vain
love
those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
love
through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
love
for better or worse i still will choose you first

verse 2
many days ive longed for you
wanting you
hoping for the chance to get to know you
longing for your kiss
for your touch your feel your presence
many nights ive cried from the things you do
felt like i could die from the thought of losing you
i know that youre real
with no doubts and no fears
and no questions
