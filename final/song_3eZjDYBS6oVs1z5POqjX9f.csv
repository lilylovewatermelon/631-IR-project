verse 1
yeah
gimme my space lord aint enough time to chase
all these dreams nah mean i got no time to wait
love my girl but i told her straight up dont wait up
stumble home late im drunk we fucked and made up
used to living free as a bird but now im laid up
feelin like a nigga got handcuffs on
how the fuck did my life become a damn love song
she ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
but a nigga wan be a nigga be a nigga
ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
shell never understand what its like to be a man
knowin when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
and you dont wan let her down
but you too young for the settle down
and maybe you can thug it out learn what is love about
when you cant live with her and you cant live without
aw shit goddamn i think the devil got his hands on me
stripper saying baby wont you throw them bands on me
and i came to spend
she pop a molly let the motherfuckin games begin
im running away

verse 2
when its all said and done everybody dies
in this life aint no happy endings
only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
the preacher say we were made in image of lord
to which i replied are you sure
even a murderer even a whore
even a nigga running through bitches on tour
with a good girl at home folding clothes and shit
she losin faith in him and he knows the shit like what the fuck is a break
dont know how much i can take no more
i give you all i got til it aint no more
no more tears its been ten long years
damn near i dont know if i can wait no more
and who can blame her you complain about
every time you out you come back she poutin
sleeping back to back this is wack we bout
to go platinum and im in the crib acting out
my childhood fantasies of wife and home
but its a whole lot of actresses id like to bone
and despite the rumors you hold out
on account of your guilt and she has got to spend her nights alone
and she ride or die like eve and em
make homecooked meals every evenin
and even in your lowest days
when youre no longer superman at least you know you got lois lane
but you

verse 3
yeah
unbelievable seen evil that not even knievel know
at age three i knew this world was three below
listen even though my ego low achieved the unachievable
imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
this just in fucked more bitches than bieber though
still i keep it low got my niggas on the need to know
basis my manager back in the days was racist
i was a young boy passing skates and tucking laces
old perverted white man who told me jermaine
its all pink on the inside fuck what color they face is
wise words from an indecent man
made me reflect on the times when we was threefifths of them
in chains and powerless brave souls reduced to cowardice
slaving in the baking sun for hours just
to see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
nine months later got a baby thats
not quite what you expected but you
refuse to neglect it cause you
know your wifey loves you thus you refuse to accept it
thatâ€™s the type of shit that turned my granny lightskinned
rich white men rule the nation still
only difference is we all slaves now the chains concealed
in our thoughts if i follow my heart to save myself
could i run away from fiftymill like dave chappelle
you know
