sunshine
there aint a thing that you can do thats gonna ruin my night
but theres just something about
this dizzy dreamer and her bleeding little blue boy
licking your fingers like youre done and
youve decided there is so much more than me oh
and baby honestly its harder breathing next to you i shake
i brought a gun and as the preacher tried to stop me
hold my heart its beating for you anyway

chorus jeremy mckinnon  vic fuentes
what if i cant forget you oh
ill burn your name into my throat
ill be the fire thatll catch you
whats so good about picking up the pieces
none of the colors ever light up anymore in this hole
oh
verse 2 vic fuentes
nobody prays for the heartless no
nobody gives another penny for the selfish
youre learning how to taste what you kill now
dont mind me im just reaching for your necklace
talking to my mom about this little girl from texas

collide invisible lips like a shadow on the wall
and just throw oh no
