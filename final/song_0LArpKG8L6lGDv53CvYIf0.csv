out of time to decide
do we run should i hide
for the rest of my life

can we fly do i stay
we could lose we could fail
in the moment it takes
to make plans or mistakes

30 minutes a blink of an eye
30 minutes to alter our lives
30 minutes to make up my mind
30 minutes to finally decide

30 minutes to whisper your name
30 minutes to shoulder the blame
30 minutes of bliss thirty lies
30 minutes to finally decide

carousels in the sky
that we shape with our eyes
under shade silhouettes
casting shade crying rain

can we fly do i stay
we could lose we could fail
either way options change
chances fail trains derail

30 minutes to alter our lives
30 minutes to make up my mind
30 minutes to finally decide

30 minutes to whisper your name
30 minutes to shoulder the blame
30 minutes of bliss thirty lies
30 minutes to finally decide

to decide to decide
to decide to decide
to decide to decide
to decide to decide
to decideembed"
