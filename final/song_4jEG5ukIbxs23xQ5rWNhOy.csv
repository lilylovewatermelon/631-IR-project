put me on a lake with biggin on the line
put me round a campfire cookin something i just cleaned
you do your thing ill do mine

i aint tradin in my familys safety
just to save on a little gas
and ill pray to god any place any time
and you can bet ill pick up the phone if uncle sam calls me up
you do your thing ill do mine

hey ill worry about me
you just worry about you
and ill believe what i believe
and you can believe what you believe too

i aint gonna spare the rod
cuz that aint what my daddy did
and i sure know the difference between wrong and right
you know to me its all just common sense
a broken rule a consequence
you do your thing ill do mine

hey ill worry about me
you just worry about you
and ill believe what i believe
and you can believe what you believe too
you might also likeim gonna keep on working hard
make my money the oldfashioned way
i dont wanna piece of nobody elses pie
if i dont get my fill on life i aint gonna blame no one but me
you do your thing ill do mine

you aint gonna be my judge
cuz my judge will judge us all one day
you do your thing ill do mineembed"
