its all pretty much the same stuff day after day
the only thing that keeps me goin
seems to be our baby girl im trying to raise
shes my life my morning angel
always seems to find the rainbow after the rain
lately shes so busy growin
i dont even think she knows youve gone away

chorus
she finally learned to say goodbye
shes sleepin through the night
she dont wake up cryin
and shes walking on her own
she dont need no one holdin to her hand
and i hate to admit shes stronger than i am

she aint crackin under pressure
first one step and then another she goes along
if she falls and skins her knee
she cries awhile and smiles at me and just goes on
so many things that she can teach me
full of life and so completely innocent
she still says she loves her daddy
goes on just like nothin happened
forgives and forgets
see lee ann womack liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likerepeat chorus

shes just like her old man
stronger than i amembed"
