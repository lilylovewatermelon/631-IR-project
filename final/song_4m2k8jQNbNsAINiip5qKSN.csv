i remember when it used to be simple
but all this cash it just complicates things
and all this money that we into
itll drive you crazy but it only make me go harder grow stronger
and get tougher when the road get longer
sometimes you gon think its too much on ya
but think what id be doing if this wasnt goin on
so i just keep pushin when im being pulled in every direction
now im poppin so the they watchin every step of my progression
sometimes fame like a curse latched to my blessing
on the road to the riches turning earth into heaven now
dear lord if ya hear me i dont need not a new friend near me
cause i dont want none of that fake love
cause how im looking at it all of that be made up

chorus
i remember when i wasnt this big
and now yall wanna act like yall helped me get here
oh now everybody wanna love me
tried to knock me down but im strong
did all this on my own
aint got no time for no new friends
so for now just leave me alone
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall

making each and every song like it might be my last one
but still making sure the cash come
still aint forget the times when i didnt have none
back against the wall feeling like i had to grab sumn
thats when i took time and i figured it out
id rather deal with the stressin more than living without
take a one way trip to the top one time
let you have it for a minute now i want mine
same girl on the cover of the magazine
was the one hiding pain that you hadnt seen
talkin bout no money no family
sixteen in the middle of miami
same critics love me nowadays couldnt stand me
now we talkin bout vmas and a grammy
but in due time turn nothin into somethin
so now i need money put in all of my discussions

chorus
i remember when i wasnt this big
and now yall wanna act like yall helped me get here
oh now everybody wanna love me
tried to knock me down but im strong
did all this on my own
aint got no time for no new friends
so for now just leave me alone
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall
verse 3
and if you wasnt here when i was down
then you wont be here when im up
now the same one you looked over
be the same one that blew up
aint it funny how this life thing works
when you think its finished is when it all begins
go from doubts to havin the thought it might work
it goes up and down and then it starts again
and when i reminisce sometimes i
cant even keep a dry eye
but my how time flies by
when you on top of the world sky high

chorus
i remember when i wasnt this big
and now yall wanna act like yall helped me get here
oh now everybody wanna love me
tried to knock me down but im strong
did all this on my own
aint got no time for no new friends
so for now just leave me alone
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall anyway
i dont need yall50embed"
