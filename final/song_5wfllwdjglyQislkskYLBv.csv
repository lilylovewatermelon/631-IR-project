verse 1
day and night
i toss and turn i keep stress in my mind mind
i look for peace but see i dont attain
what i need for keeps this silly game we play play
now look at this
madness the magnet keeps attracting me me
i try to run but see im not that fast
i think im first but surely finish last last

cause day and night
the lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
hes all alone through the day and night
the lonely loner seems to free his mind at night at at at night

the lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
hes all alone some things will never change
the lonely loner seems to free his mind at night at at at night

the lonely stoner mr solo dolo

within his dreams he sees the life he made made
the pain is deep
a silent sleeper you wont hear a peep peep
the girl he wants dont seem to want him too
it seems the feelings that she had are through through
