its crazy
im still here livin this lifestyle with the niggas i came with
i always just did what i had to do i never tried bein a gangster
my hand on the tooly while im on the stage fuck it now i gotta play dangerous
to keep it a hundred i rather the money i never wanted to be famous
to keep it a hundred these niggas be buggin just run up on me if you anxious
and niggas be totin the grip for no reason and dont even know how to aim it
by the look on your face i can tell youre in your feelings trust me you dont gotta say shit
and i dont even wanna feel how you feel baby i wanna be painless
whatever you wanna do im off of 42 and i do not want no chaser
and you need a nigga that handle your attitude but im a nigga with paper
you probably just love me for my lifestyle how i pull up in the latest
but i could read you like a book i just be over here flippin through pages

interlude melody
hmm

mmm
miss you i love you

verse 2 a boogie wit da hoodie
i love you too
and girl ima love you forever you know this already you know its true
and even when im gone ima be with you forever unplugable
before i even thought about going half on a baby
girl even your moms could tell you all about it baby im crazy
if they ever try to throw shots ill dive in front of you
i know i be fuckin up baby but dont you go lookin for something new
i dont wanna lay up with none of these bitches i wanna lay up with you
and i aint no dummy these bitches be lovin me cause of my revenue
they be tellin you rumors spreadin rumors that was never true yeah
only want me to lose cause im makin too much to be sweatin you
and niggas be sellin records off of hype now that aint nothin new yeah
and my diamonds be goin off without a light now yeah its crazy
my diamonds be goin off without a light now niggas rockin fugazi
and everywhere i go im hearin my style niggas gon have to pay me
i bought me a lam and promised myself that id never go back to mercedes
