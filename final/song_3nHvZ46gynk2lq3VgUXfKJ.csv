verse 1
girl you know i meant to call you that night
dont talk about that im calling you now
im feeling horny and i want you so bad
im picturing that im seeing your mouth
i remember what you said you do with your lips
said you know all types of tricks
are you ready for a taste of this yeah
i hope so im ready to be exposed
do every little single detail that you told me

prechorus
yeah i know that you talk a good game
but tonight youll say my name
i wanna kiss you on your private spot
and i hope you do the same
and when im done dont be telling your friends
our relationship will end
so keep it on the low
i wanna do you slow for sure
youre not my girl so just keep your mouth closed

ive been hearing that youre freaky
and youve been trying to get at me
