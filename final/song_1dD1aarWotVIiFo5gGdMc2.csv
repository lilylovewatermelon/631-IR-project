once in a lifetime its just right
we make no mistakes
not even a landslide or riptide
could take it all away

right now my heart is beating the same
out loud someones calling my name
it sounds like you

when i close my eyes
all the stars align
and you are by my side
you are by my side

not even the bad guys in the dark night
could take it all away
