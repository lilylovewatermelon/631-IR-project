see this in 3d all lights out for me
all lights out for me lightning strikes the beach
eighty degrees warm it up for me
finally free found the god in me
and i want you to see i can walk on water
thousand miles from shore i can float on the water
father hold me close dont let me drown
i know you wont

verse 1 lil baby
yeah walkin on the bridge i threw my sins over the deep end
sippin til my stomach hurt this month i done lost three friends
early mornin brainstormin normally i cant sleep in
sometimes i just wanna restart it but it all depends
if ima be that same young hungry  from west end
wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part i aint have no pen
maybach interior camе with sheepskin
still remember whеn i just had three bands
now im the one everyone call on cause i got deep pants
bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
never fazed by names that they might call me but they gon respect it
and i feel like you better off tryin to call i might not get the message
and she just tried to run off with my heart but i blocked off the exit yeah

bridge the weeknd  kaycyy

i know you wont i know that you look over us i know
so we silently sleep
bring down the rain yeah oh

mmmmmmmmmm i was out for self
mmmmmmmmmm i was up for sale but i couldnt tell
god made it rain the devil made it hail
dropped out of school but im that one at yale
made the best tracks and still went off the rail
had to go down down down this the new town town town
this the new ten ten ten im goin in in in
here i go on a new trip here i go actin too lit
here i go actin too rich here i go with a new chick
and i know what the truth is still playin after two kids
its a lot to digest when your life always movin
architectural digest but i needed home improvement
sixtymilliondollar home never went home to it
genius gone clueless its a whole lot to risk
alcohol anonymous whos the busiest loser
heated by the rumors read into it too much
fiendin for some true love ask kim what do you love
hard to find what the truth is but the truth was that the truth suck
always seem to do stuff but this time it was too much
mmmmmmmmmm everybody so judgemental
everybody so judgemental
everybody hurts but i dont judge rentals
mmmmmmmmmm it was all so simple

chorus the weeknd
i see you in 3d the dawn is bright for me
no more dark for me i know youre watchin me
eighty degrees burnin up the leaves
finally im free finally im free
as i go out to sea i can walk on water
wont you shine your light demons talk on my shoulder
father hold me close dont let me drown
i know you wont157embed"
