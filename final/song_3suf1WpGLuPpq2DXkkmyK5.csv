burns in the sun
lives for no one
salt on your tongue
lights out no fun
drink to forget
dont get upset
open your mouth
you look so
out of it

chorus
pull it together
we could love you
forever and ever
pull it together
we could love you
forever and ever

verse 2
made up a game
no pain no gain
until you break
make no mistake

chorus
i will pull it together
you can love me
forever and ever
i will pull it together
you can love me
forever and everyou might also like1embed"
