we took a walk that night but it wasnt the same
we had a fight on the promenade out in the rain
she said she loved me but she had somewhere to go
she couldnt scream while i held her close
i swore id never let her go

chorus
tell me what you wanna know
oh come on oh come on oh come on
there aint no motive for this crime
jenny was a friend of mine
so come on oh come on oh come on
oh oh oh

verse 2
i know my rights ive been here all day and its time
for me to go so let me know if its alright
i just cant take this i swear i told you the truth
she couldnt scream while i held her close
i swore id never let her go oh

chorus
tell me what you wanna know
oh come on oh come on oh come on
and then you whisper in my ear
i know what youre doin here
so come on oh come on oh come on
there aint no motive for this crime
jenny was a friend of mine
