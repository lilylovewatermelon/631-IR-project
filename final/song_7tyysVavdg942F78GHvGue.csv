i got a question fo you hatin ass niggas out there ay ay
why you mad at me ay
oh lame ass nigga why you mad at me
sucka ass nigga why you mad at me

verse 1
remember late nights earn stripes serving straight white
talk shit slapbox clear into the day light
might fuss may fight but stay tight
keep what the j need fore the lighter hit the base pipe
if the trap was the ocean or the sea
you could consider me and them the killa whales and great whites
before a nigga tried to click it make them think twice
cause they knew cap would kill a nigga fore you blink twice
they right im reciting my life
nigga i was there no matter what through sirens on a silent night
cold sundays slow mondays hot friday nights
tuesday thursdays serving whether or not they ride tonight
on peaceful days hostile evenings even violent nights
chip on my shoulder hold a grudge  cause you can die tonight
i swear you niggas have no idea what my life was like
before the bright lights and a half a mil just to grab the mic

hook
is it cause i came from the bottom to the topwhy you mad at me
maybe cause i spent a hundred on a drop why you mad at me
is it cause i kept it pimping and stayed down why you mad at me
or is it cause i am the atown thats why you mad at me
see ti liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likeis cause you a lame and im a g why you mad at me
is it cause i got love in the streets why you mad at me
is cause you know your time running out thats why you mad at me
is it cause you know im king of the south thats why you mad at me

verse 2
niggas mad cause i got it like this
gold on my wrist hoes on my dick my dick
but i could give a fuck about this industry
im a be the same tip til the end of me
thats something you know automatically if you a friend of me
you question that or think other wise now youve offended me
i came in this game not looking for a friend or enemy
found them both now that niggas in to me
got little rap niggas lighting into me
major labels and police want to censor me
feds on my ass cause im in the streets
think i still slang listen to lame niggas who lie to snitch on me
it aint my fault that you cant picture me
riding in a phantom man i swear i never fathomed
all the fame that a nigga can gain from atlanta
now im just trying to maintain for atlanta
before niggas was saying atlanta
i was grove park doug high  i stayed in atlanta
now true enough i sold yay in atlanta
but what is that compared to contributions i made to atlanta
hook
is it cause i came from the bottom to the topwhy you mad at me
maybe cause i spent a hundred on a drop why you mad at me
is it cause i kept it pimping and stayed down why you mad at me
or is it cause i am the atown thats why you mad at me

is cause you a lame and im a g why you mad at me
is it cause i got love in the streets why you mad at me
is cause you know your time running out thats why you mad at me
is it cause you know im king of the south thats why you mad at me

verse 3
ay pick a reason any reason all excusesll do
but man you lucky i aint bucking like i used to do fools
while you was throwing ones and twos
i was lifting up tools and then
shoot at his shoes just to see if he move
or either bust at his head to check if he dead man
dont talk around him cause i heard he the feds man
they offer him time and they knowing he scared and tell him
give me they names or you doing the stretch man
or wear a wire go record what he said
and then you can tell his lawyer that his clients a dead man
a rat im smelling blow i aint selling
where you got that impression aint no telling
yes im a felon why was that in question
what about all these records im selling
im bankhead born and bankhead bred
and when a nigga die im gone be bankhead dead
hook
is it cause i came from the bottom to the topwhy you mad at me
maybe cause i spent a hundred on a drop why you mad at me
is it cause i kept it pimping and stayed down why you mad at me
or is it cause i am the atown thats why you mad at me

is cause you a lame and im a g why you mad at me
is it cause i got love in the streets why you mad at me
is cause you know your time running out thats why you mad at me
is it cause you know im king of the south thats why you mad at meembed"
