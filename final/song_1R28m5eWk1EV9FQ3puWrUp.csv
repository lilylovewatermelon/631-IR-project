follow the light the light is your guide
i am controller of planet x threethree
and ive invited you here to discuss something thats very important

verse
king geedorah take me to your leader
quick to claim that he not no snake like me neither
they need to take a breather
he been rhyming longer than sigmund the sea creature
been on saturday feature
pleased to meet ya
and came to wake you up out the deep sleeper like
he needed to stop before he caught the kneedrop
even give you more zipzip than zz top
with full beers thou shall not ball corner
geedorah like one more steps and yalls goners
socalled rich front if you wanna
when he spit electrics dont be in yall saunas
he only here to warn us what the plan is
the hour is upon us its bananas
born alone die alone no matter who your man is
hope he live long enough to tell it to his grandkids
king geedorah threefinger ring fever
spring chicken eater ided as the ringleader
who needs a heater catch em with bare hands
these same hands that make razors out beer cans
his own biggest fan
and got a fan base as big as japan
uh yeah and
all hail the king and give him three cheers fam fam
like hip hip hooray
do his thing for the little kings like sling blade
to the grave put in work like a slave
on how to flip scripts on the dipstick brigade
rock em like sussussudio played
back when we used to rock the shag no fade
this skilled trade like a tailor made suede
hit the studio and im paid
half upfront half upon mastering
would you like that in cash last thing you should ask the king
you dont have to be no crystal ball reader
allergic to saltpeter used to be a war beater
in the game like a wall street cheater
a lot of rap noise is annoying like cita
turn into a triplex monster from a fairy tale movie
he dont know me very well do he
king geedorah crush on the seeds teacher
they need to pay em better she had nothing on the reefer
heifer and i had to offer her a stick of gum
she was as thick as they come and taught a strict curriculum dumb bitch
which is only good for my son
when im in the hood razors on tongue
nowadays its amazing raising young
rule number one keep your fazers on stunyou might also like28embed"
