sugar
sugar butter flour
sometimes i still see her
my mother the dreamer
shed say “nothings impossible child”

jenna becky  dawn
a dream needs believing
to taste like the real thing
like some stranger you recognize

becky  dawn jenna
so pure
so pure so electric  so electric
so sure
so sure so connected  so connected

jenna becky  dawn
to those little believers inside
may we all be so lucky

but dreams are elusive
the kind weve gotten used to is
you might also likejenna dawn becky
nothing i can feel
nothing i can hold
nothing i can have
nothing that i know

jenna becky  dawn
dreams come and they go

jenna becky  dawn
but hold them and keep them
but hold them and keep them
and know that you need them
and know that you need them

jenna
when your breaking points all that

jenna becky  dawn
you have

a dream is a soft place to land
may we all be so lucky
