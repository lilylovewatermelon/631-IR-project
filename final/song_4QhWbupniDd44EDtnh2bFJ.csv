refrain
oh oh oh oh
set the cheetahs on the loose
oh oh oh oh
theres a thief out on the move
oh oh oh oh
underneath our legions view
oh oh oh oh
they have taken cleopatra

bridge
run run run come back for my glory cleopatra
bring her back to me cleopatra
run run run the crown of our pharaoh cleopatra
the throne of our queen is empty cleopatra
verse 1
well run to the future shining like diamonds
in a rocky world rockyrocky world
our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
as we march to the rhythm on the palace floor
chandeliers inside the pyramids tremble from the force
cymbals crash inside the pyramids voices fill up the halls
you might also likerefrain
set the cheetahs on the loose
theres a thief out on the move
underneath our legions view
they have taken cleopatra cleopatra

verse 2
the jewel of africa jewel
what good is a jewel that aint still precious
how could you run off on me how could you run off on us
you feel like god inside that gold
i found you laying down with samson and his full head of hair
i found my black queen cleopatra bad dreams cleopatra

outro
remove her send the cheetahs to the tomb
our war is over our queen has met her doom
no more she lives no more serpent in her room
no more he has killed cleopatra cleopatra
part ii

segue
big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
wake up to your girl
for now lets call her cleopatra cleopatra
i watch you fix your hair
then put your panties on in the mirror cleopatra
then your lipstick cleopatra
then your sixinch heels catch her
shes headed to the pyramid

pimping in my convos
bubbles in my champagne let it be some jazz playing
top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
floor model tv with the vcr
got rubies in my damn chain
whip aint got no gas tank but it still got woodgrain
got your girl working for me
hit the strip and my bills paid
that keep my bills paid
hit the strip and my bills paid
keep a nigga bills paid

chorus
shes working at the pyramid tonight
