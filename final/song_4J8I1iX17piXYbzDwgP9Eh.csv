there’s a fire burnin in the basement
that i’d only stoke for you
freeze my whole life
if you felt warmth all the way through
you have given hope
where hope is hard to find
i hate the man i am
but i’ll love him when you’re mine

chorus
when you are mine
no i ain’t so angry
when you are mine
this world dont owe me a thing
since you are mine
oh the lord can take me
and i could die right now
with no qualms or questioning

verse 2
and there were pabst cans on the nightstand where your jewelry’s layin now
there’s times that made me anxious but there is beauty in finding out
how the good days come together like i always said they’d never
back when i was younger and the dark days kept me down

when you are mine
no i ain’t so angry
when you are mine
this world dont owe me a thing
since you are mine
oh the lord can take me
and i can die right now
with no qualms or questioning

verse 3
well there’s a fire burning in the basement
that’d i’d only stoke for you
freeze my whole life
if you felt warmth all the way through
and you have given hope
where hope is hard to find
i hate the man i am
but i’ll love him when you’re mineembed"
