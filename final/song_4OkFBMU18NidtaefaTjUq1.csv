only love could bring us
bring us to this bitter plane

verse 1
i know that im beneficial i cant show no feelings bentley windows tinted
nowadays aint no time for me to kick it business to attend to
they gon say that i been actin different im beyond they mental
i moved on from slangin drugs and pistols cant be thinkin simple
tighten up my circle someone in the camp been leakin info
the maybach triple black this shit relaxin feel like im in a limo
i pull through the hood to let em see i let down all the windows
i know im the motivation they see me they see a hero
lot of niggas rich but it hit different when you come from zero
they know i bang cs but every day i need a different b roll
super supertitious ask my niggas i still pick up pennies
you cant give attention to these bitches when your name get mentioned
if i dont kill him he gon be in critical condition when im finished with him
some shit just cant faze you when you been that nigga
brodie died that shit had me all sentimental
cuz got life in jail i pray to god they overturn his sentence

chorus
i got too much money for my mom to work a job i know she proud now
sensei to these bitches when they see me they gon bow down
i made real niggas win again we back in style now
and i got that blicky for that rahrah
i go to the dealership with checks soon as the car drop
my new house got slidin glass doors dont got no doorknobs
im in charge im always gon go hard you just do your part
and no matter what know if you get up then you lose your spot
you might also likeverse 2
you can say whatever but if i change its for the better
that shit was painful but i aint let up i left a stain in the ghetto
been inside the mix since a lil jit got my name from the ghetto
but im bigger now i can go to dinner with corey gamble and miss jenner now
couple hundred grand up on the gram before it went in style
theyll call me like take it down i been the one
bossed up i dont gotta do it but ima get her done
i man up and handle my problems when i can easily run
easy come easy go sell it all get some more
we done made it to another year im swappin out my cars again
everything is the latest cant complain cause i made it
who am i gon judge
i dont never hold nuts i dont never hold grudges
went to miami for a concert hit chanel store for my baby
i spent three hundred on a mercedes if i keep goin ill be the greatest
i bust out cryin and i wasnt sad its just a little feelin you get when you make it
i done tried tried tried and tried and tried again i cant even fake it yeah

chorus
i got too much money for my mom to work a job i know she proud now
sensei to these bitches when they see me they gon bow down
i made real niggas win again we back in style now
and i got that blicky for that rahrah
i go to the dealership with checks soon as the car drop
my new house got slidin glass doors dont got no doorknobs
im in charge im always gon go hard you just do your part
and no matter what know if you get up then you lose your spot
outro
only one of us
whos gonna walk away
here in the deep below
that only darkness really knows2embed"
