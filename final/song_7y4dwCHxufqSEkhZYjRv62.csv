i count the days that we have spent apart
ive got a bad liver and a broken heart
theres no salvation in the comfort of you
i finally realized youre tearing me apart

so help me save me tell me that the end is near
help me save me tell me that the end is near
i am done with you

but ive always loved you cause youre oh so special
im broken and im alone and i cannot maintain

help me save me tell me that the end is near
i am done with you
