of echoed situations and cursory illusion
im surrounded by forever but i dont have any time
left to wander in amusement left to ride my breath is dyin

but i love you little darlin
and ill love you till i die
like sundown in the valley
or the stars alone at night

through empty bottle alleys
you come shinin like the sun
and with your golden fingers
you save me from drowning

and i love you little darlin
and ill love you till i die
like sundown in the valley
or the stars alone at night

well life goes on around me
days are riding on the dawn
to infuse the world with words
its just your way of talking

and i love you little darlin
and ill love you till i die
like sundown in the valley
or the stars alone at night
see trampled by turtles liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likebut i love you little darlin
and ill love you till i die
