set my clock for californieyaye
and i dreamed up somethin special to give that ocean
man she cuffs me anyway

so im banking on virginia
to keep me calm and clear and straight
just like clock work seems to tell us
with every passing storm theres just a harder hail

so light my way virginia may
i cant sit still just pace across this hallway
we spent all this time
just trading crimes
while the tunesmith packed a lunch
hes headed down the coastline

theres a loneliness thats blowin
well i heard it from the radio man
hes been locked up in the belfry
listening close to a string upon a can

me im sailin on to that savior
shes a pilgrim living on the modern time
and ever since i found her magic
now every car or cloud that passes is a sign
see gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likelight my way virginia may
i cant sit still just pace across this hallway
we spent all this time
just trading crimes

and im saving all my sleep for another life
