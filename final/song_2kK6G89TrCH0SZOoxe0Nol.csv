lately im getting lost on you
you got me doing things i never thought id do
never spent so long on a losing battle
but lately giving up dont seem to matter

chorus
every day im a slave to the heartache
and youre wasting away every night
i dont wanna leave you lonely
but ive run out of love this time
you know that i adore you
though i couldnt give enough
hope youll be safe in the arms of another
cause i cant take the weight of your love

verse 2
lately im getting lost on you
i tore your world apart like it was nothing new
never bled so much when i didnt have to
im givin up on a life lived after

chorus
every day im a slave to the heartache
and youre wasting away every night
i dont wanna leave you lonely
but ive run out of love this time
you know that i adore you
though i couldnt give enough
hope youll be safe in the arms of another
cause i cant take the weight of your love
you might also likebridge
i had a hold on your soul
but i lost my grip let you go
i shouldve carried us both

chorus
every day im a slave to the heartache
and youre wasting away every night
dont wanna leave you lonely
but ive run out of love this time
you know that i adore you
though i couldnt give enough
hope youll be safe in the arms of another
cause i cant take the weight of your love of your love
hope youll be safe in the arms of another
cause i cant take the weight of your love7embed"
