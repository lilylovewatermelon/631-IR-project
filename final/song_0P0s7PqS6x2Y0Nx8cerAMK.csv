here we go again another night of being bummed
ill keep to myself avoid the sun and cancel plans with everyone i know
cause its just how it always ends our bond will break
cause you cant relate to anyone to anything at all

prechorus jeremy mckinnon
you brought your worst and im right here right here
no ive seen it all and its never been so clear

chorus jeremy mckinnon
youre not the person that i knew back then back then
its all too late to set things right cause everything has been
youre not the person that i knew back then back then
lets try and act like this didnt happen
follow your friends like you ever had them

verse 2 jeremy mckinnon kevin skaff
you still know me still not cut out for this sort of thing
never wanna be caught in between i need constant reminders of everything
so what its who i am i played it off so well
i just hold it in no matter how ive been so nobody nobody can tell

prechorus jeremy mckinnon
you brought your worst and im right here right here
