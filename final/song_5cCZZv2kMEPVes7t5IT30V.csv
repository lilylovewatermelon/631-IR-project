5cCZZv2kMEPVes7t5IT30V,You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet,Joe Nichols,1IgWZ4xGJQwzQbUvob3f92,"2 contributorsyou ain’t heard nothin’ yet lyricson a park bench
the old man sat and stared into yesterday
i sat down beside him
said thank god for this quiet place
between the wife and the kids
the tv and the phone
it seems theres something always goiing wrong
he said son if you think this is quiet
you should follow me home

cause you aint heard nothing yet
til youve lived in a house by yourself
when silence is all youve got left
in the rooms where your babies have slept
so dont wish for something
you will regret
cause you aint heard nothing yet

the old man kept talkin
paintin pictures from his memories
did he drag out his past for himself
or was it for me
his eyes came alive

he spoke of dancin with his wife
and playin ball with his two little boys
he said son
what i hear is music youre callin noise
see joe nichols liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likeyou aint heard nothin yet
til youve lived in a house by yourself
when silence is all youve got left
in the rooms where youre babies have slept
so dont wish for something
you will regret
cause you aint heard nothin yet

well all rest in peace
on that you can bet
cause you aint heard nothin yetembed"
