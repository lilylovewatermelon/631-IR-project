its a cruel cruel world
so conventional
sometimes love just wins you over
ive come to life its true
its not intentional
everytime when we move closer

prechorus tracey with livio  joey
ill take the fall
a twist i know
you just see right through me
it may be wrong all along
it keeps on turning turning

chorus tracey with all
i could walk away now
end it perfectly
and just say your words are
not affecting me
somewhere deep inside
i know it may be wrong
but im ready to commit
mistake no 2 yeah
mistake no 2
