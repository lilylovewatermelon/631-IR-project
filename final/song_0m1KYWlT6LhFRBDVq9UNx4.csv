gotta do what i gotta do
yeah
uh

verse 1 drake
all my exes live in texas like im george strait
or they go to georgia state where
tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in atlanta
that she only see when she feels obligated
admitted it to me the first time we dated
but she was no angel and we never waited
i took her for sushi she wanted to fuck
so we took it to go told em dont even plate it
and we never talked too much after i blew up
just only hello or a happy belated
and i think i text her and told her i made it
and thats when she text me and told me she prayed it
and thats when i text her and told her i love her
then right after texted and told her im faded
she asked what have i learned since getting richer
i learned workin with the negatives could make for better pictures
i learned hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
even though its fucked up girl im still fuckin with ya damn
is it the fall time for me to revisit the past
theres women to call theres albums to drop theres liquor involved
theres stories to tell we been through it all damn
interviews are like confessions
get the fuck up out my dressing room confusing me with questions like

verse 2 lil wayne
uh so much for being optimistic
they say love is in the air so i
hold my breath til my face turn purple
keep a few bad bitches in my circle
my nuts hang like aint no curfew
bitch if you wave then i will surf you
i flew jet she flew commercial
but we still met later that night
after my session she came over
i was aggressive and she was sober
i gave her a pill she started confessin
and started undressin and asked me to hold her
and so i did but that was last month
and now shes texting me asking for closure damn
she say this shit gon catch up to me i keep tissue paper
we eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
she say she hate that she love me and she wish i was average
shit sometimes i wish the same and i wish she wasnt married
promises i hope i never break em
met a female dragon had a fire conversation
but interviews are like confessions
get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like
prechorus lil wayne
