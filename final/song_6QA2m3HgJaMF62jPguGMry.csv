well ive been pacin this room for forty hours
crawlin up the walls and tryin not to call
and i saw you walkin in a supermarket aisle
i didnt say a word cause you had the biggest smile

verse 2
and ive been thinkin of you in the mornin times
you woke me up so soft i forgot the world aint kind
id pull you in and youd kiss me through a grin
and youd say you missed me when you were busy sleepin

chorus
but what if i said happy instead
is the way that i reckon it should be
and if you call youd say that youre okay
and id be wishin i was dead
cause youre happy instead
happy instead

verse 3
and ive been dreamin of the life we woulda had
happy at times but mostly just mad
maybe itd worked out maybe itd been fine
but every day your smile aint showin seems a waste of time
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
so what if i said happy instead
is the way that i reckon it should be
and if you call youd say that youre okay
and id be wishin i was dead
cause youre happy instead
happy instead

bridge
its been ten years i havent called you once
but you called last night and my child up and jumped
he asked who you were and you did the same
handed me the phone and i couldnt recall your name

chorus
but what if i said happy instead
is the way that i reckon i should be
and if you call youll hear that i was okay
and youd be wishin you was dead
cause im happy instead
happy instead
oh im happy instead
happy instead

outro
what if i said happy instead
is the way that i reckon i should be
and if you call youd hear that im okay
and youd be wishin you was dead
cause im happy insteadembed"
