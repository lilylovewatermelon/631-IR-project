verse 1
i had a name but they took it from me
i was the man that i wanted to be
i had a place where i lay my head but
they burnt it to the ground and the sky turned red
i had a life and a place in the world
i had a sweettalkin wife and a beautiful girl
i know im never gonna see em again
gonna tear the world up until i have my revenge

prechorus
they took my life
but it isnt the end
they put me in the ground
but im back from the dead

baby

chorus
im the world ender baby and im coming for them
they put me in the ground but im back from the dead
im the world ender baby and im coming for them
they put me in the ground but im back from the dead

youll hear me howl by the light of the moon
thats how youll know that im coming for you
gonna find you alone in the dark of night
when the world ender comes baby run for your life
ill never bleed and i wont ever age
ill never feel the embrace of the grave
the fair and the brave and the good must die
i seen the other side of living i know heavens a lie

chorus
ill tear through the night
and ill raise some hell
cause im the world ender baby
and im back from the dead

instrumental interlude

verse 3
lord knows i should be pushing up daisies
i was six feet down but something raised me up
sent back for to lift my curse
im gonna get me a taste of some chaos first
untied gonna get little wild
go screaming through the dark like a demon child
close your eyes now the light is fading
and the noise in the night is gonna get a little louder baby
baby

chorus
im the world ender baby and im back from the grave
they can run for their lives but they cannot be saved
im the world ender baby and im coming for them
they put me in the ground but im back from the dead

outro
im the world ender baby and im back from the dead
they can run for their lives but they cannot be saved
im the world ender baby and im coming for them
they put me in the ground but im back from the dead
im the world ender baby and im back from the dead
they can run for their lives but they cannot be saved
im the world ender baby and im coming for them
they put me in the ground but im back from the dead4embed"
