young girl dont cry
ill be right here when your world starts to fall
young girl its alright
your tears will dry youll soon be free to fly ooh

prechorus
when youre safe inside your room you tend to dream
of a place where nothings harder than it seems
no one ever wants or bothers to explain
of the heartache life can bring and what it means

chorus
when theres no one else
look inside yourself
like your oldest friend
just trust the voice within
then youll find the strength
that will guide your way
youll learn to begin
to trust the voice within
oh

that will guide your way

life is a journey
it can take you anywhere you choose to go
as long as youre learning
youll find all youll ever need to know
be strong youll break it
hold on youll make it
just don’t forsake it because
no one can tell you what you can’t do
no one can stop you you know that i’m talking to you
chorus
when theres no one else
look inside yourself
and like your oldest friend
just trust the voice within
then youll find the strength
that will guide your way
you will learn to begin
to trust the voice within
