empty spaces what are we living for
abandoned places i guess we know the score
on and on
does anybody know what we are looking for

verse 2
another hero another mindless crime
behind the curtain in the pantomime
hold the line
does anybody want to take it anymore

chorus
the show must go on
the show must go on yeah
inside my heart is breaking
my makeup may be flaking
but my smile still stays on
verse 3
whatever happens ill leave it all to chance
another heartache another failed romance
on and on
does anybody know what we are living for

verse 4
i guess im learning im learning im learning im learning
i must be warmer now
ill soon be turning turning turning turning
round the corner now
outside the dawn is breaking
but inside in the dark im aching to be free
