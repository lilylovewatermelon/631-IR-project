verse
said you wouldnt be an opp
had your bitch give me top
told the guys im like bro this is gang shit
white gold i aint rocking no stainless
fill your head with three hollows you brainless
put them goons on your ass they looking for cash
you fuck around boy and be chainless
my city im tryna rename this
run up on me head tap now you famous
and i heard niggas looking for me
and i heard niggas looking for bro
pop out i be icy and clean
new drip from my head to my toe
catch an opp back to back in a row
bullets burning we get him skip states and get low
ordered my food then i took it to go
i was 13 tryna flip me an o
when i aint know nothing i knew i would blow
i knew that one day id sell out a show
i know these fuck niggas want me to lose
thanks for the haters for helping me grow
i got some feelings i never let show
do it for smelly forever my bro
ride through my city im droppin the fours
you see me im flexing with butterfly doors
