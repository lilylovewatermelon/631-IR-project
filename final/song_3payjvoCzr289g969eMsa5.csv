and i didnt think about
all the ways i hurt you and myself
and i wouldnt say a thing to you
i keep it to myself in
my mind
and i cant stand without you
and i wont find the answers
when youre gone

chorus
but its over to you
i cant find the answers when youre gone
and its over to you
and you cant find the answers where you are

verse 2
and you know and you know
i need you now
and this aint easy to admit
and no one needs to know
what goes on behind
the door in my room
im kicking through the
walls in my mind
and i cant stand without you
and i wont find the answers
when youre gone

but its over to you
i cant find the answers when youre gone
and its over to you
and you cant find the answers where you are

bridge
i wont tear you down
i wont tear you down
to get into the world you wanted
im kicking through the walls
but no one can believe
in things that never change

chorus
but its over to you
i cant find the answers when youre gone
and its over to you
and you cant find the answers where you are

outro
and its over to you
and i cant find the answers when youre gone
and i cant find the answers when youre gone
and i cant find the answers when youre goneembed"
