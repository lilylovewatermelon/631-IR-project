a whisper away from changing everything
but is it safe to say
such dangerous things
when your hands are trembling
girl im weak in the knees
its times like these when silence means everything
more than anything

chorus
so fall when youre ready baby
let our kiss count the moments and hearts set the pace
ill be your love song and ill love you right off your feet
until you fall into me

verse 2
love aint a race
theres no finish line
and i love a chase
but dont leave me behind
cause girl were both gambling
but im playing for keeps
its time like these
when patience means everything
more than anything

so fall when youre ready baby
let our kiss count the moments and hearts set the pace
ill be your love song and ill love you right off your feet
until you fall into me

and ill fall for you every day
ill cherish the moments time cant erase

i promise you were going to sing

outro
girl when you fall into me
girl when you fall into me
cmon baby fall into me
im waiting
fall into me
fall into me
fall into me
a whisper away from changing everything3embed"
