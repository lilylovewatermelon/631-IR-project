come on

verse 1
you help me survive
youre the reason im alive
speak softly cyanide
passed from your mouth into mine
your breathing sounds like the sickest music
playing backwards in my head
contagions so hellacious
you cant find the words so you scream instead

prechorus
this lifeless ordinary
my righteous unsuspecting
i have a secret you are a dichotomy

chorus
what wont kill me makes me
what wont love me hates me
what wont kill me dies

come on

verse 2
you could help me hide
you could keep me inside
heartbroken petrified
what am i supposed to do if you dont try
mad symmetry senseless poetry
laying naked on my bed
contracted and frustrated
you wont say a word and your eyes are dead
you might also likeprechorus
this lifeless ordinary
my righteous unsuspecting
i have a secret you are a dichotomy

chorus
what wont kill me makes me
what wont love me hates me
what wont kill me dies

what wont kill me makes me
what wont love me hates me
what wont kill me dies

outro
the whole fucking worlds against us dude
i swear to godembed"
