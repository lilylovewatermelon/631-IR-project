for somebody else
while i´m dancing this dance with you
o don´t cry on my shoulder
about someone you knew
i told you i am in love with you

you try to tell me that
you love me yet
how come while were dancing
our eyes never met

don´t cry on my shoulder
for somebody else
while i´m dancing this dance with you

and oh pretty baby
don´t cry on my shoulder
for somebody else
while i´m dancing this twist with you

and oh pretty baby
o don´t cry on my shoulder
about someone you knew
i told you i am in love
at least i mean to tell you i am on love with you
you might also likeah you try to tell me that
you love me yet
how come while were dancing
our eyes never met

don´t cry on my shoulder
for somebody else
while i´m dancing this dance with you

do that thing one more timeembed"
