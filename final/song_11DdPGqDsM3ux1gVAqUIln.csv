running off over next doors garden before the hour is done
its more a question of feeling than it is a question of fun
the confidence is the balaclava im sure youll baffle em good
will the ending reek of salty cheeks and runny makeup alone
or will blood run down the face of a boy bewildered and scorned
and youll find yourself in a skirmish where you wish youd never been born
you tie yourself to the tracks and there isnt no going back
and its wrong wrong wrong but well do it anyway cause we love a bit of trouble

verse 2
are you pulling her from a burning building or throwing her to the sharks
can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start
the confidence is the balaclava im sure youll baffle em straight
and its wrong wrong wrong but she can hardly wait

chorus
thats right he wont let her out his sight
now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
whos the crooks in this crime
thats right he wont let her out his sight
now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
whos the crooks in this crime

thats right he wont let her out his sight
thats right he wont let her out his sight
thats right he wont let her out his sight
well youll be able to boast
of the day of the most flawless heist of all time

outro
you knew that itd be trouble right before the very first kiss
quiet and unassuming but you heard that they were the naughtiest
she pleaded with you to take it off but you resisted and fought
but sorry sweetheart id much rather keep on the balaclava27embed"
