when its lovely
i believe in anything
what does love mean
when the end is rolling in ooh
let it go let it stay can we love one another
cold is it safe to be warm in the summer
who knows who knows
i said who knows

chorus
ooh teach me to love just to let me go
i cant believe that im not enough
not enough
and so long no one will be here to save you
and no one will be here to let you know
let you know
this is your world this is your world
this is your world this is your world

bridge
quietly still
in a lie
oh goodnight
i dont mind

ooh teach me to love just to let me go
i cant believe that im not enough
not enough
and so long no one will be here to save you
and no one will be here to let you know let you know97embed"
