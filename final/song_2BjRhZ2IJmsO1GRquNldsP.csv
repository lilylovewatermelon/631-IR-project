when the revenant came down
we couldnt imagine what it was
in the spirit of three stars
the alien thing that took its form

ooh history involved itself
mysterious shade that took its form
or what it was incarnation three stars
delivering signs and dusting from their eyes
ooh oohyou might also like4embed"
