well what is this that i cant see
with icecold hands taking hold of me
well i am death none can excel
ill open the door to heaven or hell

“oh death” someone would pray
“could you wait to call me another day”
the children prayed the preacher preached
time and mercy is out of your reach

verse 3
ill fix your feet till you cant walk
ill lock your jaw till you cant talk
ill close your eyes so you cant see
this very hour come and go with me

verse 4
death i come to take the soul
leave the body and leave it cold
to drop the flesh off of the frame
the earth and worms both have a claim

my mother came to my bed
placed a cold towel upon my head

well youre hurting my body you make me cold

please dont take me at this stage
my wealth is all at your command
if you will move your icy hands

no wealth no land no silver no gold
nothing satisfies me but your soul
