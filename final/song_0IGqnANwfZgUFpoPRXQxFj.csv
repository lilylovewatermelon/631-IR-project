they say life is a battlefield
i say bring it on
if you wanna know how i feel
leave it till its gone
im just sayin that what dont kill
only makes you strong
if you dont recognize what is real
then forever is a long long long long long long long long time

prechorus
some things never change here we go again
feel like im losing my mind
shake it off let it go i dont care anymore

chorus
lets go numb
you never know until you let go
lets go numb
i can feel you now

verse 2
keep on doing the same old thing
and you expecting change
well is that really insanity
or just a losers game ha
i only trust in the things i feel
some may say thats strange
you better recognize what is real
cause forever is a long long long long long long long long time
