the modern with the warrior
the mean with the stride
the tom with the sawyer
and the mean mean mean mean pride

verse 1
and though his mind is not for rent
dont put him down as arrogant
his reserve a quiet defense
riding out the days events
the river

chorus
what you say about his company
is what you say about society
catch the mist mist catch the myth myth
cast the mystery catch the drift drift

refrain
the world is the world is
love and life are deep
maybe as his skies are wide

bridge
the tom with the sawyer
with the eye on the you
the space he invades
he gets by by by by
you might also likeverse 2
no his mind is not for rent
to any god or government
always hopeful yet discontent
he knows changes arent permanent
but change is

chorus
what you say about his company
is what you say about society
catch the witness catch the wit wit
cast the spirit catch the spit spit

refrain
the world is the world is
love and life are deep
maybe as his skies are wide

outro
exit the warrior
the tom with the sawyer
the eye on the you energy trade
right on to the friction of the day day day dayembed"
