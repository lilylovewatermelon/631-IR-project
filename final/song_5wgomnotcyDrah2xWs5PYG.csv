verse 1 jt woodruff with casey calvert
through arteries untold
your skin is pale my bodys cold
way down deep down in my lungs
i can hear our sweet decay

prechorus jt woodruff casey calvert
so spill my blood so spill my blood
midnight skies turn scarlet red

chorus jt woodruff casey calvert
say so long and say goodnight
and just hold out your hand
to catch me if i fall into the night
when im coming home
say so long and say goodnight
and just hold out your hand
to catch me if i fall
