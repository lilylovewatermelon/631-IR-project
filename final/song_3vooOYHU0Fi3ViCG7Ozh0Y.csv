two nights ago she got that look in her eyes
kaleidoscope but thats only half the time
three days before she told me that i dont even try
shes crazy though i guess theres something wrong inside

hook
maybe youre right maybe this is all that i can be
but what if its you and it wasnt me
what do you want from me
what do you want from me

verse 2
four weeks ahead i thought that i should think some more
im fucked in the head and my mind is turning into a whore
five months go by and i thought about letting her go
shes crazy though and i guess she took control
oh no oh no oh no oh no no

hook
maybe youre right maybe this is all that i can be
but what if its you and it wasnt me
what do you want from me
what do you want from me

bridge
maybe shes right maybe im wrong
maybe well fight til they move us along
i cant deny writing a song
hoping shell find shes not alone
you might also likehook
maybe youre right maybe this is all that i can be
but what if its you and it wasnt me oh
what what do you want from me
what do you want what do you want
do you want from me
what what do you want from me
what do you want what do you want
do you want from me now62embed"
