got a pinch of tobacco in my pocket
im not gonna roll it no im not gonna smoke it
till were staring at the stars and the rockets
twinkling in the silvery night
two sips of whiskey in the flask
but im not gonna drink em
i swear ill make it last
till were drinking out of the same glass again

chorus
and though the sand may be washed by the sea
and the old will be lost in the new
well four will not wait for three
for three never waited for two
and though you will not wait for me
ill wait for you

verse 2
got a polaroid picture in my wallet
im not gonna tear it no im not gonna spoil it
its an unspoken heartbreak
a heartbroken handshake
i take with me where i go
three words on the tip of my tongue
not to be spoke nor sung
or whispered to anyone
till i scream em at the top of my lungs again
see passenger liveget tickets as low as 36you might also likechorus
and though the sand may be washed by the sea
and the old will be lost in the new
well four will not wait for three
for three never waited for two
and though you will not wait for me
ill wait for you
oh whoa
and oh oh oh
ill wait for you
oh whoa
and oh oh oh
and ill wait for you
oh oh

got a pinch of tobacco in my pocket
im not gonna roll it no im not gonna smoke it
till were staring at the stars and the rockets
twinkling in the silvery night8embed"
