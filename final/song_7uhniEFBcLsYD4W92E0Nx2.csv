verse 1
yeah
whos that on the other end of the phone
didnt hear nothin when i said my hello
oh well to hell then we go
so high lookin at heaven below
you know me though from coast to coast for smokin dope
overdose with the holy ghost but hold the phones
i hold my own was local grown
been killin that shit since row the boat
know im supposed to hold the throne be honest
one more drink ima be an alcoholic
i dont wanna think like better unconscious
need fresh air everything so toxic
i open coffin doors with a 38 when its time for war
told my mama you aint need no drama
and you aint gotta cry no more now now

prechorus
itll be alright
my mind on the run i wont sleep tonight its like
when it all goes up in flames who gon hold me down down
and im the chosen one
lookin all around what has the world become um
the only way to change it is to burn it to the ground ground
ive been gettin paid
about four or five bitches in the escalade let it rain
this money feel the same im afraid that ima drown drown yeah
you might also likechorus
youve never been better than me
from this prison im settin em free
open eyes ima let you see
this world just like our dreams
ill throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
im runnin to the edge and when i get there best believe that ima jump jump
to see if i can fly fly
i wonder if i jump jump
do you think that i can fly fly

verse 2
yeah
its the life of a entertainer
i need that check go and get the waiter
fuck a troll this destruction mode and these explosions dont need detonators
i met my maker in a elevator he was headed to the top floor
were quite similar we just did our work but we were in it for a lot more
we would try to change the world but we got bored
when i rip this show got a encore
back when we were still in school we didnt listen to the list of rules
wrote a million words on the chalkboard
i dont need answers to the questions of intangibles
i told my homies the top so lonely
but we aint gonna die not now now
prechorus
you gon make it here live free tonight til the day appear
lets sit back right where we at and let this money pile pile
how do we get rich if she actin crazy you dont need that bitch
wish i knew back then all the things that i know now now
go on and on knew i had this shit all along
take a breath feel this moment hold it just so you can can
look where we at and look where we came from
when will we wake up lost in translation

chorus
youve never been better than me
from this prison im settin em free
open eyes ima let you see
this world just like our dreams
ill throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
im runnin to the edge and when i get there best believe that ima jump jump
to see if i can fly fly
i wonder if i jump jump
do you think that i can fly fly
