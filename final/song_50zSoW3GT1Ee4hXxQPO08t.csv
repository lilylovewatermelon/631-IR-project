standing here like im supposed to say something
dont hold your breath i never said id save you honey
and i dont want your money if i was you id run from me or
rip me open youll see youre not the only one whos hopeless
be sure to put your faith in something more
im just a girl and youre not as alone as you feel
we all got problems dont we we all need heroes dont we
but rest assured theres not a single person here whos worthy

verse 2
oh its such a long and awful lonely fall
down from this pedestal that you keep putting me on
what if i fall on my face what if i make a mistake
if its okay a little grace would be appreciated
remember how we used to like ourselves
what little light thats left we need to keep it sacred
i know that youre afraid to let all the dark escape ya
but we could let the light illuminate these hopeless places
