little black submarines
operator please put me back on the line
told my girl id be back
operator please
this is wreckin my mind

oh can it be
the voices calling me
they get lost and out of time
i shouldve seen it glow
but everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
that a broken heart is blind

verse 2
pick you up let you down
when i wanna go to a place i can hide
you know me i had plans
but they just disappeared to the back of my mind

chorus
oh can it be
the voices calling me
they get lost and out of time
i shouldve seen it glow
but everybody knows that a broken heart is blind
that a broken heart is blind

oh can it be
the voices calling me
