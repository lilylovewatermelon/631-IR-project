box
i would surely break the lock
id jump right in and and fall asleep i i fall asleep
cause cause cause you cause you are the death of me
cause you are the—
if you was in a pine box box
i would surely break the lock
id jump right in and and fall asleep i i fall asleep
cause cause cause you cause you are the death of me
cause you are the—
the the death of me you you the death of me
verse kendrick lamar
lookin in the mirror im embarrassed
im feelin like a suicidal terrorist
react like an infant whenever you are mentioned
mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
im in the matter of man arm wrestlin hands i was dealt
when i said the music business was all i needed
when i got it i was greeted by an alien
that said last year that she slept with a canadian
that gave him an addiction thatd keep him in mercedes benz
bright lights and rihanna as a lady friend
my vice is similar
women love when youre my type
and youre winnin from everything that your palm write
put her in the palms hotel sin city
devil in a dress platinum chanel
live the ambiance all cause the audience one day said i would do it
so instead of a verse bein read
ima go and get some head off the strength of my music
i tell a bad bitch your ass too fat capitalize that
and your weave look good with the indian tracks
trackin device on your used 5 series
i dont call back just blame it on your canadian
the same day we say we in the area cruisin in toronto
hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers i know
sat down with a few drinks located where you cant see us
a white waitress on standby when we need her
a black maybach 40 pulled up jeep
no doors all that nigga was missin was aaliyah
felt like the initiation a reality livin in the matrix
we talk casually about the industry
and how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin
then he said that he was the same age as
myself and it didnt help cause it made me even more rude and impatient
so blame it on mr ovoxo
the reason why im breathin all the vanity i know
the reason why my best friend say she love me more than life
but i live a double life and need to let her go
the reason why the highlight was when he said
you belong to the people when you outside
so dig a shovel full of money full of power full of pussy
full of fame and bury yourself alive then i diedsee drake liveget tickets as low as 89you might also like124embed"
