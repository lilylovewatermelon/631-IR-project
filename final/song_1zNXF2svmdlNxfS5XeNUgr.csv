i waited til i saw the sun
i dont know why i didnt come
i left you by the house of fun
i dont know why i didnt come
i dont know why i didnt come

verse 2
when i saw the break of day
i wished that i could fly away
instead of kneeling in the sand
catching teardrops in my hand

refrain
my heart is drenched in wine
but youll be on my mind forever
verse 3
out across the endless sea
i will die in ecstasy
but ill be a bag of bones
driving down the road alone

refrain
my heart is drenched in wine
but youll be on my mind forever

verse 4
something has to make you run
i dont know why i didnt come
i feel as empty as a drum

outro
i dont know why i didnt come
i dont know why i didnt come
i dont know why i didnt come14embed"
