lyrics manoj kannankutty

outside the stars again arrived
dressed so cosy among the night
the world prepares for a dreams delight
its time to rest and put off the light

father has finished to tell the story
a happy ending with no worries
mother came near to kiss and sing
its time for sleep peaceful and deep

you can still hear the love of her song
as your eyes gently shut down
fairies and princesses await beyond
in beautiful dreams nothing goes wrong

sleep sleep in tranquility little one
tomorrow a new day will come with the sun
of learning and love of playing and fun
sleep sleep in traquility little one

your bed  is comfy tidy and warm
made with affection by caring mom
who will care like this when you are grown
such nice memories will never be gone
you might also likesleep sleep in tranquility little one
tomorrow a new day will come with the sun
of learning and love of playing and fun
sleep sleep in traquility little one
