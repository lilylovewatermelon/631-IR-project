its twilight
and the street lights are coming on
im in a stream of cars on this boulevard
headed home
and i can hardly wait
for you to make what wrong today seem right
its been a long hard day
so bring on the night

chorus
bring on the night
and pull down the shades
lock the world outside
and throw the key away
and turn on the feelings
and turn out the lights
lets call it a day
and bring on the night

verse 2
from 9 to 5
its the same old grind all week long
and the only thing
that keeps me sane is coming home
when the sun goes down
you know how to set things right
lets put the day behind us
and bring on the night
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likechorus
bring on the night
and pull down the shades
lock the world outside
and throw the key away
and turn on the feelings
and turn out the lights
lets call it a day
and bring on the night

outro
lets call it a day
and bring on the nightembed"
