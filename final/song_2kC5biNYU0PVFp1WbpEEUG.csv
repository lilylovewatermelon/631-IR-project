the sun goes down as the city lights
pave their way through the darkest night
raindrops fall as an old man cries
never thought to ever think twice

prechorus
of all he had
of all he lost
a selfish life
and guess comes with the cost

chorus
hey remember me
i remember you walking away
hey remember me
i remember you walking away

verse 2
the same old streets just a different name
same old house just the familys changed
pickett fence
the window stains
freedom spells by a man in chains
silence is all we have to give
and the memories of a life i wish wed lived
you might also likechorus
hey remember me
i remember you walking away
hey remember me
i remember you walking away

verse 3
from all that you made
that you lost
or threw away
traded in for a brand new life
but i cant
cant let go
cant turn around
hold my head high and walk away

chorus
hey remember me
i remember you walking away
hey remember me
i remember you walking away3embed"
