every time you take a sip
in this smoky atmosphere
you press that bottle to your lips
and i wish i was your beer
and in the small there of your back
your jeans are playing peekaboo
id like to see the other half
of your butterfly tattoo

prechorus
hey that gives me an idea
well lets get out of this bar
drive out into the country
and find a place to park

chorus
cause id like to see you out in the moonlight
id like to kiss you way back in the sticks
id like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
and id like to check you for ticks

verse 2
i know the perfect little path
out in these woods i used to hunt
but dont worry babe ive got your back
and ive also got your front
now id hate to waste a night like this
ill keep you safe you wait and see
the only thing allowed to crawl all over you
when we get there is me
see brad paisley liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likeprechorus
you know every guy in here tonight
would like to take you home
but ive got way more class than them
babe that aint what i want

chorus
cause id like to see you out in the moonlight
id like to kiss you way back in the sticks
id like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
and id like to check you for ticks

bridge
now ooh you never know where one might be
and ooh theres lots of place that are hard to reach
i gotcha

chorus
id like to see you out in the moonlight
id like to kiss you baby way back in the sticks
id like to walk you through a field of wildflowers
and id like to check you for ticks
oh id sure like to check you for ticks
