i made a promise to myself
locked it away deep down inside
told my heart wed wait it out
swore wed never compromise
oh id rather be alone
like i am tonight
than settle for the kind of love
that fades before the morning light

verse 2
silence stared me in the face
and i finally heard its voice
it seemed to softly say
that in love you have a choice
today i got the answer
and theres a world of truth behind it
love is out there waiting somewhere
you just have to go and find it

chorus
i believe in love
i believe in love
a love thats real love thats strong
love that lives on and on
yes i believe in love

yes i believe in love
