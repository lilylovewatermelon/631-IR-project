hey dorothea do you ever stop and think about me
when we were younger down in the park
honey makin a lark of the misery
you got shiny friends since you left town
a tiny screens the only place i see you now
and i got nothin but well wishes for ya

prechorus
ooh
this place is the same as it ever was
ooh
but you wont like it that way

chorus
its never too late to come back to my side
the stars in your eyes shined brighter in tupelo
and if youre ever tired of bеin known for who you know
you know that youll always know me

just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
and damn dorothea they all wanna be ya
but are you still the same soul i met under the bleachers well

prechorus
ooh
i guess ill never know
ooh
and youll go on with the show

chorus
but its never too late to come back to my side
the stars in your eyes shined brighter in tupelo
and if youre ever tired of bein known for who you know
you know youll always know me
