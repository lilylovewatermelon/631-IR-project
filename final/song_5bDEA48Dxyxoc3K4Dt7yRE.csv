things have been so crazy and hectic
i shouldve gotten back by now
but you know how much i wanted to make it
its probably better anyhow

bridge drake
so if you gotta go
if theres anything i should know
if the spotlight makes you nervous
if youre looking for a purpose

verse 2 drake
you put the tea in the kettle and light it
put your hand on the metal and feel it
but do you even feel it anymore
i remember when you thought i was joking
now im off singing karaoke
further than ive ever been ohoh oh

bridge drake
so if you gotta go
if theres any way i can help

verse 3 drake
isnt it ironic that the girl i want to marry is a wedding planner
that tells me my life is too much and then moves to atlanta
damn of all the places you could go
i just thought youd choose somewhere that had somebody that you know
im always up too late i worry bout you there alone
in that place you call your home warm nights and cold patron
i hope you dont get known for nothing crazy
cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
i know they say the first love is the sweetest but that first cut is the deepest
i tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
secrets you were telling everybody but me
dont be fooled by the money im still just young and unlucky im surprised you couldnt tell

i was only trying to get ahead
i was only trying to get ahead
but the spotlight makes you nervous
and youre looking for a purpose
i was only trying to get ahead
i was only trying to get ahead
but the spotlight makes you nervous29embed"
