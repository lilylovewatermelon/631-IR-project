so i typed a text to a girl i used to see
saying that i chose this cutie pie with whom i wanna be
and i apologize if this message gets you down
then i cced every girl that id seesee round town
and hate to see yall frown but id rather see her smilin
wetness all around me true but im no island
peninsula maybe it makes no sense i know crazy
give up all this pussy cat thats in my lap no looking back
spaceships dont come equipped with rearview mirrors
they dip as quick as they can the atmosphere is now ripped
im so like a pimp im glad its night
so the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
when i shoot the moon high jump the broom
like a preemie out the womb my partner yelling too soon
dont do it reconsider read some liter
ature on the subject you sure fuck it
you know we got your back like chiropractic
if that bitch do you dirty well wipe her ass out as in detergent
now hurry hurry go on to the altar
i know you aint a pimp but pimp remember what i taught ya
keep your heart three stacks keep your heart
ayy keep your heart three stacks keep your heart
man these girls is smart three stacks these girls is smart
play your part play your part

my bitch a choosy lover never fuck without a rubber
never in the sheets like it on top of the cover
money on the dresser drive a kompressor
top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
trash like to fuck with forty dollars in the club
fuckin up the game bitch it gets no love
she be cross country givin all that she got
a thousand a pop im pullin bentleys off the lot
i smashed up the gray one bought me a red
every time we hit the parkin lot we turn heads
some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
your bitch chose me you aint a pimp you a fairy

chorus willie hutch
ohh ohh i choose you girl yeah

verse 3 bun b
baby you been rollin solo time to get down with the team
the grass is greener on that other side if you know what i mean
ill show you shit you never seen the seven wonders of the world
and i can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
when i say my girl i dont mean my woman that aint my style
need a real street stalker stalker to walk a green mile mile
we piling up the paper on the dining room table
cause you able to realize im the truth and not a fable fable
we rocking russian sable keep that chilla on the rack
what i look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back
im a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch

cause he payin 20k a day that bitch is eating good
like an infant on a double d titty just getting plump
cause you miscalculated the next to thethe last pump
