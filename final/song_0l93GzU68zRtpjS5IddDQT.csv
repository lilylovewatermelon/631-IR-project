got me on a short leash tied to your screen door
i used to run with the big dogs til i stretched out on your front porch
used to be a hound dog chased a lot of fast cars
now i dont even bark when the kitty cats stroll through the back yard

chorus
i used to howl at the moon yeah ive been known to roam
then i caught her trail one day followed this girl home
i aint the same she knows how to put my chain

verse 2
they say that an old dog cant learn a new trick
well she taught me to stay the first day and i learned real quick
theres a doghouse a fence and a gate latch
i keep my tail wagging and i dont mind begging for a good scratch

chorus
i used to howl at the moon yeah ive been known to roam
then i caught her trail one day followed this girl home
i aint the same she knows how to put my chain
