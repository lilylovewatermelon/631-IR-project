im bad

verse 1
i gotta figure out where mommy keeps the dynamite
ill get some measuring tape so i can time it right
i know its dangerous i know youre thinking i am a fool
but its the only chance ill ever get to look so cool
look so cool

chorus 1
hey look at me casually
walking away like action movie hero boy
in slowmo everything glowing and
blowing to bits right behind me

verse 2
you see it all the time in theatres on the silver screen
like when the good guy blows the bad guys house to smithereens
ive got a moviemaking camera and a dozen grenades
im looking tough ive got the stuff ive got the spiffy shades
spiffy shades

chorus 1
hey look at me casually
walking away like action movie hero boy
in slowmo everything glowing and
blowing to bits right behind me

stumbling down like action movie blooper reels
in slowmo everything glowing and
blowing to bits including me4embed"
