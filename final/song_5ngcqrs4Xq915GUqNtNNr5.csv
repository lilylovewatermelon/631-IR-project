oh dear oh dear i’m sorry
that you grew up so soon
a cold year and no high school parties
i’ve been drinking alone
oh i’ve been drinking alone
so dont fear don’t fear their warnings
they’re bitterer than most
4 years of driving across the country
for empty seats at their shows
and they’ve been drinking alone

chorus
so keep your time keep your mind keep humble
start your life in the middle of the jungle
you young young blood
rub your eyes be surprised keep hungry
stay alive try to lose all of your money
you young young blood
you young young blood
young blood

verse 2
so when you’re mad for no reason
at everything at once
and when you start overthinking
i’ll be drinking at home
oh i’ll be drinking at home

so keep your time keep your mind keep it humble
start your life in the middle of the jungle
you young young blood
rub your eyes be surprised keep hungry
stay alive try to lose all of your money
you young young blood
you young young blood
young blood

and if you want i could tell the truth
that this life takes a toll on you
i spend nights stitching up the loose threads in my soul
in the morning i’m bullet proof
and if you want i could tell the truth
that this life takes a toll on you
i spend nights stitching up the loose threads in my soul
in the morning i’m bullet proof
in the morning i’m bullet proof

chorus
so keep your time keep your mind keep it humble
start your life in the middle of the jungle
you young young blood
rub your eyes be surprised keep hungry
stay alive try to lose all of your money
you young young blood
you young young blood
you young young blood
