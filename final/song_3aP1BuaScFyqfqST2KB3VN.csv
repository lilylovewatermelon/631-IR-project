so what of you
the fateful few

government fall lalala
so tell your family and friends
well keep it plain
never again lalala

verse 2
ill make it clear youll make it then
but never here never again nanana
so which one hangs police with gangs
its all the same its all the same
i met you here but then you ran
you ran with fear you fearless man nanana
so tell your violent and tame
that they will cry never again
