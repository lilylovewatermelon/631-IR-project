weve been running in place
the whole years been one of those days
i know were close to an edge
oh i dont wanna be blamed
i know you hate to cause to pain
i hope the silence will end

prechorus
oh and we hold onto this for whatever reason
oh and were too far to fix it up

chorus
i wanna break this to you honestly
im afraid im afraid im afraid
im afraid im afraid im afraid

i know youre ready to move on from me
but you stay and you stay and you stay
and we wait and we wait til one of us caves
oh til one of us caves
oh

verse 2
long game but none of us win
afraid of shеdding our skin
we keep on playing pretend
this fеars a rope on our wrists
these years of life that weve missed
building a case in our heads
