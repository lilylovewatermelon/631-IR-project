—through the spot
everyday was like a beef to me

verse 1 aap rocky
uh buccaneers of rugged gear nigga fuck a fair
one since year one ive been thuggin here yeah uh
whole shit is ours you in awe please dont get involved
this is war walk around a frame with blaze up in this jawn
behind prison walls niggas lickin balls pause
different cause stricted laws
damn if i dont break up in the morgue prison yard prison guard
no principal tention on your friends and all
commissary missin like your siblings paw
uncle tom please dont make my sentence long
granted what i did was wrong
pigs dont show remorse if you admit it all
missin ma hope that she dont miss the call
admitted that shell never visit
like the hardheaded never listen lord
so tell me how the fuck im sposed to eat nigga uh
if the richers gettin richer the poors growin weak nigga uh
my brother died up in the streets may he rest in peace
niggas got heat like pusha t get it cheap uh

verse 2 aap rocky
its like i lace up my boots and call my troops lately
traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
im twenty six but ive been livin in my youth lately
pull my wisdom but i still spit it like my tooth ache me
duck shots motherfuck cops whats the blood clots
all i gots my word and my balls and my one cock
pause buckshots fly my young buck died
passed away from a stray from some faketoughguy
now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
fuck that this the story that should make thugs cry
dry your eyes older sis held em close watch em twitch
gave em kiss in the midst of all of this
aint too late to pause or skip—

chorus joe fox  max b
and i wonder im biggaveli i could do this in my sleep layin in my bed baby i wonder
