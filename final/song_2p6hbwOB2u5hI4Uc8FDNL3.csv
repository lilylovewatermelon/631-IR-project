i dont know where the hell it comes from
got no idea where it goes when it leaves
when its here its here when its gone its gone
kinda like them smoky mountain fall time trees
i guess ill leave it to something bigger to figure it all out
but i sure could use a little breeze right now

chorus
yeah if anybody out there somewhere
got a secret they wanna sharе
on why it does to her what it does to dust
it rеally just aint fair
and why it always takes her with it
and only brings her back now and then
i guess ive always been
wonderin bout the wind

verse 2
she sits there like a feather just waitin on a gale
by the time i pushed off she already caught sail
im always waitin to put my anchor down
but i sure could use a little breeze right now

chorus
yeah if anybody out there somewhere
got a secret they wanna share
on why it does to her what it does to dust
it really just aint fair
and why it always takes her with it
and only brings her back now and then
i guess ive always been
wonderin bout the wind
see morgan wallen liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likebridge
hey i can taste the rain i can see the sun
and that makes sense to me
but this feels like one i that i cant outrun
guess im runnin just to see

chorus
if anybody out there somewhere
got a secret they wanna share
on why it does to her what it does to dust
it really just aint fair
and why it always takes her with it
and only brings her back now and then
i guess ive always been
wonderin bout the wind

outro
and why it always takes her with it
and leaves me hangin on a limb
just wonderin bout the wind
aw wonderin bout the windembed"
