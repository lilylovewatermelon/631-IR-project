in this hole that is me
the dead are rolling over
in this hole thickening
dirt shoveled over shoulders

prechorus 1
i feel it in me so overwhelmed
oh this pressured center rising
my life overturned unfair the despair
all these scars keep ripping open

chorus
peel me from the skin
tear me from the rind
does it make you happy now
tear meat from the bone
tear me from myself
are you feeling happy now

verse 2
in this hole that is me
a life thats growing feeble
in this hole so limiting
the sun has set all darkens
see mudvayne liveget tickets as low as 110you might also likeprechorus 2
buried underneath hands slip off the wheel
internal pathway to contention

chorus
peel me from the skin
tear me from the rind
does it make you happy now
tear meat from the bone
tear me from myself
are you feeling happy now

bridge
are you happy
are you happy
are you feeling happy
in this hole that is me left with a heart exhausted
whats my release what sets me free
do you pull me up just to push me down again

chorus
peel me from the skin
tear me from the rind
does it make you happy now
tear meat from the bone
tear me from myself
are you feeling happy now
outro
peel me from the skin
peel me from the skin
tear me from the rind
does it make you happy now
tear me from the bone
tear me from the bone
tear me from myself
are you feeling happy now

does it make you happy
are you feeling happy
are you fucking happy
now that im lost left with nothing
does it make you happy
are you feeling happy
are you fucking happy
now that im lost left with nothing13embed"
