over me and over you
i came by to say im confused
about last week when you said
hello we should go to tokyo
i think about you quite a lot
at least enough to question what is
causing me to think so much
about someone it keeps me up

chorus
if you rip open my heart you’d see
a whole lotta blood and arteries
but if im talking romantically
youd see space for you

verse 2
i remember at the pub
the tea towel hanging at your butt
you said i should come by sometime
and so i came that very night
i read a book i didn’t like
i was approached by some old guy he
bought me a glass of cheap wine
he had a piano on his tie

if you rip open my heart youd see
a whole lotta blood and arteries
but if im talking romantically
youd see space for you

outro
if you rip open my heart youd see
a whole lotta blood and gunk and arteries
but if im talking romantically
youd see space for you
youd see space for you2embed"
