when i was a kid the things i did were hidden under the grid
young and naive i never believed that love could be so well hid
with regret im willing to bet and say the older you get
it gets harder to forgive and harder to forget
it gets under your shirt like a dagger at work
the first cut is the deepest but the rest still flipping hurt
you build your heart of plastic
get cynical and sarcastic
and end up in the corner on your own

hook
cause id love to feel love but i cant stand the rejection
i hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
i thought i was close but under further inspection
it seems ive been running in the wrong direction oh no

verse 2
so whats the point in getting your hopes up
when all youre ever getting is choked up
when your coked up
and cant remember the reason why you broke up
you call her in the morning when youre coming down and falling
like an old man on the side of the road
cause when youre apart you dont want to mingle
when youre together you want to be single
ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss
that made your heart tingle
how much greener the grass is
with those rose tinted glasses
but the butterflies they flutter by and leave us on our asses

cause id love to feel love but i cant stand the rejection
i hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
i thought i was close but under further inspection
it seems ive been running in the wrong direction
theres fish in the sea for me to make a selection
id jump in if it wasnt for my ear infection
cause all i want to do is try to make a connection
it seems ive been running in the wrong direction oh oh

hook x2

outro
seems like im running in the wrong direction oh
seems like im running in the wrong direction oh
well it seems ive been running in the wrong direction oh no
seems ive been running in the wrong direction oh12embed"
