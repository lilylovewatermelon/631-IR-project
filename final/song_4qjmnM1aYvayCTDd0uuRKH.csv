i still feel 25 most of the time
i still raise a little cain with the boys
honky tonks and pretty women
but lord im still right there withem
singing above the crowd and the noise

chorus
sometimes i feel like jesse james
still trying to make a name
knowing nothings gonna change what i am
i was a young troubador
when i wrote in on a song
and ill be an old troubador when im gone

verse 2
well the truth about a mirror
is that a damn old mirror
dont really tell the whole truth
it dont show whats deep inside
or read between the lines
and its really no reflection of my youth

chorus
sometimes i feel like jesse james
still trying to make a name
knowing nothings gonna change what i am
i was a young troubador
when i wrote in on a song
and ill be an old troubador when im gone

i was a young troubador
when i wrote in on a song
and ill be an old troubador when im gone
ill be an old troubador when im gone8embed"
