drinking wine and thinking bliss is on the other side of this
i just need a compass and a willing accomplice
all my doubts that fill my head cascading up and down again
up and down and round again down and up and down again
oh ive had my chances and ive taken them all
just to end up right back here on the floor
to end up right back here on the floor

chorus
pennies in a well a million dollars in the fountain of a hotel
fortune teller that says maybe you will go to hell
but im not scared at all mmm
of the cracks in the crystal the cracks in the crystal ball

verse 2
sometimes you think everything is wrapped inside a diamond ring
love just needs a witness and a little forgiveness
and a halo of patience and a less sporadic pace and
im learning to be brave in my beautiful mistakes
oh ive felt that fire and i ive been burned
but i wouldnt trade the pain for what ive learned
i wouldnt trade the pain for what ive learned

chorus
pennies in a well a million dollars in the fountain of a hotel
fortune teller that says maybe you will go to hell
but im not scared at all mmm
of the cracks in the crystal the cracks in the crystal ball
see pnk liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likebridge
irony irony is hating love hating love
for what it does to me what its done to me
what is done done

chorus
pennies in a well a million dollars in the fountain of a hotel
broken mirrors and a black cats cold stare
walk under ladders on my way to hell ill meet you there
but im not scared at all mmm
no im not scared at all
of the cracks in the crystal the cracks in the crystal ballembed"
