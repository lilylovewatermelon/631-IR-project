cold drink chilling in my right hand
watchin you sleep in the evening light
resting up for a long long night

when the sun goes down well be feeling all right
when the sun sinks down over the water
everything gets hotter when the sun goes down yeah

all day long just takin it easy
laying in the hammock where its nice and breezy
sleeping off the night before
cause when the sun goes down well be back for more

when the sun goes down well be feeling all right
when the sun sinks down over the water
everything gets hotter when the sun goes down
