damn we left a beautiful mess on the hardwood floor
your  dress my jeans made a hell of a scene from the night before
the  last thing i wanna do is get in my truck
all fingers crossed that chevy dont fire up

chorus
cause girl you make it hard to leave
you  got some kind of hold on me
you  drive me wild givin me that smile
and my shirt in these sheets
girl  i cant make these boots
take a single step away from you
got a goodbye kiss that gets the best of me
yeah you make it hard to leave

verse 2
i  wish i had a dime for every single time you made me late
pullin these all nighters might get me fired but thats okay
ill trade 10 long hours on a roof in a summer heat
for another five minutes of you in this bed with me

chorus
cause girl you make it hard to leave
you got some kind of hold on me
you drive me wild givin me that smile
and my shirt in these sheets
girl i cant make these boots
take a single step away from you
got a goodbye kiss that gets the best of me
yeah you make it hard to leave
yeah you make it hard to leave
