verse
keep it g i know you love me but i know you want millions too
i really wasnt trying to bug you but i just left your city too
thats just my influence somewhere id probably lose it
on the e way drive stupid
she said she shouldve called a uber
three k for a pint of lean samе thing for her hair and nails
red seats shе ride with me
fear of god my car from hell
sheesh ayy uh
sold your soul to the internet my money cant get it back
on drugs protectin my energy
if im sober probably get em whacked
she serve and thats probably me ima take it for apology
fuck the friend im tryna be better
back on xans cause i cant forget her
lean drinkin with a bartender told mama she not a stripper
hm man

thats just my influence thats just my influence
