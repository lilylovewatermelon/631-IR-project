verse 1
a  is for all the love and the life took away
f  dont forget we were bought and trade
r  ripped from the land and shipped away
i   is the inspiration we use to survive
c  have to see it with your own cries
a  no play add it up and arrive
still you dont know
the land is so gold and green
the place is so fresh and clean
and everyday i water my garden
tell if you feel i deep in your heart and
the space is so cool and nice
visit once guaranteed to visit twice
and if you just believe in the most high
i know youll be all right mama africa has

verse 2
a  thats my favorite place when i need to get away
f   must forget but we cant forget to pray
r   flight lands right on the runway
i    in my homeland and im feeling so alive
c  imagine africa unite
a  go on an accept her now its all right
still you dont know
skin is so dark and brown
she lifts me right off the ground
but no youre not gonna see it on your tv
so yo just listen up and believe me
her trees have the only cure
her love is so new and pure
had to kiss them troubles goodbye bye
no i dont have to lie
