yeah
tryna figure out the difference
but i think—think the lines are starting to get blurred

verse 1 eminem
im in a strange place
i feel like mae when he gave up the game for his faith
i feel like im caged in these chains and restraints
grimmin every stranger in the place while i gaze into space
‘cause im mentally rearrangin his face
i need a change of pace
‘cause the pace im workin ats dangerous
theres nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
i done quit chicken heads cold turkey
and started slowly roastin em
‘cause thats where most of my anger is based
fuck your feelings
i feel like i play for the saints
i just wanna hurt you—aim for the skanks
then aim for all these fake kanyes jays waynes and the drakes
im frustrated ‘cause aint no more nsync now im all out of whack
im all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack
im goin all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is im strapped for battle
suck a duck crawl out the back—its a bar fight
prepare your arsenal
and beware of bar stools flyin through the air and bottles breakin mirrors also
and i aint stoppin til the swear jars full
you done called every woman a slut but youre forgetting sarah marshall palin
oh my bad slut and next time i show up to court
ill be naked and just wear a law suit
judge be like thats sharp
how much that motherfucker cost you smartass
youre lucky i dont tear it off you
and jump your bones you sexy motherfucker
youre so fuckin gravy marshall i should start callin you au jus
‘cause alls you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
evil twin take this beat now its all you
i believe people can change but only for the worse
i coulda changed the world if it wasnt for this verse—so satanic
kmart chains panic ‘cause they cant even spin back the curse words
‘cause theyre worse when theyre reversed motherfucker
rekcufrehtom rape your mother— tihs kill your parents
and these kids are like parrots
they run around the house just like terrorists
screamin fuck shit fuck
adult with a childishlike arrogance
wild ever since the day i came out i was like merits
fuck that id rather be loud and i like swearin
from the first album even the gals were like tight lyrics dreamy eyes
but my fuckin mouth was nightmarish
and from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite
sometimes i listen and revisit them old albums often as i can and skim through all them bitches to make sure i keep up with my competition haha
hogger of beats hoarder of rhymes
borderline genius whos bored of his lines
and that sort of defines where im at and the way i feel now
feel like i might just strike first then ignore the replies
you might also likehook eminem  royce da 59
theres darkness closing in evil twin there it goes again my evil twin
it controls my pen my evil twin but that aint me its my evil twin
then i step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin
but hes just a friend evil twin who pops up now and again evil twin
so dont blame me evil twin blame him its my evil twin
then i step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin

interlude
welcome back to the land of the living my friend
you have slept for quite some time

verse 2 eminem
so whos left lady gaga mess with the bieber
nah f with christina
i aint fuckin with either jessica neither simpson or alba
my albums just sicker than strep with the fever
get the chloraseptic excedrin aleve or
extra strength tylenol 3s
feel like im burnin to death but im freezin
bedridden and destined never to leave the
bedroom ever again like the legend of heathuh
ledger
my suicide notes barely legible read the
bottom its signed by the joker
lorena said i never can leave her
shell sever my wiener i ever deceive her
fuck that shit bitch give up my dick for pussy
ill be jerry mathers i ever left it to beaver
get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver
golly wolly i vent heat register jesus
ever since 19946 dresden it was definitely in my destiny
when on the steps i met deshaun at osborn
id never make it to sophomore
i just wanted to skip school and rap
used to mop floors flip burgers and wash dishes
while i wrote rhymes tryna get props for em
‘cause i took book smarts and swapped for em
they were sleepin i made em stop snorin
made em break out the popcorn
now ive been hip hop in its tiptop form
since nwa was blarin through my car windows
leanin on the horn screamin fuck the police like cop porn
flipped rap on its ear like i dropped corn
fuck top five bitch im top four
and that includes biggie and pac whore
and i got an evil twin
so who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spots for
and crazy as i am im much tamer than him and im nuts
then again who the fuck wants a plain eminem
but no ones insaner than slim look at that evil grin
evil twin please come in what was your name again
hi faggot
look whos back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
two rabbits a koala bear and a ball of hair
and youre all aware i dont got it all upstairs
guess thats why im an addict and its so small up there
peace to whitney
jeez just hit me
that i should call the looney police to come get me
‘cause im so sick of bein the truth
i wish someoned finally admit me
to a mental hospital with britney
oh lmfao no way jo
se baez couldnt beat this rap—oj no
hooray im off the hook like casey anthony hey ho hey ho
i sound like im tryna sing the fuckin chorus to hip hop hooray
no i’m hollerin you got bottomend like an 808
and i base whether were fuckin off that instead of your face so
let your lowend raise yo
tango what you think ho slow dancin or bowling
you tryin to hold hands with your homie
what you think im lookin for romance ‘cause im lonely
change that tune you aint got a remote chance to control me
ho im only vulnerable when i got a boner
superman try to fuck me over it wont hurt
dont try to fix me im broke so i dont work
so are you but youre broke ‘cause you dont work
but all bullshit aside i hit a stride
still shady inside hair every bit as dyed
as it used to be when i first introduced yall to my skittish side
and blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
‘cause we are the same
