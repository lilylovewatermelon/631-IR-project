under the tree where the grass dont grow
we made a promise to never get old
you had a chance and you took it on me
and i made a promise that i couldnt keep

prechorus
heartache heartbreaks all over town
but something flipped like a switch when you came around
and im in pieces pick me up and put me together
oh whoa oh

chorus 1
these are the days weve been waiting for
on days like these who could ask for more
keep them coming cause were not done yet
these are the days we wont regret
these are the days we wont forget
these are the days weve been waiting for
rattle the cage and slam that door
and the world is calling us but not just yet
these are the days we wont regret
these are the days we wont forget

verse 2
out on the midnight the wild ones howl
the last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel
we used to believe we were stars aligned
you made a wish and i fell out of
you might also likeprechorus
time flew cut through all over town
you made me bleed when i look up and youre not around
but im in pieces pick me up and put me together
oh whoa oh

chorus 2
these are the days weve been waiting for
neither of us knows whats in store
you just roll your window down and place your bets
these are the days we wont regret
these are the days well never forget
and these are the days these are the days
and these are the days these are the days
