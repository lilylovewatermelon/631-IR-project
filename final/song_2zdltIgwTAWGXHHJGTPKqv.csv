traffic crawls
cell phone calls
talk radio screams at me
through my tinted window i see
a little girl
a rust red minivan
shes got chocolate on her face
got little hands

prechorus 1
and she waves at me
yeah she smiles at me

chorus
well hello world how ya been
good to see you my old friend
sometimes i feel cold as steel
broken like im never gonna heal
i see a light a little hope in a little girl
well hello world

verse 2
every day i drive by
a little white church
its got these little white crosses
like angels in the yard
maybe i should stop on in
say a prayer
maybe talk to god
like he is there
prechorus 2
ooh i know hes there
yeah i know hes there

chorus
well hello world how ya been
good to see you my old friend
sometimes i feel as cold as steel
and broken like im never gonna heal
i see a light a little grace a little faith unfurl
well hello world

bridge
sometimes i forget what livings for
and i hear my life through my front door
and ill breathe it in oh im home again
i see my wife my little boy little girl
hello world
hello world

outro
all the empty disappears
i remember why im here
just surrender and believe
i fall down on my knees
oh hello world
hello world
