outro sample
so i gave him an ultimatum
and i said i cant just keep living and moving with you all over the united states without a commitment
theres no certainty you know of a future and i wanted to have children and that was important to me so we got married
im not sure i think i wouldve waited to find
i probably wouldve held out longer to get married cause i i just i dont know
you never really know for sure but i had serious doubts when i got married and i i shouldve listened to my heart more
cause when youre young youre idealistic and you think your love is gonna change a person but it really doesnt
they are who they are think it might make slight modifications but they basically are who they are and who you see and who you feel that they are
so be cautious when youre searching and dont just give your love away2embed"
