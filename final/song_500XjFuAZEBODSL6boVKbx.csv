slip away your vanity is gone
im falling out of place
we all fall down the pain goes on
we bare the fruit of war
and turn the lost away
we all fall down the pain goes on
and ill be the fire that dries the flood

chorus
as i fight for one last prayer
i keep holding on
no love to believe in
as i drag the devil down
i will stand alone
no longer defeated

verse 2
stripped away we rise above it all
forgotten and betrayed
we all fall down the pain goes on
no better than before
still broken and afraid
we all fall down the pain goes on
and ill be the cloud that hides the sun
see breaking benjamin liveget tickets as low as 117you might also likechorus
as i fight for one last prayer
i keep holding on
no love to believe in
as i drag the devil down
i will stand alone
no longer defeated

bridge
im falling to pieces
stained and used
i know what i need and its not you
its not you

chorus
as i fight for one last prayer
i keep holding on
no love to believe in
as i drag the devil down
i will stand alone
no longer defeated

outro
no longer defeated
no longer defeatedembed"
