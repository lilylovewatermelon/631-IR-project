waited on you for so long
too many days since january
im still sitting here alone
we shouldve did this already
said i got a email today
kind of thought that you forgot about me
but i wanna hit you back to say
just like you i get lonely

chorus
baby i could really get to know you
take my time and show you
dont tell anybody what we do
when i get lonely
take me to another place where ill be
face to face just you and me with no rules
just like you i get lonely too
ooh ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh
just like you i get lonely too
ooh ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh
just like you i get lonely

verse 2
ready for us to get it on
aint got a love to call steady
hope it aint like that for long
ill be your friend if you let me
dont wanna come on strong
cause too many people wanna get me
but you know i do what i gotta do
just like you i get lonely
