i thought it was important to go right into the booth after the arguing
i think its only right hoarse and everything
like fuck it though whats up

verse 1 wale
pessimism is all that she know
cause every brother she go with always pick up and go
i been trying to show you somethin got a different approach
told her give me your heart try to get you the globe
have the world baby girl live it up you deserve it
every time she catch feelings she go throw away the gloves
we go together  break up
we go together  break up
aint this an insecure bitch meanin we love to make up
when we good we good shawty
we dont ever make love
but if i call you out your name i bet your ready to uh
you say you ready you aint ready enough
cause when it fall right in your lap you be ready to get up
this is her this is it this is sabotage love counterfeit

my girl likes to sabotage our love yeah
she can only take so much more than her heart got
she can only live for the moment
why ill never know it
guess ill meet her right back at start

verse 2 wale
lets roll a j and pretend we in love
ive got a paper plane its propelling my buzz
im trying to make a way she never call back
shes tryna fall back cuz she say im all that
she only love me when i be ignoring
when i be doing throwin it on her shorty brushing me off
i swear i kinda feel like shes slightly bizarre
sabotage all the time have me avatard
blue ball who fault mine only cause i stick around
she leave before the sun up leave you something to think about
yea and this is something to think about
why people want you single every time that you got a spouse
ha that make it hard to be faithful
knowing i can go wherever and get 8 more
ten more depending on where wale going

shit ain’t better alone

keep coming back for more keep coming back for more
keep coming back for more keep coming back for
