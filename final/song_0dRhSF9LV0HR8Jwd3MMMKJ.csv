notice me
take my hand
why are we
strangers when

prechorus
our love is strong
why carry on without me

every time i try to fly i fall
without my wings i feel so small
i guess i need you baby
and every time i see you in my dreams
i see your face its haunting me
i guess i need you baby

verse 2
i make believe
that you are here
its the only way
i see clear

prechorus
what have i done
you seem to move on easy

my weakness caused you pain
and this songs my sorry

at night i pray
that soon your face will fade away

chorus
and every time i try to fly i fall
without my wings i feel so small
i guess i need you baby
and every time i see you in my dreams
i see your face youre haunting me
i guess i need you baby26embed"
