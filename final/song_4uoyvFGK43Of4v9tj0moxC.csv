took a deep breath in the mirror
he didnt like it when i wore high heels
but i do
turn the lock and put my headphones on
he always said he didnt get this song
but i do i do

verse 2
i walked in expecting youd be late
but you got here early and you stand and wave
i walk to you
you pull my chair out and help me in
and you dont know how nice that is
but i do

chorus
and you throw your head back laughin like a little kid
i think its strange that you think im funny cause he never did
ive been spending the last eight months
thinkin all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a café i watched it begin again

verse 3
you said you never met one girl who
had as many james taylor records as you
but i do
we tell stories and you dont know why
im comin off a little shy
but i do
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likechorus
but you throw your head back laughin like a little kid
i think its strange that you think im funny cause he never did
ive been spending the last eight months
thinkin all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a café i watched it begin again

bridge
and we walked down the block to my car
and i almost brought him up
but you start to talk about the movies
that your family watches every single christmas
and i wanna talk about that
and for the first time whats past is past

chorus
cause you throw your head back laughin like a little kid
i think its strange that you think im funny cause he never did
ive been spending the last eight months
thinkin all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a café i watched it begin again

outro
hmm hmm
but on a wednesday in a café i watched it begin again40embed"
