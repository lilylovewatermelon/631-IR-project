i lost my leg like i lost my way
so no loose ends
nothing to see me down
how are we going to work this out

verse 2 2d
dreams are bad our heads are mad
i love the girl
but god only knows its
getting hard to see the sun coming through
i love you
but what are we going to do

verse 3 2d
picture im a dreamer ill take you deeper
down to the sleepy glow
time is a low
dont you know
what are we going to do

bridge 2d
when we go down
for all the sacred selfless days
only left with heartache
i want to see you again
i love you
but what are we going to do
