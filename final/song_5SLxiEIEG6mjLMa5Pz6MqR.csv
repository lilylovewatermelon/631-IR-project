verse 3 tech n9ne
ive been nice to you rapper cats for a long time
i left kansas city so them other cats can go and shine
but it seems these punks are confused because im my own kind
but im back on deck cause kansas city is whose throne mine
this aint no punk shit
nigga this is strength at its finest
i made this shit so you all you simps can rewind it
meaning you pussies who say this tech shit aint hard for real
and try to disregard the real
you motherfuckers is hard to feel
i get your death threats cause im the king bitch
money groupies drugs and alcohol and bling shit
but i stay ahead of the game
and you punks is so late
cause my one gangsta track will demolish your whole tape
ive been with every rapper whos legendary
underground to mainstream know that tech is very hard
cause i bring the heater
love me cause im your leader
bitches they suck my peter
while im drinkin margaritas
