verse 1
checked in at the royal garden
to chill and avoid my problems
until paranoia caused me
to feel like im going bonkers
for real think my toilets talkin
i spilled like like forty bottles
of pills think your boy is startin
to feel like a spoiled carton of milk
cause it just occurred
my girls cheatin im kickin that fucking bitch to the curb
but the word fucking aint meant to be a descriptive word
the type of bitch she is aint no adjective its a verb
ho thinks her snatch is magical
but thats how she attracts men though
traps em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
in fact itll be nothin to throw that lil bitch with a capital b out the back window
of the black cadillac limo like a whack demo
when im strapped when i spit rapid like a ratchet
a halfwit ill aim at then ill
been fire bitch i can outrap reynolds
a pad and penll be great but a napkinll do
return of the whack sicko
head spinnin like invisibl skratch piklz
yeah shadys back see the bat signal
its time to go bat shit like you accidentally ate a louisville slugger and crapped it
id like to introduce myself

i could keep beefin fuck is the point
i could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to detroit
if youre still looking for smoke i already gave you an l
id rather just see you in hell but i should get puff on the joint diddy
wait run it back i said give you an l inhale
puff on the joint i am the blunt you avoid
used to get jumped for my prowings
when i was growing up they said a slinkys a wonderful toy
my mother thought i was such a fun little boy
oh what a bundle of joy
until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
from a tantrum i was throwing
like a motherfuckin disgruntled employee
i dont cut the beat til i fuckin destroy it
once i get going rain thunder its storming
puddles are forming i hear somebodys voice
in my head say its still a dream
then he said kill emcees
trippie redd with pills and lean
sipping meds in the limousine
getting head guillotine
chorus
my name’s marsh and im out this world this world
s on my chest superman like its plural its lit
call me extra extraterrestrial yeah
extra extra extraterrestrial
