i open my eyes
i try to see but im blinded by the white light
i cant remember how i cant remember why
iâ€™m lying here tonight
and i cant stand the pain
and i cant make it go away
no i cant stand the pain

chorus
how could this happen to me
ive made my mistakes
got nowhere to run
the night goes on as im fading away
im sick of this life
i just wanna scream
how could this happen to me

verse 2
everybodys screaming
i try to make a sound but no one hears me
im slipping off the edge im hanging by a thread
i wanna start this over again
so i try to hold on to a time when nothing mattered
and i cant explain what happened
and i cant erase the things that ive done
no i cant
