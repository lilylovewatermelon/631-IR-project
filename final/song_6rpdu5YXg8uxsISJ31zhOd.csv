i been watchin these wannabe cowboys
getting turned down like a radio
i been sittin here watching you
thinking of one or two new ways to say no
but you been tappin them tony lamas
you got one thing on your mind
and girl with that body cant believe nobodys
asked you to dance all night

chorus
so lets get ya out there on a hardwood
spread around a little sawdust
girl lets slide like a steel guitar should
then make this holeinthewall all jealous of us
these boys dont know how to twostep
lets show em how to honkytonk
cause i aint here to drop pickup lines
and you aint here to talk nah

postchorus
step step to the left
step step to the right

verse 2
yeah i could ask if you fell from heaven
where youre hidin them angel wings where they at
i could say you look like loretta lynn circa 1973
i could buy you another fruity drink
but you been drinkin free here all night long
id rather use that money to keep the band country
playin your favorite songs
