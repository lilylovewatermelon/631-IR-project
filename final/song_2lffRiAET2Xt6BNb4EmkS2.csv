its not the first time
that ive watched you
passing by
ive tried too hard
to get back there
but youâ€™re not on time
anymore

tried to get in with you
for a second time
you said the worlds closed in
but you crawled in
back inside

chorus
so please
run away
so please
run away

verse 2
i tried to believe in fate
for a second try
its there in the safe
why dont you
close the blinds
for the night
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likechorus
