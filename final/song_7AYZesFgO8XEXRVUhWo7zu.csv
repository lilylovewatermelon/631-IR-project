ohoohooh mmm yeah

verse 1
my skin is like a map
of where my heart has been
and i cant hide the marks
but its not a negative thing
so i let down my guard drop my defenses down by my clothes
im learning to fall with no safety net to cushion the blow

chorus
i bruise easily so be gentle when you handle me
theres a mark you leave
like a love heart carved on a tree
i bruise easily
cant scratch the surface without moving me
underneath i bruise easily
i bruise easily yeah

verse 2
i found your fingerprints
on a glass of wine
do you know youre leaving them
all over this heart of mine too
but if i never take this leap of faith ill never know
so im learning to fall with no safety net to cushion the blow
