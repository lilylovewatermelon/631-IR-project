love without guilt love without doubt
love without guilt love without doubt
love without guilt love without doubt
rejection love without doubt
love without guilt love without doubt
love without guilt love without doubt
love without guilt love without doubt
rejection love without doubt

verse 1
i dont dont care if its not right
dont go near the fire dont go in the dark
to have your arms around me
dont give in to your desire cause hes going to break your heart
i want to feel what its like
let go let go
take all of you inside of me

chorus
in your eyes in your eyes forbidden love
in your smile in your smile forbidden love
in your kiss in your kiss forbidden love
if i had one wish love would feel like this love would feel like this

verse  2
i know that youre no good for me
thats why i feel i must confess
whats wrong is why it feels so right
i want to feel your sweet caress

wishing on the stars above

love without guilt love without doubt
love without guilt love without doubt
rejection love without doubt
