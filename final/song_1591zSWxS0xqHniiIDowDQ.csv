hook
theres no such thing as maybe
burn it like its fading
no more hesitating
let the sparks fly baby
drive it like ya race it
you can call me crazy
im just tired of waiting
let the sparks fly baby

verse i
give me one if its real
and two if you can feel it
give me three signs that youre awake
it only takes one spark
for two to fall apart
and three more to blow it away
give me one if its real
and two if you can feel it
give me three signs that youre awake
it only takes one spark
for two to fall apart
and three more to blow it away

verse ii
give me one good reason
two more to believe in
and three shots at why i should wait
cause i got one more match

give me three signs that youre awake
it only takes one spark
but two to fall apart
and three more to blow it away
