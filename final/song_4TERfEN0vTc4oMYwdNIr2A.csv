cant i just crack a window cant i just shake it off
im sure ive tasted this before before before
im sure ive tasted this before
everything is out of reach and i
just want to see outside
the air the air has been getting thin
i feel like cutting it open tonight tonight yeah
and falling on the floor
theres nothing left unused in here
theres nothing left to say
i havent talked in days
im really not too sure what i sound like anymore
my vision has gone and my mouth is full is full of sores
i feel like dripping it dry tonight yeah
over and over again
