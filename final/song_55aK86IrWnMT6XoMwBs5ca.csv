stephen groans who black panther vampire he sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels who drive fergus now and pierce woods woven shade

he turns on his left side sighing doubling himself together

bloom poetry well educated pity he bends again and undoes the buttons of stephens waistcoat to breathe he brushes the wood shavings from stephens clothes with light hands and fingers one pound seven not hurt anyhow he listens what

murmurs

 shadows the woods
 white breast dim


he stretches out his arms sighs again and curls his body bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect a dog barks in the distance bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant he looks down on stephens face and form

bloom communes with the night face reminds me of his poor mother in the shady wood the deep white breast ferguson i think i caught a girl some girl best thing could happen him he murmurs swear that i will always hail ever conceal never reveal any part or parts art or arts he murmurs in the rough sands of the sea a cabletows length from the shore where the tide ebbs  and flows

silent thoughtful alert he stands on guard his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master against the dark wall a figure appears slowly a fairy boy of eleven a changeling kidnapped dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet holding a book in his hand he reads from right to left inaudibly smiling kissing the page

bloom wonderstruck calls inaudibly rudy

rudy gazes unseeing into blooms eyes and goes on reading kissing smiling he has a delicate mauveface on his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons in his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot a white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket10embed"
