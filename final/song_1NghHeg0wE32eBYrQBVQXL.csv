verse 1
theres a story that i was told
and i wanna tell the world before i get too old
and dont remember it so lets december it
and reassemble it oh yeah
once upon a time in a town like this
a little girl made a great big wish
to fill the world full of happiness
and be on santas magic list

verse 2
at the same time miles away
a little boy made a wish that day
that the world would be okay
and santa claus would hear him say
i got dreams and i got love
i got my feet on the ground and family above
can you send some happiness with my best
to the rest of the people of the east and the west
and maybe every once in a while
you give my grandma a reason to smile
tis the season to smile
its cold but well be freezing in style
and let me meet a girl one day
that wants to spread some love this way
we can let our souls run free
and she can open some happiness with me

chorus
shake it up shake up the happiness
wake it up wake up the happiness
come on yall

shake it up shake up the happiness
wake it up wake up the happiness
come on yall
