its every breath that comes before
heartache ive heard is part of life
and i have broken more and more

but i can hope how this will end
with every line a comedy
that we could learn to love without demand
but unreserved honesty
if i am not afraid to die
and you are crouching at my door
and suffering is all there is to gain in life
then what is all this waiting for
i can see how this will end
in all its bitter tragedy
ill give you all i have to spend
and youll give nothing back to me

i will wait for this to end
the back and forth the battery
for you at last to comprehend
the kind of love of which i speakyou might also like1embed"
