im always screaming my lungs out til my head starts spinning
playing my songs is the way i cope with life
wont keep my voice down
know the words i speak are the thoughts i think out loud
i like to keep things honest
im a safe bet like your lifes staked on it for real
id hate to keep you all wondering
im constant like the seasons and i will never be forgotten man

prechorus
lets leave no words unspoken and save regrets for the broken
will you even look back when you think of me

chorus
all i want is a place to call my own
to mend the hearts of everyone who feels alone
woah you know to keep your
hopes up high and your head down low

postchorus
keep your hopes up high and your head down low

verse 2
still got something left to prove it tends to keep things movin
while everyone around me says my last days are looming
overhead but what the hell do they think they know
my heads above the water while they drown in the undertow
