when romes in ruins
we are the lions free of the colosseums
in poison places we are antivenom
were the beginning of the end

prechorus
tonight the foxes hunt the hounds
its all over now
before it has begun
weve already won
chorus
we are wild
we are like young volcanoes
we are wild
americana exotica do you wanna feel a little beautiful baby

verse 2
cmon make it easy say i never mattered
run it up the flag pole
we will teach you how to make boys next door
out of assholes hahaha

prechorus
tonight the foxes hunt the hounds
its all over now
before it has begun
