how you feel you made it clear

you said fuck this life and popped a pill or two

you said fuck this life and popped a pill or two
i stay inside my room i love the solitude

she just smoked a spliff and i can smell it on her breath

and i guess that its a part of gettin oh oh old its feeling cold

chorus
and i got problems and you have problems too
i said fuck my life i got a point to prove
you said fuck this life and popped a pill or two
i stay inside my room i love the solitude

seklenland non c’est pas des lol
un jour on fera ltour du globe
j’fais une passe devant moi il y a lglobe
pour l’instant les condés mtraquent à mort
tu connais déjà on vend la mort
3f réputé pour les com’
j’connais les pétards emballe ton gom
tu veux nous fumer mais gros tu dors
j’connais ratepi qui choiera ton or
quand j’s’rais mort ils diront qu’j’suis fort
mes textes sont remplis d’métaphores
t’est’es boosté mais mon gars t’es pas fort
tout seul dans ma bulle nique tes morts
tout seul dans ma bulle nique tes morts
j’vais rentrer pépettes pendant qu’tu dors
il y en a plus d’un qui ont peur d’la mort
il y en a plus d’un qui m’écoutent en scred
j’suis dans la ville gros pet’ au bec
demande à coyote wallah j’les baise
on suce pas on est pas des dép’
maman pleure à six heures ça pète
j’envoie les ballons comme phil foden
tous les jours mon gava faut qu’ça becte
tous les jours mon gava faut qu’ça becte
j’finis au telho avec mon ex
libérer mon gava sls
j’pense à lui dans l’auto quand j’suis sten
plus fort qu’eux il y a zéro suspens
plus fort qu’eux il y a zéro suspens
j’barode dans la ville active mode s
mon gava on sait faire l’oseille
et wallah on t’éteint pour l’oseille
il y a que pour les passes dé’ que j’prends l’bus
les condés veulent remont’ la puce
j’la baise fort elle dit h t’abuses
tu fais le chaud au volant vu qu’ta bu
on les connais c’est des vrai acteurs
hld il envoie de la pure
tu veux baiser mais ta chatte elle pue
c’est connu sans pitié on n’a pas de cœur
j’suis zehef comme un gars qui prend 10 ans
ça t’allume ta mère à bout portant
il y a du nouveau kamas tiens lechant
on t’encule ta mère si on descend
ça déboule et tes gars ils déchantent
pourtant dans la clique on n’est pas cinquante
j’envoi un tipeu pour la cinquante
j’allume un gros kamas dans la planque

chorus
j’ai vendu ma meca dans tous les coins dparis

interlude
okay for the interlude section of this this set
were gonna be talking to my good friend adam thr6x
adam thr6x say whats— say hello
hello
um so for this section im gonna explain to him about this thing i just started watching on netflix called chimp empire
um okay so basically its this show that follows this group of chimps in in africa somewhere
and they are like like a  apparently its like the biggest group of chimpanzees in the world and theyre like kinda civilized and shit
like they have like a hierarchy of leadership
and um theres like one specific chimp and this is no spoilers dont worry guys um
theres a theres a chimp whos like at the top named jackson
and he has another bigger chimp whos like is his bodyguard kind of named miles
and uh it basically sh— is the first episode is all ive seen
but it shows like the sort of didichotomy between jackson and miles and their their opp uh abrams
and abrams is like a younger chimp whos tryna become the new alpha
but abram but um but miles and fuckin jackson are like not letting him even though jackson is like a little too old to be an alpha
but because he has a younger miles whos like hes like the biggest chimp that uh i think its called the ngogo chimpanzees um ever seen
like its the biggest one theyve ever had and uh hes like kind of a fucking huge beast
but the like the big sort of drama the first episode is like they all like they have drama like in their like ininside their chimpanzee community
but then all the other neighbouring chimpanzee communities they have been with them
so like theres this one part where they they
they like slide on the other chimpanzees and they run them out of their territory
but then later in the episode one of the chimpanzees i dont remember what his name is
he gets jumped by the uh he is alone and gets jumped and killed by like another group of chimpanzees
and all like jackson and abrams and everybody comes together
and they just look so fucking sad like watching this chimp dead
i dont know its really fucking sad but yeah thats
thats chimp empire what is your are you gonna watch it

were fucking in a car shooting heroin
saying controversial things just for the hell of it slowsilver03
