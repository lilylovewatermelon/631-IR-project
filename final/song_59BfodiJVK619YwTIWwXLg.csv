i hate to see you cry
my love is dying inside
i hate to see you cry
your smile is a beautiful lie

verse 1 vika jigulina with edward maya
can i get to your soul can you get to my flow
can we promise we wont let go
all the things that i need all the things that you need
you can make it feel so real
cause you cant deny youve blown my mind
when i touch your body i feel im losing control
cause you cant deny youve blown my mind
when i see you baby i just dont wanna let go

chorus 2 edward maya

oh baby baby i run but im running to you
