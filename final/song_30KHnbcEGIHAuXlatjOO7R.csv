this is so dumb this is so bad
gotta be numb to push you like that
liftin me up lettin me fall
fuck with my head like its nothin at all
you were my sun you were my earth
i was your best and you were my worst
breakin my heart one piece at a time
well heres a piece of my mind yeah

chorus nick jonas
you dont know what it is you do to me
yeah you stole my heart
and all i have is a hole where it used to be
and the hardest part is
now youve got some substitute for me
but hes not the one
you dont know what it is you do to me
yeah you leave me numb
yeah you leave me numb numb

verse 2 nick jonas
losin my mind losin control
swallow my pride you swallow me whole
smile on my face to cover my hurt
spent so much time but what was that worth
im broken apart im savin it all
cross in my hand mistaken for love
nails in my back they dont mean a thing
they aint yours they aint yours

verse 3 angel haze  nick jonas
i got trapped off in a black box lit from the matchbox in your rage
you said we are merely players who still act off of the stage
i kept begging you to stay like baby please dont leave me
know you dont like trouble but whats one more season
and i dream on you gettin your plot and your scheme on
and i just be here with my theme song
he love me he love me no he dont
cause you make me feel like the night before christmas
love is a crime and im stuck in your prison
far as you want baby i go the distance
if you numb and im numb then what is we feelin

chorus nick jonas
you dont know what it is you do to me
yeah you stole my heart
and all i have is a hole where it used to be
and the hardest part is
now youve got some substitute for me
but hes not the one
you dont know what it is you do to me you do to me yeah
yeah you leave me numb numb
