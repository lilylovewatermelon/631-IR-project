down at the mall is the one whos got it all
the answer to my prayers just two doors down from sears
i was surprised because they mostly hire guys
shes the girl shes the girl at the video game store

shes smart and shes sweet and she knows all of the cheats
her thumbs are lightning fast at tekken shell beat your behind
she was nice to me she helped me buy my wii
shes the girl shes the girl
shes the girl shes the girl at the video game store

i was alone playing by myself
oh then i was alone there must be something else
then she gave me her code now shes on my friend list
oh my heart i hope this joy is never ending

i was alone so alone playing by myself by myself
oh then i was alone very alone
there must be something else something else
then she gave me her code now shes on my friend list
oh my heart i hope this joy is never ending
