this next song is called i have seen the rain and it was written by my daddy mr jim moore uh he wrote it back in vietnam about 40 years ago and i grew up singing it with him at different vietnam vet functions its how i learned to harmonize and how to love an acoustic guitar and the way that we recorded it it was my dads first time in a recording studio and he always said singers dont really have to work too hard  and he changed his mind that day uhm but we did it live him and i in the vocal booth together him playing and singing and me harmonizing one take straight through uhm it was really really a good time it was really special to be able to record a song with my dad the first song i ever learned uhm we hope you like it and we dedicate it to all the vets out there

verse 1 pnk  james t moore
i have seen the rain
i have felt the pain
i dont know where ill be tomorrow
i dont know where im going
i dont even know where ive been
but i know id like to see them again

chorus pnk  james t moore

oh theyve said i shouldve been more
probably so if i hadnt of been in that crazy damn vietnam war
