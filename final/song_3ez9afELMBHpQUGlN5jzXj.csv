the days go by we argue all the time
i want to make it right ‘cause that was last night
baby we gon be alright baby we gon be alright
yea yea love was the mark bullets to your heart
i want to move on but my feelings too strong
i don’t wanna waste time i don’t wanna waste time

verse 1 – tyga
man i know we ain’t finished when it’s barely beginning
all the time i done put in i put in but time was ending
so silly chasing a feeling figured you felt different
but so many so many girls but i just stay with ya
see love wasn’t my intention
rather play dominoes
count money with my niggas shoot dice
give me seven rolling out the gate i hit it twice
black eyed peas money baby it’s gon be a good night
and when i said i love you yeah i fuckin’ meant it
and we ain’t gotta bring your moms and your sister in it
house too big they all trying to spend the night
you always inviting them and i don’t even be liking it
at all and i don’t even say shit
‘cause i just like to see you happy even when you faking it
so flagrant you foul ass bitch man i hate you
i hope we can make up in the am
see tyga liveget tickets as low as 300you might also likehook
‘cause the days go by we argue all the time
i want to make it right ‘cause that was last night
baby we gon be alright baby we gon be alright
yea yea love was the mark bullets to your heart
i want to move on but my feelings too strong
i don’t wanna waste time i don’t wanna waste time
it’s like we’re in a love game love game
love game love game
yea yea yea yea
it’s like we’re in a love game love game
love game love game
yea yea yea yea

verse 2 – tyga
uhh for every last king need a queen
if you love me now then forever hold this ring
hold me down defend it hold me down no witness
you always got so much pride but once you look in my eyes
it’s over you even told me about you when you was younger
how your father abused you i let you cry on my shoulder
no tissue just short sleeve tears seethrough
our lives equal thinking what you been through
uhh yo genie here
yea i grant you every wish
put you in environments good company success
already set you going with the best
i know i lied before but trust me i ain’t like your ex
sex so good break up then break a sweat
we should stay together then we fight again
same old shit different location
feeling like my time wasted
hook
‘cause the days go by we argue all the time
i want to make it right ‘cause that was last night
baby we gon be alright baby we gon be alright
yea yea love was the mark bullets to your heart
i want to move on but my feelings too strong
i don’t wanna waste time i don’t wanna waste time
it’s like we’re in a love game love game
love game love game
yea yea yea yea
it’s like we’re in a love game love game
love game love game
yea yea yea yea

verse 3 – tyga
trying to forget someone that you love
like trying to remember someone that you never knew
think about it i dream about it
my nightmares haunting me i can’t sleep about it
anxiety can’t breathe can’t live without you
the revival all these verses is my survival
standing at the podium waiting on your arrival
one day but no return
like usher say gotta let it burn

outro – tyga
the hardest part of dreaming about someone you love
is waking up to see that person gone
you know it it it takes seconds to say hello
but forever to say goodbye
moving on is easy but what you leave behind
is what makes it hard…26embed"
