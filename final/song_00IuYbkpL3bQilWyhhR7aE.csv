granddaddy always said when he was 17
he met the girl the one in all his dreams
and man that was it he never once looked back
he found something he just knew was gonna last
and if you ask him bout that day
he’ll just tap his chest
and say

chorus
that’s how you know
when it grabs a hold of you and won’t let go
and you feel like she’s always been in your soul
and as time goes by she’s still surprising you
that’s how you it’s true
when a new love feels old
and an old love feels new

verse 2
he said i walked up to her door
and i was shaking like a leave there on her porch
til she flashed that smile at me
and son she took my breathe away
and she still does to this day

chorus
that’s how you know
when it grabs a hold of you and won’t let go
when you feel like she’s always been in your soul
and as time goes by she’s still surprising you
that’s how you know it’s true
when a new love feels old
and an old love feels new

chorus
