verse
record label full of smackers rap group with no rappers

ice on my neck when it melt eat me up baby right there
fuck that lil ho she a heffer

i had to dive in the deep last time i snipe who i see bodies be cheap
kodak the one with the vision i got my clique in position
they listen to me got all kinda movement
i keep shooters for my shooters in case them niggas wanna beef
got two mansions one on the beach
