stick around greenleaf now that shes gone
take my time when i got to bed and i sleep long
im getting over mulling over
i said could you just wait to tell me in the morning

bridge
slow it down slow it down
and lay it low save it for the morning

verse 2
i know that you would like like to change me
make me softer to your voice like a baby
im using caution but youre warning
i wish that you could wait to tell me in the morning

bridge
slow it down slow it down
and lay it low save it for the morning

verse 3
im shouting questions like a fist fight
you try to take me by the arms lead me to the light
im almost over warring over
i wish that you could wait to tell me in the morning
see cold war kids liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likebridge
slow it down slow it down
and lay it low save it for the morning
and ill tell you one more thing

chorus
i confess to selfdeception
and i broke the lock and i pried it open
then pretended to be stolen
i am my own thief in the night

verse 4
struggled for many years just to get here
to learn humility and be my own teacher
i guess it backfired cause my motive
was just to take another care bout what i give

bridge
slow it down slow it down
and lay it low save it for the morning

verse 5
im shouting questions like a fist fight
you try to take me by the arms lead me to the light
im almost over warring over
i wish that you could wait to tell me in the morning
bridge
slow it down slow it down
and lay it low save it for the morning
but ill tell you one more thing

chorus
i confess to selfdeception
and i broke the lock and i pried it open
then pretended to be stolen
i am my own thief in the nightembed"
