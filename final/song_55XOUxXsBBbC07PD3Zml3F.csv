stuck in a maze
oh oh oh oh oh oh
stuck in a maze mmh

chorus
stuck in a maze
everythings okay but its not really okay
my lifes a death race
im numbing my pain with codeine rain
im going insane
lifes not the same
stuck in a maze
im not going anywhere
my brain is going everywhere
im tormented every day
mom im losing my mental
the sorrows that ive been through
story to be continued

verse
i sip ill pop pills crack seals
doing anything to numb the way that i feel yeah
i chase thrills you still crashin hot wheels
ride a dirt bike down the ditch see if i live
i knock my subconscious unconscious
they tell me that they can help me i got this
watch this i took my demons into the bank of life and i made the biggest deposit
without drugs im losing my logic
these pills and my pro tools still got logic
i run i run i run
i run i run i run
