late at night i been roaming i aint getting no sleep woah
its hard to stay focused when that pain running deep
been alone my whole life but you helped me forget
then you made me remember my heart cold as december
learning to love myself i been alone every weekend
they say hes out of breath cause hes been runnin from demons
you left i needed help you were someone that i believed in
people change like the seasons im asking whats the reason
then i been thuggin dolo lay in my bed and cut off my phone
i smoke that dope alone me and others dont get along
you can peep the pain in my face but i hide it deep in these songs
i learned to keep my mouth closed cause dont nobody know whats wrong
got me addicted to love and then you left round the same time
