got your rhymes going round in my head
got your supersonic beats mixing up my keds
so dance little dj come on
what’s your name

i wanna move but it don’t feel right
cause you’ve been playing other peoples songs all night
so tell what you’re trying to say
what’s your name

chorus
hey roll over dj
you’re spinning away
all my time
hey who cares what you play
say whatever you say cause i don’t mind
hey roll over dj
if you don’t mind

verse 2
well i know that you think you’re a star
a pill poppin’ jukebox is all that you are
so tell me it ain’t that way
what’s your name

hey roll over dj
you’re spinning away
all my time
hey who cares what you play
say whatever you say ‘cause i don’t mind
hey roll over dj
if you don’t mind
