im gonna pick up the pieces
and build a lego house
if things go wrong we can knock it down
my three words have two meanings
but theres one thing on my mind
its all for you mm

prechorus
and its dark in a cold december
but ive got you to keep me warm
if youre broken ill mend ya
and ill keep you sheltered from the storm thats raging on now

chorus
im out of touch im out of love
ill pick you up when youre gettin down
and out of all these things ive done
i think i love you better now
im out of sight im out of mind
ill do it all for you in time
and out of all these things ive done
i think i love you better now
now

verse 2
im gonna paint you by numbers
and colour you in
if things go right we can frame it
and put you on a wall
and its so hard to say it
but ive been here before
now ill surrender up my heart
and swap it for yours
