it seems like money
is always on our minds these days
make more spend more
worry how the bills will get paid
oh it wasnt that long ago
but it seems so far away
when we didnt have a damn thing
but we were happy

chorus
and love was easy
just laying on a river bank
all night counting the stars
love was easy
as that feeling we found
in the back seat of my car
even in the dark
love was easy
when we didnt make it so hard

verse 2
can you tell me
the last time we really laughed
the last time we had a moment
when we hated that the moment passed
here we are down the road
standing here looking back
seeing what we used to have
is what were missing

when love was easy
just laying on a river bank
all night counting the stars

as that feeling we found
in the back seat of my car

when we didnt make it so hard

ah maybe thats how it goes

chorus
is love was easy
just laying on a river bank
all night counting the stars
love was easy
as that feeling we found
in the back seat of my car
even in the dark
love was easy
when we didnt make it so hard
