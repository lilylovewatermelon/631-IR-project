verse 3 mr short khop
i keeps a firm grip on my shit when in transit
uncandid its the young bandit
fresh out the trenches the woodworks
city of the champion where the hood work
in search of the rich blocks to lick spots and kick rocks
from shattered glass down to pick locks
want chips by the glocks
you niggas scramblin for bullion
and settle for crumbs and croutons
im out for armored bucks and armored trucks with armed killas
bitch niggas get swallowed by the armadillos
aint no harmin me the army full of ornery niggas you cant see
so while you pace bitches and saturns livin janky
i hangs with niggas who got patterns on they hankies
after ben frankeys with the big skull and eyes
you niggas bound and nullified
sit back and mine stack it multiply
