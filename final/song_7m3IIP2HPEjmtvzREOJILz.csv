were taking the long way home taking the long way home

verse 1 luke
take me back to the middle of nowhere
back to the place only you and i share
remember all the memories
the fireflies and makebelieve
kicking back in the old school yard
singing songs on our guitars
this is our reality
crazy stupid you and me

prechorus luke
we know this is the way its supposed to be

chorus all ashton luke

something like makebelieve
living in a movie scene
