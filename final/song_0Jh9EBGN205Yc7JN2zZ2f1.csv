this is a call to the colorblind
this is an iou
im stranded behind a horizon line
tied up in something true

prechorus
yes im grounded
got my wings clipped
im surrounded by all this pavement
guess ill circle
while im waiting for my fuse to dry

chorus
someday ill fly
someday ill soar
someday ill be so damn much more
cause im bigger than my body gives me credit for

verse 2
why is it not my time
what is there more to learn
shed this skin ive been tripping in
never to quite return

prechorus
yes im grounded
got my wings clipped
im surrounded by all this pavement
guess ill circle
while im waiting for my fuse to dry

someday ill fly
someday ill soar
someday ill be so damn much more
cause im bigger than my body gives me credit for
cause im bigger than my body now

bridge
maybe ill tangle in the power lines
and it might be over in a seconds time
but ill gladly go down in a flame
if a flames what it takes to remember my name
to remember my name

prechorus
yes im grounded
got my wings clipped
im surrounded by all this pavement
guess ill circle
while im waiting for my fuse to dry
for my fuse to dry
wait for my fuse to dry

chorus
someday ill fly
someday ill soar
someday ill be so damn much more
cause im bigger than my body
im bigger than my body
im bigger than my body now1embed"
