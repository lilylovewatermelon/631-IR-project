turn around
every now and then i get a little bit lonely
and youre never coming round
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit tired
of listening to the sound of my tears
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit nervous
that the best of all the years have gone by
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit terrified
and then i see the look in your eyes

refrain
turn around bright eyes
every now and then i fall apart
turn around bright eyes
every now and then i fall apart

verse 2
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit restless
and i dream of something wild
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit helpless
and im lying like a child in your arms
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit angry
and i know ive got to get out and cry
turn around
every now and then i get a little bit terrified
but then i see the look in your eyes
see bonnie tyler liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likerefrain
turn around bright eyes
every now and then i fall apart
turn around bright eyes
every now and then i fall apart

chorus
and i need you now tonight
and i need you more than ever
and if you only hold me tight
well be holding on forever
and well only be making it right
cause well never be wrong
together we can take it to the end of the line
your love is like a shadow on me all of the time all of the time
i dont know what to do and im always in the dark
were living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
i really need you tonight
forevers gonna start tonight
forevers gonna start tonight

postchorus
once upon a time i was falling in love
now im only falling apart
theres nothing i can do
a total eclipse of the heart
once upon a time there was light in my life
but now theres only love in the dark
nothing i can say
a total eclipse of the heart
instrumental interlude
turn around bright eyes
turn around bright eyes

verse 3
turn around
every now and then
i know youll never be the boy
you always wanted to be
turn around
but every now and then
i know youll always be the only boy
who wanted me the way that i am
turn around
every now and then
i know theres no one in the universe
as magical and wondrous as you
turn around
every now and then
i know theres nothing any better
theres nothing that i just wouldnt do

refrain
turn around bright eyes
every now and then i fall apart
turn around bright eyes
every now and then i fall apart
chorus
and i need you now tonight
and i need you more than ever
and if you only hold me tight
well be holding on forever
and well only be making it right
cause well never be wrong
together we can take it to the end of the line
your love is like a shadow on me all of the time all of the time
i dont know what to do
im always in the dark
living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
i really need you tonight
forevers gonna start tonight
forevers gonna start tonight

postchorus
once upon a time i was falling in love
now im only falling apart
theres nothing i can do
a total eclipse of the heart
once upon a time there was light in my life
but now theres only love in the dark
nothing i can say
a total eclipse of the heart
a total eclipse of the heart
a total eclipse of the heart
