what day is it and in what month
this clock never seemed so alive
i cant keep up and i cant back down
ive been losing so much time

chorus
cause its you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
nothing to lose
and its you and me and all other people
and i dont know why i cant keep my eyes off of you

verse 2
all of the things that i want to say just arent coming out right
im tripping on words
youve got my head spinning
i dont know where to go from here

chorus
cause its you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
nothing to prove
and its you and me and all other people
and i dont know why i cant keep my eyes off of you

bridge
theres something about you now
i cant quite figure out
everything she does is beautiful
everything she does is right

cause its you and me and all of the people with nothing to do
nothing to lose
and its you and me and all other people
and i dont know why i cant keep my eyes off of you
and me and all other people with nothing to do
nothing to prove
and its you and me and all other people
and i dont know why i cant keep my eyes off of you
