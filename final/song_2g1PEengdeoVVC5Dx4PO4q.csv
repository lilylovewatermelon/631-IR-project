youre not a chickenhead goin heeshey
youre choosy in the bed like heeshey
i know your mans in the feds but heeshey
i cant figure out the reason you keep hawkin me
is it the invisible settings on the baguettes
the benzes beamers and corvettes
or the woodgrain in the convertible lex
be ease shoppin sprees what designer is next
is it the diablo parked on rodeo
half a mill in the trunk and i aint moved no llello
could it be im antipimp hundredthousand a clip
hat low doin donuts when i pull up out the dealership
is it the the fortune 500 covers
the family man that got one baby mother
the way i brainwash yall to love one another
and got the whole community bouncin in unity

i cant figure out the reason you be hawkin me
is it the twenty million i be grabbin a flick
or my fourhundred million dollar fubu clique
