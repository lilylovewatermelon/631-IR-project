hold on to me as we go
as we roll down this unfamiliar road
and although this wave wave is stringing us along
just know youre not alone
cause im gonna make this place your home

dont pay no mind to the demons
they fill you with fear
the trouble it might drag you down
if you get lost you can always be found
