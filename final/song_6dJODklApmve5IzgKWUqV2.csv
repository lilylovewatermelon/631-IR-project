verse 1
tied to a wheel our fingers got to feel
bleeding through a tourniquet smile
i spin on a whim i slide to the right
i felt you like electric light
for our love for our fear
for our rise against the years and years and years

verse 2
deaf dumb dirty
starting to deserve this
leaning on my conscience wall
blood is like wine unconscious all the time
if i had it all again id change it all

i’ve seen the best minds of my generation
they are starving hysterical and naked…
