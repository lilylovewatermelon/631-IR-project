disclaimer we should all have hope and look towards the day where a man realizes the sounds exiting his mouth are mostly complaints that a change occurs

say it say it

verse 1
alone you support and embrace
another reason to see
success we unfold clutching firm
betting he panics for sure

chorus
say it say it that its done
i want it want it need it done
say it say it that its done
i want it want it need it done

verse 2
the lie want to know has it met
expectations so far

chorus
say it say it that its done
i want it want it need it done
say it say it that its done
i want it want it need it done

still running
never waking up to say it
still running
never waking up to say it
still running
never waking up to say it
selfishly walking through killing the angles
picking and choosing to screw all of them one by one

verse 3
so run make amends feeling torn
boy you better be sure sure
