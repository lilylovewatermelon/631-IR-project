yeah

verse 1
i know a lot of people but i dont fuck with a lot
got me standing here when i just wanna leave the spot
thinking bout a whip and man i might just cop the drop
just so they could think im friendly when im not
arm out the window like yessir yessir
right good working on my left bruh
man i got my shit together then i stepped up
i got tired of niggas telling me im next up
old label wasnt talking bout nothing
meanwhile im getting ready for a run
i aint sitting i aint talking i aint hustling with you niggas
fuck around and yall gon make me push a button on you niggas ayy
i got a baby on the way baby on the way
i think about it every day i think about it every day
they think that paper gon change me
i do this shit for my baby
i do this shit for my niggas
and we go way back just like crack in the muhfuckin 80s
this flow is crazy yeah yeah yeah
yeah nigga this flow is crazy
i dont fear no man or no object
bullfighter ive been working on my sidestep
i know preparation gets you through the process

verse 2
i would never know
worked on this shit till i was a pro
ran through these streets ran through these beats
ran through these thoughts ran through these hearts
i was in the dark till i caught a spark
feel like im on fire get too close make a nigga die
they cannot be i its too hard they could probably try
they could try im on i20 tryna get to eightyfive
my girl mad but she dont want another guy
i wonder why
wait uh no i dont
work real hard and i get what i want
this is for them days we aint eat
this is for them nights we aint sleep
going through beat after beat now
i could probably make a hundred songs in my sleep
yeahyeahyeah

chorus
i aint have nobody there so i had to tell myself when to go when to go
if i was waiting on you to tell me then i would never know i would never know
i aint have nobody there so i had to tell myself when to go when to go
if i was waiting on you to tell me then i would never know i would never know
