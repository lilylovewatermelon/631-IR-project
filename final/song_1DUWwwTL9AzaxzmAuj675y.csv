there goes another night
losing my breath in waves
knowing that ever crash is bleeding the hourglass
and taking the strife from all our lives

everyone keeps talking
they promise you everything
but they dont mean anything

we may lose our focus
theres just too many words
were never meant to learn
and we dont feel so alive

say goodbye these days are gone
and we cant keep holding on
when all we need is some relief
though these hard times
through these hard times

move your hands in circles
keeping me hypnotized
the power behind your eyes

move around your bedroom cursing the naked sky
you should be here tonight
but you stay alone and cry
see matchbox twenty liveget tickets as low as 77you might also likesay goodbye these days are gone
and we cant keep holding on
when all we need is some relief
through these hard times
whoa theres something missing
oh whoa youll never feel it but you
oh whoa youre gonna feel it when its gone
when its gone

say goodbye these days are gone
and we cant keep holding on
when all we need is some relief
through these hard times
hey these hard times
oh no now hard times
hard times

say goodbye these days are gone
say goodbye these days are gone
these days are goneembed"
