honey honey get the kids in the car now
put the cash in the trunk get the keys lets go
hit the biggest bank in chicago
for all it had were thieves you know
remember the thing that i told ya
three years two moons ago
i promise i’ll be right behind you
but you’re gonna die if you don’t hit the road

chorus
keep your lights down keep your voice down low
wear your hair down whichever way you go
and i’ll meet you in idaho

verse 2
three kids in the back of a caddy
she said come here and kiss your wife
and i know you’re real mad at me
but you’re on your way to some kind of life
daniel john and abby
promise me you’ll treat your mother nice

chorus
keep your lights down keep your voice down low
wear your hair down whichever way you go
and i’ll meet you in idaho
outro
i know you’ll miss me i’m barely fifty
aint comin with me are all the debts i owe
you don’t have to kiss me just bear with me
and ill be back someday i hope
i know you’ll miss me i’m barely fifty
aint comin with me are all the debts i owe
you don’t have to kiss me just bear with me
and ill be back someday i hope
oh i hope
oh oh oh i hope1embed"
