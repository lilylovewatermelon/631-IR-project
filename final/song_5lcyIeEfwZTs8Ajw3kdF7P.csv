verse 1
you dont know how little you matter until youre all alone
in the middle of arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
used to date a blonde you used to hit it raw
cause she was and you are madly involved madly involved

hook
hittin stones in glass homes
youre smokin stones in abandoned homes
you hit them stones and broke your home
crack rock crack rock
crack rock crack rock
hittin stones in glass homes
youre smokin stones in abandoned homes
you hit them stones and broke your home
crack rock crack rock
crack rock crack rock

verse 2
youre shuckin and jivin stealin and robbin
to get the fixing that youre itching for
your family stopped inviting you to things
wont let you hold their infant
you used to to get a little cutup from time to time
but the freaks aint trying to sleep with cracky
you might also likehook
hittin stones in glass homes
youre smokin stones in abandoned homes
you hit them stones and you broke your home
crack rock
crack rock crack rock

bridge
crooked cop dead cop
how much dope can you push to me
crooked cop dead cop
no good for community
fuckin pig get shot three hundred men will search for me
my brother get popped and dont no one hear the sound
dont no one hear the rounds sound
dont no one hear the shells shells

outro
dont no one hear a sound
dont no one disturb the peace for riot
dont no one disrupt nirvana
dont no one wanna blow the high
crack rock crack rock crack rock
how you feeling girl
hows the gutter doing
