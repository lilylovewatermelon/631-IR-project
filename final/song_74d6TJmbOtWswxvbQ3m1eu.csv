i used the deadwood to make the fire rise
the blood of innocence burning in the skies
i filled my cup with the risin of the sea
and poured it out in an ocean of debris
oh

chorus chester bennington
im swimming in the smoke of bridges i have burned
so dont apologize im losing what i dont deserve what i dont deserve

verse 2 mike shinoda
we held our breath when the clouds began to form
but you were lost in the beating of the storm
and in the end we were made to be apart
like separate chambers of the human heart
no

chorus chester bennington
im swimming in the smoke of bridges i have burned
so dont apologize im losing what i dont deserve
its in the blackened bones of bridges i have burned
so dont apologize im losing what i dont deserve what i dont deserve

chorus chester bennington
im swimming in the smoke of bridges i have burned
so dont apologize im losing what i dont deserve
the blame is mine alone for bridges i have burned
so dont apologize im losing what i dont deserve what i dont deserve
what i dont deserve ohwoah what i dont deserve

outro mike shinoda
i use the deadwood to make the fire rise
the blood of innocence burning in the skies14embed"
