its been such a long time
since i set foot in the club
i really hate this shit don’t i
i hate feeling rushed girl can i just be honest
i dont feel like talkin unless it’s bout me or philosophy
can we just get down to business
and when were both finished then well have a reason to speak

chorus
then you can open up to me girl
let me plant my seed girl
let me fill your needs girl
open up to me open up to me

verse 2
the piano that i fuck you on
same one that on which i write these songs for you
theyre one in the same
that goes for us too i give you my name
the bed on which i lay to sleep
and lay with you and lay in deep
there aint no difference this case there isnt
that goes for us too i know youre listenin’
sometimes it feels like i don’t really care
one day youll see but in the meantime
just trust that i’m there
just trust that i love you
just trust that i care
trust that i need you to always be there
trust that you know me well enough to know
im the high priest but you put on the show

then you can open up to me girl
let me plant my seed girl
let me fill your needs girl
open up to me open up to—
