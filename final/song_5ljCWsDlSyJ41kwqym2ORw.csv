verse 1 jayz jayz  beyonce
look for me
young b cruisin down the westside highway
doin what we like to do our way
eyes behind shades
this necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
but today i got my thoroughest girl with me
im mashin the gas shes grabbin the wheel its trippy
how hard she rides with me the new bobby and whitney
only time we dont speak is durin sex and the city
she gets carrie fever but soon as the shows over
shes right back to being my soldier
cause mamis a rider and im a roller
put us together how they gon stop both us
whatever she lacks im right over her shoulder woo
when im off track mami is keepin me focused
so lets lock this down like its supposed to be
