stone  glass everything balancing
every saint has a sin
wont it last resident present
i dont even want to ask

chorus
all the light is low
where the time will go
all i know is that i can see anything
out in the twilight

verse 2
all is past everything interesting
is it new is it me
stone  glass give me a reason it
ought to be easy to last

chorus
all the light is low
where the time will go
all i know is that i can see anything
out in the twilight

bridge
and in between eternally
an even fall is all that will appear to be
our storys old and either end untold
the inbetween goes on

collect yourself and move into the street
out in the twilight
the rest of our entire life is free
out in the twilight
collect yourself and move into the street
out in the twilight
the rest of our entire life is free
out in the twilight1embed"
