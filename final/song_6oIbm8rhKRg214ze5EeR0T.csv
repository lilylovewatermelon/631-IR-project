baby when were touching in the dark can you feel it
i can hear the pounding of my heart can you feel it
when you take my body to the stars i believe it
boy this love is supernatural can you feel it

verse 1
come take me by the hand
wanna cross the line
baby go ahead
til the morning light watch my silhouette
cause you know tonight were gonna wake the dead

prechorus
get a little bit wrong get a little bit wild
get a little bit high off of this love tonight
get a little bit raw come a little undone
get a little bit reckless i cant get enough

chorus
baby when were touching in the dark can you feel it
i can hear the pounding of my heart can you feel it
when you take my body to the stars i believe it
