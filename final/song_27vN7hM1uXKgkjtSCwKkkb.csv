travelled so far on my own
i dont know where ive gone
and i dont wanna be alone
when i am so far from my home

chorus
you wanna feel something
but i dont feel nothing
trying so hard to get over you

verse 2
wanna go back to the place where we started
at the party i see you but you keep your guard up
we could be something special if you wanted
im afraid that if we tried to you would just give up
you would just give up

chorus
you wanna feel something
but i dont feel nothing
trying so hard to get over you
you wanna feel something
but i dont feel nothing
trying so hard to get over you

do you wanna go away with me
do you wanna go away with me
do you wanna go away with me
do you wanna go away with me

chorus
you wanna feel something
but i dont feel nothing
trying so hard to get over you
you wanna feel something
but i dont feel nothing
trying so hard to get over you6embed"
