did you realize
that you were a champion in their eyes

chorus kanye west
yes i did
so i packed it up and brought it back to the crib
just a lil something show ya how we live
everybody want it but it aint that serious
mhm thats that shit
so if you gon do it do it just like this

refrain
did you realize
that you were a champion in their eyes

verse 1 kanye west
you dont see just how wild the crowd is
you dont see just how fly my style is
i dont see why i need a stylist
when i shop so much i can speak italian
i dont know i just want it better for my kids
and i aint sayin we was from the projects
but every time i wanted layaway or a deposit
my dadd say when you see clothes close your eyelids
we was sort of like will smith and his son
in the movie i aint talkin bout the rich ones
cause every summer hed get some
brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from
and i dont know what he did for dough
but hed send me back to school wit a new wardrobe but ayy
see kanye west liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likerefrain kanye west
did you realize
ayy ayy ayy
that you were a champion in their eyes

chorus kanye west
i think he did
when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
just a lil somethin show ya how we live
everything i wanted man it seem so serious
mhm thats that shit
so if you gon do it do it just like this

refrain
did you realize
that you were a champion in their eyes

verse 2 kanye west
when it feel like livings harder than dyin
for me givin ups way harder than tryin
lauryn hill said her heart was in zion
i wish her heart still was in rhymin
cause who the kids gon listen to huh
i guess me if it isnt you
last week i paid a visit to the institute
they got the dropout keepin kids in the school
i guess ill cleaned up my act like princell do
if not for the pleasure least for the principle
they got the cd they got to see me
drop gems like i dropped out of pe
they used to feel invisible
now they know they invincible
refrain kanye west
did you realize
ayy ayy ayy
that you were a champion in their eyes
bridge connie mitchell
this is the story of a champion
runners on their mark and they pop their guns
stand up stand up here he comes
tell me what it takes to be number one
tell me what it takes to be number one
this is the story of a champion
runners on their mark and they pop their guns
stand up stand up here he comes
tell me what it takes to be number one
tell me what it takes to be number one

refrain
did you realize
that you were a champion in their eyes
