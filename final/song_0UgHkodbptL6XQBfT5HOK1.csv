every now and then i get a little lost
my strings all get tangled my wires all get crossed
every now and then im right up on the edge
dangling my toes out over the ledge
i just thank god youre here

chorus
cause when im a bullet shot out of a gun
cause when im a firecracker coming undone
or when im a fugitive ready to run all wildeyed and crazy
no matter where my reckless soul takes me
baby you save me

verse 2
its hard loving a man thats got a gypsy soul
i dont know how you do it im not sure how you know
the perfect thing to say to save me from myself
youre the angel that believes in me like nobody else
and i thank god you do

chorus
cause when im a bullet shot out of a gun
when im a firecracker coming undone
when im a fugitive ready to run all wildeyed and crazy
no matter where my reckless soul takes me
baby you save me
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeverse 3
i know i dont tell you nearly enough
that i couldnt live one day without your love
when im a ship tossed around on the waves
up on a high wire thats ready to break
when ive had just about all i can take
baby you baby you save me

chorus
when im a bullet shot out of a gun
when im a firecracker coming undone
when im a fugitive ready to run all wildeyed and crazy
no matter where my reckless soul takes me
baby you save me1embed"
