ive been trying for days
to think of a way
to find the words to make sense
of how we behave
this might take a while
so please just hear me out
we know how things can get crazy
when we go ablaze
we just get carried away

prechorus
believe me i know
dont even say a word
now please just hear me out

chorus
see my side
and ill see yours better
love me back
and ill love you better

verse 2
sometimes the stunts that we pull
dont even make sense
but i was never the one to feel that resent
this aint bout whos to blame
so please just hear me out
when the scene gets intense
its hard to prevent
from going all crazy again

well get right back
on the right track
well get right back on
well get right back on
on the right track

and ill see yours better

and ill love you better

and ill see yours better
love me back
