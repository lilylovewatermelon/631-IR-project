i just want the best for you

verse 1
yeah another night out
i get drunk i get high
then you call and i lie
and say im on my way now
yeah i say im on my way now
show up when its light out
when youre dressing for work
and im mumbling words
i dont know what to say now
no i dont know what to say now

prechorus
you tell me i dont care tell me i never try
i said im sorry maybe a million times
its gonna hurt ya if i dont say goodbye
you dont believe me you dont believe me

chorus
i just want the best for you
i just want the best for you
but im just not the best for you
you dont want what im gonna put ya through
i just want the best for you
i just want the best for you
but im just not the best for you
you dont want what im gonna put ya through

verse 2
parties with shots and powder
but youd rather sleep eight hours
and i know you got your doubts
cause i cant turn this life around baby
thought it was just a phase
til i woke up a thousand days later
realizing im the same as i was before i saw your face

i said im sorry maybe a million times
its gonna hurt ya if i dont say goodbye
you dont believe me you dont believe me
