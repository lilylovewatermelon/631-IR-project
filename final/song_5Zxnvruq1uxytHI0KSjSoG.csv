the smoke and the whiskey aint gonna miss me when im gone
i thought that they were needing me but really they were leading me on
it gets old waking up with your head in a vice feeling empty as a bottle of jack
but i finally found something worth lovin thats lovin me back

chorus with lee ann womack
you get me high you get me stoned
its a ride i aint never been on
its a binge its a buzz
its a drunk i cant find in no glass
yeah i finally found something worth lovin thats lovin me back

verse 2
bright lights and guitars and dive bars playing for tips
and pouring your heart out to strangers is a strange kind of fix
but filling a dance floor is something i live for but ill give more than ill ever get back
but i finally found something worth lovin thats lovin me back

chorus with lee ann womack
you get me high you get me stoned its a ride i aint never been on
its a binge its a buzz its a drunk i cant find in no glass
yeah i finally found something worth lovin thats lovin me back

the smoke and the whiskey aint gonna miss me when im gone

you get me high you get me stoned its a ride i aint never been on
its a binge its a buzz its a drunk i cant find in no glass
