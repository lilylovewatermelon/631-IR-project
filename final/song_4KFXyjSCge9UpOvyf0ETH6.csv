she mistakes my name
i see the light come around
strange as it seems
im bursting at the seams
and oh ive got a woman now

verse 2
her wallet photos dont turn me on
i feel her hand come around
and her stonewash denim jeans are darker than they seem
and oh ive got a woman now

bridge
she said my name is eileen boy thats all you need
oh and this ones on the house i dont mind

verse 3
it all tastes the same
and boy theres something different about your mouth
and you try chasing dreams man its harder than it seems
and oh ive got a woman now
