conquest
he was out to make a conquest
didnt care what harm was done
just as long as he won the prize
conquest
she was just another conquest
didnt care whose heart was broke
love to him was a joke
til he looked into her eyes

refrain
and then in the strange way things happen
their roles were reversed from that day
the hunted became the huntress
the hunter became the prey

verse 2
conquest
now you know who made the conquest
she with all her female guile
led him helpless down the aisle
she had finally made a conquest

refrain
and then in the strange way things happen
their roles were reversed from that day
the hunted became the huntress
the hunter became the prey
