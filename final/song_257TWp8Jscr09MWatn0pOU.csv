if you are a man like me who is good at leaving
if you like your space and you love your freedom
do not see yourself as ever settling down
or your whole world being tossed around

prechorus
be wary of a woman a woman so fine
do not want to change you loves you just right
makes you feel like a man inside
sometimes she will make you cry

chorus
till you do not know what you are doing
you are out of control forget about leaving your heart would not go
if you do not like that you better run and hide
and be wary of a woman like mine

verse 2
she will make you laugh when you feel like crying
make you want to live when you feel like dying
so if you like living in the dark
just walk away you are going to lose your heart

prechorus
