those days when i would sit around with you
theres nothing like it
and even when my heart was black and blue
theres nothing like it
and everything before and after you
it doesnt cut it

prechorus
so do you remember the old times
those were the only times the only times

chorus
i dont know how it ended
i dont know where you ran to
ill always be right here
i dont know how it ended
i dont know where you ran to
ill always be right here

verse 1
you never have to say that you were wrong
i know id do it all again
even if it was wrong
and i could write a thousand more songs about you
before this ones done
the next ones begun
you might also likeprechorus
so do you remember the old times
those were the only times the only times

chorus
i dont know how it ended
i dont know where you ran to
ill always be right here
i dont know how it ended
i dont know where you ran to
ill always be right here

verse 2
and how will this end
and when will my life begin
again again again again

prechorus
so do you remember the old times
those were the only times the only times

chorus
i dont know how it ended
i dont know where you ran to
ill always be right here
i dont know how it ended
i dont know where you ran to
ill always be right here4embed"
