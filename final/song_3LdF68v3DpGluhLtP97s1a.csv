got your voicemail
can you call me at a hotel
theres something thats weighing heavy on my heart
and heavy on my chest
im the lone night youre the morning
i annoy you and you bore me
and its hard enough to make it through a world thats already a mess

prechorus
all in good time well be just fine
either way we need to be happy

chorus
tell me is this thing on
how do we keep this new
how do i keep you into me into me
without faking it too
what do we have to try
when everything is to lose
cause it always is just me and you
but its the hardest thing the hardest thing to do

verse 2
and i want you to want me
like the first time you saw me
i know were ten years on
but in my head were still young and dumb
itd be so hard to let go and replace you
i still love you
i just wanna find the thing that made me think
this was the one
