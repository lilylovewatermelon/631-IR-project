hey instagram
this song ive been writing oh for a few months
i dont know i i started writing it about family
just came up now so
anybody feel any way about it i dont give a fuck
yeah family

verse 1 drake
yeah
yeah
lost you to the game i gotta hug that
i was here when you was asking where the love at
dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
i was wishin on a star when i was that
ive been fortunate enough to have it my way
im a fortune teller listen to what i say
member when we used to park up in my driveway
i always told it how it was i never shy away
this life is really something you get lost in
i know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
i had friends that only had half of they heart in
its hard to accept now and it was hard then
but i treated you like gold i was all in
spoiled rotten they could smell you fore you walked in
burnin incense in your new apartment
but you got no sense when it come to
lost you to the game i gotta hold that
how you feelin in your soul since you sold that
ill be better off without you and we know that
you aint lookin at a nigga you could hold back
like im tryna show the waves this is no cap
you sold me up the river but i rowed back
you put me on the road without a roadmap
im not tryna make no song these are cold facts

verse 2 drake
ayy
being here wasnt in the plans
i do it for the grahams not the gram
i do it for the fam but still fuckin uncle sam
i tried to change for you but that wasnt who i am
even when being real is out of fashion
niggas keep stealin my style now we out here matchin
i did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
i couldnt sit around and wait i had to have it happen
lost you to the game i gotta face that
really think i lost you like a ways back
always sayin how a nigga never play fair
i took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
you was supposed to grow some wings get your own pair
we started this from the bottom now you alone there
shit you treat it like its home there
dependent on me you was supposed to get your own share
i still love you to my last days
i never knew that shit would be this fastpaced
i never thought id see awards in a glass case
i couldve ended up in your crib with a masked face
it couldve went left on a couple bad days
when i visit my last place is the only time im in last place
see me these days i never got on a sad face
see me these days i
lost you to the game and i see why
it was always you and i without the ty
this is not one of them stories that got three sides
this is not one of them stories you could rewind
like im tryna show the waves this is no cap
you drove a nigga crazy but i drove back
you wrote me off and then you never wrote back
im not tryna make no song these are cold facts
outro drake  dennis graham
yes sir
baby
hold on hold on
let me tell you something about me
i really do know i know who i wanna be
woo
lord i already passed on all that woo
you go head on haha16embed"
