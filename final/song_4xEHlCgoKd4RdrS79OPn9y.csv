there is a roadway muddy and foxgloved
whenever id have life enough my heart is screamin of
and in a few days i will be there love
whatever here thats left of me is yours just as it was

chorus
just as it was baby
before the otherness came
and i knew its name
the drug the dark the light the flame

postchorus
the highs hit the heights of my baby
and its hold had the fight of my baby
and the lights were as bright as my baby
but your love was unmoved

verse 2
tell me if somehow some of it remains
how long you would wait for me and how long ive been away
the shape that im in now your shape in the doorway
make your good love known to me or just tell me bout your day

chorus
just as it was baby
before the otherness came
and i knew its name
the drug the dark the light the shame
see hozier liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likepostchorus
the highs hit the heights of my baby
and its hold had the fight of my baby
and the lights were as bright as my baby
but your love was unmoved
and the sights were as stark as my baby
and the cold cut as sharp as my baby
and the nights were as dark as my baby
and half as beautiful too11embed"
