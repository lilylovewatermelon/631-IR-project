she would not show that she was afraid
but being and feeling alone was too much to face
though everyone said that she was so strong
what they didnt know is that she could barely carry on

prechorus
but she knew that she would be okay
so she didnt let it get in her way

chorus
sometimes it all gets a little too much
but you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
and you dont have to be afraid because were all the same
and we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much

verse 2
she would always tell herself she could do this
she would use no help it would be just fine
but when it got hard she would lose her focus
so take my hand it will be alright

prechorus
and she knew that she would be okay
so she didnt let it get in her way
