your skin attached
this fragile cliché of my broken heart attack
you should swallow your teeth and hang out and stay for a while
if your hearts still beating it must be the blood
if your lungs are still working it must be the mud
if it’s still light out than a kick in the ribs todays worth living

chorus
i dont see anything now
so just say what you want to say
its kind of funny how im not listening anyway

verse 2
lights out i cant stand to hear you scream
while we were making love i was fast asleep
and the night sky better give something up
give something up

chorus
i dont see anything now
so just say what you want to say
its kind of funny how im not listening anyway
i dont see anything now
so just say what you want to say
its kind of funny how im not listening anyway

lights out lights out lights out lights out
lights out i can’t stand to hear you scream
while we were making love i was fast asleep
if your hearts still beating it must be the blood
if your lungs are still working it must be the mud
if it’s still light out than a kick in the ribs
if todays worth living it probably is

chorus
i dont see anything now
so just say what you want to say
its kind of funny how im not listening anyway
i dont see anything now
so just say what you want to say
its kind of funny how im not listening anyway

refrain
im not listening anyway
im not listening anyway
im not listening anyway

breakdown

im not listening
im not listening
im not listening
