the icy sky at night
paddles cut the water
in a long and hurried flight
from the white man
to the fields of green
and the homeland
weve never seen

they killed us in our tepee
they cut our women down
they might have left some babies
cryin on the ground
but the firesticks
and the wagons come
and the night falls
on the setting sun

they massacred the buffalo
kitty corner from the bank
the taxis run across my feet
and my eyes have turned to blanks
in my little box
at the top of the stairs
with my indian rug
and a pipe to share
you might also likei wish i was a trapper
i would give a thousand pelts
to sleep with pocahontas
and find out how she felt
in the mornin
on the fields of green
in the homeland
weve never seen

and maybe marlon brando
will be there by the fire
well sit and talk about hollywood
and the good things there for hire
like the astrodome
and the first tepee
marlon brando pocahontas and me
marlon brando pocahontas and me
