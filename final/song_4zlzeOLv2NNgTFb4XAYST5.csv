old school mcgraw coming out of my doors
had to pull over couldnt take it no more
got this thing running in park hazards lighting up the dark
i was just out driving around
wasnt scanning for a memory to slow me down
but damn if yours didnt baby
ida paid that dj not to play it

chorus 1
cause im sitting here knowing what its gonna take to fix me
it aint a bar it aint the beer it aint the whiskey
id give anything to hear you say you miss me tonight
yeah anybody else with any kind of sense
woulda done moved on said it is what it is
but im off on the shoulder in a mess all wrecked inside
baby im broke down and it aint the truck this time

verse 2
people slowing down wanna see whats wrong
i got my hand out the window just waving em on
cause i dont wanna have to explain
dont want no one to see me this way
dont need no gas dont need no ride
everything on this chevy is running just right
i just need another minute or two
til this songs over like me and you
