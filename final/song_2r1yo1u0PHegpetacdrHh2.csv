hold on slow down again from the top now and tell me everything
i know ive been gone for what seems like forever
but im here now waiting
to convince you that im not a ghost or a stranger
but closer than you think
she said just go on
to what you pretend is your life
but please dont die on me

prechorus
wings wont take me
heights dont faze me
so take a step
but dont look down
take a step

chorus
now im standing on the rooftop ready to fall
i think im at the edge now but i could be wrong
im standing on the rooftop ready to fall

verse 2
perpetual motion the image wont focus
a blur is all thats seen
but here in this moment like the eye of a storm
it all came clear to me
i found a shoulder to lean on
an infallible reason to live all by itself
i took one last look from the heights that i once loved
and then i ran like hell

wings wont take me
heights dont faze me
so take a step
but dont look down
take a step

chorus
now im standing on the rooftop ready to fall
i think im at the edge now but i could be wrong
im standing on the rooftop ready to fall

bridge
i count the times that ive been sorry
i know i know
now my compassion slowly drowns
i know i know
if theres a time these walls could guard you
i know i know
then let that time be right now

now im standing on the rooftop
now im standing on the rooftop ready to fall
