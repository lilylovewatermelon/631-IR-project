im not calling you a liar just dont lie to me
im not calling you a thief just dont steal from me
im not calling you a ghost just stop haunting me
and i love you so much im going to let you kill me

chorus 1
theres a ghost in my lungs and it sighs in my sleep
wraps itself around my chest as it softly weeps
and it walks and it walks with my legs
to fall to fall to fall at your feet

chorus 2
there but for the grace of god go i
and when you kiss me i am happy enough to die
