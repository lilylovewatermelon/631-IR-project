i want you to die
i want you to die
why wont you just die
see eyedress liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likehes a pussy boy sending threats
in the shadows i sliced his neck
dumped his body in thе water
with the fishes i thrеw the blade
i didnt run i walked away
when the cops came i said hey
the bad guys went the other way

i want you to die
i just want you to die
you can run but you cant hide
hahahaha
i want you to die
i just want you to die
i just want you to die
i just want you to dieembed"
