ohohoh ohohoh ohohoh

verse 1
i cant get it back but i dont want it back
i realized that she dont know how to act
never been a dumb dude no im not dense
i just had a slight lack of common sense
i was the good guy she was the bad girl
im thinking one girl
she thinking me earl james and jimmy
yep she had plenty
but love for me she didnt have any

prechorus
i was inviting her into my heart
but she was out riding in some other mans car
she was my night time thought i was her star
guess i was wrong but see im strong
wont take long for me to move on

chorus
please dont worry bout me im fine
please dont worry bout me im fine
only gonna play the fool one time
only gonna play the fool one time
trust me when i say that ill be okay
go on girl go on girl
go on girl go on girl
go on girl

i cant get it back but i dont want it back
i realized that she dont know how to act

im in the house thinking shes with her girlfriends
just not knowing truly not knowing
i look back now like man i was open

prechorus
i was inviting her into my heart
but she was out riding in some other mans car

guess i was wrong but see im strong
wont take long for me to move on
