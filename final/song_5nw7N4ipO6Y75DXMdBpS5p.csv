girl ive been at work all week
fingers to the bone i need
a little hit of you and me
a little time alone
all day ive been thinking about
quitting early skipping out
holing ass to hit the couch
and hang with you at home

chorus 1
we got some laid back country tunes on the radio
we going to burn all afternoon like its something to smoke
we got to whole lot of nothing to do and nowhere to go
so baby i dont know about you but im ready to roll

verse 2
let other fools go paint the town
well just hold this sofa down
till monday morning rolls around
ill tell you what lets do
you go grab those tater chips
ill whip up some party dip
and well kick back and take a trip
sip a beer or two
