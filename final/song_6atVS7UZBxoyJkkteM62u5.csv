i worry
i weigh three times my body
i worry
i throw my fear around
but this morning
theres a calm i cant explain
the rock candys melted only diamonds now remain
oooooo
oooooo

verse 2
by the time i recognize this moment
this moment will be gone
but i will bend the light pretending that it somehow lingered on
when all i gots
oooooo oooooo
oooooo oooooo

chorus
and i will wait to find
if this will last forever
and i will wait to find
if this will last forever
and i will pay no mind
when it wont and it wont because it cant
it just cant
its not supposed to
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likeverse 3
was there a second of time that i looked around
did i sail through or drop my anchor down
was anything enough to kiss the ground
and say im here now
and she is here now
oooooo oooooo
oooooo oooooo

bridge
so much wasted in the afternoon
so much sacred in the month of june
how bout you oh

chorus
and i will wait to find
if this will last forever yeah
and i will wait to find
that it wont and it wont
and it wont
and i will pay no mind
worried bout no rainy weather
and i will waste no time
remaining in our lives together5embed"
