my only one
my smoking gun
my eclipsed sun
this has broken me down
my twisted knife
my sleepless night
my winless fight
this has frozen my ground

chorus
stood on the cliffside screaming give me a reason
your faithless loves the only hoax i believe in
dont want no other shade of blue but you
no other sadness in the world would do

verse 2
my best laid plan
your sleight of hand
my barren land
i am ash from your fire

chorus
stood on the cliffside screaming give me a reason
your faithless loves the only hoax i believe in
dont want no other shade of blue but you
no other sadness in the world would do

you know i left a part of me back in new york
you knew the hero died so whats the movie for
you knew it still hurts underneath my scars
from when they pulled me apart
you knew the password so i let you in the door
you knew you won so whats the point of keeping score
you knew it still hurts underneath my scars
from when they pulled me apart
but what you did was just as dark
ah ah ah
darling this was just as hard
as when they pulled me apart

outro
my only one
my kingdom come undone
my broken drum
you have beaten my heart
dont want no other shade of blue but you
no other sadness in the world would do57embed"
