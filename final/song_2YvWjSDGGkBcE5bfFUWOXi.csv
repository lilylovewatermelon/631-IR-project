i shouldnt have walked away
i wouldve stayed if you said
we couldve made everything ok
but we just
threw the blame back and forth
we treated love like a sport
the final blow hit so low
im still on the ground

prechorus 1
i couldnt have prepared myself for this fall
shattered in pieces curled on the floor
super natural love conquers all
member we used to touch the sky
and

chorus
lightning dont strike
the same place twice
when you and i said goodbye
i felt the angels cry
true loves a gift
but we let it drift
in a storm
every night
i feel the angels cry

cmon babe cant our love be revived
bring it back and we gon make it right
im on the edge just tryin to survive
as the angels cry

verse 2
limitless omnipresent
kind of love couldnt have guessed
it would just up and disappear in
the whirlwind
here i am walkin on this narrow rope
wobbling but wont let go
waitin for a glimpse of the suns glow

prechorus 2
i know i can stand just pull me back up
like there aint no hurricane
its just us
im willing to live and die for our love
baby we can get back that shine

chorus
cause
lightning dont strike
the same place twice
when you and i said goodbye
i felt the angels cry
true loves a gift
but we let it drift
in a storm
every night
i feel the angels cry
postchorus
come on baby can our love be revived
bring it back and were gon make it right
im on the edge just trying to survive
as the angels cry

bridge
baby im missin
you dont allow love to lose
we gotta ride it through
im reaching for you

bridge
baby im missin
you dont allow love to lose
we gotta ride it through
im reaching for you

chorus
lighting dont strike
the same place twice
when you and i said goodbye
i felt the angels cry
true loves a gift
but we let it slip
in a storm
every night
