yeah
only way to fly is to jump

verse 1
mama preachin and they speakin to us common sense
look around neighborhood like the apoocalypse
wanna reach the top no money for that rocket ship
and he dont think hell get no scholarship
so he drop out people tellin him its just a cop out
american dream picture perfect he been cropped out
bills at the house past due what else to do
they dont know what he been through
how they gon tell him how to move
born to loselose no avenues left to chose
bruised and abused persecuted and accused
money he pursued poverty he refused
walkin outta school with a fucking attitude

chorus
some day youll look around and regret what youve become
never spread your wings to leave that place that you were from
stars die in the sky trying to get close to the sun
fly high young one it could end before its begun

verse 2
hes writin songs about the pain he feel inside
but aint no rapper ever made it from the west side
his is a silly dream reality is brutal
lost three homies in three weeks from gang shootins
try to get out its just useless
they say his only option is a factory or prison institution
he wanna fly but he afraid to jump
plus he cant afford it his old lady got that baby bump
time to grind gotta let go of his wants provide for their needs
time to be a man grow some roots plant a seed
get a 95 hustle on the side
let go of all the foolishness and kiss the dream goodbye
see struggle jennings liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likechorus
some day youll look around and regret what youve become
never spread your wings to leave that place that you were from
stars die in the sky trying to get close to the sun
fly high young one it could end before its begun

verse 3
seven kids a couple prison years later
i decided to quit listening to haters
took from the hood everything that made us
god wont forsake us and the feds couldnt break us
promised greater for my babys fate than hard labor
now im living in the mansion saving for some acres
same people said i couldnt askin if i can
give a helping hand loan a couple grand
never fake it for a second cause we been through real shit
the moral of the story what you want you can get
gotta jump you wanna fly you wont get another life
twinkle twinkle little star go and live your lullaby

chorus
stars die in the sky trying to get close to the sun
fly high young one it could end before its begun
stars die in the sky trying to get close to the sunembed"
