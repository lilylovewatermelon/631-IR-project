Let It Snow! - Remastered 2006,Bing Crosby,3My4DXwRjAS5HXontsJx1A,"7 contributorsthird presidential debate lyricschris wallace good evening from the thomas and mack center at the university of nevada las vegas im chris wallace of fox news and i welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between secretary of state hillary clinton and donald j trump this debate is sponsored by the commission on presidential debates the commission has designed the format six roughly 15minute segments with two minute answers to the first question then open discussion for the rest of each segment both campaigns have agreed to those rules for the record i decided the topics and the questions in each topic none of those questions has been shared with a commission or the two candidates the audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent no cheers boos or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say no noise except right now as we welcome the democratic nominee for president secretary clinton and the republican nominee for president mr trump

wallace secretary clinton mr trump welcome lets get right to it the first topic is the supreme court you both talked briefly about the court in the last debate but i want to drill down on this because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments which means that you will in effect determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century first of all where do you want to see the court take the country and secondly what’s your view on how the constitution should be interpreted do the founders words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances in this segment secretary clinton you go first you have two minutes

clinton thank you very much chris and thanks to unlv for hosting us you know i think when we talk about the supreme court it really raises the central issue in this election namely what kind of country are we going to be what kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens what kind of rights will americans have and i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system i have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the supreme court but i feel that at this point in our countrys history it is important that we not reverse marriage equality that we not reverse roe v wade that we stand up against citizens united we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace that we stand up and basically say the supreme court should represent all of us thats how i see the court and the kind of people that i would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful standing up on behalf of our rights as americans and i look forward to having that opportunity i would hope that the senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that president obama has sent to them thats the way the constitution fundamentally should operate the president nominates and the senate advises and consents or not but they go forward with the process

wallace secretary clinton thank you mr trump same question where do you want to see the court take the country and how do you believe the constitution should be interpreted

trump well first of all it’s so great to be with you and thank you everybody the supreme court it is what it is all about our country is so so it is just so imperative that we have the right justices something happened recently where justice ginsburg made some very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people many many millions of people that i represent and she was forced to apologize and apologize she did but these were statements that should never ever have been made we need a supreme court that in my opinion is going to uphold the second amendment and all amendments but the second amendment which is under absolute siege i believe if my opponent should win this race which i truly dont think will happen we will have a second amendment which will be a very very small replica of what it is right now but i feel that it is absolutely important that we uphold because of the fact that it is under such trauma i feel that the justices that i am going to appoint and ive named 20 of them the justices that i am going to appoint will be prolife they will have a conservative bent they will be protecting the second amendment they are great scholars in all cases and theyre people of tremendous respect they will interpret the constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted and i believe that’s very important i dont think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear it is all about the constitution of and it is so important the constitution the way it was meant to be and those are the people that i will appoint

wallace mr trump thank you we now have about ten minutes for an open discussion i want to focus on two issues that in fact by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land first is one that you mentioned mr trump and that is guns secretary clinton you said last year and let me quote “the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment” and now in fact in the 2008 heller case the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms but a right that is reasonably limited those were the words of the judge antonin scalia who wrote the decision whats wrong with that

clinton well first of all i support the second amendment i lived in arkansas for 18 wonderful years i represented upstate new york i understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership that goes back to the founding of our country but i also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation because i support the second amendment doesnt mean that i want people who shouldnt have guns to be able to threaten you kill you or members of your family and so when i think about what we need to do we have 33000 people a year who die from guns i think we need comprehensive background checks need to close the online loophole close the gun show loophole there’s other matters that i think are sensible that are the kinds of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the second amendment you mentioned the heller decision and what i was saying that you referenced chris was that i disagreed with the way the court applied the second amendment in that case because what the district of columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them and the court did not accept that reasonable regulation but theyve accepted many others so i see no conflict between saving peoples lives and defending the second amendment

wallace let me bring mr trump in here the bipartisan debate coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here and this was in fact one of the top questions that they got how will you ensure the second amendment is protected you just heard secretary clintons answer does she persuade you that while you may disagree on regulation that in fact she in fact she supports the second amendment right to bear arms

trump well the dc versus heller decision was very strongly and she was extremely angry about it i watched i mean she was very very angry when upheld and justice scalia was so involved and it was a well crafted decision but hillary was extremely upset extremely angry and people that believe in the second amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say

wallace let me bring in secretary clinton were you extremely upset

clinton well i was upset because unfortunately dozens of toddlers injure themselves even kill people with guns because unfortunately not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions but there is no doubt that i respect the second amendment that i also believe there is an individual right to bear arms that is not in conflict with sensible common sense regulation and you know look i understand that donald has been strongly supported by the nra the gun lobby is on his side theyre running millions of dollars of ads against me and i regret that because what i would like to see is for people to come together and say of course were going to protect and defend the second amendment but were going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33000 lives that we lose every year

wallace let me bring mr trump back into this because in fact you oppose any limits on assault weapons any limits on high capacity magazines you support a national righttocarry law why sir

trump well let me just tell you before we go any further in chicago which has the toughest gun laws in the united states probably you could say by far they have more gun violence than any other city so we have the toughest laws and you have tremendous gun violence i am a very strong supporter of the second amendment and i dont know if hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner but im very proud to have the endorsement of the nra and it was the earliest endorsement theyve ever given to anybody who ran for president so im very honored by all of that we are going to appoint justices this is the best way to help the second amendment we are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the second amendment that will not do damage to the second amendment
wallace well lets pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there thats the issue of abortion mr trump youre prolife and i want to ask you specifically do you want the court including the justices that you will name to overturn roe v wade which includes in fact states a womans right to abortion

trump well if that would happen because i am prolife and i will be appointing prolife judges i would think that would go back to the individual states

wallace im asking you specifically would you

trump if they overturned it it would go back to the states

wallace but what im asking you do you want to see the court overturn it you just said you want to see the court protect the second amendment do you want to see the court overturn

trump if we put another two or perhaps three justices on that is really what will happen that will happen automatically in my opinion because i am putting prolife justices on the court i will say this it will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination

clinton well i strongly support roe v wade which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate most difficult in many cases decisions about her health care that one can imagine and in this case it is not only about roe v wade it is about what is happening right now in america so many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding planned parenthood which of course provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country donald has said he is in favor of defunding planned parenthood he even supported shutting the government down to defund planned parenthood i will defend planned parenthood i will defend roe v wade and i will defend womens rights to make their own healthcare decisions we have come too far to have that turn back now and indeed he said women should be punished there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions and i could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking

wallace im going to give you a chance to respond but i wanted to ask you secretary clinton i want to explore how far you think the right to abortion goes you have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights you also voted against a ban on late term partial birth abortions why
clinton because roe v wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account and when i voted as a senator i did not think that that was the case the kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking painful decisions for families to make i have met with women who have toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy i do not think the united states government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions so you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account

wallace mr trump your reaction particularly on this issue of late term partial birth abortions

trump well i think it is terrible if you go with what hillary is saying in the ninth month you can take baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby now you can say that that is okay and hillary can say that that is okay but its not okay with me because based on what she is saying and based on where shes going and where shes been you can take baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day and thats not acceptable

clinton well that is not what happens in these cases and using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate you should meet with some of the women ive met with women ive known over the course of my life this is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make and i do not believe the government should be making it you know ive had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country ive been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions like they used to do in china or forced women to bear children like they used to do in romania and i can tell you the government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith with medical advice and i will stand up for that right

trump and honestly nobody has business doing what i just said doing that as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth nobody has that

wallace all right lets move on to the subject of immigration and there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration actually there are many issues that separate the two of you mr trump you want to build a wall secretary clinton you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border mr trump you are calling for major deportations secretary clinton you say that within your first 100 days as president you’re going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship the question really is why are you right and your opponent wrong mr trump you go first in this segment you have two minutes
trump well first of all she wants to give amnesty which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people waiting in line for many many years we need strong borders in the audience we have four mothers of  i mean these are unbelievable people that ive gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally you have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country
theyre coming in illegally drugs are pouring in through the border we have no country if we have no border hillary wants to give amnesty she wants to have open borders as you know the border patrol agents 16500 plus ice last week endorsed me first time theyve endorsed a candidate it means their job is tougher but they know what’s going on they know it better than anybody they want strong borders they feel we have to have strong borders i was up in new hampshire the other day the biggest complaint they have it’s with all the problems going on in the world many of the problems caused by hillary clinton and barack obama all of the problems the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern borders just pouring and destroying their youth it is poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people we have to have strong borders we have to keep the drugs out of our country right now were getting the drugs theyre getting the cash we need strong borders we need absolute we cannot give amnesty now i want to build the wall we need the wall the border patrol ice they all want the wall we stop the drugs we shore up the border one of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords all of the bad ones we have some bad bad people in this country that have to go out were going to get them out were going to secure the border and once the border is secured at a later date well make a determination as to the rest but we have some bad hombres here and were going to get them out

wallace mr trump thank you same question to you secretary clinton basically why are you right and mr trump is wrong

clinton well as he was talking i was thinking about a young girl i met here in las vegas carla who is very worried that her parents might be deported because she was born in this country but they were not they work hard they do everything they can to give her a good life and youre right i dont want to rip families apart i dont want to be sending families away from children i dont want to see the deportation force that donald has talked about in action in our country we have 11 million undocumented people they have 4 million american citizen children 15 million people he said as recently as a few weeks ago in phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation heres with a that means it means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence where law enforcement officers would be going school to school home to home business to business rounding up people who are undocumented and we would then to have put them on trains on buses to get them out of our country i think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation i think it is an idea that would rip our country apart i have been for border security for years i voted for border security in the united states senate and my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security but i want to put our resources where i think theyre most needed getting rid of any violent person anybody who should be deported we should deport them when it comes to the wall that donald talks about building he went to mexico had a meeting with the mexican president he didnt even raise it he choked and then got into a twitter war because the mexican president said were not paying for that wall so i think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly and thats why im introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with a path to citizenship

wallace thank you secretary clinton i want to followup

trump chris i think it’s  i think i should respond first of all i had a very good meeting with the president of mexico very nice man we will be doing very much better with mexico on trade deals believe me the nafta deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind signed by anybody it’s a disaster hillary clinton wanted the wall hillary clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or there abouts now she never gets anything done so naturally the wall wasnt built but hillary clinton wanted the wall

wallace well let me 

trump we are a country of laws by the way 

wallace i would like to hear from secretary clinton

clinton i voted for border security and

trump and a wall

clinton there are some limited places where that was appropriate there also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that but it is clear when you look at what donald has been proposing he started his campaign bashing immigrants calling mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers that he has a very different there view about what we should do to deal with immigrants now what i am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows putting them into the formal economy would be good because then employers cant exploit them and undercut americans wages and donald knows a lot about this he used undocumented labor to build the trump tower he underpaid undocumented workers and when they complained he basically said what a lot of employers do you complain ill get you deported i want to get everybody out of the shadows get the economy working and not let employers like donald exploit undocumented workers which hurts them but also hurts american workers

trump president obama has moved millions of people out nobody knows about it nobody talks about it but under obama millions of people have been moved out of this country theyve been deported she doesnt want to say that but thats what has happened and that’s what happened  big league as far as moving these people out and moving we either have a country or we dont were a country of laws we either have a border or we dont now you can come back in and you can become a citizen but it’s very unfair we have millions of people that did it the right way theyre on line theyre waiting were going to speed up the process bigly because it’s very inefficient but theyre on line and they’re waiting to become citizens very unfair that somebody runs across the border becomes a citizen under her plan you have open borders you would have a disaster on trade and and you will have a disaster with your open borders what she doesn’t say is that president obama has deported millions and millions of people

wallace secretary clinton 
clinton we will not have open borders that is a rank mischaracterization we will have secure borders but we will also have reform this used to be a bipartisan issue ronald reagan was the last president to sign 

wallace excuse me

clinton to sign immigration reform and george w bush supported it as well

wallace secretary clinton i want to clear up your position on this issue because in a speech you gave to a brazilian bank for which you were paid 225000 weve learned from wikileaks that you said this and i want to quote “my dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders”

trump thank you

wallace thats the question please quiet everybody is that your dream open borders

clinton if you went on to read the rest of the sentence i was talking about energy we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined and i do want us to have an electric grid an energy system that crosses borders i think that would be a great benefit to us but you are very clearly quoting from wikileaks what is really important about wikileaks is that the russian government has engaged in espionage against americans they have hacked american websites american accounts of private people of institutions then they have given that information to wikileaks for the purpose of putting it on the internet this has come from the highest levels of the russian government clearly from putin himself in an effort as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed to influence our election so i actually think the most important question of this evening chris is finally will donald trump admit and condemn that the russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of putin in this election that he rejects russian espionage against americans which he actually encouraged in the past those are the questions we need answered weve never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before

trump that was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders okay how did we get on to putin

wallace hold on folks because this is going to end up getting out of control lets try to keep it quiet for the candidates and for the american people

trump just to finish on the borders she wants open borders people are going to pour into our country people are going to come in from syria she wants 550 more people than barack obama and he has thousands and thousands of people they have no idea where they come from and you see we are going to stop radical islamic terrorism in this country she wont even mention the words and neither will president obama so i just want to tell you she wants open borders now we can talk about putin i dont know putin he said nice things about me if we got along well that would be good if russia and the united states got along well and went after isis that would be good he has no respect for her he has no respect for our president and ill tell you what were in very serious trouble because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads 1800 by the way where they expanded and we didnt 1800 nuclear warheads and she is playing chicken look

clinton wait

trump putin from everything i see has no respect for this person

clinton well thats because he would rather have a puppet as president of the united states

trump no puppet youre the puppet

clinton it is pretty clear you wont admit that the russians have engaged in cyber attacks against the united states of america that you encouraged espionage against our people that you are willing to spout the putin line sign up for his wish list break up nato do whatever he wants to do and that you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race so i think that this is such an unprecedented situation weve never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election we have 17 17 intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks these cyber attacks come from the highest levels of the kremlin and they are designed to influence our election i find that deeply disturbing

wallace secretary clinton

clinton and i think it is time 

trump she has no idea whether it is russia china or anybody else

clinton i am not quoting myself

trump you have no idea

clinton i am quoting 17 17  do you doubt

trump our country has no idea

clinton our military and civilian 

trump yeah i doubt it i doubt it

clinton he would rather believe vladimir putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us i find that just absolutely 

trump she doesnt like putin because putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way

wallace mr trump

trump excuse me putin has outsmarted her in syria he’s outsmarted her every step of the way

wallace i do get to ask some questions and i would like to ask you this direct question the top national security officials of this country do believe that russia has been behind these hacks even if you dont know for sure whether they are do you condemn any interference by russia in the american election

trump by russia or anybody else

wallace do you condemn their interference

trump of course i condemn of course i condemn  i dont know putin i have no idea

wallace im not asking you that

trump i never met putin this is not my best friend but if the united states got along with russia it wouldnt be so bad let me tell you putin has outsmarted her and obama at every single step of the way whether it is syria you name it missiles take a look at the startup that they signed the russians have said according to many many reports i cant believe they allowed us to do this they create warheads and we cant the russians cant believe it she has been outsmarted by putin and all you have to do is look at the middle east they’ve taken over weve spent 6 trillion theyve taken over the middle east she has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody ive ever seen in any government whatsoever

wallace were a long way away from immigration im going to let you finish this you have about 45 seconds
trump and she always will be

clinton i find it ironic that he is raising nuclear weapons this is a person who has been very cavalier even casual about the use of nuclear weapons

trump wrong

clinton he has advocated more countries getting them japan korea even saudi arabia he’s said if we have them why dont we use them which i think is terrifying but heres the deal the bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order it must be followed there is about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so and that is why ten people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and in an unprecedented way said they would not trust donald trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button

trump i have 200 generals and admirals 21 endorsing me 21 congressional medal of honor recipients as far as japan and other countries we are being ripped off by everybody in the world were defending other countries we are spending a fortune doing it they have the bargain of the century all i said is we have to renegotiate these agreements because our country cannot afford to defend saudi arabia japan germany south korea and many other places we cannot continue to afford she took that as saying nuclear weapons

wallace okay

trump look shes been proven to be a liar on so many different ways this is just another lie

clinton well im just quoting you when

trump there is no quote you wont find a quote from me

clinton nuclear competition in asia you said go ahead enjoy yourselves folks

trump and defend yourselves and defend yourselves i didnt say  and defend yourself

clinton the united states has kept the peace through our alliances donald wants to tear up our alliances i think it makes the world safer and frankly it makes the united states safer i would work with our allies in asia in europe in the middle east and elsewhere that is the only way 

wallace we are going to move on to the next topic which is the economy and i hope we handle that as well as we did immigration you also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster secretary clinton in your plan government plays a big role you see more government spending more entitlements more tax credits more tax penalties mr trump you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation we’re going to drill down into this a little bit more in this overview please explain to me why you believe your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponents plan will not in this round you go first secretary clinton

clinton well i think the middle class thrives america thrives so my plan is based on growing the economy giving middle class families many more opportunities i want us to have the biggest jobs program since world war ii jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing i think we can compete with high wage countries and i believe we should new jobs in clean energy not only to fight climate change which is a serious problem but to create new opportunities and new businesses i want us to do more to help small business that’s where twothirds of the new jobs are going to come from i want to us raise the national minimum wage because people who work full time should not still be in poverty and i sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do i feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college that’s why i want more technical education and community colleges real apprenticeships to prepare young peel for the jobs of the future i want to make college debtfree and for families making less than 125000 you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or a university if the plan that i worked on with bernie sanders is enacted and were going to work hard to make sure that it is because we are going to go where the money is most of the gains in the last years since the great recession have gone to the very top so we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share were going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country that is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs by contrast donalds plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 35 million jobs why because his whole plan is to cut taxes to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations adding 20 trillion to our debt and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before because it truly will be trickle down economics on steroids so the plan i have i think will actually produce greater opportunities the plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another great recession

wallace secretary thank you mr trump why will your plan create more jobs and growth than secretary clinton

trump well first of all before i start on my plan her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes her tax plan is a disaster and she can say all she wants about college tuition and im a big proponent were going to do a lot of things for college tuition but the rest the public is going to be paying for it we will have a massive massive tax increase under hillary clintons plan but i would like to start off where we left because when i said japan and germany and im not just singling them out but south korea these are very rich countries saudi arabia nothing but money we protect saudi arabia why arent they paying she immediately when she heard this i questioned it and i questioned nato why aren’t they nato questioned why arent they paying because they weren’t paying since i did this this was a year ago all of a sudden theyre paying and ive been given a lot of credit for it all of a sudden theyre starting to pay up they have to pay up were protecting people they have to pay up and im a big fan of nato but they have to pay up she comes out and says “we love our allies we think our allies are great” well it is awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are we have to tell japan in a very nice way we have to tell germany all of these countries south korea we have to say you have to help us out we have during his regime during president obamas regime weve doubled our national debt were up to 20 trillion so my plan we’re going to negotiate trade deals we’re going to have a lot of free trade more free trade than we have right now but we have horrible deals our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed nafta one of the worst deals ever the jobs are being sucked out of our economy you look at the places i just left you go to pennsylvania you go to ohio you go to florida you go to any of them you go to upstate new york our jobs have fled to mexico and other places were bringing our jobs back im going to renegotiate nafta and if i cant make a great deal then were going to terminate nafta and we’re going to create new deals were going to have trade but were going to terminate it were going on make a great trade deal if we cant were going to go our separate way because it has been a disaster were going to cut taxes massively were going to cut business taxes massively theyre going to start hiring people were going to bring the 25 trillion that’s offshore back into the country we are going to start the engine rolling again because right now our country is dying at 1 gdp

clinton let me translate that if i can chris

trump you cant

clinton the fact is he is going to advocate for the largest tax cuts weve ever seen three times more than the tax cuts under the bush administration i have said repeatedly throughout this campaign i will not raise taxes on anyone making 250000 or less i also will not add a penny to the debt i have costed out what i’m going to do he will through his massive tax cuts add 20 trillion to the debt he mentioned the debt we know how to get control of the debt when my husband was president we went from a 300 billion deficit to a 200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt when president obama came into office he inherited the worst economic disaster since the great depression he has cut the deficit by twothirds so yes one of the ways you go after the debt one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people so i do have investments investments in new jobs investments in education skill training and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead thats the kind of approach

wallace secretary 

clinton  that will work cutting taxes on the wealthy weve tried that it has not worked the way that it has been 

wallace secretary clinton i want to pursue your plan because in many ways it is similar to the obama stimulus plan in 2009 which has led to the slowest gdp growth since 1949

trump correct

wallace thank you sir you told me in july when we spoke that the problem is that president obama didnt get to do enough in what he was trying to do with the stimulus so is your plan basically more even more of the obama stimulus

clinton well it is a combination chris let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that president obama inherited it was a real touch and go situation i was in the senate before i became secretary of state ive never seen people as physically distraught as the bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy i personally believe that the steps that president obama took saved the economy he doesnt get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions
but it was a terrible recession so now weve dug ourselves out of it were standing but were not yet running so what i am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up not the top down that is not going to work that is why what i have put forward doesnt add a penny to the debt but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs higher paying jobs were beginning to see some increase in incomes and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs we have got to do more to get the whole economy moving and thats what i believe i will be able to do

wallace mr trump even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers dont add up that your idea and you’ve talked about 25 million jobs created 4 growth

trump over a 10year period

wallace  is unrealistic and they say you talk a lot about growing the energy industry they say with oil prices as low as they are right now thats unrealistic as well your response

trump so i just left some high representatives of india theyre growing at 8 china is growing at 7 and that for them is a catastrophically low number we are growing our last report came out and it is right around the 1 level and i think it’s going down last week as you know the end of last week they came out with an anemic jobs report a terrible jobs report in fact i said is that the last jobs report before the election because if it is i should win easily because it was so bad the report was so bad look our country is stagnant weve lost our jobs weve lost our businesses were not making things anymore relatively speaking our product is pouring in from china pouring in from vietnam pouring in from all over the world ive visited so many communities this has been such an incredible education for me chris ive gotten to know so many i’ve developed so many friends over the last year and they cry when they see what has happened i pass factories that were thriving 20 25 years ago and because of the bill her husband signed and that she blessed 100 it is just horrible what has happened to these people in these communities now she can say her husband did well but boy did they suffer as nafta kicked in because it didnt really kick in very much but it kicked in after they left boy did they suffer that was one of the worst things that has ever been signed by our country now she wants to sign transpacific partnership and she wants it she lied when she said she didnt call it the gold standard in one of the debates she totally lied she did call it the gold standard and they actually fact checked and they said i was right

wallace i want to give you a chance to briefly speak to that then i want to pivot  to obamacare but go ahead briefly
trump and that will be as bad as nafta

clinton well first let me say number one when i saw the final agreement for tpp i said i was against it it didnt meet my test ive had the same test does it create jobs raise incomes and further our national security i’m against it now i’ll be against it after the election ill be against it when im president theres only one of us on this stage who has actually shipped jobs to mexico because thats donald he has shipped jobs to 12 countries including mexico but he mentioned china and you know one of the biggest problems we have with china is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets i have fought against that as a senator i have stood up against it as secretary of state donald has bought chinese steel and aluminum in fact the trump hotel right here in las vegas was made with chinese steel so he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is but he has given jobs to chinese steelworkers not american steelworkers thats the kind of approach that is just not going to work were going to pull the country together were going to have trade agreements that we enforce thats why im going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history and were going to enforce those agreements and were going to look for businesses to help us by buying american products

trump can i ask a simple question shes been doing this for 30 years why the hell didnt you do it over the last 15 20 years you were very much involved

clinton i voted 

trump excuse me my turn you were very much involved in every aspect of this country very much and you do have experience i say the one thing you have over me is experience but it is bad experience because what youve done has turned out badly for 30 years youve been in a position to help and if you say that i used steel or i used something else i make it impossible for me to do i wouldnt mind the problem is you talk but you dont get anything done hillary you dont just like when you ran the state department 6 billion was missing how do you miss 6 billion you ran the state department 6 billion was either stolen they dont know it’s gone 6 billion if you become president this country is going to be in some mess believe me
clinton well first of all what he just said about the state department is not only untrue it’s been debunked numerous times but i think its really an important issue he raised the 30 years of experience so let me just talk briefly about that you know back in the 1970s i worked for the childrens defense fund and i was taking on discrimination against africanamerican kids in schools he was getting sued by the justice department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings in the 1980s i was working to reform the schools in arkansas he was borrowing 14 million from his father to start his businesses in the 1990s i went to beijing and i said womens rights are human rights he insulted a former miss universe alicia machado and called her an eating machine

trump give me a break

clinton and on the day when i was in the situation room monitoring the raid that brought osama bin laden to justice he was hosting the celebrity apprentice so i’m happy to compare my 30 years of experience what i’ve done for this country trying to help in every way i could especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead with your thirty years and ill let the american people make that decision

trump well i think i did a much better job i built a massive company a great company some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world worth many many billions of dollars i started with a 1 million loan i agree with that its a 1 million loan but i built a phenomenal company and if we could run our country the way ive run my company we would have a country that would you would be so proud of you would even be proud of it and frankly when you look at her real record take a look at syria take a look at the migration take a look at libya take a look at iraq she gave us isis because her and obama created this huge vacuum and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because we should have never been in iraq but once we were there we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out she gave us isis as sure as you are sitting there and what happened is now isis is in 32 countries now i listen to how shes going to get rid of isis shes going to get to rid of nobody

wallace were going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments but the next segment is fitness to be president of the united states mr trump at the last debate you said your talk about grabbing women was just that talk and that youd never actually done it and since then as we all know nine women have come forward and said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up  you deny this why would they make up these stories and since this is a question for both of you secretary clinton mr trump says what your husband did and what you defended was even worse mr trump you go first

trump well first of all those stories have been largely debunked those people i dont know those people i have a feeling how they came i believe it was her campaign that did it just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where i was wondering what happened with my rally in chicago and other rallies where we had such violence shes the one and obama that caused the violence they hired people they paid them 1500 and theyre on tape saying be violent cause fights do bad things i would say the only way  because those stories are all totally false i have to say that and i didnt even apologize to my wife who is sitting right here because i didnt do anything i didnt know any of these women i didnt see these women these women the woman on the plane the woman on the  i think they want either fame or her campaign did it and i think its her campaign because what i saw what they did which is a criminal act by the way where theyre telling people to go out and start fistfights and start violence  and ill tell you what in particular in chicago people were hurt and people could have killed in that riot and thats now all on tape started by her i believe chris she got these people to step forward if it wasnt they get their ten minutes of fame but they were all totally  it was all fiction it was lies and it was fiction

clinton well 

wallace secretary clinton

clinton at the last debate we heard donald talking about what he did to women and after that a number of women have come forward saying thats exactly what he did to them now what was his response well he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for –

trump i did not say that

clinton  them to be assaulted

trump i did not say that

clinton in fact he went on to say 

wallace her two minutes sire her two minutes

trump i did not say that

wallace her two minutes

clinton he went on to say “look at her i don’t think so” about another woman he said “that wouldnt be my first choice” he attacked the woman reporter writing the story called her disgusting as he has called a number of women during this campaign donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger he goes after their dignity their selfworth and i dont think there is a woman anywhere that doesnt know what that feels like so we now know what donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women thats who donald is i think its really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president how we want to bring our country together where we dont want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other where instead we celebrate our diversity we lift people up and we make our country even greater america is great because america is good and it really is up to all of us to make that true now and in the future and particularly for our children and our grandchildren

wallace mr trump 

trump nobody has more respect for women than i do nobody
laughter

wallace please everybody

trump and frankly those stories have been largely debunked and i really want to just talk about something slightly different she mentions this which is all fiction all fictionalized probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign but i will tell you what isnt fictionalized are her emails where she destroyed 33000 emails criminally criminally after getting a subpoena from the united states congress what happened to the fbi i dont know we have a great general fourstar general today you read it in all the papers going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the fbi one lie shes lied hundreds of times to the people to congress and to the fbi hes going to probably go to jail this is a fourstar general and she gets away with it and she can run for the presidency of the united states thats really what you should be talking about not fiction where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign

wallace secretary clinton

clinton well every time donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable like what these women are saying he immediately goes to denying responsibility and its not just about women he never apologizes or says hes sorry for anything so we know what he has said and what hes done to women but he also went after a disabled reporter mocked and mimicked him on national television

trump wrong

clinton he went after mr and mrs khan the parents of a young man who died serving our country a gold star family because of their religion he went after john mccain a prisoner of war said he prefers people that arent captured he went after a federal judge born in indiana but who donald said couldnt be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against trump university because his parents were mexican so its not one thing this is a pattern a pattern of divisiveness of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country where he incites violence where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies that is not who america is and i hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign more and more people will understand whats at stake in this election it really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have

trump so sad when she talks about violence at my rallies and she caused the violence its on tape the other things are false but honestly id love to talk about getting rid of isis and id love to talk about other things

wallace okay

trump but those other charges as she knows are false

wallace in this bucket about fitness to be president theres been a lot of developments over the last ten days since the last debate id like to ask you about them these are questions that the american people have secretary clinton during your 2009 senate confirmation hearing you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the clinton foundation while you were secretary of state but emails show that donors got speciall access to you those seeking grants for haiti relief separately from nondonors and some of those donors got contracts government contracts taxpayer money can you really say youve kept your pledge to that senate committee and why isn’t what happened and what went on and between you and the clinton foundation why isnt it what mr trump calls paytoplay

clinton well everything i did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our countrys interests and our values the state department has said that i think thats been proven but i am happy  in fact im thrilled to talk about the clinton foundation because it is a world renowned charity and im so proud of the work that it does i could talk for the rest of the debate i know i dont have the time to do that but just briefly the clinton foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with hiv aids to afford treatment and thats about half of all the people in the world that are getting treatment in partnership with the american health association

wallace secretary clinton respectfully this is an open discussion

clinton well it is an open discussion

wallace the specific question is about pay to play 

clinton there is a lot of evidence about the very good work 

trump and its a criminal enterprise 

wallace please let mr trump speak

trump its a criminal enterprise saudi arabia given 25 million qatar all of these countries you talk about women and womens rights so these are people that push gays off business off buildings these are people that kill women and treat women horribly and yet you take their money so id like to ask you right now why dont you give back the money that youve taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly why don’t you give back the money i think it would be a great gesture because she takes a tremendous amount of money and you take a look at the people of haiti i was in little haiti the other day in florida and i want to tell you they hate the clintons because whats happened in haiti with the clinton foundation is a disgrace and you know it and they know it and everybody knows it

wallace secretary clinton

clinton well very quickly we at the clinton foundation spend 90 90 of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs for people around the world and in our own country i’m very proud of that we have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations and i would be happy to compare what we do with the trump foundation which took money from other people and bought a sixfoot portrait of donald i mean who does that i mean it just was astonishing but when it comes to haiti haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere the earthquake and the hurricanes it has devastated haiti bill and i have been involved in trying to help haiti for many years the clinton foundation raised 30 million to help haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had weve done things to help small businesses agriculture and so much else and were going to keep working to help haiti because it is an important part of the american experience

trump i dont want you to help them anymore id like to mention one thing trump foundation small foundation people contribute i contribute the money goes 100 100 goes to different charities including a lot of military i don’t get anything i dont buy boats i dont buy planes

wallace wasnt some of the money used to settle your lawsuit sir

trump no we put up the american flag and thats it they put up the american flag we fought for the right in palm beach to put up the american flag

wallace there was a penalty that was imposed by palm beach county 

trump there was there was and by the way the money went to fisher house where they build houses the money that youre talking about went to fisher house where they build houses for veterans and disabled veterans

clinton of course theres no way we can know whether any of that is true because he hasnt released his tax returns hes the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40plus years who has not released his tax returns so everything he says about charity or anything else we cant prove it you can look at our tax returns we’ve got them all out there what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax and we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago chris half of all undocumented immigrants actually pay federal income tax so we have undocumented immigrants in america who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire i find that just astonishing
trump were entitled because of the laws that people like her pass to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges and we do it and all of her donors just about all of them i know buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars soros george soros took hundreds of millions of dollars
wallace mr trump 

trump let me just explain all of her donors most of her donors 

wallace mr trump 

trump have done the same thing as i did and you know what she should have done you know hillary what you should have done you should have changed the law when you were a united states senator if you dont like it 

wallace thanks we’ve heard this

trump  because your donors and special interests are doing the same thing as i do except even more so you should have changed the law but you wont change the law because you take in so much money i sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street

clinton made with chinese steel

trump i will tell you i sat there i sat there watching ad after ad after ad all false ads all paid for by your friends on wall street that gave so much money because they know youre going to protect them and frankly you should have changed the laws if you dont like what i did you should have changed the laws

wallace mr trump i want to ask you about one last question in this topic youve been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that hillary clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you your running mate governor pence pledged on sunday that he and you his words will absolutely accept the result of this election today your daughter ivanka said the same thing i want to ask you here on the stage tonight do you make the same commitment that youll absolutely accept the result of the election

trump i will look at it at the time i’m not looking at anything now ill look at it at the time what ive seen what i’ve seen is so bad first of all the media is so dishonest and so corrupt and the pile on is so amazing the new york times actually wrote an article about it but they dont even care it is so dishonest and they have poisoned the minds of the voters but unfortunately for them i think the voters are seeing through it i think they’re going to see through it we’ll find out on november 8th but i think they’re going to see through it if you look 

wallace but but 

trump excuse me chris if you look at your voter rolls you will see millions of people that are registered to vote millions this isnt coming from me this is coming from pew report and other places millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldnt be registered to vote so let me just give you one other thing i talk about the corrupt media i talk about the millions of people ill tell you one other thing she shouldnt be allowed to run it’s  shes guilty of a very very serious crime she should not be allowed to run and just in that respect i say its rigged because she should never 

wallace but but 

trump chris she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with emails and so many other things

wallace but sir there is a tradition in this country in fact one of the prides of this country is the peaceful transition of power and no matter how hard fought a campaign is that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner not saying youre necessarily going to be the loser or the winner but that the loser concedes to the winner and the country comes together in part for the good of the country are you saying youre not prepared now to commit to that principle

trump what i’m saying is that i will tell you at the time ill keep you in suspense okay

clinton well chris let me respond to that because that’s horrifying you know every time donald thinks things arent going in his direction he claims whatever it is is rigged against him the fbi conducted a yearlong investigation into my emails they concluded there was no case he said the fbi was rigged he lost the iowa caucus he lost the wisconsin primary he said the republican primary was rigged against him then trump university gets sued for fraud and racketeering he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him there was even a time when he didnt get an emmy for his tv program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the emmys were rigged against him

trump should have gotten it
laughter

clinton this is a mindset this is how donald thinks and its funny but its also really troubling that is not the way our democracy works weve been around for 240 years weve had free and fair elections weve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election you know president obama said the other day when youre whining before the game is even finished
applause

wallace hold on folks

clinton it just shows youre not up to doing the job and lets be clear about what hes saying and what that means hes denigrating he is talking down our democracy and i for one am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position

trump i think what the fbi did and what the department of justice did including meeting with her husband the attorney general in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in arizona i think its disgraceful i think its a disgrace

wallace all right

trump i think weve never had a situation so bad
applause

wallace hold on folks this doesnt do any good for anyone lets please continue the debate and let’s move onto the subject of foreign hotspots the iraqi offensive to take back mosul has begun if they are successful in pushing isis out of that city and out of all of iraq the question then becomes what happens the day after and thats something whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront will you put us troops into that vacuum to make sure isis doesnt come back or isnt replaced by something even worse secretary clinton you go first in this segment you have two minutes

clinton well i am encouraged there is an effort led by the iraqi army supported by kurdish forces and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other americans on the ground but i will not support putting american soldiers into iraq as an occupying force i dont think that is in our interest and i dont think that would be smart to do in fact chris i think that would be a big red flag waving for isis to reconstitute itself the goal here is to take back mosul its going to be a hard fight ive got no illusions about that and then continue to press into syria to begin to take back and move on raqqa which is the isis headquarters i am hopeful that the hard work that american military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a really successful military operation but we know weve got lots of work to do syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war aided and abetted by the iranians and the russians continue so i have said look we need to keep our eye on isis thats why i want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home why we have to go after them from the air on the ground online why we have to make sure here at home we dont let terrorists buy weapons if youre too dangerous to fly youre too dangerous to buy a gun and im going to continue to push for a nofly zone and safe havens within syria not only to help protect the syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees but to frankly gain some leverage on both the syrian government and the russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track

wallace mr trump same question if we are able to push isis out of mosul and out of iraq would you be willing to put us troops in there to prevent their return or something else

trump let me tell you mosul is so sad we had mosul but when she left she took everybody out we lost mosul now were fighting again to get mosul the problem with mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of isis who they felt were in mosul about three months ago i started reading they want to get the leaders and theyre going to attack mosul whatever happened to the element of surprise okay we announce were going after mosul ive been reading about going after mosul now for about how long is it hillary three months these people have all left theyve all left the element of surprise douglas macarthur george patton spinning in their graves at the stupidity of our country
so we’re now fighting for mosul that we had all she had to do was stay there now we’re going in to get it but you know who the big winner in mosul is going to be after we eventually get it  and the only reason they did it is because shes running for office of president and they want to look tough they want to look good he violated the red line in the sand and he made so many mistakes he made all mistakes thats why we have the great migration but she wanted to look good for the election so they’re going in
but who is going to get mosul really well take mosul eventually by the way if you look at whats happening much tougher than they thought much much tougher much more dangerous going to be more deaths than they thought but the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because theyre smart they say what do we need this for so mosul is going to be a wonderful thing and iran should write us a letter of thank you just like the really stupid the stupidest deal of all time a deal thats going to give iran absolutely nuclear weapons iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much because iran as i said many years ago iran is taking over iraq something theyve wanted to do forever but weve made it so easy for them so were now going to take mosul and you know who is going to be the beneficiary iran boy are they making they are outsmarting… look youre not there you might be involved in that decision but you were there when you took everybody out of mosul and out of iraq you shouldnt have been in iraq but you did vote for it you shouldnt have been in iraq but once you were in iraq you should have never left the way  the point is the big winner is going to be iran

clinton well you know once again donald is implying that he didnt support the invasion of iraq i said it was a mistake i said that years ago he has consistently denied what is 

trump wrong

clinton  is a very clear fact that before the invasion

trump wrong

clinton  he supported it i just want everybody to go google it “google donald trump iraq” and youll see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of iraq

trump wrong

clinton and you can hear the audio of him saying that why does that matter well it matters because he has not told the truth about that position i guess he believes it makes him look better to contrast with me because i did vote for it but whats really important here is to understand all the interplay mosul is a sunni city mosul is on the border of syria and yes we do need to go after baghdadi just like we went after bin laden while you were doing celebrity apprentice and we brought him to justice we need to go after the leadership but we need to get rid of them get rid of their fighters there are several thousand fighters in mosul they’ve been digging underground they’ve been prepared to defend its going to be tough fighting but i think we can take back mosul and then we can move on into syria and take back raqqa
this is what we have to do im just am amazed that he seems to think the iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on mosul to help me in this election but that’s how donald thinks you know he always is looking for some conspiracy

trump we dont gain anything iran is taking over 

wallace secretary clinton 

trump iran is taking over iraq

clinton his conspiracy theories

wallace secretary clinton 

trump we would have gained 

clinton for quite sometime 

wallace secretary clinton its an open discussion secretary please let mr trump speak go ahead

clinton he’s unfit he proves it every time

trump no youre the one thats unfit you know wikileaks just actually came out john podesta said some horrible things about you and boy was he right he said some beauties and you know bernie sanders he said you have bad judgment you do and if you think going into mosul after we let the world know were going in and all of the people we really wanted the leaders are all gone if you think that was good then you do now john podesta said you have terrible instincts bernie sanders said you have bad judgment i agree with both

clinton well you should ask bernie sanders who he is supporting for president

trump which is a big mistake

clinton and he said you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of america i think hes right

wallace lets turn to aleppo mr trump in the last debate you were both asked about the situation in the syrian city of aleppo and i want to follow up on that because you said several things in that debate which were not true sir you said that aleppo has basically fallen in fact there are 

trump its a catastrophe

wallace it is a catastrophe

trump it’s a mess have you seen it have you seen it have you seen what’s happened to aleppo

wallace sir if i may finish my question

trump okay so it hasn’t fallentake a look at it

wallace well there are quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered

trump that’s right and they are being slaughtered because of bad decisions

wallace if i may just finish here and you also said that syria and russia are busy fighting isis in fact they have been the ones who have been bombing and shelling eastern aleppo and they just announced a humanitarian pause in effect admitting they have been bombing and shelling in aleppo would you like to clear that up sir

trump well aleppo is a disaster it’s a humanitarian nightmare but it has fallen from any standpoint what do you need a signed document take a look at aleppo it is so sad when you see whats happened and a lot of this is because of hillary clinton because whats happened is by fighting assad who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought  now shes going to say oh he loves assad hes much tougher and much smarter than her and obama and everyone thought he was gone two years ago three years ago he aligned with russia he now also aligned with iran who we made very powerful we gave them 150 billion back we gave them 17 billion in cash i mean cash bundles of cash as big as this stage we gave them 17 billion
now they have lined  he has aligned with russia and with iran they dont want isis but they have other things because were backing were backing rebels we dont know who the rebels are were giving them lots of money lots of everything we dont know who the rebels are and when and if  and its not going to happen because you have russia and you have iran now but if they ever did overthrow assad you might end up with as bad as assad is and he’s a bad guy but you may very well end up with worse than assad if she did nothing we would be in much better shape and this is whats caused the great migration where shes taking in tens of thousands of syrian refugees who probably in many cases  not probably who are definitely in many cases isisaligned and we now have them in our country wait til you see  this is going to be the great trojan horse wait til you see what happens in the coming years lots of luck hillary thanks a lot for doing a great job

wallace secretary clinton you have talked about in the last debate and again today that you would impose a nofly zone to try to protect the people of aleppo and to stop the killing there president obama has refused to do that because he fears it’s gonna draw us closer and deeper into the conflict and general joseph dunford the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff says you want to impose a nofly zone chances are you are going to get into a war his words with syria and russia so the question i have is first how do you respond to their concerns secondly if you impose a nofly zone and a russian plane violates that does president clinton shoot that plane down

clinton well chris first of all i think a nofly zone could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict i am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general this would not be done just on the first daythis would take a lot of negotiation and it would also take making it clear to the russians and the syrians that our purpose is to provide safe zones on the ground weve had millions of people leave syria and those millions of people inside syria who’ve been dislocated so i think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the russians and syrians that this was something that we believe the best interests of the people on the ground in syria it would help us in the fight against isis
but i want to respond to what donald said about refugees made these claims repeatedly i am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted who we do not have confidence in but i am not going to slam the door on women and children that picture of that little 4yearold boy in aleppo with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance is haunting and so we are going to do very careful thorough vetting that does not solve our internal challenges with isis and our need to stop radicalization to work with american muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks in fact the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in orlando the pulse night club was born in queens the same place donald was born so lets be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it yes some of that threat emanates from over in syria and iraq and weve got to keep fighting and i will defeat isis and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home

wallace folks i want to get into our final segment

trump but i just have too it’s so ridiculous what she… she will defeat isis we should never have let isis happen in the first place and right now they are in 32 countries 

wallace mr trump 

trump wait one second they had a ceasefire three weeks ago a ceasefire united states russia syria and during the ceasefire russia took over vast swathes of land and then they said we dont want the ceasefire anymore we are so outplayed on missiles on ceasefires they are outplayed she wasnt there i assume she had nothing to do with it but our country is so outplayed by putin and assad and by the way and by iran nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is

wallace mr trump secretary clinton no we need to move on to our final segment and that is the national debt which has not been discussed until tonight our national debt as a share of the economy our gdp is now 77 thats the highest since just after world war ii but the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget says secretary clinton under your plan debt would rise to 86 of gdp for the next ten years mr trump under your plan they say it would rise to 105 of gdp over the next ten years the question is why are both of you ignoring this problem mr trump you go first

trump well i saw theyre wrong because i’m going to create tremendous jobs and were bringing gdp from really 1 which is what it is now and if she got in it would be less than zero but we’re bringing it from 1 up to 4 and i actually think we can go higher than 4 i think you can go to 5 or 6 and if we do you don’t have to bother asking your question because we have a tremendous machine we will have created a tremendous economic machine once again to do that were taking back jobs were not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs we dont make our product anymore its very sad but i am going to create a… the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry we used to be there weve given it up weve become very very sloppy weve had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world bigger than companies you take these big companies
these trade deals are far bigger than these companies and yet we dont use our great leaders many of whom back me and many of whom backed hillary i must say but we dont use those people those are the peoplethese are the greatest negotiators in the world we have the greatest business people in the world we have to use them to negotiate our trade deals we use political hacks we use people that get the position because they made a campaign contribution and theyre dealing with china and people that are very much smarter than they are so we have to use our great people but that being said we will create an economic machine the likes of which we havent seen in many decades and people chris will again go back to work and theyll make a lot of money and well have companies that will will grow and expand and start from new

wallace secretary clinton

clinton well first when i hear donald talk like that and know that his slogan is make america great again i wonder when he thought america was great and before he rushes and says you know before you and president obama were there i think its important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades you know back in 1987 he took out an 100000 ad in the new york times during the time when president reagan was president and basically said exactly what he just said right now that we were the laughing stock of the world he was criticizing president reagan this is the way donald thinks about himself puts himself into you know the middle and says you know ‘i alone can fix it’ as he said on the convention stage
but if you look at the debt which is the issue you asked about chris i pay for everything im proposing i do not add a penny to the national debt i take that very seriously because i do think its one of the issues weve got to come to grips with so when i talk about how were going to pay for education how were going to invest in infrastructure how were going to get the cost of prescription drugs down and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time ive made it very clear we are going where the money is we are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share and there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth in fact i think just the opposite well have what economists call middle outgrowth weve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class the families of america thats where growth will come from thats why i want to invest in you i want to invest in your family and i think thats the smartest way to grow the economy to make the economy fairer and we just have a big disagreement about this it may be because of our experiences you know he started off with his dad as a millionaire i started off with my dad as a small businessman

trump weve heard this before hillary weve heard this before

clinton i think its a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy

wallace time

trump thank you hillary could i just respond

wallace well no because were running out of time

trump because i disagreed with ronald reagan very strongly on trade i disagreed with him we should have been much tougher on trade even then ive been waiting for years nobody does it right and frankly now were going to do it right

wallace the one last area i want to get into with you in the debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements which is 60 of all federal spending now the committee for a responsible federal budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that medicare is going to run out of money in the 2020s social security is going to run out of money in the 2030s and at that time recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits in fact the final question i want to ask you in this regard is  and let me start with you mr trump would president trump make a deal to save medicare and social security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts in effect a grand bargain on entitlements

trump im cutting taxes were going to grow the economy its going to grow in a record rate

wallace thats not going to help with entitlements

trump it is going to totally help you and one thing we have to do is repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacare its destroying our country its destroying our businesses our small business and our big businesses we have to repeal and replace obamacare you take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year 2017 it is a disaster if we dont repeal and replace it is probably going to die of its own weight but obamacare has to go the premiums are going up 60 70 80 next year theyre going to go up over 100 and i’m really glad that the premiums have started at least the people see whats happening because she wants to keep obamacare and she wants to make it even worse and it cant get any worse bad health care at the most expensive price we have to repeal and replace obamacare

wallace secretary clinton same question because at this point social security and medicare are going to run out  the trust funds are going to run out of money will you as president consider a grand bargain a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs

clinton well chris i am record as saying we need to put more money into social security trust fund thats part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy my social security payroll contribution will go up as will donalds assuming he cant figure out how to get out of it but what we want to do is 

trump such a nasty woman

clinton replenish the trust fund by making sure that we have sufficient resources and that will come from either raising the cap andor finding other ways to get more money into it i will not cut benefits i want to enhance benefits for lowincome workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current social security system but what donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a 20 trillion additional national debt that will have dire consequences for social security and medicare and ill say something about the affordable care act which he wants to repeal the affordable care act extended the solvency of the medicare trust fund if he repeals it our medicare problem gets worse

trump your husband disagrees with you

clinton we’ve got to go after the longterm health care drivers weve got to get costs down increase value emphasize wellness i have a plan for doing that and i think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control but with more resources and smart decisions

wallace this is a final time probably to both of your delight that youre going to be on the stage together in this campaign i would like to end it on a positive note you had not agreed to closing statements but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven’t prepared closing statements so i would for each of you to take  and were going to put a clock up  a minute as the final question in the final debate to tell the american people why they should elect you to be the next president this is another new mini segment secretary clinton its your turn to go first

clinton well i would like to say to everyone watching tonight that im reaching out to all americans democrats republicans and independents because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be to grow the economy to make it fairer to make it work for everyone we need your talents your skills your commitment your energy your ambition you know ive been privileged to see the presidency up close and i know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you i have made the cause of children and families really my lifes work thats what my mission will be in the presidency i will stand up for families against powerful interests against corporations i will do everything that i can to make sure that you have good jobs with rising incomes that your kids have good educations from preschool through college i hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president

wallace secretary clinton thank you mr trump

trump shes raising the money from the people she wants to control doesnt work that way but when i started this campaign i started it very strongly its called make america great again were going to make america great we have a depleted military it has to be helped it has to be fixed we have the greatest people on earth in our military we dont take care of our veterans we take care of illegal immigrants people that come into our country illegally better than we take care of our vets that can’t happen our policemen and women are disrespected we need law and order but we need justice too our inner cities are a disaster you get shot walking to the store they have no education they have no jobs i will do more for africanamericans and latinos that she can do for ten lifetimes all shes done is talk to the africanamericans and to the latinos but they get the vote and then they come back they say ‘we’ll see you in four years’ we are going to make america strong again and we are going to make america great again and it has to start now we cannot take four more years of barack obama and thats what you get when you get her

wallace thank you both secretary clinton   applause  hold on just a moment folks i want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates that brings us to the end of the three debates sponsored by the commission of presidential debates we want to thank the university of nevada las vegas and its students for having us now the decision is up to you while millions have already voted election day november 8 is just 20 days away one thing everyone here can agree on is we hope you will go vote it is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country thank you and good night  applause
