dont breathe too deep
dont think all day
dive into work
drive the other way
that drip of hurt
that pint of shame
goes away
just play the game
youre living in america
at the end of the millenium

youre living in america
leave your conscience at the tone

and when youre living in america
at the end of the millenium
youre what you own
roger
the filmmaker cannot see

mark
and the songwriter cannot hear
you might also likeroger
yet i see mimi everywhere

mark
angels voice is in my ear
roger
just tighten those shoulders

mark
just clench your jaw til you frown

roger
just dont let go

both
or you may drown

youre living in america
at the end of the millenium
youre living in america
where its like the twilight zone

and when youre living in america
at the end of the millenium
youre what you own
so i own not a notion
i escape and ape content
i dont own emotion i rentmark
what was it about that night
connection
in an isolating age
for once the shadows gave way to light
 
for once i didnt disengage
angel i hear you i hear it
i see it i see it my film
alexi  mark
call me a hypocrite
i need to finish my
own filmroger
 
what was it about that night
connection
in an isolating age
 
for once the shadows gave way to light
for once i didnt disengage
mimi i see you i see it
i hear it i hear it my song
one song glory
mimi your eyesmark
i quit
both
dying in america
at the end of the millenium
were dying in america
to come into our own

and when youre dying in america
at the end of the millenium
youre not alone

im not alone
im not aloneembed"
