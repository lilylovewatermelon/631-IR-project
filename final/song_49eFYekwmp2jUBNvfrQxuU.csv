and i hit the ground you changed your plans
i caught a train oh these aint incomprehensible
you jumped a plane and back to arkansas
how far do i have to go to get to you babe
swam in the river and i sailed the seas
climbed up the mountain all the tallest trees
ill shoot the moon swing from the stars
ill take a rocket ship all the way to mars
how far do i have to go to get to you babe
and how far do i have to go to get to you
you dont mean to tease me baby
to take me for a ride
it aint your fault that you hooked my heart
and you left me on the line
you reeled me in from my bed
and it aint right to do me like that
body talks and i hear you say
come on come on come on come on
come on come on come on come on
come on come on come on
how far
no i wont or that i should
how far
the way i need you oh it aint good
how far
you got me weak you took control
how far
you twist my heart and confuse my soul
how far do i have to go to get to you babe
and how far do i have to go to get to you
how far do i have to go
how far do i have to go
how far do i have to go to get to you babesee whiskey myers liveget tickets as low as 44you might also likeembed"
