here i am alone again tonight in this old empty house
its hard to learn what you dont think you need that you cant live without
never leave the sound of the telephone
but ever since you left ive been gone

chorus
gone crazy going out of my mind
ive asked myself the reasons at least a thousand times
going up and down this hallway trying to leave the pain behind
ever since you left ive been gone

verse 2
i never saw your face this many times when you were really here
the things you said i never understood now are crystal clear
never spent this much time alone
but ever since you left ive been gone

chorus
gone crazy going out of my mind
ive asked myself the reasons at least a thousand times
going up and down this hallway trying to leave the pain behind
ever since you left ive been gone

outro
ive been gone
ive been gone
ive been gone gone
gone ive been gone
gone ive been gonesee alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeembed"
