put your red boots on baby giddy up
baby wants to dance baby gets her way
treat me nice talk to me with that whiskey breath
twirl me twice ill treat you like a holiday

prechorus
and dont say youre over me
when we both know that you aint
dont say youre over me
babe its already too late
just do what you do best with me

chorus
dance me all around the room
spin me like a ballerina super high
dance me all around the moon
light me up like the fourth of july
once twice three times the guy i
ever thought i would meet so
dont say youre over me
when we both know that you lie

postchorus
if you lie down lie next to me
lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
if you lie down lie next to me
lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
when you lie down lie next to me
see lana del rey liveget tickets as low as 42you might also likeverse 2
get your jacket on be a gentleman
get into your truck and pick me up at eight
cause we were built for the longhaul freight train
burnt by fire without trial like a stowaway

prechorus
and dont say youre over me
when they all know that you aint
if you lay down lie next to me

chorus
dance me all around the room
spin me like a ballerina super high
dance me all around the moon
like six times til im sick and i cry
once twice three times the guy i
ever thought i would meet so
dont say youre over me
when they all know that youre lying

postchorus
if you lie down lie next to me
lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
you lie you lie
if you lie down lie next to me
lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie lie
you lie you lie
when you lie down lie next to me
