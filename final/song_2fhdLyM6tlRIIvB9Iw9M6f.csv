that magic voodoo doll is making me think crazy shit
well baby im a rockandroller i dont know what you want from me
oh but if we get to dancing tonight you may never want to leave
lets not make this harder than it really needs to be
my hearts unlocked and i dont know girl how i lost the key
you got to get away away from me
i got to get away away from you before we fall in love
before we fall in love before we fall in love before we fall in love
bbbbbefore we fall in love
i aint never been the type of boy to live my life without some risk
but im no fool â€˜cause i know damn well whatll happen baby if we kiss
my mind keeps saying no but my bodys screaming yes
and if we dont stop right now girl we know whats coming next
lets not make this harder than it really needs to be
my hearts unlocked and i dont know girl how i lost the key
you got to get away away from me
i got to get away away from you before we fall in love
before we fall in love before we fall in love before we fall in love
bbbbbefore we fall in love
lala lalala lalala bbbefore we fall in love
lala lalala lalala oh before we fall in love
lala lalala lalala
lala lalala lalala
