how many nights do you lie dreaming
im counting the days since you went away
when i lost my heart life lost all meaning
what i would give to see you again

chorus
ill pray for you
do you pray for me
ill pray for you

verse 2
and you slipped away from me without talking
the look in your eye was stronger than this
and i drink alone to stop me from weeping
whats left of my heart is forever yours
forever yours

chorus
ill pray for you
do you pray for me
ill pray for you

outro
