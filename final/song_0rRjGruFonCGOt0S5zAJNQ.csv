when i was young and stupid my love
left to be a rock and roll star
he told me please dont worry
wise little smile that spoke so safely
he booked a oneway ticket
out west thats where they make it
six kids stuck in a bedsit
to sunswept poolside riches

verse 2
he met a girl who wore versace
pink feather coats and jumbo jewellery​
gonna be a hoop phenomenon
hes gonna be hakeem olajuwon
hes got a gold camaro
he said over the payphone
i try to keep my cool but
my life turns in slow motion

chorus
byebye baby blue
i wish you could see the wicked truth
caught up in a rush its killing you
screaming at the sun you blow into
curled up in a grip when we were us
fingers in a fist like you might run
i settle for a ghost i never knew
super paradise i held on to
but i settle for a ghost

where i was from in nola no one
left to be a rock and roll star
hed stay and treat his lady
give everything to his new baby
i miss him dont you blame me
that boy went stone cold crazy
caught up in camera lust hes
chasing that pappy pipe dream

bridge
ooh ooh
i know you dont but i—
i know you dont but i still try
my thunder shook him down
my thunder came and shook him down
that girl is gone but i—
that girl is gone but i still try
i think its over now
the bullet hit but maybe not
i feel so fucking numb
it hits my head and i feel numb
my bodys looking wrong
my bodys looking wrong
my bodys looking wrong
chorus
byebye baby blue
i wish you could see the wicked truth
caught up in a rush its killing you
screaming at the sun you blow into
curled up in a grip when we were us
fingers in a fist like you might run
i settle for a ghost i never knew
super paradise i held on to
but i settle for a ghost53embed"
