yung germ

verse 1
feared it was a dog from the sight of the tracks
took a little walk and he never came back
we will find your son told his mom to relax
he would never go nowhere without his baseball bat
found his body layin on the side of the creek
with a backpack on and a note near his feet it said
everything will end eventually
every leaf will blow into the wind eventually
and i swear that night i saw him in my sleep
a shadow that floats right above me
i cant scream and i cant shout
and i cant breathe i cant scream out
and i swear that night i saw him in my sleep
a shadow that floats right above me
i cant scream and i cant shout
and i cant breathe and i cant see

chorus
ill see you in space cowboy
ill see you in space cowboy
ill see you in space cowboy
ill see you in space cowboy
and all dogs go to heaven
and all dogs go to heaven
and all dogs go to heaven
and all dogs go to heaven

feared it was a dog from the sight of the tracks
took a little walk and he never came back
had the sig sauer with one in the mag
and a book full of notes in a small backpack
walked in the woods dropped a note to be read
took out his gun put one in his head
blood in the sky and the leaves turned red
and the deers run away while the children in bed
cause nobody cared when he was breathin
he thought he was livin for no reason cause nobody cared for him
nobody cared if he was eatin
lived all his life through readin cause nobody was there for him
and i guess youre part of the problem too
and i hope that it all swallows you
and now im part of the problem jeez
and every night it starts to bother me
