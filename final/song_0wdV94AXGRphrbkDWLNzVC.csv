broadway is black like a sinkhole
everyone raced to the suburbs
and im on the rooftop with curious strangers
this is the oddest of summers
maybe ill medicate maybe inebriate
strange situations i get anxious
maybe ill smile a bit maybe the opposite
but pray that they dont call me thankless

prechorus
my telltale hearts a hammer in my chest
cut me a silk tie tourniquet

chorus
this is my roaring roaring 20s
i dont even know me
roll me like a blunt cause i wanna go home
roll me like a blunt cause i wanna go home
my roaring roaring 20s
i dont even know me
roll me like a blunt cause i wanna go home
roll me like a blunt cause i want i wanna go home

verse 2
oscars and emmys and grammys
everyone here is a trophy
and im sipping bourbon
the futures uncertain
the past on the pavement below me
maybe ill elevate maybe im second rate
so unaware of my status
maybe im overjoyed maybe im paranoid
designer me up in straight jackets

chorus
this is my roaring roaring 20s
i dont even know me
roll me like a blunt cause i wanna go home
roll me like a blunt cause i wanna go home
my roaring roaring 20s
i dont even know me
roll me like a blunt cause i wanna go home
roll me like a blunt cause i want i wanna go home

bridge
hallucinations only mean that your brain is on fire
if its lord of the flies in my mind tonight
i dont know if i will survive
lighters up if youre feeling me
fade to black if youre not mine
cause i just need a sign or a signal inside

chorus
this is my roaring roaring 20s
i dont even know me
roll me a blunt cause i wanna go home
roll me a roll me a blunt
this is my roaring roaring 20s
i dont even know me
roll me like a blunt cause i wanna go home
roll me like a blunt cause i want i wanna go home
