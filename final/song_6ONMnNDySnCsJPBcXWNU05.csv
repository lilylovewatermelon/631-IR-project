hold my hand
while you cut me down
itd only just begun
but now its over now
and youre in the heat of moments
with your heart playing up cold
im between the middle
watching hastiness unfold
on my eyes
you were smiling in the spotlight
dancing with the night
the night fell off your mind

chorus
im tired of trying
your teasing aint enough
fed up of biding your time
when i dont get nothing back
and for what and for what and for what
when i dont get nothing back
boy im tired

verse 2
whered you go
when you stay behind
i looked up and inside down
and outside only to find
a double taking punching hard
and laughing at my smile
i get closer
you obviously prefer her

im tired of trying
your teasing aint enough
fed up of biding your time
when i dont get nothing back
and for what and for what and for what
when i dont get nothing back
boy im tired of trying
your teasing aint enough
fed up of biding your time
when i dont get nothing back
and for what and for what and for what
when i dont get nothing back
hey im tired

bridge
i should have known

verse 3
never mind
said your open arms
i couldnt help believe
it tricked me back into them

chorus
even though im tired of trying
your teasing aint enough
fed up of biding your time
when i dont get nothing back
and for what and for what and for what
when i dont get nothing back
boy im tired of trying
your teasing aint enough
fed up of biding your time
when i dont get nothing back
and for what and for what and for what
when i dont get nothing back
boy im tired7embed"
