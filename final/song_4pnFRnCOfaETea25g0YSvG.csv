verse 1 jayz
motherfuckers wanna act loco
hit em up numerous shots with the fofo
faggots wanna talk to popos smoke em like coco
fuck rap coke by the boatload
fuck that on the runby gun high one eye closed
left holes through some guy clothes
stop your bullshit glock with the full clip
motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
one shot could make a nigga do a full flip
see the nigga layin shocked when the fool hit
hey ma how you know niggas wanna buy you
but see me i wanna fuck for free like akinyele
take this ride make you feel it inside your belly
if its tight get the ky jelly
all night get you wide up inside the telly
side to side til you say jayz youre too much for me
you might also likeverse 2 mike shinoda
i am a little bit of loneliness a little bit of disregard
handful of complaints but i cant help the fact
that everyone can see these scars
i am what i want you to want what i want you to feel
but its like no matter what i do i cant convince you
to just believe this is real

prechorus mike shinoda
so i let go watching you
turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that im not
ill be here cause youre all that ive got

verse 3 jayz
woo woo uh
got a condo with nothin but condoms in it
the same place where the rhymes is invented
so all i do is rap and sex
imagine how i stroke see how i was flowin on my last cassette
rapidfire like im blastin a tec never jam though
never get hot never run out of ammo
niggas hatin and shit cause i slayed your bitch
you know your favorite i know it made you sick
and now youre actin raw but you never had war
dont know how to carry your hoes wanna marry your ho
now shes mad at me cause your majesty
just happened to be a pimpâ€”what a tragedy
she want us to end cause i fucked her friend
she gave me one more chance and i fucked her again
i seen her tears as she busted in
i said shit theres a draft shut the door bitch and come on in
verse 4 mike shinoda
i am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
cause you dont understand i do what i can
but sometimes i dont make sense
i am what you never wanna say
but ive never had a doubt
its like no matter what i do i cant convince you
for once just to hear me out

prechorus mike shinoda
so i let go watching you
turn your back like you always do
face away and pretend that im not
and ill be here cause youre all that ive got
