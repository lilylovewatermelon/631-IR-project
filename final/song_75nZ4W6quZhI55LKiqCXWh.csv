driving through west virginia
and i’ve seldom been thinner
with that chip on my shoulder
and this past year i got so much older

verse 2
lookin’ back over my life
spent the most of it tongue tied
i wish i’d had more time
listenin’ to you speak your mind

chorus
now i’m thinkin’ about her everyday
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force
thinkin’ about her everyday
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force

banjo interlude

verse 3
drinkin’ coffee black as iron
and i couldn’t be much higher
without fallin’ out of my chair
been so numb for so many years
you might also likechorus
now i’m thinkin’ about her everyday
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force
thinking about her everyday
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force

bridge
and its so easy
to be blinded by the light
to feel lonely in the night
this blowing in the breeze babe
i got dust in my eyes
and rust in my mind
ill be home come next spring
wont you say you love me later by and by

verse 4
looking back over life
spent the most of it tongue tied
pullin’ my belt tight
just me and the stars tonight

verse 5
two fingers and a tight line
keep my head above the alpine
just wish id spent more time
listenin’ to her speak her mind
chorus
thinking about her everyday
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force
thinking about her everyday
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force
thinking about her everyday
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force
thinking about her everyday
on my mind atypical way
are you a life force
