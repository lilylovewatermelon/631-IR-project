this may be the last sunset ill see
so ill take it in ill take it in
this may be the last air that ill breathe
so ill breathe it in ill breathe it in

verse 1 nf
i heard that pictures dont change
just the people inside of em do
whoever told you that life would be easy
i promise that person was lyin to you
you got a problem with followin through
thats why i got a problem with followin you
you keep lookin at me like this problem is new
but weve been here before what you tryin to do
dont talk to me like i dont know what youre feeling
cause i was there with you back in the beginning
quit looking away when i talk let me finish
im tryna be honest youre tryna forget me ugh
whats wrong with you hey
i know that you got a lot on your plate
you keep telling me i should get out of your way
but i cant see how you gon lie to my face
dont tell me youre fine
cause i know youre not so dont even try it
and what we gon live in this life full of pain
til were eighty and when well get up and say we regretted our lives
cause thats where were going
and do not pretend like you dont even notice
the funny thing is that you already know it
im starting to think that you like how it feels to be lost in the moment

lost lost in the moment
lost in the moment lost in the moment
and get lost lost in the moment

verse 2 nf
yeah they told us that time flies didnt know what it means
now i feel like were just running around tryna
catch it and hoping to cut off its wings
but that aint gon happen
joy when was the last time we had it
i dont remember cause all that we do
is go backwards but thats what you get
when you live in the past
and i know were breathing but were not alive
really is this the way we wanna die
til you got everything bottled inside
if they only knew what goes on in our minds
i know what youre thinking so dont try to hide
why do you look at me like you surprised
if you really mean what you write in these lines
then why dont you fix it cause im getting tired
yeah i can no longer do this
ever since you fell in love with the music
see you find a way to express what you feel
but the moment that you get away from the mic you dont know what youre doing
is it clear to you yet
i dont know whats going on in your head
but eventually youll have to deal with the things
that you talk about yeah but i guess until then were lost
chorus andreas moss
lost lost in the moment
lost in the moment lost in the moment
and get lost lost in the moment
lost in the moment lost in the moment

this may be the last sunset ill see
so ill take it in ill take it in
this may be the last air that ill breathe
so ill breathe it in ill breathe it in42embed"
