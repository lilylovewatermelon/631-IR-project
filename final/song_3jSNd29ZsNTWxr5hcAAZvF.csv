doesnt come down when she calls
its time for breakfast
momma cant get down those halls
fast enough to see
glass is sprayed across the floor
from the broken window
she cant breathe anymore
cant deny what we know

prechorus
theyre gonna find you just believe
theyre gonna find you just believe
youre not a person
youre not a person youre a disease

chorus
all these lives that youve been taking
deep inside my heart is breaking
broken homes from separation
dont you know its violation
its so wrong but youll see
never gonna let you take my world from me
the world outside these walls may know youre breathing
but you aint coming in
but you aint coming in

posters hung on building walls
of missing faces
months go by without the calls
no clues or traces

prechorus
theyre gonna find you just believe
theyre gonna find you just believe
youre not a person
youre not a person youre a disease

chorus
all these lives that youve been taking
deep inside my heart is breaking
broken homes from separation
dont you know its violation
its so wrong but youll see
never gonna let you take my world from me
the world outside these walls may know youre breathing
but you aint coming in
but you aint coming in

bridge
shed the light on all the ones who never thought they would become
a father mother asking why this world can be so cold
verse 3
doesnt come down when she calls
its time for breakfast
the memories begin to fall
she asks when will i be free

chorus
all these lives that youve been taking
deep inside my heart is breaking
broken homes from separation
dont you know its violation
its so wrong but youll see
never gonna let you take my world from me
the world outside these walls may know youre breathing
but you aint coming in

outro
all these lives that youve been taking deep inside my heart is breaking
all these lives that youve been taking deep inside my heart is breaking
all these lives that youve been taking deep inside my heart is breaking
the world outside these walls may know youre breathing
the world outside these walls may know youre breathing
but you aint coming in3embed"
