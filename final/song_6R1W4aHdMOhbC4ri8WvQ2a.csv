i wanna wake up in your arms i wanna set off your alarm
i wanna break into your car and i wanna take out the backseat
the one where you told me everything i thought id always wanted to hear
the one where you told me that its over

prechorus
and every time you look in your rearview mirror
i hope you see me
and all the stuff we did when we were back there together uh huh

chorus
i hope you like your twoseater no radio
key marks parallel to the pinstripes
windows broken your ttops stolen now its one of a kind thanks for the ride

verse 2
i gotta get the hell out of dodge
i just spent the whole night avoiding the cops
and i just dont think ill go to the clink
just cause i took out the backseat
remember you told me everything
i thought i always wanted to hear
and thats where you told me that its over

prechorus
and every time you look in your rearview mirror
i hope you see me
and all the stuff we did when we were back there together uh huh

i hope you like your twoseater no radio
key marks parallel to the pinstripes
windows broken your ttops stolen
now its one of a kind thanks for the ride

bridge
can you hear your radio
i bet you cant hear your radio
so youll never know i wrote this song for you
sorry that your tires are flat
no you really werent expecting that
i guess i got a little carried away
so when you look in your rearview mirror
i hope you see me there

chorus
i hope you like your twoseater no radio
key marks parallel to the pinstripes
windows broken your ttops stolen
now its one of a kind thanks for the ride

outro
no radio
twoseater
no radio
thanks for the ride
twoseater thanks for the ride
twoseater thanks for the rideembed"
