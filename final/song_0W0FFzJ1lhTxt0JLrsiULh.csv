love is nice when its understood
even nicer when it makes you feel good
you got me trippin why our love is old
come on baby let the good times roll
come on baby let the good times roll
come on baby let the good times roll
come on baby let the good times roll
come on baby let the good times roll

verse 1
its like woodstock city brand new villain
and bark to the music sucker than a psychic
my heart beat acoustic moves like hendrix
walk to a fire then i flame and kiss it
go hard in my lambo strikes and a visit
to meeting in the rain gotta roll with the vision
vision of a good time all i wanna know
when the party gonna stop let the good times roll
come on lets go you got another minute
get the party on the roll aint nothing like the feeling
when youre winning in your soul
the wheel keep spinning only got one love
stop stop the show and stop stop the flow
the world aint ready cause i rock the globe
so act like you know act like you know
act like you know just what to do
when the good times roll

verse 2
roll is on everybody come to get the taste of the bomb
feeling wild shopper when youre bad to the bone
gotta be the hottest when you shine like chrome
gotta find that tone has a mind of its own
love while im supposed to look around and its gone
love while im supposed to up hold it down for this crown
just like her im already gone
let the good times go
all i wanna lock lock up in this drop top
pull up in the chevy so classy and hot hot
pockets full and heavy got you screaming what you got got
what you tryna say i know i already rock rock
gotta let go pedal to the floor
so incredible so much better with the flow
ready for the show like im singing hey yo
do it like a pro let the good times roll roll roll roll
bridge
and lets go all night all night
wake up the club and lets go all out all out
more drinks for us toast for the good times
where they last forever were youngs yeah the good times
raise your glass lets all have some fun

chorus
love is nice when its understood
even nicer when it makes you feel good
