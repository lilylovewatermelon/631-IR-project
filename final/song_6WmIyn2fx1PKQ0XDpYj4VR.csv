were fucking in a car shooting heroin
saying controversial things just for the hell of it
selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
start with misdemeanours and well make a business out of them
and we can find out the information
access all the applications
that are hardening positions based on miscommunication
oh fuck your feelings
truth is only hearsay
were just left to decay
modernity has failed us

chorus
and id love it if we made it
yes id love it if we made it
yes id love it if we made it
yes id love it if we made it

verse 2
and poison me daddy
i got the jones right through my bones
write it on a piece of stone
a beach of drowning threeyearolds
rest in peace lil peep
the poetry is in the streets
jesus save us
modernity has failed us

and id love it if we made it
yes id love it if we made it
yes id love it if we made it
yes id love it if we made it
and id love it if we made it
and id love it if we made it
and id love it if we made it
id love it if we made it
tell me something i didnt know
bridge
consultation
degradation
fossil fueling
masturbation
immigration
liberal kitsch
kneeling on a pitch

verse 3
i moved on her like a bitch
excited to be indicted
unrequited house with seven pools
thank you kanye very cool
the war has been incited
and guess what youre all invited
and youre famous
modernity has failed us
outro
and id love it if we made it
and id love it if we made it
and id love it if we made it
tell me something i didnt know
and id love it if we made it
and id love it if we made it
and id love it if we made it
and id love it if we made it129embed"
