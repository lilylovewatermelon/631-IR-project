i think i started something
i got what i wanted
diddidnt i cant feel nothing superhuman
even when im fucking viagra popping
every single record autotuning
zero emotion muted emotion
pitch corrected computed emotion uhhuh
i blame it on the model broad with the hollywood smile ow
stripper booty and a rack like wow
brain like berkeley
met her at coachella
i went to see jigga she went to see z trip perfect
i took a seat on the ice cold lawn
she handed me a ice blue bong whatever
she said she wanna be a dentist really badly
shes in school paying
for tuition doing porn in the valley
at least you workin
but girl i cant feel my face
what are we smoking anyway
she said dont let the high go to waste
but can you taste a little taste

chorus
novacane baby baby
novacane baby i want you
fuck me good fuck me long fuck me numb
love me now when im gone love me none
love me none love me none
numb numb numb numb

sink full of dishes pacin in the kitchen
cocaine for breakfast yikes
bed full of women flip on a tripod
little red light on shootin
im feelin like stanley kubrick
this is some visionary shit
been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut
but it keeps on movin
i blame it on the model broad with the hollywood smile
stripper booty with a rack like wow
ill never forget ya
you put me on a feelin i never had
never had never had never
and ever since ive been tryna get it back
and pick it up and put it back
now im something like the chemist on campus
but theres no drug around
quite like what i found in you you
i still cant feel my face
what am i smokin anyway ahh
she said dont let the high go to waste ooh
but can you taste a little taste

chorus
novacane baby baby ohh
novacane baby i want you
fuck me good fuck me long fuck me numb
love me now when im gone love me none
love me none love me none
numb numb numb numb
bridge

pretty girls involved with me
making pretty love to me pretty

making pretty love to me pretty
