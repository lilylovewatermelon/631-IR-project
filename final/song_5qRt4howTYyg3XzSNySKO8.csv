all my friends are gone i dont blame them
i guess id move on do the same thing
so i wrote a song to be my lullaby
sing me to sleep at night open my third eye

prechorus
im not gon lie to you i miss you so much
tell me what i did wrong to lose touch
im not gon lie to you this has been a hard year
how i wish that you were here

chorus
i just need to let it go waitin on a miracle
guess thats just the way it goes easy come easy go
i just need to let it go turn it down and lay low
its just the way it goes easy come easy go

verse 2
sometimes i drive a little too fast
think im runnin from demons of my past
so i wrote a song to help me slow down
keep my mind straight but its a bit late

prechorus
im not gon lie to you i miss you so much
tell me what i did wrong to lose touch
im not gon lie to you this has been a hard year
how i wish that you were here

remember when you got sick cancer of the bone
everyone in school while youre sittin at home
in your wheelchair of grief find no relief
we were there for the ups and downs and there for the constant rounds of chemo
yeah you know that you are our hero
you were there when i was a zero
and i swear ill make things right before the long night
swear ill make things right tomorrow
but as for tonight
