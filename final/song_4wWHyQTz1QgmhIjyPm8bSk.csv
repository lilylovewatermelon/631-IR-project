verse 1  nas
ladies love what i been through blood on my tim boots
snub noses club closes down when my men shoot
but she cant stand im sharing everything wit the fam
that means them too flat screen benz coupe
plus i entertain bosses
at my spanish style lagerfeld furnished up fortress
but look at ms thang in alexander mcqueens
giuseppe zanottis the sexiest bodies
and i betcha she prolly heard how i love em and leave em
but she still wanna suck em and eat em
cause im a poet a preacher and a pimp wit words
a thief who stole her heart a prince she deserves

kelis

eyeing passes by like your rich but life aint fair but ya
