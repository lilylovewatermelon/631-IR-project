everybodys got their problems
everybody says the same things to you
its just a matter how you solve them
and knowing how to change the things youve been through
i feel ive come to realize
how fast life can be compromised
step back to see whats going on
i cant believe this happened to you
this happened to you

verse 2
its just a problem that im faced with am i
not the only one who hates to stand by
complications that are first in this line
with all these pictures running through my mind
knowing endless consequences
i feel so useless in this
get back step back and as for me
i cant believe

chorus
part of me wont agree
cause i dont know if its for sure
suddenly suddenly
i dont feel so insecure
part of me wont agree
cause i dont know if its for sure
suddenly suddenly
i dont feel so insecure anymore

verse 3
everybodys got their problems
everybody says the same things to you
its just a matter how you solve them
but what else are we supposed to do

chorus
part of me wont agree
cause i dont know if its for sure
suddenly suddenly
i dont feel so insecure
part of me wont agree
cause i dont know if its for sure
suddenly suddenly
i dont feel so insecure anymore

outro
why do things that matter the most
never end up being what we chose
now that i find no way so bad
i dont think i knew what i had
why do things that matter the most
never end up being what we chose
now that i find no way so bad
i dont think i knew what i had5embed"
