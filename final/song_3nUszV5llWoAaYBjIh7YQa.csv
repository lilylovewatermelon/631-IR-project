verse 1 travie mccoy
lately it seems the good dreams are few and far between
nightmares are putting fires out with gasoline damn
and im just tryin to stay righteous
sometimes i see my own face in christs likeness uhhuh yeah
and apart from my lifes vices
fifteen years young had my first midlife crisis uh uh wow
but its tough to stay upright and pious
when people you hold highest be the ones that most biased damn
my daddy told me misery loves company
if thats the case they must hate they aint getting none from me
i dont sweat it its embedded in my dna
i got a good heart and bad brains bma
