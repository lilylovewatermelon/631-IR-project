id be sittin in the same old bar
heart breakin on a broken barstool
wishin shed come runnin back runnin from the past
runnin up the tab drinkin for two
but that night my boys showed up
dragged me out on the town had to pick me up
id never know what i was missin if they didnt

chorus
cause id have never found you
at that random house party that i didnt even wanna go to
the way you move
had me first time feelin in a while i should make one too
sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
if id have never lost her
then id have never found you
no id have never found you never found you
never found you

verse 2
yeah i still go out sometimes
but i dont ever try to get that drunk
now when i cant sleep its cause youre all over me in the sheets
all night keepin me up
yeah its hard to believe that a goodbye could be
so good to me

at that random house party that i didnt even wanna go to

sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
if id have never lost her
then id have never found you
no id have never found you
mmm no id have never found you

bridge
and now im takin back the way i said i wish id never met her
sometimes the things that dont work out couldnt work out any better
id have never found you
no id have never found you

chorus
cause id have never found you
at that random house party that i didnt even wanna go to
the way you move
had me first time feelin in a while i should make one too
sometimes the finish line is just the start of something new
if id have never lost her
then id have never found you
no id have never found you
