a siren with gold eyes shell cut you with her kindness
she will lead you with her lies
shes been called a glistening devil
shes good at keeping score
if you make it shes your savior if you dont shes a whore
the roads to and from her heart are littered with grave souls
they gave all of their all and all they got in return is empty holes
sure weve all heard about shell and chris willy and bobby bares
shed smiled on the johnnys the merles and the music row millionaires
like a beacon she goes seeking seed her loins so fertile
to a free man shes a prison to a caged one shes a fire

shes the reason theres a sunday morning coming down
i saw the light a boy named sue he stopped loving her today
the pill and 16th avenue
the ryman oh shes a diamond in the crown of that wicked queen
she was roy acuffs castle and elvis presleys broken dream
its not all bad its not all dark its not all gloom and crass
but to find gold in this silver mine it does take balls of brass
for shes seen em come and seen em go
and came herself a time or two
no matter how satisfied her screams sound she always wants someone new
the next him or them or her or all with stamina to last the night
to be a star in this ladys town you can fuck or you can fight
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likeyou see it all comes down to money
not romantic art of days gone past
if you forget that rule you can bet your backside she will bury it in your ass
a tramp a slut a bitch a mutt a thousand pawn shop guitars
a nasty little needle to a vein that feeds a singers heart
she lurks in friendly shadows but shes a junky with a limp
the agents are her bookie and the labels are her pimp
ill tell you a wellknown secret of a tiny place known far and wide
the devil walks among us folks and nashville is his bride

of all the chaos he has caused and done
his greatest trick is to every guitartotin dreamer
the devil dont exist but me i shook his hand
and i know that he is real
so devil you can go screw yourself and then go straight to hellembed"
