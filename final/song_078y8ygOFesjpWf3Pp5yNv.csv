im sorry that your dad is dead
i hope you amend it
i think ive lost a lot of my friends
through belief that im an instrument
well fuck me if you must then
treat me like an old friend
i cant exist within my own head
so i insist on haunting your bed
if you could only hear what i said
youd see
chorus
im not scared anymore no
im not scared
im not scared
im not scared
im not scared
im not scared

verse 2
spin car round push your head down down down
and smash into the ground with you
theres been a piece of glass found and a terrible sound sound
what if what theyre saying is true
oh i prefer it in your bed television set
