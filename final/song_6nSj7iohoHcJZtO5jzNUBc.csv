verse 2 william
feel the vibration of the bass charm
put your head on the speaker get your face blown
get up on the floor get your dance on
coz your backbones connected to your ass go on
the ladies all dressed in high fashion hot
dancing all sexy with passion
honey if you dont mind me asking
can you feel all that bass in that ass uh
