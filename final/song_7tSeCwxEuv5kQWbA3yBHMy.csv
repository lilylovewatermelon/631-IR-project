dont waste your time it will never work
dont try and fight it only makes it worse
and i will never be the one you can defeat
believe in me cause i was born to lead

verse 1
im on your side dont ever believe
or let anybody tell you you cannot achieve your dreams
what are you fighting for
let down your guard lift up your arms
salute to the sky and be thankful youre here
the man in the mirrors the one that you fear the most
and just like a ghost you must keep the faith
you must not lose your hope

prechorus
to be the last one standing up
and when that day comes theyll know what youre about

chorus
dont waste your time cause it will never work
dont try and fight it only makes it worse
and i will never be the one you can defeat
believe in me cause i was born to lead

ive got your back so fuck what they say
the hate that they show should enable your strength to stay
stand up and fight
rise from the ashes open your eyes and fight
fuck the ones that are holding you down
open your eyes you are wearing the crown
you are the reason they even exist
so put up your fist the power is in you now

prechorus
to be the last one standing up
and when that day comes theyll know what youre about

chorus
dont waste your time cause it will never work
dont try and fight it only makes it worse
and i will never be the one you can defeat
believe in me cause i was born to lead
