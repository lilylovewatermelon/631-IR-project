poolside convo about your summer last night ooh yeah
about your summer last night
aint give you no play mmm
could i make you shive last night
could i make you shy on the last night last night
could we make it in do we have time

verse 1 frank ocean
ill be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
noses on a rail little virgin wears the white
you cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life
wish i was there wish wed grown up on the same advice
and our time was right

chorus austin feinstein
keep a place for me for me
ill sleep between yall its nothing
its nothing its nothing
keep a place for me for me

verse 2 frank ocean
now and then you miss it sounds make you cry
some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
i came to visage cause you see me like a ufo
thats like never cause i made you use your selfcontrol
and you made me lose my selfcontrol my selfcontrol
