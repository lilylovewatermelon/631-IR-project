every morning when you come downstairs
hairs a mess but i dont care
no makeup on and shining so bright
my old sweatshirt never fit so right
dancing around to the radio
humming the words that you dont know
cross out finding an angel off my list
thinking that it dont get no better than this

chorus
you make loving you easy
you make loving you all i wanna do
every little smile and every single touch
reminds me just how much it all makes
loving you easy

verse 2
wrapped around me late at night
pillow talk by candle light
gonna slow this down and make it last
the best things fly by us so fast

chorus
you make loving you easy
you make loving you all i wanna do
every little smile and every single touch
reminds me just how much it all makes
see zac brown band liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likebridge
oh i wanna sing it again

chorus
you make loving you easy
you make loving you all i wanna do
every little smile and every single touch
reminds me just how much it all makes
loving you easy
