music reality sometimes its hard to tell the difference
but we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids

verse 1 eminem
if i were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
would you feel sorrow show love or would it matter
could never be the leadoff batter
if there aint shit for me to feed off im seesaw battlin
but theres way too much at stake for me to be fake
theres too much on my plate
i done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
and not say what i got to say
what the fuck you take me for a joke you smokin crack
fore i do that id beg mariah to take me back
ill get up fore i get down run myself in the ground
fore i put some wack shit out
im tryna smack this one out the park fivethousand mark
yall steady tryna drown a shark
aint gon do nothin but piss me off
lid to the can of whipass just twist me off
see me leap out pull a piece out
fuck shootin im just tryna knock his teeth out
fuck with me now bitch lets see you freestyle
talk is cheap
motherfucker if you really feelin froggish leap
yo slim you gon let him get away with that
he tried to play you you cant let him escape with that
man i hate this crap
this aint rap this is crazy the way we act
when we confuse hiphop with real life when the music stops
you might also likeverse 2 swifty mcvay
aint no gettin rid of mcvay if so you wouldve tried
the only way im leavin this bitch is suicide
i have died clinically
arrived back at my enemys crib with hennessy
got drunk then i finished him
im every niggas favorite archenemy
physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
i spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently
im not what you think
i appear to be fucked up mentally endangered
i cant stay away from a razor
i just want my face in a paper
i wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres bah
ill murder you i gauge and have me turn into
a mad man son of sam bitch im surgical
im allergic to dyin you think not
you got balls we can see how large when the music stops

verse 3 kon artis
i was happy havin a deal at first
thought money would make me happy
but it only made my pain worse
it hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg
and you aint got nothin left but your word and your balls
and youre stressed from the calls of your new friends
beggin with their hands out
checkin for your record when its sellin
when it aint thats the end no laughs no friends
no girls just the gin you drink til your car spin
you think damn when you slam into the wall and you fall
out the car and try to crawl with one arm
im bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
if my funerals tomorrow wonder would they even call
when the music stops
verse 4 kuniva
lets see how many of your men loyal
when i pull up lookin for you with a pistol sippin a can of pennzoil
im revved up who said what when lead bust
your head just explode with red stuff
im handcuffed tossed in the paddywagon
braggin about how you shouted like a coward
bullets devoured you showered you niggas
if i was you niggas id run while given a chance
understand i can enhance the spirit of man
death itself it cant hurt me
just the thought of dyin alone that really irks me
you aint worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
be smart and stop tryna walk how gs walk before we spark
hug the floor while we playin tugofwar wit your life
fuck a tour and a mic id rather fuck a whore with a knife ah
deliver that shit that coroners like
you hype poppin shit in broad daylight nigga youre a goner at night
when the music stops

verse 5 proof
instigators turn pits in cages
let loose and bit the neighbors wrist to razors
yall dont want war yall want talk
in the dark my dogs all bark like woof
proof nigga im a wolf
get your whole roof caved in like reindeer hooves
stomp the booth shake the floor tiles loose
the more yall breathe shit the more i moves
its hill street this is hardcore blues
put a gun to rap check in all our dues nigga
or make the news bet you all yall move
when the uzi pop you better drop when the music stop
verse 6 bizarre
music has changed my life in so many ways
brains confused been fucked since the 5th grade
ll told me to rock the bells
nwa said fuck tha police now im in jail
93 was strictly rb
fucked up haircut listened to jodeci
michael jackson who gon tell me i aint mike
ass cheeks painted white fuckin priscilla tonight
flyin down sunset smokin crack
transvestite in the front eddie murphy in the back
mop had me grimy and gritty
marilyn manson i dyed my hair blue and grew some titties
ludacris told me to throw them bows
now im in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
voices in my head im goin in shock
im reachin for the glock but the music stops85embed"
