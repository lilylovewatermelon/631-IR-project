i know i saw you singin
but my ears wont stop ringin
long enough to hear those sweet words
what did you say

end of the day
the hour hand has spun
but before the night is done
i just have to hear those sweet words
spoken like a melody

all your love is a lost balloon
rising up through the afternoon
till it could fit on the head of a pin

come on in did you have a hard time sleeping
cause the heavy moon was keepin me awake
and all i know is im just glad to see you again

see my love like a lost balloon
rising up through the afternoon
and then you appeared

what did you say
i know what you were singing
but my ears wont stop ringing
long enough to hear those sweet words
and your simple melody
