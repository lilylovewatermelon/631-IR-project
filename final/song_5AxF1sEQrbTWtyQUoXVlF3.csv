its hard to believe weve made it this far
so come on boys and grab your coats
detroits waitin so get in the car

well the wind it blows cold but the girls are on fire
they say theyre the prettiest things you have seen
and i aint a gambler but id bet the farm
that detroits a gold mine waiting for me

the sidewalks are always jammed in this town
i feel like a dam thats about to cut loose
and the girls they say will treat you fine
beg for your silver til you cant refuse

and id love to go back to the hills where i was born
instead of workin on cars that i cant afford
my pockets are empty my patience is torn
oh look whats become of me

mama im writin to tell you im fine
im workin real hard and i pray every night
so dont you worry im happy and free
detroits been like a blessing to mesee tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeembed"
