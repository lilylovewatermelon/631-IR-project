i want to be the boy to warm your mothers heart
im so scared to take you away
i tried to win her over right from the start
but something always got in the way
weve been sitting in your backyard for hours
but she wont even come out and say hi
while my mother baked a little cake for you
and even dreaded when you said goodbye

chorus
what kind of cartwheels do i have to pull
what kind of joke should i lay on her now
im inclined to go finish high school
just to make her notice that im around

verse 2
well nothing i come up with seems to work
it feels like everything i say is a lie
and never have i felt like such a jerk
im afraid to even open my eyes
because i really dont want her to judge me
i want her to really know who i am
and then and only then will she love me
well at least that was the plan
if ever a boy needed a holiday
if ever a girl needed someone to hold
i just hope i dont act the same way
by the time that i get that old

what kind of cartwheels do i have to pull
what kind of joke should i lay on her now
im inclined to go finish high school
just to make her notice that im around

outro
i never said i was an heir to a fortune
i never claimed to have any looks
but these kind of things must be important
cause somebody ripped out my page in your telephone book
i want to warm her heart3embed"
