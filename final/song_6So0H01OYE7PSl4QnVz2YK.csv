i said i dont want love
but you just wont give up
dont wanna waste my time
on a feeling but youre not listening

chorus
show me what youre made of cause im squaring up
you may be fighting dirty but im not giving up
i know that you want to break my heart of stone
you sure are good looking but ill be going home alone tonight

verse 2
i said this dont feel right
you said im just the type
to change my mind ten hundred times
almost took you home just to prove you wrong

chorus
show me what youre made of cause im squaring up
you may be fighting dirty but im not giving up
i know that you want to break my heart of stone
you sure are good looking but ill be going home alone

show me what youre made of cause im squaring up
you may be fighting dirty but im not giving up
i know that you want to break my heart of stone
you sure are good looking but ill be going home alone tonight
