i think we should be together
if you agree show me a sign

girl you opened up my eyes

you opened up my eyes
to the other side of love
ive been waiting all my life
could she be the one for me for me

i know youve got another
but baby he dont do you right
i can be your secret lover
stare at you all through the night
all im asking girl is try me
come with me ill change your life
