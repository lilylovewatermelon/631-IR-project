come on a sexodus
come on a sexodus
come on a sexodus
come on a sexodus

verse 1
do you want to come on thi sexodus
if you got swag fuck with us
and do you wanna ride like a crusader
me im not a christian girl
my blood type is no negative
but im positive that im too deep
switch the light on when we hit the sheets
truly what i see is all i keep
i see you stacked chicks their views are blocked in
when i help em you say you broke in
i see you locked in you say i dont let you in
how come all this drama still trending

hook
baby you can have it all
tell me what for
baby you can have it all
tell me what for

new frontier i got news from there
lets sell it to a new frequency
i left the graveyard selling full of fancy
bring your homie with transparency
my blood type is no negative
but im positive the dark aint deep
just switch your light on when we hit the streets
truly what i see is all i keep
my sights are set in higher times
and my eyes can see in 3d
make it bright and i see 360
i can get you but you cant get me

hook
baby you can have it all
tell me what for
baby you can have it all
tell me what for

yeah you keep on telling me you wanna have it all

verse 3
cash and kashmir gold in zier
i got a new one from over there
you can drink a mint tea by the red sea
as youre living out whose fantasy
yeah the sun the moon are both
hitting the hood and the heats too hot to be cool
yeah im sailing my bed to a better man school
and its two in the afternoon
we already bulletproof we got a big crew
and were running on a force thats true
we dont fear you wear uptodate shoes
or fall for the point of view

hook
baby you can have it all
tell me what for
baby you can have it all
tell me what for

hook 2
