this…is…my…re…venge

i’m a little tease
watch what i do
here’s a little taste
of how it’s gonna be from now on

yo fuck me and my friends
my friends and me
never special enough
to make a case for jealousy
plus the secret sauce
i’m gothalicious with cheese
and all the gay things i say
make such a pretty melody
you might also likenow i’m gonna say all those bad things about you
intimate things so everyone hates you

this…is…my…re…venge

i’m a little tease
watch what i do
here’s a little taste
of how it’s gonna be from now on

yo fuck me and my friends
my friends and me
never special enough
to make a case for jealousy
plus the secret sauce
i’m gothalicious with cheese
and all the gay things i say
make such a pretty melody

now i’m gonna say all those bad things about you
intimate things so everyone hates you

this…is…my…re…venge

i’m a little tease
watch what i do
here’s a little taste
of how it’s gonna be from now on
