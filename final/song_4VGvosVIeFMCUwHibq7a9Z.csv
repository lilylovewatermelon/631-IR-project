listen to the beatles and the sound of laughing ed mcmahon
we got high
educated by a world so full of self and lost in space
too much pride
cosmonauts and dirty thoughts are juggling the juggernaut
soviet spy
every now and then when i remember to befriend
the little things in life

chorus
hey youre fine i wanna listen to the radio
driving down calexico highway
and now i know the signs for sure
hold my hand i want to share it all with mary
results are gonna vary now

verse 2
later on ill read to you the things that ive been needing
to say goodbye
walk away from mom and dad to find the love you never had
tell no lies
carry on and write a song that says it all and shows it off
fore you die
take a little breath before you catch an early death there is
so much sky
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus
hey youre fine i wanna listen to the radio
driving down calexico highway
and now i know the signs for sure
hold my hand i want to share it all with mary
results are gonna vary now

verse 3
skinny brains and little stains upon your face teenage remains
tell me more
lifted in the fifties when you really rather drifted through time
lets soar

chorus
hey youre fine i wanna listen to the radio
driving down calexico highway
and now i know the signs for sure for sure
hold my hand i want to share it all with mary
results are gonna vary now3embed"
