well this is just between us
but between us lets get high
in pictures i have seen her
and to see her is truly fine

chorus
shes on fire
shes on fire oohooh

verse 2
flowers in her evening set
i get the feeling she wont forget
and theres times youd long to be her
but to be her is surely blinding

chorus
shes on fire
shes on fire
shes on to me and now im over me
shes on fire oohooh

bridge
and if i could be inside her light
i would steal enough to make my way into the night
and if i could be inside her light
i might just find id be alright
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likeguitar solo

verse 3
well its not just a daydream
if you decide to make it your life your life
and this is not between us but between us
lets keep getting back to where its from

chorus
shes on fire
shes on fire
shes on to me and now im over me
shes on fire

outro
shes on to me and now im over me
shes over me and now im over her
shes on fire
shes on fire
shes on fire oohooh1embed"
