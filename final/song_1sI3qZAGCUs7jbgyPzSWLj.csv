the night has started here we go
ive taken everything
this is our time to lose control
what do you want from me
you line them up well put them down this is so frustrating
to watch you sleazing all around yet you keep on smiling

chorus
what can i do to make you see youre guilty
what can i do to make you feel youre wanted
what can i do to make you see youre guilty
im suffocating under words of sorrow

verse 2
her skin reflects behind the blur im intoxicated
where am i from why i am here youre so predictable
her fingers running through my hair but its all just fiction
she steps out from her underwear so beautiful

chorus
what can i do to make you see youre guilty
what can i do to make you feel youre wanted
what can i do to make you see youre guilty
im suffocating under words of sorrow

verse 3
theres bodies lying on the floor but i keep on staring
my world is over close the door
her skin reflects behind the blur im intoxicated
where am i from why i am here youre so predictable
her fingers running through my hair ive a new addiction
she steps out from her underwear so beautiful

chorus
what can i do to make you see youre guilty
what can i do to make you feel youre wanted
what can i do to make you see youre guilty
im suffocating under words of sorrow words of sorrow3embed"
