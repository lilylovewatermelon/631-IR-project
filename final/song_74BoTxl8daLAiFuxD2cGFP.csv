got a song song man
it goes like this

verse 1
somewhere the time was right
could have been gone in ten
this world is hard to fight
hitting you once hit it again
to know the way it feels
everyone gets knocked down
when you get up its real
by taking it back turn it around

chorus
get on it up on it
get on it—wouldnt wanna be you
get on it up on it
get on it—no ones gonna free you
you know when youre keeping it slow
no matter where you wanna go—wouldnt wanna be you
get on it up on it
its on—were living in chaos

verse 2
somewhere along the line
things get chipped away
this place keeps going down
gets a little worse every day
i see hate and greed
this worlds a messed up town
embrace the pain and see
by taking it back you turn it around
see the offspring liveget tickets as low as 56you might also likechorus
get on it up on it
get on it—wouldnt wanna be you
get on it up on it
get on it—no ones gonna free you
you know when youre keeping it slow
no matter where you wanna go—wouldnt wanna be you
get on it up on it
its on
