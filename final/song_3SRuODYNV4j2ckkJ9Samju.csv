i sure do hope this is a long night
cause i have never felt one so right
each look into your eyes im falling
a little more and more

prechorus
looks like we started us a fire
wrapped up in flames of desire
with every touch theyre burning higher
two shadows dancing on the wall

chorus
with nothing on but the radio
feel the music playing soft and slow
you and me and the lights down low
with nothing on but the radio

verse 2
well fall asleep here in the moonlight
in tangled sheets well be here all night
and when we wake up in the morning
we might stay like this all day

prechorus
two people meant to be together
two lovers dreaming of forever
and it just keeps on getting better
with every tender little kiss

nothing on but the radio
feel the music playing soft and slow
you and me and the lights down low
with nothing on but the radio

bridge
two people meant to be together
two lovers dreaming of forever
and it just keeps on getting better
with nothing on but the radio
feel the music playing soft and slow
you and me and the lights down low
with nothing on but the radio
you and me and the lights down low
with nothing on but the radioembed"
