as the years blow by baby
the more i come to know myself
the more it seems my love grows for you
and surely id be dead baby
had i gone with someone else
for this and more my loves owed to you

chorus
k anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
k settle down turn around and take this song and let it play

verse 2
got to know your heart baby
still so much for me to learn
and as i do my love stays with you
and surely id be dumb baby
had i made another turn
glad the turn that i made was you

chorus
k anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
k settle down turn around and take this song and let it play
k anytime it feels as though my love has gone away
k settle down turn around and take this song and let it playyou might also like2embed"
