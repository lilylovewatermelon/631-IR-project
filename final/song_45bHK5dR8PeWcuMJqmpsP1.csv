we met on a rainy evening in the summertime
dont think i need to tell you more
i needed a raise
i worked so hard for this love of mine love of mine
still i got nothing to show for it
heres a simplification of everything were going through
you plus me is bad news oh
but youre a lovely creation
i like to think that i am too ooh
but my friend said i look better without you yeah mm

prechorus
and tongue tied and twisted
go on baby and go to my head

chorus
babe baby believe me
if i stay it aint gonna be easy
okay well do it your way
but this is the last time
youll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down
love on the rocks

verse 2
you love the chase but hate me for the runaround
we both just tired of the whole thing tired of the whole thing
oh when you tell me what you want you need you know you have to have
and i just pretend im listening listening
you might also likeprechorus
too tired this time ah
to deal with old suits you wear with your ties that wont bind

chorus
babe baby believe me
if i stay it aint gonna be easy
okay well do it your way
but this is the last time
youll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down

bridge
hot as hell cold as ice sip it slow cause its so nice
dulls my senses drives my pain but i do it again
burns a bit to the touch dangerous if its too much ah
if this bottle could talk
love on the rocks

chorus
babe baby believe me
if i stay yeah
okay well do it your way ooh baby baby baby
believe me
youll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down
love on the rocks1embed"
