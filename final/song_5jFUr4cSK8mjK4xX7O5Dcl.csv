people
in the middle
lifes a riddle
not a game of dice
not for a man who rolls with us
days turn
faster than a minute
how was i to know this
would you even notice me
theyre imposters
we threw away the time

chorus
anagram
im just the messenger man
its the last
time around
one of these days i wished you were around
anagram
if were just passengers
then its the first
time around
one of these days i wished you were around

verse 2
all the people
in white stockings
talk with pride
theyll be waving all the flags at night
which will i decide
cuz theyre imposters
im making up my mind
you might also likechorus
anagram
im just the messenger man
its the last
time around
one of these days i wished you were around
anagram
if were just passengers
then its the first
time around
one of these days i wished you were around

bridge
glide
i stand in the light of your eyes
ill see you another time
come on baby roll the dice
im feeling like its gon break
this time will stars align
im thinking that its all the same

chorus
anagram
im just the messenger man
its the last
time around
one of these days i wished you were around
anagram
if were just passengers
then its the first
time around
one of these days i wished you were around
