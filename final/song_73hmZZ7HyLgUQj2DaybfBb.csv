verse 1 yung mutt
mirror mirror on the wall
who the fuck was that ugly ass boy i saw
yung mutt what a dumbfuck dirty like a dump truck
such a fucking bum hauntin sluts guts
im disgusted im busted up
what the fuck did i just put up my nose
im buggin out knees buckle
im duckin out im in trouble
now i can see the clouds lights out
now i lay myself to sleep now that i can rest in peace
no questioning my misery my deathwish granted blissful sleep
my body turns to worms for the birds to eat
internal decay for eternity
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likechorus playa fly
creepin out the cut with my yams now i want some hay
serve on serserve on now you know im out here hard
creepin out the cut with my yams now i want some hay
serve on serserve on now you know im out here hard

verse 2 crim
i cant lie lately i been on the fuckin edge
pistol gripped up on my lap
xanax heroin bunch of meds
fantasizin about death just need one in my temple
put the gun up to my head
fuck this shit i shot the lead and now im dead
descendin through hell nothin but burnin flesh smells
i scream and scream and scream
and hear the others yell as well
oh well just my luck
devil opens up to devour me that was my old life
antichrist he has empowered me
