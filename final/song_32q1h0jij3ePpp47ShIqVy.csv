my name is cupid valentino the modern day cupid
and i just want to say one thing

verse 1 andré 3000
happy valentines day every day the 14th
i dont think yall heard me
i just wanna say happy valentines day every day the 14th

now when arrows dont penetrate see cupid grabs the pistol
uh yeah now now lookie here
he shoots straight for your heart now and he wont miss you
but thats alright yall wont believe in me anyway but

chorus joi and screechy peach  andré 3000

verse 4 andré 3000
got a sweet lil darlin back in my corner
below i know i love her but act like i dont want her
surrounded by the lovely but yet feel like a loner
could be an organ donor the way i give up my heart
but never know because shit i never tell her
ask me how im feeling id holla that its irrele–
i dont get myself caught up in the jello jella
and pudding pops that others opt to call falling in love
but for the record have you ever rode a horse
like for you to send me to pluto i said of course
but if you aint a sweety indeedy i wont endorse
han solo til im hit by the bullet so may the force
be with you and ill hit you when better time permits
for now show me samples examples why youre the shit
but how am i to know with the profession that im in
and if you do not know me then how could you be my friend

outro joi screechy peach  andré 3000
