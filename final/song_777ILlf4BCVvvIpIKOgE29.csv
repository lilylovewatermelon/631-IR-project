verse 1 lil durk
what the fuck you know bout foenem

verse 2 king von
in the field like a pitch
cause daddy was not in the picture he wasnt
i swear im in love with the pistol
you got blessed if i missed you for real
confrontin our problems and issues
im like man with a mission i am
and i get paid bout people i killed
but that shit wont make me no killer
cause killers dont talk about bodies they dont
we do that shit on the silent for real
when me and zoo out slidin
rock paper scissors who drivin its you
bitch im a shooter i shoot out a uber
if zoo dont feel like drivin i do
nigga ill do ya ill blow out ya noodles
and it aint hard to find me bitch i aint hidin for real
