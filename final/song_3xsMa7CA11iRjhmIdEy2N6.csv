and its all alright
i guess its all alright

but its all alright
yeah its all alright
i guess its all alright
i got nothing left inside of my chest
but its all alright

verse 1
and i got the call soon as the day hit night
as soon as the headlights lit up the westside
i stopped the car and came outside
cause i know that tone
i remember the first time
we wished upon parallel lines
waiting for a friend to call
and say theyre still alive

prechorus
ive given everyone i know
a good reason to go
i was surprised you stuck around
long enough to figure out
you might also likehook
that its all alright
i guess its all alright
i got nothing left inside of my chest
but its all alright
yeah its all alright
i guess its all alright
i got nothing left inside of my chest
but its all alright

verse 2
and now all my loves that come back to haunt me
my regrets and texts sent to taunt me
i never claimed to be more than a onenight stand

prechorus
ive given everyone i know
a good reason to go
but i came back with the belief
that everyone i love is gonna leave me

hook
and its all alright
i guess its all alright
i got nothing left inside of my chest
but its all alright
yeah its all alright
i guess its all alright
i got nothing left inside of my chest
but its all alright
bridge
and i know oh no
youve fallen from the sun
crashing through the clouds
i see you burning out
and i know oh no
that i put up a front
but maybe just this once
let me keep this one

hook
yeah its all alright
i guess its all alright
i got nothing left inside of my chest
but its all alright
yeah its all alright
i guess its all alright
i got nothing left inside of my chest
but its all alright
yeah its all alright
i guess its all alright
i got nothing left inside of my chest
but its all alright
yeah its all alright

i got nothing left inside of my chest
