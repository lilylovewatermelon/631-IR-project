put on that i still got it lipstick shade
take a get me there shot in the kitchen
tell my friends that im fixing to head that way

everybody wants somebody on the weekend
a go sit at a bar have a drink with
a neon bad decision they could leave with
and id be lying if i said that i didnt
yeah i didnt
wish that friday
wasnt just another way to say lonely
and sunday morning didnt dawn on me
that im hungover from the weakend
yeah the weak end of a heartache
a permanent case of the mondays
maybe ill get over you one day someday

well that third round of double whiskeys burning
hes flirting and its working and im drunk
and i dont smoke but hes gotta lighter
and if a marlboro light will start a fire ill let him light it up

everybody wants somebody on the weekend
a go sit at a bar have a drink with
a neon bad decision they could leave with
and id be lying if i said that i didnt
yeah i didnt
wish that friday
wasnt just another way to say lonely
and sunday morning didnt dawn on me
that im hungover from the weakend
yeah the weak end of a heartache
a permanent case of the mondays
maybe ill get over you one day someday yeah
