verse 1 flo rida
i done bought all this cîroc now lil mama on my jock
starin at me up and down like when my rollies six oclock
now you know you better stop
you done heard about my squad
img poe boy you either uh or you not hold up shorty
wait a minute shorty why you came
who you know and who the hell told you to come
all up in the middle with the business unofficial
when i cant stand a chick tryna spoil my fun
lookin for a dude to rip you off some funds
i dont need a chick tryna throw my ones
let me look rich i wanna have his son
i sip pérignon but do i look dumb
get a job tryna turn my knob
and if the door open up make sure you slob
my boys they know we buy the bar
sit back blow smoke from a cuban cigar
whats your mission looks suspicious
i dont get it no permission
back no interest whats the business
shorty listen
see flo rida liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likechorus git fresh  ludacris
im just tryna figure figure why you up in here
why you up in here

im just tryna figure figure figure why you up in here
why you up in here
all up in my grill
why you dancin on me steady talkin to me
when you know that youre not gonna give it to me
im just tryna figure figure figure why you up in here
what you doin up in here man get your ass on
why you up in here
all up in my grill

verse 2 ludacris
now i aint got no time for silly games
got no time for silly notions
but get smacked silly for playin with my emotions
you figured you lead me on
but bitch you led me out the door
now let me lead you with a song
it go like d yous a hoe
drunk up all my cointreau aint even leave me with a glass
so cough up my whole bottle or ima take out your ass
cause you dont wanna see me angry nope
you dont like me when im angry nope
live like jackson 5 but get greezy like jermaine
be dangerous like michael so tito pass the tissues
dont test me cause i keep a clipper number 2 pistols
and you will be erased outta sight and outta mind
so get the fuck on or my girls will wipe the floor with your behind
chorus git fresh  gucci mane
im just tryna figure figure why you up in here

verse 3 gucci mane
all the 4s on my maserati whoa kemosabe
i should be a wine taster bottle poppin is my hobby
i should be a food critic all the restaurants i dine in
a quarter million dollars gone i only got one diamond damn
im just tryna figure how you think you teasin it
dont dock the world star or listen to it
rock so much ice thatll make ya shiver
mia to east atlanta big ups if you make the scrilla
im too official like im referee wilson
referee bitch back in ya killed em
gorgeous chica speakin with a loaded smile
bad attitude but a song tied
i aint even hit her like one time
but that couldve been a fun time
could be the back then brought her back
but cant keep it here you can have her back
i am stable i am grateful i aint faithful but fuck that
its gucci
chorus git fresh
im just tryna figure figure why you up in here

im just tryna figure figure figure why you up in here
why you up in here
all up in my grill
why you dancin on me steady talkin to me
when you know that youre not gonna give it to me
im just tryna figure figure figure why you up in here
why you up in here
all up in my grillembed"
