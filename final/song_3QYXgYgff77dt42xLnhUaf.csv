yeah id give this last wrinkled dollar
in my pocket that i earned
with a hammer and vice
if i could undo some things
and grow me some wings
fly out of this quarter tonight

verse 2
yeah tonight every man with a tv
is seeing a man with my clothes and my face
in the last thirty minutes
ive gone from a person of interest
to a fullblown manhunt underway

prechorus
i did what i did
i have no regrets
when you cross the line
you get what you get

chorus
tonight a bleeding memory
is tomorrows guilty vein
your auburn hair on a faraway sea wall
screams across the pontchartrain
im haunted by headlights
and a crescent city breeze
one wrong turn on bourbon
cuts like the knives of new orleans
see eric church liveget tickets as low as 200you might also likeverse 3
im a ghost dodging bullets
in all of these alleys
just looking for my getaway keys
wrapped up in the night
hiding out in plain sight
but this grips getting tight around me

prechorus
aint no getting out
that i can see
theyll take me dead
if they ever take me

chorus
tonight a bleeding memory
is tomorrows guilty vein
your auburn hair on a faraway sea wall
screams across the pontchartrain
im haunted by headlights
and a crescent city breeze
one wrong turn on bourbon
cuts like the knives of new orleans
of new orleans

bridge
what i wouldnt do
for just one more kiss
im all out of time
honey its come down to this
chorus
im haunted by your hazel eyes
and this crescent city breeze
one wrong turn on bourbon
cuts like the knives of new orleans

outro
i did what i did
i did what i did
i did what i did
i did what i did1embed"
