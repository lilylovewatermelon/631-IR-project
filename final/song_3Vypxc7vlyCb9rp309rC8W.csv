and y’all niggas can’t afford those

yea and i ain’t nothin’ like that other man
still lookin’ polished with the hoties up in rubber bands
spendin’ money all across the world
up the magic closet have it with my neighbor earl
yea pulled up in the new range
no we had to make it rain with the loose change
