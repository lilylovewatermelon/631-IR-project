you know my girl get the keys with the ms on it
she have the range night then a benz mornin
bought plenty of ice for them shinin on your friends moments
ill give her anything she want if it look good on her
and we be chillin like a bottle sittin on the rocks
shoppin bags full of cartier forgetmenots
but money cant buy you love baby thats a fact
but you can rent some love with a couple stacks
man i aint gotta lease nothin i own one
and every time i hit she say its a home run
when asked how can we be serious at so young
i just say im in it for the long run
