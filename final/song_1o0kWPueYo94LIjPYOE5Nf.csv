yeahyeah 908 la time
back in the lab and shit

verse 1 kanye west
my wife said i cant say no to nobody
and at this rate we gon both die broke
got friends that ask me for money knowin im in debt
and like my wife said i still didnt say no
people tryna say im goin crazy on twitter
my friends best advice was to stay low
i guess its hard to decipher all of the bills
especially when you got family members on payroll
the media said it was outlandish spendin
the media said hes way out of control
i just feel like im the only one not pretendin
im not out of control im just not in their control
i know im the most influential
that time cover was just confirmation
this generations closest thing to einstein
so dont worry about me im fine
i can see a thousand years from now in real life
skate on the paradigm and shift it when i feel like
troll conventional thought dont need to question
i know its antiquated so sometimes i get aggressive
thank god for jay electra he down with the mission
did it with no permission on our own conditions
most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
yeezy with the big house did it way different
never listen to hollywood producers
dont stare at money too long its medusa
the ultimate gemini has survived
i wasnt supposed to make it past 25

yeah youre lookin at the church in the night sky

and you wonder where is god in your nightlife
yeah youre lookin at the church in the night sky
father father father in the night sky
wonderin whether gods gonna say hi
yeah i feel like im home yeah yeah

verse 2 kanye west
ive been wakin the spirits of millions more to come
a million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
i believe in the children listen to the kids bro
if the phone ringin go and get your kids ho
brother don muhammad told the minister about the presentation
he sat back and smiled
black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
the jews share their truth on how to make a dime
most black men couldnt balance a checkbook
but buy a new car talkin bout how my neck look
well it all looks great
four hundred years later we buyin our own chains
the light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard
real family stick together and see through the mirage
the smokescreens perceptions of false reality
who the real owner if your boss gets a salary
i am one with the people
i am one with the people real
ive been woken from enlightened mans dream
checkin instagram comments to crowdsource my selfesteem
let me not say too much or do too much
cause if im up way too much im out of touch
im prayin a outofbody experience will happen
so the people can see my light now its not just rappin
god i have humbled myself before the court
drop my ego when confidence was my last resort
i know i know he got a plan i know im on your beams
one set of footsteps you was carryin me
when i turned on the news and they was buryin me
one set of footsteps you was carryin me
when i was negotiatin with apple it was larry and me
told tim cook to call me i was scary to see
i wouldve took a hundred million and gave twenty to hov
i heard its the way they did it when we only had a stove
but its better that i stayed at home with my folks
cause if jay a billionaire then ima never go broke
only thing i ask is next time im on stage we all go
we all go
not just by myself lookin for niggas like wheres waldo
she got the same shoes as my wife but she copped em at aldo
modernday mj with a offthewall flow
bridge sampha
nightlife walk all over me
walk all over me
im deliverin everything ive ever sent that youll bring
fly fly fly overseas
fly overseas
oh anywhere everything but in between
oh yeah

chorus sampha
yeah youre lookin at the church in the night sky
wonderin whether gods gonna say hi
oh youre lookin at the church in the night sky
and you wonder where is god in your nightlife
yeah youre lookin at the church in the night sky
wonderin whether gods gonna say hi
father father father in the night sky
oh youre lookin at the church in the night sky
and you wonder where is god in your nightlife

verse 3 sampha
please face me when i speak
please say to me somethin before you leave
youve been treatin me like im invisible now im visible to you
oh the invisible truth stay sober
i cant quite understand the games you play
understand understand understand im standin under oath
and i promised i i wouldnt fall anymore
but im cryin at the bar
im wishin that you saw my scars man
im wishin that you came down here and stood by me
and looked at me like you knew me
but i feel so alone
like i dont know anyone except the night sky above
chorus sampha
yeah youre lookin at the church in the night sky
wonderin whether gods gonna say hi
oh youre lookin at the church in the night sky
and you wonder where is god in your nightlife
yeah youre lookin at the church in the night sky
father father father in the night sky
wonderin whether gods gonna say hi
