plenty cry
this life without you
you dont want you dont want you dont want
you dont want you dont want to go back to the basics yeah

verse
checked the velocity hope you can weather through the storm
peep out the carpet its custom stitched up in yarn
hottest commodity covered in italian velour
hold on to your faith when i need you to be there
askin for your heart if its real then its rare
ocean in the sea gia i see
lunch time in cheetah with snow bunny divas
only for me this just aint for the relapse
bubble eye benz came with goggles yeah
gang of korean talk to me proper yeah
translator friend european model yeah
they cover my trend top story espn
so many chains like a turtleneck under my chin
ill learn to speak another language if it makes sense
princess cut clarity vvss
military money out the gutter ducked the popo
three strips skrrted goin solo
havin the time of my life with no photo
cant show every gift you get to ig when you fuck on a mogul
i dc sniped it and i hit it listenin to gogo
ima make em lose count if they addin up the total
after i fuck you let me cry on your shoulder
this is a chance of a lifetime
you might also likeoutro
after we make love let me cry on your shoulder
you dont want you dont want you dont want
you dont want to go back to the basics
you dont want you dont want you dont want
you dont want you dont want to go back to the basics
get a room key check in saying twoofour
after we make love let me cry on your shoulder
you dont want you dont want you dont want
you dont want to go back to the basics
you dont want to go back to the basics11embed"
