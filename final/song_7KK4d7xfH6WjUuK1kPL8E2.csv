he thought the money make you happy it dont make you different
i start to see that shit myself when i got a couple million
rolled through the mud i cant lie i seen too much
real steppers outside theyll squeeze and bust
i told my brother have some patience and your dayll come
now he sittin in the county jail and he aint got no bond
you cant walk inside my shoes like a sneaker con
i overcome obstacles and they still come
i was tryna make a way out like it was my first day out
remember my first day out now i got ms in account
i eat that pussy like steak she eat my dick like a crepe
i got some niggas in the south i sip on purple like grape

chorus
these streets by my side you dont want war with us
i felt so stuck in my life i had to pour me a cup
if i hurt your feelings im sorry i dont apologize
my penthouse got a birds view through gods eyes
i got gang gang gang gang i got mob ties mob ties
i got porsche with the frog eyes
got a handcrafted jet jet with a palmpilot
all this money on my mind i talk to god about it yeah yeah

verse 2
i gotta grab dough grab dough
brand new whitewhite rolls royce and that bitch match her toes yeah yeah
i was out flockin i aint have a choice i aint even had no clothes
i put my wrist inside the freezer watch the patek froze
think about the time man we was ten
we was hoppin fences
i was stayin inside the trenches
i keep a strap for you and you i know the opps intentions
back in genesis i was ot with the coco
she got a bangin body booty like a rollercoaster

these streets by my side you dont want war with us
i felt so stuck in my life i had to pour me a cup
if i hurt your feelings im sorry i dont apologize
my penthouse got a birds view through gods eyes
i got gang gang gang gang i got mob ties mob ties
i got porsche with the frog eyes
got a handcrafted jet jet with a palmpilot
all this money on my mind i talk to god about it yeah yeah4embed"
