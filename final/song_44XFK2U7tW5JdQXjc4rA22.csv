verse 1
once upon a time there was a girl
in her early years she had to learn
how to grow up living in a war that she called home
never knew just where to turn for shelter from the storm
hurt me to see the pain across my mothers face
every time my fathers fist would put her in her place
hearing all the yelling i would cry up in my room
hoping it would be over soon

chorus
bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
and i still remember how you kept me so afraid
strength is my mother for all the love she gave
every morning that i wake i look back at yesterday
and im ok

verse 2
i often wonder why i carry all this guilt
when its you that helped me put up all these walls ive built
shadows stir at night through a crack in the door
the echo of a broken child screaming please no more
daddy dont you understand the damage you have done
to you its just a memory but for me it still lives on
you might also likechorus
bruises fade father but the pain remains the same
and i still remember how you kept me so so afraid
strength is my mother for all the love she gave
every morning that i wake i look back at yesterday

bridge
its not so easy to forget
all the marks you left along her neck
when i was thrown against cold stairs
and every day im afraid to come home
in fear of what i might see next

chorus
bruises fade father but the pain remains the same same
and i still remember how you kept me so afraid
strength is my mother for all the love you gave
every morning that i wake i look back at yesterday
and im ok
