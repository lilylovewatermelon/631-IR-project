i think i think too much
im a little bit paranoid i think i’m breaking
maybe its in my blood
got a pain that i cant avoid i think i’m breaking down

verse 1 brian burkheiser
hate every single second minute hour every day
person in the mirror they wont let me feel a thing
keep me focused on my problems im addicted to the pain
everybodys out to get you

prechorus eric vanlerberghe
i guess i never noticed how it came creeping in
my enemy emotion but i cant sink or swim
i say im feeling hopeless they give me medicine
they give me medicine they give me medicine

chorus brian burkheiser  eric vanlerberghe
i think i think too much too much
im a little bit paranoid i think im breaking
maybe it’s in my blood my blood
got a pain that i can’t avoid i think im breaking
down i think i’m breaking
down i think im breaking
i think i think too much too much
im a little bit paranoid i think im breaking down

lies every time they ask me i just tell ’em that im fine
try to hide my demons but they only multiply
keep me running from the voices on repeat inside my mind
everybody fucking hates you

prechorus eric vanlerberghe
i guess i never noticed how it came creeping in
my enemy emotion but i cant sink or swim
i say im feeling hopeless but no ones listening
but no ones listening but no ones listening

chorus brian burkheiser  eric vanlerberghe

i think i think too much too much
im a little bit paranoid i think im breaking down
