pushing past the limit trippin on hallucinogenics
my cigarette burnt my finger cause i forgot i lit it

verse 1
rippin with my sinners cause fuck it man i aint no beginner
and then i crawled back to the life that i said i wouldnt live in

prechorus
cause i just couldnt open up im always shiftin
go find yourself a man whos strong and tall and christian

chorus
pushing past the limit trippin on hallucinogenics
my cigarette burnt my finger cause i forgot i lit it

verse 2
drunken in seattle two more xans and without a paddle
i dont remember your face or your hair or your name or your smile

prechorus
cause i just couldnt open up im always shiftin
go find yourself a man whos strong and tall and christian

chorus
pushing past the limit trippin on hallucinogenics
and then i crawled back to the life that i said i wouldnt live in
see matt maeson liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likebridge
cause i carried on like the wayward son
and now through and through ive come undone
and now i am just but the wayward man
what with my bloodshot eyes and my shaky hand
cause i carried on like the wayward son
and now through and through ive come undone
and now i am just but the wayward man
what with my bloodshot eyes and my shaky hand

chorus
pushing past the limit trippin on hallucinogenics
