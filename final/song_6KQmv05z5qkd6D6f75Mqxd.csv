wanna know the truth well i wrote it down
i got a phd in thinkin out loud
no book to buy its more like a list
it aint long kinda goes like this

chorus
tell it like it is dont sugarcoat it
take it to the bank so you cant blow it
use a little duct tape if you done broke it
when it dont start you might have to choke it
if it gets too tall you can just mow it
aint tall enough sit back and grow it
and if you gotta drawl you best just own it
so put a little yall in your pipe and smoke it

verse 2
cant find a barstool just find a porch
hell whiskeys cheaper at the liquor store
when life gets you down go buy a dog
and in the end youll be better off

chorus
if you tell it like it is dont sugarcoat it
take it to thе bank so you cant blow it
use a little duct tape if you donе broke it
when it dont start you might have to choke it
if it gets too tall you can just mow it
aint tall enough sit back and grow it
and if you gotta drawl you best just own it
so put a little yall in your pipe and smoke it

chorus
and if it gets too tall you can just mow it
