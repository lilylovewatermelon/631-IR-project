lately things are on my mind
good news is hard to find
and i work on the factory line
and all i do is stay behind
call my mama like i should
she says daddy aint doing too good
me and him should wet a line
just cant seem to find the time

chorus
but i love my life
man its something to see
its the kids and the dogs and you and me
its the way its alright when everything goes wrong
its the sound of a slow simple song

verse 2
finally saved some money up
til i had to fix my truck
talked to brother the other day
he didnt have too much to say
tryna quit these cigarettes
i cant seem to kick em yet
sister got laid off last fall
and i got high cholesterol
see chris stapleton liveget tickets as low as 36you might also likechorus
but i love my life
man its something to see
its the kids and the dogs and you and me
its the way its alright when everything goes wrong
its the sound of a slow simple song

but i love my life
man its something to see
its the kids and the dogs and you and me
its the way its alright when everything goes wrong
its the sound of a slow simple songembed"
