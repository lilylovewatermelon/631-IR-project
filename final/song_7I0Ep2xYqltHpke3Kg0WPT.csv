we dont come down we just stay up all year
counting our vices dear and the shit that got us here
but when i loved you it didnt have to be a language
no written rules or commandments
it was enough to be alive

prechorus
one by one or two by two
miss jenny jenkins
you know i wouldnt change things
even if i made it

chorus
so we take our time and skip around some
half my love is on the run half my love is on the run
chase it down while im young

adlibs

verse 2
my car broke down somewhere up on mulholland
and we watched the lights fade on the imported palms
and we laughed out loud at all of the bullshit here
im dying on promises dear in the hollywood sun
see mt joy liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likeprechorus
