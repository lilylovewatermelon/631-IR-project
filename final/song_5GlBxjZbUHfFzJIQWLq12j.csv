a spring break party miles from minnesota
jane was with her friends to mark a celebration
phi beta kappa for her college graduation
a little pomp and circumstance
see jane dance

the bouncer led the ladies to an openair cabana
a sea of coppertones and hawaiian tropicanas
a slew of southern beauties were causing a commotion
oiling up their skin to win a trip across the ocean
jane had never been to france
see jane dance

she jumped up on the stage and after many margaritas
she took her place in line amongst the tanned se√±oritas
she tore into a groove and lost her inhibition
stirring up the crowd she blew away the competition
in her leopard underpants
see jane dance

now she drives a bimmer that was bartered for a gig in barcelona
a harley that was payment from the bikers in daytona
shes heavily invested her stock is on the run
be worth a couple million by the time shes thirtyone
so before you miss your chance
see jane dance
