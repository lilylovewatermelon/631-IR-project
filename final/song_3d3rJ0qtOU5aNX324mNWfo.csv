wide awake my mistake so predictable
you were fake i was great nothing personal
im walking whos laughing now
whos laughing whos laughing now
im wasted wasting time
you talk for hours but youre wasting lines
a pretty face but the chase aint worth the prize

chorus
im gonna break your little heart
watch you take the fall
laughing all the way to the hospital
cause theres nothing surgery can do
when i break your little heart in two
im gonna break your little heart in two

verse 2
party queen draws a scene so ridiculous
little dress maybe less so conspicuous
youre falling whos crashing now
whos crashing whos crashing now
im wasted wasting time
im moving on but youre left behind
a pretty face but the chase aint worth the prize
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likechorus
im gonna break your little heart
watch you take the fall
laughing all the way to the hospital
cause theres nothing surgery can do ohohohoh
im gonna break your little heart show you to the door
sew yourself shut and now youre begging for more begging for more
cause theres nothing surgery can do
when i break your little heart in two

bridge
dont be so sentimental no
this love was accidental so
give it up this was never meant to be more than a memory for you

chorus
im gonna break your little heart
watch you take the fall
laughing all the way to the hospital hospital
cause theres nothing surgery can do
when i break your little heart in two
im gonna break your little heart show you to the door
sew yourself shut now youre begging for more
dont be so sentimental
cause theres nothing surgery can do ohohohoh
when i break your little heart in two13embed"
