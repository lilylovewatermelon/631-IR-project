the thing about a break up
sometimes you just gotta break down
coming off a great love
theres plenty of pain to pass around
like a tip jar in a dive bar
full of broken hearts
its a lonely crowd
the thing about a breakup
sometimes you just gotta break down

chorus
when the only thing you want is
the only thing that you cant have
when the part that you cant take is
knowing you cant take it back
shes on the good side goodbye
on the right sight of free
and youre on the wrong end of a long night
on the left side of leavin
yeah
on the left side of leavin

verse 2
the thing about a last kiss
you never know that its the last
till they call the last call
and youre just drinking about the past
like the bottom of the bottle
knows how to get her back
the thing about a last kiss
you never know that its the last

when the only thing you want is
the only thing that you cant have
when the part that you cant take is
knowing you cant take it back
shes on the good side goodbye
on the right sight of free
and youre on the wrong end of a long night
on the left side of leavin
yeah
on the left side of leavin
stuck on the left side

bridge
youre on the drunk part of drinking
the cant stop part of thinking
the wide awake part of sleeping woah
youre on the broke part of breaking
the mistake part of making
youre on the cane part of shaking woah

chorus
when the only thing you want is
the only thing that you cant have
when the part that you cant take is
knowing you cant take it back
shes on the good side goodbye
on the right sight of free
and youre on the wrong end of a long night
on the left side of leavin
yeah
on the left side of leavinembed"
