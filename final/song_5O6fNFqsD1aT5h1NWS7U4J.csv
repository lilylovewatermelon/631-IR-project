on certain sundays in november
when the weather bothers me
i empty drawers of other summers
where my shadows used to be
and she is standing by the water
as her smile begins to curl
in this or any other summer
she is something altogether different
never just an ordinary girl

verse 2
and in the evenings on long island
when the colors start to fade
she wears a silly yellow hat
that someone gave her when she stayed
i didnt think that she returned it
we left new york in a whirl
time expands and then contracts
when you are spinning in the grips of someone
who is not an ordinary girl
and when you sleep
you find your mother in the night
but she stays just out of sight
so there isnt any sweetness in the dreaming
and when you wake
the morning covers you with light
and it makes you feel alright
but its just the same hard candy
youre remembering again
see counting crows liveget tickets as low as 170you might also likeyou send your lover off to china
then you wait for her to call
you put your girl up on a pedestal
then you wait for her to fall
i put my summers back in a letter
and i hide it from the world
all the regrets you cant forget
are somehow pressed upon a picture
in the face of such an ordinary girl

chorus
and when you sleep
you find your mother in the night
but she fades just out of sight
so there isnt any sweetness in the dreaming
and when you wake
the morning showers you with light
and it makes you feel all right
but its just the same hard candy
youre remembering again

bridge
again again again again
and its just the same hard candy
youre remembering again
again again again again
and its just the same hard candy
youre remembering again
outro
go ask her to come around
and see me late after dark
dont ask me to come around
then wait to see if theres a spark
go ask her to come around
and see me late after dark
dont ask me to come around
then make me wait to see the spark
go ask her to come around
late and see me after dark
dont ask me to come around
then wait to if there is a spark
go ask her to come around
late and see me late after dark
dont ask me1embed"
