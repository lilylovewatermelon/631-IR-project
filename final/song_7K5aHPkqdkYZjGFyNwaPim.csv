conversations with my thirteenyearold self
conversations with my thirteenyearold self

verse 1
youre angry youre angry
i know this i know this
the world couldnt care less
youre lonely youre lonely
i feel this i feel this
and you wish you were the best
no teachers
or guidance
and you always walk alone
youre crying
at night when
nobody else is home

chorus 1
come over here and let me hold your hand and hug you darling
i promise you that it wont always feel this bad
there are so many things i want to say to you
youre the girl i used to be
you little heartbroken thirteenyearold me

verse 2
youre laughing
but youre hiding
god i know that trick too well
you forget
that ive been you ive been you
and now im just the shell
i promise
i love you and
everything will work out fine
dont try to
grow up yet
oh just give it some time

the pain you feel is real youre not asleep but its a nightmare
but you can wake up anytime
oh dont lose your passion or the fighter thats inside of you
youre the girl i used to be
the pissedoff complicated thirteenyearold me

refrain
conversations with my thirteenyearold self
conversations with my thirteenyearold self

outro
until we meet again
oh i wish you well oh
i wish you well
little girl
until we meet again
oh
i wish you well
little girl
i wish you well
until we meet again
