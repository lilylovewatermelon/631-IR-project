ive been thinking bout you all day baby
waitin on that sun to go down
what ya say i pick you up after work
slide over we slip out to the outskirts of town

verse 2
i got a blanket and a fifth of comfort
a little something to knock off the edge
its supposed to get a little cool tonight
looks like im gonna have to hold you tight yeah

chorus
about a mile off old mill road
in that spot nobody knows
we park the truck and we take off runnin
hurry up girl i hear it comin
got a moon and a billion stars
the sound of steel and old boxcars
the thought of yous drivin me insane
come on baby lets go listen to the night train

verse 3
yeah i hope its gonna be a long one
and if were lucky its moving slow
i wouldnt mind if it lasted all night
lying next to you on that hillside lets go
see jason aldean liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
about a mile off old mill road
in that spot nobody knows
we park the truck and we take off runnin
hurry up girl i hear it comin
got a moon and a billion stars
the sound of steel and old boxcars
the thought of you is drivin me insane
come on baby lets go listen to the night train
lets go listen to the night train

chorus

hurry up girl i hear it comin
got a moon and a billion stars
the sound of steel and old boxcars
