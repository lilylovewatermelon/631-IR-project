and even if i was wrong i know i dont deserve this
dont stay too long i need to hear those words you use to tell me
from way back when we were just friends
before this love affair began

chorus
tell me how i love you wins
or how a broken heart can mend
just tell me this is not the end
please tell me now
how the fairy tale begins
or how it was supposed to end
please tell me that part again

verse 2
now tell me whats wrong
i never meant to hurt you no babyooh
was it the home the car
or darling all those thing we thought we needed
tell me even if it aint true
but baby please dont say were through

chorus
tell me how i love you wins
or how a broken heart can mend
just tell me this is not the end
please tell me now
how the fairy tale begins
or how it was supposed to end
please tell me that part again

i wanna know that
feelin thats from way back
a time when it was true that love was sweet and innocent
when you and i could still be friends
make all the wrong be right again
where true love never has to end

chorus
tell me how i love you wins
or how a broken heart can mend
just tell me this is not the end
please tell me now
how the fairy tale begins
or how it was supposed to end
please tell me that part againembed"
