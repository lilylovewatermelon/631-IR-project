under blue moon i saw you
so soon youll take me
up in your arms too late to beg you
or cancel it though i know it must be
the killing time
unwillingly mine

chorus
fate
up against your will
through the thick and thin
you must wait until
you give yourself to him

verse 2
in starlit nights i saw you
so cruel youll take me
your lips a magic world
your sky all hung with jewels
the killing moon
will come too soon

chorus
fate
up against your will
through the thick and thin
you must wait until
you give yourself to him

hes a yoyo man always up and down
so take him to the end of his temper

chorus
fate
up against your will
through the thick and thin
you must wait until
you give yourself to him

outro
fate
up against your will
through the thick and thin
you must wait until
you give yourself
you give yourself to him
you give yourself to him
you give yourself to himembed"
