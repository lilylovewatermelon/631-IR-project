used to come around here every day
now youre breaking
used to be the one that is not ashamed
now you shaming
lost in all the wars we fought
never sorrowed
now that i think about you in the skies
of tomorrow
and i wonder where you are
now i wonder where you
are ooh

verse 2
tear yourself down
pick yourself up
everything changed when you got alone
71 took it all down
suddenly you cant even be found
i said all night long

chorus
a missing persons in the window
staring at me
saying things i cant hear
a missing persons in the window
staring at me
havent seen them in years

first things first
second in command
right as im trying to change my plan
second gonna die
ooh i cant breathe
everybodys staring straight at me
you spend it all chasing those lies
i dont really wanna take that chance
i dont really wanna do that dance
i dont know what to do till you say
oh i dont wanna let you go
but i cant keep holding on
skies of silver stars of gold
and now you know just what you like

bridge
so far this love is all i have
so far this hurt is all i have

outro
missing person at the window
missing person at the window
missing person at the window
missing person at the window
i wonder where you are
i wonder where you are
i wonder where you are
i wonder where you5embed"
