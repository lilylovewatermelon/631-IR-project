our hearts are free
so tell me whats wrong with the feeling
im a flower youre the bee
its much older than you and me
im in love im alive
i belong to the stars and sky
lets forget who we are for one night
were not animals baby
its the people who lie to themselves

ooh dont leave me waiting
ive got real love maybe
wait until you taste me
i want real love baby
theres a world inside me
got the key just use it
just if for a minute and gone
