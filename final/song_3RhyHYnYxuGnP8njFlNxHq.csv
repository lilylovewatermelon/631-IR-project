if you wanna go ahead and lie to me
throw it all out now thats fine with me uh
if im not enough for you honestly
i hope you dont come back
when you see that im better off
when youre all broke down and youre missing us
when you finally figure out just what you lost
i hope you dont come back

verse 1
i can feel you shutting off now
like i always expected you would
stop believing all your friends now
cause they all say that you get bored
i feel it youre bout to cut me out your life
i feel it just know that theres no second try

chorus

i hope you dont come back
when you see that im better off
when youre all broke down and youre missing us
when you finally figure out just what you lost
i hope you dont come back
