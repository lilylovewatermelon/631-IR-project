it aint everyday when i say who that
impressing me is kinda hard but you did that
you got me curious to see where you at
which you game when i see can you get that
if so then good news you qualify
to get something you aint never had in your life
a little bit heaven youll hear the angels singing
this stuff is so good youll throw it up and
watch it turn in to sunshine

chorus

if you ever get some of this sunshine
make it rain money all fa my honey
