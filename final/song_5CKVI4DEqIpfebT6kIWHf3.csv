i admit i miss seeing your face babe seeing your face baby
and being alone is starting to take its toll
im cold and its getting old getting cold
i admit i admit i should have made some changes changes
we were so smothered in love
we didnt have a chance to come up for air no fair

prechorus
what a waste where did the time go
where did our minds go i dont know
whats this place where did our home go
we wont know i dont knowâ€¦

chorus
too much of anything is too much
too much love can be too much
we had too much time too much us
so we fought like tomorrow was promised
too much too much too much too much
too much too much too much  much much too much

verse 2
i admit im still watching the days go by
and sleeping alone is starting to break me down
its cold but i should have known
i admit i made a few mistakes babe
we were so caught up in love
we didnt have a chance to come up for air no fair

what a waste where does the time go
where did our minds go i dont know
whats this place where did my heart go
well never know ill never know

chorus
too much of anything is too much
too much love can be too much
we had too much time too much us
so we fought like tomorrow was promised
too much too much too much too much
too much too much too much too much
too much too much too much too much
too much too much too much  much much too much

bridge
i need to find a reason to feel
like everything was meant to be let go
take it slow cause i cant be on my own

chorus
too much of anything is too much its just too much
too much love can be too much its just too
we had too much time too much us
so we fought like tomorrow was promised
too much too much too much too much

too much too much too much too much
too much too much too much  much much too muchembed"
