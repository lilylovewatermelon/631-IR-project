the sins of deliverance

verse 1
the eyes of the patriot fixed through the scope
the unknowing tyrant walks to the rope

chorus
its when murder is justice that martyrs are made
a onegun salute for the new independence day
theyll hallow your name
theyll hallow your name for your sacrifice

bridge
the sins of deliverance
so let the wicked perish
in the presence of god
for your sacrifice

verse 2
the sins of the father
atoned by the son
confessions of commitments broken
a nail driven for every one

chorus
its when murder is justice that martyrs are made
a onegun salute for the new independence day
theyll hallow your name
theyll hallow your name for your sacrifice

bridge
you are the cause i am the effect
created in hatred a noose for your neck

verse 3
the eyes of the patriot fixed through the scope
the unknowing tyrant walks to the rope

outro
theyll hallow your name
for your sacrifice
theyll hallow your name
sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice
theyll hallow your name6embed"
