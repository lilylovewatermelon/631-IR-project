sitting at home after rockin and areelin
all night in a cat fight with the only one who can make me cry
open the blind as the world is in rotation
shaking my mind like an etchasketch erasin
sunshine you were bad
im still mad but i cant remember why

i believe you know me well
i react like youre ringing a bell
are you sorry that you treat me unkind
never you mind

rolling along to the song that aggravates us
beckoned down by the mirage of an oasis
hurry im getting blurry
and its no longer clear in my mind

i believe you know me well
i react like youre ringing a bell
are you sorry that you treat me unkind
never you mind

i believe ive got you down
you react like anybody else around
are you sorry that we wasted our time
never you mind
you might also likesome days it takes all my time guessing why i cant figure it out
some days it takes all my energy just to forget about
all the memories that id be better off without
i believe you know me well

switch on the box mr spock is on the table
dr mccoy is unable to connect his brain
sweatin and strainin
well it seemed so simple at the time

i believe you know me well
i react like youre ringing a bell
are you sorry that you treat me unkind
never you mind

i believe ive got you down
you react like anybody else around
are you sorry that we wasted our time
never you mind never you mind
are you sorry that you treat me unkind
are you sorry are you sorry that were wasted our time
never you mind never you mind
are you sorry that were wastin our time
are you sorry are you sorry that you treat me unkind
never you mindembed"
