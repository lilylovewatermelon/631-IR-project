one two one two three—

verse 1
our lives will come to an end
so dont die with a bunch of regrets
when its all set in stone
and youre nothing but bones
can you live with the things that you did
or the things that you didnt
the things that you didnt

prechorus
just write down your plans on the back of your hands
until you feel the sand on your toes
keep drivin west to the coast

chorus
i dont know where youre from
but i would take the long way home
you need to go with your mom
so pack your stuff and drive alone
to cannon beach cannon beach
cannon beach cannon beach

postchorus
woohoh ohohoh
woohoh ohohohoh
woohoh ohohoh
woohoh ohohohoh

the sky looks bluer out here
watch the tide slowly disappear
you know the waves have so much to say
but its something that youll never hear
if you dont stop and listen
maybe youll miss it

prechorus
write down your plans on the back of your hands
until you feel the sand on your toes
keep drivin west to the coast oohooh

chorus
i dont know where youre from
but i would take the long way home
you need to go with your mom
and pack your stuff and drive alone
to cannon beach cannon beach
cannon beach cannon beach

i dont know where youre from
