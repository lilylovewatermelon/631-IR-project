silencer over the silencer so you aint gon be able to call a shot all you gon feel is the wind pressure
you on twitter sayin 9s known for jammin tryin to put the shame on niggas
old school so when you said the 9s jam i was like yeah nba jam they bang on niggas
told yall in 2012 bill collector they bang on niggas
reverse that to collect a bill i bang on
i wanna see you die in the worst way
funeral hearse play
after i kill you i cant stop i kill ya family dirty on thursday
slit ya mother throat drown your grandmother on her church day

two pistols to keep em quiet i got two tennis balls on the end like a cripple im usin a walker
if i dont slow it down or translate it two racks you tennis ball i dont do drive bys im usually the walker
and take it a step further im tryin to keep it non violent

im a beast married to that white girl call her sable
bitch where roman reigns you get your shit spared
north carolinadetroit ttop to tee grizzley i brought a big bear
a new day for this uso ill let a clip air
two ars got me walkin like ric flair
i came in this game filled with stars im talkin vcrs
the chinese spot everything we spit was raw
ive been in tough battles my resume is built with scars
gotti you aint nothin but a cash register so i treat you like a cashier and tuck one under like the bill too large
im back on smack its time for my ascension
ready for the bullshit so miss me with the detention
layin on a roof is the only time im crawlin for position
you sell hair so you should be used to these extensions
gotti i thought you was a real one
you said you had six months to a year in jail and you came home in two weeks
sheesh
i dont know what type of deal you cut man that shit was sweet
they confronted you with jail time unless you turned informant made you squeak
southside compton crip huh
no wonder they got you out here tellin on the nephews like 
ill put 18 through your wheel the dawgs on it
you hop out and try to run im all on it
catch him at the end of the trailer and then i pull it
beasley voice although we do this for sport it is not a game
he got hit with a beasley bullet
call it quits
if i make change its for the parliament
i got 40 cents in my hand and im spendin all of it
i want your baby mother i heard she was a baller bitch
so i can stuff her in a black trash bag thats how you ball a bitch
youse a beverly hills rapper
aint no murders down there
you keep your doors locked for what aint no burglars down there
come to philly you fuck around and get murdered down there
talkin beef turn his body to burger down there
talk is cheap we take it a step further down there
not geechi man but gucci man the clip go blllet blllet burn down there
you bird nigga
round 2

round 3 geechi gotti
aye this nigga got his mans right here tellin you the words the whole time and shit
laughs
and then you rap for like ten minutes wastin niggas time and shit
tryin to play me for a snitch man that shit wack
in cali them type of accusations will get you bitch slapped
real rap but i heard tech a legend
i say a legend for what cause he beat miles
nigga what that mean to a nigga that beat trials
free my nigga doggy and baby wood my bros on that fo yard
say they livin through me so i aint got no choice but to go hard
see i coulda been killed if it wasnt for rappin
still duckin them shots from guns thats clappin
they say my life like a movie
i say this shit couldnt be comedy cause i wasnt laughin
and when them niggas came through shootin clips and my patnas died on the scene that wasnt actin
yall remember boyz n the hood
ice cube played doughboy that movie made him a star
but we in land of the gangbang walk ups and drive bys
that wasnt the first time i seen a nigga let the tre trey out the car
true story i hate it when they say cause we grew up in the hood we hopeless
nigga thats a damn lie cause i remember goin to school and my teachers used to be like you can be whatever you want you dont gotta be this thug guy
i said i know i believe anything is possible shit yesterday i seen some slugs fly
now listen when doves cry see growin up that song aint make a lot of sense
til my patna got cracked for a murder cause he aint had gloves on thats when i realized you can actually learn a lot from prints prince
now ive been pissed off for a minute
cause yall remember i asked a mama what hurt more givin birth or buryin him
she told me it was givin birth now that answer threw me to the left
she said cause she never planned on bein pregnant but the way that nigga was livin she was already plannin for his death
now this lifestyle will have a nigga stressed
like the condom broke in a hoodrat
my biggest fear is gettin smoked by a nigga who was just askin where the woods at
true story thats why im never slippin its forever grippin
two straps one nine one revolver the code word red lobster
what the fuck that mean
you will get this before the meal its a cheddar biscuit
the metal twisted but its not a game
i hold it like this cause i dont need the aim
baow put this clown head on fire he needles kane
the heatll bang they told me if they aint ridin for you then what the fuck you doin wit em
i sent a prayer up to spittage he told me to tell you stop sayin his name before the battles if you gon be losin in em
stupid nigga
my cousin wicked got hit when that tec jammed true story
im just glad he live to tell about it
my patna got shot in his couch left stankin in the house
i seen his grandma she said she still cant get the smell up out it
you gotta have the stomach for this
i digress cause seein my niggas just die thats hard to digest
but i guess we done been to enough jails
even blindfolded we can sketch out the cell pattern
this the gangland where niggas die rags cover the coughin coffin like we well mannered
my niggas hit me everyday like gotti whats up im glad you got out
cause im one of the few niggas that understand a green dot is more important than a shoot out
my niggas be in there pissed off thinkin that niggas dont give a fuck about him like they must hate em
it be everyday i be gettin frustrated wishin i could just save em
cause they write letters to niggas who wont even write back
the only letter they get is the one the judge gave em
and you think i gave a fuck about who they cheer fo
i only came here to show the difference between a real one and a weirdo
and when its real you can see it in they eyes
go head see if you can make them believe them lies
time

round 3 tech 9
can yall hear me well aight then

spittage
yall motherfuckers get it right wayne ave
look at my eyes you see nothin but pain inside
i done lost love ones close friends they talkin change
well in my city aint nothin in mine
over a quarter you can catch a quarter i got a little change in mind
these young boys on a suicide mission cause they was trained to ride
innocent bystanders gettin shot cause these pussies aimin high
when its hot the murder rate pop
when its cold the murder rate drop its crazy how the weather can be the reason whether you live or die
gotti you cant talk this real shit to me everything you claim you did ive been through it
my little sister was murdered on the corner of my mothers block now every time she walk home from work she gotta live through it
if you dont get killed by your own brother then the pigs do it
stop snitchin these little niggas get a story and they stick to it
i got so many guns sometimes i dont know how to pick em
first its the tec warning shots so i rip low
second is the 45 the feelin make me wanna grip mo
the third is the ar the shit got me walkin like my hip broke
i cant figure out what gun i wanna smoke you with but dont trip though
cause you can get em all you can get the 1 2 and the 3 like avocado intro

chokes

you look like one of them old ass hip hop fans that knows the words to every song

regulator
it was a clear black night a clear white moon
warren g was on the streets tryin to consume

game of thrones my gun dont got a body but my sword do
blades shiftin valerian steel they made different

lanes switchin usin 220 on the dash we race different
i land on the roof top of the hotel you pull up with a roof top to the hotel we stay different
breast milk baby similac bay we raised different

nigga owe you money you give them deadlines extension
a nigga owe me money its a dead line extension
cold killer oh you a drama starter
i catch you at the crib playin bones witcha girl
knife out put stake in ya company then turn around and hit you with the silent partner
quiet investor detective found stake in your company but couldnt find out where money came from cause i hit you with the silent partner1embed"
