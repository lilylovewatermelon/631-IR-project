hey girl you know you drive me crazy
one look puts the rhythm in my hand
still ill never understand why you hang around
i see whats going down
cover up with makeup in the mirror
tell yourself its never gonna happen again
you cry alone and then
he swears he loves you

chorus
do you feel like a man when you push her around
do you feel better now as she falls to the ground
well ill tell you my friend one day this worlds going to end
as your lies crumble down a new life she has found

verse 2
a pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
every action in this worldll bear a consequence
if you wade around forever you will surely drown
i see whats going down
