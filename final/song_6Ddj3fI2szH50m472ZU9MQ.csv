sunset broadway are all the streets i like
neon billboards that make me feel alive
i dont think they take me serious
normal life makes me delirious

prechorus
ever think of changin your name
for all the attention you could gain
has anybody told you youre vain
bow down bow down the sinners have the floor

chorus
why are we just junkies for fame
why because its burned in our
brains when we wake up then we need it to stay up
you know i like it ive always been a junkie for fame
why are we just junkies for fame
why

verse 2
