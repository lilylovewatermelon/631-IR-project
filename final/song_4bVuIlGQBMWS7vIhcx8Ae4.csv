i can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
that don’t bother me
i can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
i’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
even though goin on with you gone still upsets me
there are days every now and again i pretend i’m okay
but that’s not what gets me

chorus
what hurts the most
was being so close
and havin so much to say
and watchin you walk away
and never knowing
what couldve been
and not seein that love in you
is what i was tryin’ to do

verse 2
it’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere i go
but i’m doin’ it
it’s hard to force that smile when i see our old friends and i’m alone
still harder
gettin up gettin dressed livin’ with this regret
but i know if i could do it over
i would trade give away all the words that i saved in my heart
that i left unspoken
