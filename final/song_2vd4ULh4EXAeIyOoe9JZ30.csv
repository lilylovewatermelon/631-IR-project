it doesnt take much
to cover up small cuts
hid neath the bandages
under her sleeve

prechorus
she just wants attention
we all want attention
she just wants it more than
shed have you believe

chorus
goodnight sleep tight
dont let anyone bite
she will leave you deaf and bewildered
oh how she floats like a butterfly
stings like a killer

verse 2
all of the good kids
will darken their eyelids
cover in makeup
and uncomfortable dress

prechorus
they just want attention
we all want attention
a beautiful kiss and
a sin to confess

goodnight sleep tight
dont let anyone bite you
she will leave you deaf and bewildered
oh how she floats like a butterfly
stings like a killer

it doesnt take much
to cover up small cuts
hid neath the bandages
under her sleeves
