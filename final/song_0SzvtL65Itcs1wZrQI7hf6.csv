render unto geedorah what is geedorahs
ten to one he sees ya through a beaker and a tweezers
read the fine print and be like whats the big deal
spun wheels of steel since broke wheel big wheel
back when it was greasy scurl now its easy dread
had a rhyme on how they used to tease him bout his peasy head
yesyesyall to the beat have it bald or avacor
have it your way or grab his drawer jabberjaw
since two tone lees these new phonies is boney hos
lonely like cheese and bologna only
i couldve broke my sacrophillyac
silly grind billy jack illy nine milli black
listen to it go bang through and through a kangol
a strange combination of a king who teach slang flow
twothirds slow onethird amazing
wonder words fine sponsor of this thunderbird occasion
and have an iller rhyme at least by miller time
collect the skrilla and geese with a killer dime
met her out in killa queens originally she from the philippines
i love the way she fill her jeans
still a teen and made for strange bedfellows
okay so its head to elbows for shelltoes
uhoh heads up there she blows
a whole load of head  shoulders and who care where she goes
let the music take control
just dont let the evildoers abuse it and use it to take your soul
its like putting fire to fake gold it turn colors
and get duller than a bake roll with no butter
the shutter of a cake hole
who break drakes til it get old and flake mold
cornball have em seeing white stars i warned yall
like getting hit with a bottle of mo from sean paul
he not white  oh he mad light though
either which way they not ready for the lightning show
they cant scandalize mine
you could ask a swine who cant stands when i shine
geedorah the professor add a question to the lessons
he suggest you get a full assessment instead of guessing
its too stressing did he stutter like rookie yesmen
or did he just bring the butter like the cookie chessmen
this just in they aint even worth the worry
lying on their first birth and couldnt even hurt a smurfberry
hear ye hear ye how dare ye
go up against the king who do his thing triyearly
they too carefree with their mouths around here
off with his head and display it at town square
on top a sevenfeet spike make sure its on tight
in light of when the peasants throw stones with all their might
skull get smashed for weeks
til vulture beaks eats the last meat off the cheeks
maybe then theyll know the right words to speak
out loud at home in the world or in the streets
theres no escape just in case
all the kings mens and em decides to go apes
the most slicktalking of burly guys
get caught early and boiled in oil like curly fries
even those thats mr furleys size that earned the fate
can all get burned at the stake
send word to his closest kins that for his sins
we claim his throne his providence and its citizens
in the name of king geedorah
dont make him catch a seizure

we regret that you have not yet complied with our order
we interpret this as a negative reply
we are prepared therefore to conquer the earth
we have stationed king geedorah in the western hemisphere
geedorah was always one of their weapons
and king geedorah is completely controlled by our computers through magnetic waves
are you a homo like the others
we help thousands of homos every month
all i’m saying right…
is in the old days right
the women knew who the women were
the men knew who the men were
the women knew who the men were
and the men knew who the women were
im here to tell you that the future of your planet is at stake
i urge that you transmit that message to the nations of the earth
now do you feel like telling me where your leader is4embed"
