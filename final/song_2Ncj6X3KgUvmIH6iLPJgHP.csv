deep into the night
with the moonlight as my guide
i go wander through the pines
and make my way to natures shrines
and i look up to the sky
and i know youre still alive
but i wonder where you are
i call your name into the dark

prechorus
i wake up in the morning oh
and i dont know where ive been
all alone on a mountainside
and huddled in the wind

chorus
and it feels like ive been away for an era
but nothing has changed at all
and it feels like ive been with you
but oh what did you do and where have you gone

verse 2
on the night you disappeared
oh if i had seen you clear
but the strange light in the sky
was shining right into my eyes
there was no one else in sight
just the endless frozen pines
but i wonder how they know
cause they dont die if they dont grow

i am ready to follow you
even though i dont know where
ive been waiting the night
until you decide to take me there

chorus
cause i know i dont wanna stay here forever
its gotta be moving on
oh i dont wanna be the only one living
if all of my friends are gone

outro
i will be waiting for you
on the other side of the frozen pines
im gonna find a way through
theres another light beyond the lie
i will be waiting for you
on the other side of the frozen pines
im gonna find a way through
theres another life beyond the lie4embed"
