june fell for johnny on the forth of july
as the fireworks popped in the summer sky
with a spark in her eye she just there and stared
as his face lit up to the rockets red glare
and by september shed asked him for a wedding band
how could she know he was a rambling man
he walked out the door in the dead of the night
and a sleepy voice whispered as he turned out the light

chorus
where you gonna go
what you gonna do when you get there
who you gonna call when your road runs out at the sea
oh youre never gonna find
someone who loves you like i do
if you get tired of running
you can turn around and walk back to me

verse 2
he called up to tell her he missed her a lot
texas panhandle was as far as he got
hed run out money hed run of luck
hed run out of gas in his pickup truck
hitch a ride catch a train or a greyhound bus
cause theres a baby on the way and that makes three of us
and i need you here beside me i cant go it alone
she told him one more time then she hung up the phone

saying where you gonna go
what you gonna do when you get there
who you gonna call when your road runs out at the sea
you know youre never gonna find
someone who loves you like i do
when you get tired of running
you can turn around and walk back to me

verse 3
and the years just seemed to roll on by them
she missed him more and more every day
and that boy grew up to look and act just like him
and she knew some day soon hed be old enough to fly away

chorus
and shed say baby where you gonna go
what you gonna do when you get there
who you gonna call when your road runs out at the sea
you know youre never gonna find
someone who loves you like i do
when you get tired of running
you can turn around and walk back to me

outro
if you ever get tired of running
turn around and walk back to meembed"
