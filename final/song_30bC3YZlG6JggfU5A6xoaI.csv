this is beautiful disaster

verse 1
he drowns in his dreams
an exquisite extreme i know
hes as damned as he seems
and more heaven than a heart could hold

prechorus
and if i try to save him
my whole world would cave in
it just aint right
lord it just aint right

chorus
oh and i dont know
i dont know what hes after
but hes so beautiful
hes such a beautiful disaster
and if i could hold on
through the tears and the laughter
lord would it be beautiful
or just a beautiful disaster

verse 2
hes magic and myth
as strong as what i believe
a tragedy with
more damage than a soul should see
see kelly clarkson liveget tickets as low as 275you might also likeprechorus 2
but do i try to change him
so hard not to blame him
hold me tight
baby hold me tight

chorus
oh and i dont know
i dont know what hes after
but hes so beautiful
hes such a beautiful disaster
and if i could hold on
through the tears and the laughter
lord would it be beautiful
or just a beautiful disaster

verse 3
im longing for love and the logical
but hes only happy hysterical
im searching for some kind of miracle
waited so long
ive waited so long

bridge
hes soft to the touch
but frayed at the end he breaks
hes never enough
and still hes more than i can take
chorus
oh and i dont know
i dont know what hes after
but hes so beautiful
hes such a beautiful disaster
and if i could hold on
through the tears and the laughter
lord would it be beautiful
or just a beautiful disaster

outro
hes beautiful
lord hes so beautiful
hes beautiful
