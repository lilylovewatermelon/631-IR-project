when youre so lonely lying in bed
nights closed its eyes but you cant rest your head
everyones sleeping all through the house
you wish you could dream but forgot to somehow

prechorus
sing this lullaby to yourself
sing this lullaby to yourself

verse 2
and if you are waiting waiting for me
know ill be home soon darling i guarantee
ill be home sunday just in one week
dry up your tears if you start to weep

prechorus
and sing this lullaby to yourself
sing this lullaby to yourself

chorus
lullaby im not nearby
sing this lullaby to yourself
dont you cry no dont you cry
sing this lullaby to yourself

cause when i arrive dear it wont be that long
no it wont seem like anytime that ive been gone
it aint the first time it wont be the last
wont you remember these words to help the time pass

so when youre so lonely lying in bed
nights closed its eyes but you cant rest your head
everyones sleeping all through the house
you wish you could dream but forgot to somehow

chorus
sing this lullaby to yourself
sing this lullaby to yourself
sing this lullaby sing this lullaby
sing this lullaby to yourself1embed"
