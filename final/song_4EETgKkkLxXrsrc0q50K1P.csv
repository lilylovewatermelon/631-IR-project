the band was startin slow hand
about the time you walked in
i could see it in your eyes
you were heart broke and needin a friend
the singer started singin as i let you have my bar stool
and before that first chorus was through

chorus
you were already smilin
i said no use in tryin
open up a tab oh girl im gladly buyin
aint it funny thinkin you were thinkin you be drinkin alone
baby aint it crazy what can happen in half a song

verse 2
the second verse started
i asked you if youd like to dance
when you said no i figured well there goes my chance
but the singer kept on singin
and before he hit that chorus again

chorus
i felt you grab my hand
then we beelined to the floor like wed done this before
holdin onto you one two three four
spinnin and agettin in a rhythm girl it didnt take long
baby aint it crazy what can happen in half a song
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likeverse 3
that song ended said weve only got one more
now were halfway through and were still out here on the floor
wonder what youre thinkin
cause i think id like to drive you home
but i know thats probably never gonna happen
ill just settle for your number on a napkin
then again you never know what could happen in half a song
half a songembed"
