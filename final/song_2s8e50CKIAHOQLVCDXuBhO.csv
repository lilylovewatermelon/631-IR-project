dont disturb the beast
the temperamental goat
the snail while hes feeding on the rose
stay frozen compromise
what i will i am

verse 2
bend around the wind
silently blown about
again im treading so soft and lightly
compromising my will i am

chorus 1
i am i will
so no longer will i lay down
play dead play your doe

verse 3
in the headlight
locked down and terrified
your deer in the headlights
shot down and horrified
when push comes to pull comes to shove
comes to step around this selfdestructive dance
that never wouldve ended til i rose
i roared aloud here
i will i am

i am i will
so no longer will i lay down
lay dead play this
kneel down gunshy martyr pitiful
i rose i roared i will i am3embed"
