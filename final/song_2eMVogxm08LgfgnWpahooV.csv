and i dont know where you went when you left me but
says here in the water you must be gone by now
i can tell somehow
one hand on the trigger of a telephone
wondering when the call comes
when you say its alright
you got your heart right

prechorus
maybe ill sleep inside my coat and
wait on your porch til you come back home
oh right
i cant find a flight
we share the sadness
split screen sadness

chorus
two wrongs make it all alright tonight
two wrongs make it all alright tonight
two wrongs make it all alright tonight
two wrongs make it all alright tonight

verse 2
all you need is love is a lie cause
we had love but we still said goodbye
now were tired battered fighters
and it stings when its nobodys fault
cause theres nothing to blame at the drop of your name
its only the air you took and the breath you left

so maybe ill sleep inside my coat and
wait on your porch til you come back home
oh right
i cant find a flight
so i check the weather wherever you are
cause i want to know if you can see the stars tonight
it might be my only right

chorus
we share the sadness
two wrongs make it all alright tonight
split screen sadness
two wrongs make it all alright tonight
we share the sadness
two wrongs make it all alright tonight
split screen sadness
two wrongs make it all alright tonight

bridge
i called
because
i just
need to feel you on the line
dont hang up this time
and i know it was me who called it over but
i still wish youd fought me til your dying day
dont let me get away
outro
cause i cant wait to figure out whats wrong with me
so i can say this is the way that i used to be
theres no substitute for time
or for the sadness
two wrongs make it all alright tonight
split screen sadness
two wrongs make it all alright tonight
we share the sadness
two wrongs make it all alright tonight
split screen sadness
two wrongs make it all alright tonight
oh and the sadness its so right its so right
two wrongs make it all alright tonight
oh and the sadness its so right its so right
two wrongs make it all alright tonight
oh and the sadness its so right its so right
two wrongs make it all alright tonight
oh and the sadness its so right its so right
two wrongs make it all alright tonight5embed"
