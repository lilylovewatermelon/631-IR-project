ayo this is the infinite intelligent extravagant and eloquent
that shit yall talkin is irrelevant
i put it down from the gutter to the tenement
its ll cool j nigga everything i do is excellent
and i got to represent qboro the thorough

check this shit out right here uh

verse
e pluribus unum is the album ima drop
itll make your bitch nipples as hard as rocks
givin head to the glock pretend its hard cock
splashin niggas i came slow through the block
i the original visual individual
ten times platinum your careers lookin critical
rich from this motherfuck bein a criminal
look in your bitch eyes the vibe is subliminal
you wanna freestyle fuck that
i need at least seven figures to even touch that
but since everybody was underestimatin my format
i dropped ill bomb and now niggas want more of that
aint a rapper dead or alive fuckin with me
ask the last bitch that tried to come and get me
talk about paper i can talk about broads
i can talk about movies i can talk about awards
fuck the fantasies yo i got all four
and 2001 will be mine by law
whyd i name it greatest of all times
because for fifteen years i kept yall standin in line
lovin the way i shine and my lyrics combine
with the ruggedest illest beats that def jam can find
fuck them other niggas with their 9 or 10 hits
my hits run deep as the emotions of your bitch
back in the days it was the m5 stick
but now the bentley azure get more whores on the dick
this ones for clue and my rikers island niggas
that remember when i came through
the bing o b c c h d m 2 c 74
little nasi and the crew yall niggas come home

word up the new album gon be the shit baby
aint no doubt about it e pluribus unum
out of many one the goat greatest of all timeembed"
