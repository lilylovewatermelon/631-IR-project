love

verse 1
when i breathe then i breathe into you
and i feel you right to the bone
and i give what you give and we go
even higher than we are strong
and the cracks in the walls covered up
by the sheets we live underneath
all the sex all the nights we stay up
yeah were stuck but were more than free

prechorus
ooh ah ooh ah
got the world in our hand like a land

chorus
got enough to make the ocean look like its a pond
got enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
and we live like legends now know that well never die
we got love we got love
got enough to make the ocean look like its a pond
got enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
and we live like legends now know that well never die
we got love we got love

i can feel that you feel what i feel
and i feel it all in your hands
when we touch its too much and youre makin me move
yeah now make me dance
going body to body for good
saying nobody gets it right
we dont plan we dont care got the fume
and the flame we dont let it die

prechorus
ooh ah ooh ah
got the world in our hand like a land

chorus
got enough to make the ocean look like its a pond
got enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
and we live like legends now know that well never die
we got love we got love
got enough to make the ocean look like its a pond
got enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
and we live like legends now know that well never die
we got love we got love

bridge
love
perfect like a picture
i know we are one and the same
love
perfect like a picture
even when they look through the grains
mmm
chorus
got enough to make the ocean look like its a pond
got enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
and we live like legends now know that well never die
we got love we got love
got enough to make the ocean look like its a pond
got enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
and we live like legends now know that well never die
we got love we got love

outro
