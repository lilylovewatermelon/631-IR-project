she moved out of state and shit done went left shes seekin forgiveness
she used to dance but she want a loan to start up a business

verse 2
her daddy is not around mama is definitely not around
she got a business plan but she just aint had time to write it down
stay with her sister now she got a man but he out of town
soon as he out of town they hop in his whip and they ride around
i watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin slidin
thought about trappin a player before but that just aint right right
look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
you popped a 325 you feelin too good to worry tonight

verse 3
black boxes with the bow and rose
zara heels bound to give ya zara toes
back that thing up its a wide load shawty
i dont even know where the time goes shawty
know you got some brand new life goals
baby blue but you are not a baby i know shawty
i know yeah
so why you gotta be so hardheaded
why you wanna ask girl you know what i did
actin like you dont  already know what that is
baby just relax im on your side
i will not discuss it with nobody
neither of our pasts bout to go away
you made me forget about it anyway
i know i know
black boxes with the bow and rose
little side hustle with the fashion nova
know we both came from a broken home shawty
mom and daddy didnt really get along shawty
heard you got some brand new life goals
baby blue but you are not a baby i know shawty
i know know know know know37embed"
