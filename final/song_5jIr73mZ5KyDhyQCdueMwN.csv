you used to talk to me like
i was the only one around
you used to lean on me
the only other choice was falling down
you used to walk with me like
we had nowhere we needed to go
nice and slow
to no place in particular

chorus
we used to have this figured out
we used to breathe without a doubt
when nights were clear you were the first star that id see
we used to have this under control
we never thought
we used to know
at least theres you and at least theres me
can we get this back
can we get this back to how it used to be

verse 2
i used to reach for you when
i got lost along the way
i used to listen
you always had just the right thing to say
i used to follow you
never really cared where we would go
fast or slow
to anywhere at all

bridge
i look around me
and i want you to be there
cause i miss the things that we shared
look around you
its empty and youre sad
cause you miss the love that we had

interlude
you used to talk to me like
i was the only one around
the only one around
