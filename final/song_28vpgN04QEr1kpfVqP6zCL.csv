if you dont like our drinking
if you dont like our trucks
if you dont like our rifles buddy we dont give a buck

verse 1
some people got a problem with my rowdy friends and me
our kind of whiskeys never gonna be their cup of tea
sorry we aint sorry if it makes you feel that way
wed sure like to apologize but all we know to say is

chorus
if you dont like our drinking
if you dont like our trucks
if you dont like our rifles buddy we dont give a buck
if you dont like your country rocking bootin scootin loud
dont let that swinging door hit you if you on your way out

verse 2
i aint trying to disrespect you if we dont see eye to eye
you are cordially invited to blow us off tonight
the beers cheap and cold
theres enough to go around
wed love for you to be a part of this here party crowd but

chorus
if you dont like our drinking
if you dont like our trucks
if you dont like our shotguns we dont give a flying duck
if you dont like your country rocking bootin scootin loud
dont let that swinging door hit you if you on your way out
see lee brice liveget tickets as low as 88you might also likeoutro
if you dont like our drinking
if you dont like our trucks
if you dont like our rifles buddy we dont give a buck
if you dont like your country rocking bootin scootin loud
dont let that swinging door hit you if you on your way out
dont let that swinging door hit you if you on your way outembed"
