theres a place that i know
where the sycamores grow
and daffodils have their fun
where the cares of the day
seem to slowly fade away
in the glow of the evening sun
peace when the day is done

verse 2
if i go there real late
let my mind meditate
on everything to be done
if i search deep inside
let my conscience be my guide
thеn the answers are surе to come
dont have to worry none

verse 3
when you find peace of mind
leave your worries behind
dont say that it cant be done
with a new point of view
lifes true meaning comes to you
and the freedom you seek is won
peace is for everyone
peace is for everyone
peace is for everyonesee norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeembed"
