everything is fine now
let sleeping dogs lay
all our minds made up now
all our beds are made
no ones out of time no
chips fall wherever they may
leave it all behind
let the ocean wash away

prechorus
it never was about the money or the drugs
for you theres only love
for you theres only love
it never was about the party or the clubs
for you theres only love

chorus
cause youre my religion youre how im living
when all my friends say i should take some space
well i cant envision that for a minute
when im down on my knees youre how i pray

postchorus
hallelujah i need your love
hallelujah i need your love

everything is bright now
no more cloudy days
even when the storms come
in thee i will stay
no need to survive now
all we do is play
all i hear is music
like lay lady lay

prechorus
it never was about the money or the drugs
with you theres only love
with you theres only love
it never was about the party or the clubs
for you theres only love

cause youre my religion youre how im living
when all my friends say i should take some space
well i cant envision that for a minute
when im down on my knees youre how i pray
