i was walking down the street when out the corner of my eye
i saw a pretty little thing approaching me
she said i never seen a man who looks so all alone
oh could you use a little company
if you pay the right price your evening will be nice
and you can go and send me on my way
i said youre such a sweet young thing why you do this to yourself
she looked at me and this is what she said

chorus
oh there aint no rest for the wicked
money dont grow on trees
i got bills to pay i got mouths to feed
there aint nothing in this world for free
oh no i cant slow down i cant hold back
though you know i wish i could
oh no there aint no rest for the wicked
until we close our eyes for good

verse 2
not even fifteen minutes later im still walking down the street
when i saw the shadow of a man creep out out of sight
and then he swept up from behind he put a gun up to my head
he made it clear he wasnt looking for a fight
he said give me all youve got i want your money not your life
but if you try to make a move i wont think twice
i told him you can have my cash but first you know i gotta ask
what made you want to live this kind of life

he said there aint no rest for the wicked
money dont grow on trees
i got bills to pay i got mouths to feed
there aint nothing in this world for free
oh no i cant slow down i cant hold back
though you know i wish i could
oh no there aint no rest for the wicked
until we close our eyes for good

verse 3
well now a couple hours passed and i was sitting in my house
the day was winding down and coming to an end
and so i turned on the tv and flipped it over to the news
and what i saw i almost couldnt comprehend
i saw a preacher man in cuffs hed taken money from the church
hed stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills
but even still i cant say much because i know were all the same
oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills
chorus
you know there aint no rest for the wicked
money dont grow on trees
we got bills to pay we got mouths to feed
there aint nothing in this world for free
oh no we cant slow down we cant hold back
though you know we wish we could
oh no there aint no rest for the wicked
until we close our eyes for good70embed"
