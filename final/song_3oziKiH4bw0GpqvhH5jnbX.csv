bring your secrets to me
just give me your hands and ill let you feel the wounds
they put in me
if you believe in me how can i be dissolving
if youd believe me id tell you everything

do you want to try to pacify
fall into me fall into me fall into me
into me

verse 2
silence can you hear me
press me to your lips and ill suck the poison out
who will heal me me
if you keep killing me how can i keep absolving
your sins into me begin the poisoning

chorus
do you fall too every time that i
yes i fall every time that i
do you want to try to pacify
fall into me fall into me fall into me
