1st citizen meeting another hullo lamstad you here too

2nd citizen i go to every public meeting i do

3rd citizen brought your whistle too i expect

2nd citizen i should think so havent you

3rd citizen rather and old evensen said he was going to bring a cowhorn he did

2nd citizen good old evensen laughter among the crowd

4th citizen coming up to them i say tell me what is going on here tonight

2nd citizen dr stockmann is going to deliver an address attacking the mayor

4th citizen but the mayor is his brother

1st citizen that doesnt matter dr stockmanns not the chap to be afraid

peter stockmann for various reasons which you will easily understand i must beg to be excused but fortunately we have amongst us a man who i think will be acceptable to you all i refer to the president of the householders association mr aslaksen

several voices yes—aslaksen bravo aslaksen
dr stockmann takes up his ms and walks up and down the platform

aslaksen since my fellowcitizens choose to entrust me with this duty i cannot refuse

loud applause aslaksen mounts the platform

billing writing mr aslaksen was elected with enthusiasm

aslaksen and now as i am in this position i should like to say a few brief words i am a quiet and peaceable man who believes in discreet moderation and—and—in moderate discretion all my friends can bear witness to that

several voices thats right thats right aslaksen

aslaksen i have learned in the school of life and experience that moderation is the most valuable virtue a citizen can possess—

peter stockmann hear hear

aslaksen —and moreover that discretion and moderation are what enable a man to be of most service to the community i would therefore suggest to our esteemed fellowcitizen who has called this meeting that he should strive to keep strictly within the bounds of moderation

a man by the door three cheers for the moderation society

a voice shame

several voices shsh

aslaksen no interruptions gentlemen please does anyone wish to make any remarks
peter stockmann mr chairman

aslaksen the mayor will address the meeting

peter stockmann in consideration of the close relationship in which as you all know i stand to the present medical officer of the baths i should have preferred not to speak this evening but my official position with regard to the baths and my solicitude for the vital interests of the town compel me to bring forward a motion i venture to presume that there is not a single one of our citizens present who considers it desirable that unreliable and exaggerated accounts of the sanitary condition of the baths and the town should be spread abroad

several voices no no certainly not we protest against it

peter stockmann therefore i should like to propose that the meeting should not permit the medical officer either to read or to comment on his proposed lecture

dr stockmann impatiently not permit— what the devil—

mrs stockmann coughing ahemahem

dr stockmann collecting himself very well go ahead

peter stockmann in my communication to the peoples messenger i have put the essential facts before the public in such a way that every fairminded citizen can easily form his own opinion from it you will see that the main result of the medical officers proposals—apart from their constituting a vote of censure on the leading men of the town—would be to saddle the ratepayers with an unnecessary expenditure of at least some thousands of pounds
sounds of disapproval among the audience and some catcalls

aslaksen ringing his bell silence please gentlemen i beg to support the mayors motion i quite agree with him that there is something behind this agitation started by the doctor he talks about the baths but it is a revolution he is aiming at—he wants to get the administration of the town put into new hands no one doubts the honesty of the doctors intentions—no one will suggest that there can be any two opinions as to that i myself am a believer in selfgovernment for the people provided it does not fall too heavily on the ratepayers but that would be the case here and that is why i will see dr stockmann damned—i beg your pardon—before i go with him in the matter you can pay too dearly for a thing sometimes that is my opinion

loud applause on all sides
hovstad i too feel called upon to explain my position dr stockmanns agitation appeared to be gaining a certain amount of sympathy at first so i supported it as impartially as i could but presently we had reason to suspect that we had allowed ourselves to be misled by misrepresentation of the state of affairs—
dr stockmann misrepresentation—

hovstad well let us say a not entirely trustworthy representation the mayors statement has proved that i hope no one here has any doubt as to my liberal principles the attitude of the peoples messenger towards important political questions is well known to everyone but the advice of experienced and thoughtful men has convinced me that in purely local matters a newspaper ought to proceed with a certain caution

aslaksen i entirely agree with the speaker

hovstad and in the matter before us it is now an undoubted fact that dr stockmann has public opinion against him now what is an editors first and most obvious duty gentlemen is it not to work in harmony with his readers has he not received a sort of tacit mandate to work persistently and assiduously for the welfare of those whose opinions he represents or is it possible i am mistaken in that

voices from the crowd no no you are quite right

hovstad it has cost me a severe struggle to break with a man in whose house i have been lately a frequent guest—a man who till today has been able to pride himself on the undivided goodwill of his fellowcitizens—a man whose only or at all events whose essential failing is that he is swayed by his heart rather than his head

a few scattered voices that is true bravo stockmann

hovstad but my duty to the community obliged me to break with him and there is another consideration that impels me to oppose him and as far as possible to arrest him on the perilous course he has adopted that is consideration for his family—

dr stockmann please stick to the watersupply and drainage

hovstad —consideration i repeat for his wife and his children for whom he has made no provision

morten is that us mother

mrs stockmann hush

aslaksen i will now put the mayors proposition to the vote

dr stockmann there is no necessity tonight i have no intention of dealing with all that filth down at the baths no i have something quite different to say to you

peter stockmann aside what is coming now

a drunken man by the entrance door i am a ratepayer and therefore i have a right to speak too and my entire—firm—inconceivable opinion is—

a number of voices be quiet at the back there

others he is drunk turn him out they turn him out

dr stockmann am i allowed to speak

aslaksen ringing his bell dr stockmann will address the meeting

dr stockmann i should like to have seen anyone a few days ago dare to attempt to silence me as has been done tonight i would have defended my sacred rights as a man like a lion but now it is all one to me i have something of even weightier importance to say to you the crowd presses nearer to him morten kiil conspicuous among them

dr stockmann continuing i have thought and pondered a great deal these last few days—pondered over such a variety of things that in the end my head seemed too full to hold them—

peter stockmann with a cough ahem

dr stockmann —but i got them clear in my mind at last and then i saw the whole situation lucidly and that is why i am standing here tonight i have a great revelation to make to you my fellowcitizens i will impart to you a discovery of a far wider scope than the trifling matter that our water supply is poisoned and our medicinal baths are standing on pestiferous soil

a number of voices shouting dont talk about the baths we wont hear you none of that

dr stockmann i have already told you that what i want to speak about is the great discovery i have made lately—the discovery that all the sources of our moral life are poisoned and that the whole fabric of our civic community is founded on the pestiferous soil of falsehood

voices of disconcerted citizens what is that he says

peter stockmann such an insinuation—

aslaksen with his hand on his bell i call upon the speaker to moderate his language

dr stockmann i have always loved my native town as a man only can love the home of his youthful days i was not old when i went away from here and exile longing and memories cast as it were an additional halo over both the town and its inhabitants some clapping and applause and there i stayed for many years in a horrible hole far away up north when i came into contact with some of the people that lived scattered about among the rocks i often thought it would of been more service to the poor halfstarved creatures if a veterinary doctor had been sent up there instead of a man like me murmurs among the crowd

billing laying down his pen im damned if i have ever heard—

hovstad it is an insult to a respectable population

dr stockmann wait a bit i do not think anyone will charge me with having forgotten my native town up there i was like one of the ciderducks brooding on its nest and what i hatched was the plans for these baths applause and protests and then when fate at last decreed for me the great happiness of coming home again—i assure you gentlemen i thought i had nothing more in the world to wish for or rather there was one thing i wished for—eagerly untiringly ardently—and that was to be able to be of service to my native town and the good of the community

peter stockmann looking at the ceiling you chose a strange way of doing it—ahem

dr stockmann and so with my eyes blinded to the real facts i revelled in happiness but yesterday morning—no to be precise it was yesterday afternoon—the eyes of my mind were opened wide and the first thing i realised was the colossal stupidity of the authorities— uproar shouts and laughter mrs stockmann coughs persistently

peter stockmann mr chairman

aslaksen ringing his bell by virtue of my authority—

dr stockmann it is a petty thing to catch me up on a word mr aslaksen what i mean is only that i got scent of the unbelievable piggishness our leading men had been responsible for down at the baths i cant stand leading men at any price—i have had enough of such people in my time they are like billygoats on a young plantation they do mischief everywhere they stand in a free mans way whichever way he turns and what i should like best would be to see them exterminated like any other vermin— uproar

peter stockmann mr chairman can we allow such expressions to pass

aslaksen with his hand on his bell doctor—

dr stockmann i cannot understand how it is that i have only now acquired a clear conception of what these gentry are when i had almost daily before my eyes in this town such an excellent specimen of them—my brother peter—slowwitted and hidebound in prejudice— laughter uproar and hisses mrs stockmann sits coughing assiduously aslaksen rings his bell violently
the drunken man who has got in again is it me he is talking about my names petersen all right—but devil take me if i—

angry voices turn out that drunken man turn him out he is turned out again

peter stockmann who was that person

1st citizen i dont know who he is mr mayor

2nd citizen he doesnt belong here

3rd citizen i expect he is a navvy from over at—the rest is inaudible

aslaksen he had obviously had too much beer proceed doctor but please strive to be moderate in your language

dr stockmann very well gentlemen i will say no more about our leading men and if anyone imagines from what i have just said that my object is to attack these people this evening he is wrong—absolutely wide of the mark for i cherish the comforting conviction that these parasites—all these venerable relics of a dying school of thought—are most admirably paving the way for their own extinction they need no doctors help to hasten their end nor is it folk of that kind who constitute the most pressing danger to the community it is not they who are most instrumental in poisoning the sources of our moral life and infecting the ground on which we stand it is not they who are the most dangerous enemies of truth and freedom amongst us

shouts from all sides who then who is it name name

dr stockmann you may depend upon it—i shall name them that is precisely the great discovery i made yesterday raises his voice the most dangerous enemy of truth and freedom amongst us is the compact majority—yes the damned compact liberal majority—that is it now you know tremendous uproar most of the crowd are shouting stamping and hissing some of the older men among them exchange stolen glances and seem to be enjoying themselves mrs stockmann gets up looking anxious ejlif and morten advance threateningly upon some schoolboys who are playing pranks aslaksen rings his bell and begs for silence hovstad and billing both talk at once but are inaudible at last quiet is restored

aslaksen as chairman i call upon the speaker to withdraw the illconsidered expressions he has just used

dr stockmann never mr aslaksen it is the majority in our community that denies me my freedom and seeks to prevent my speaking the truth

hovstad the majority always has right on its side

billing and truth too by god

dr stockmann the majority never has right on its side never i say that is one of these social lies against which an independent intelligent man must wage war who is it that constitute the majority of the population in a country is it the clever folk or the stupid i dont imagine you will dispute the fact that at present the stupid people are in an absolutely overwhelming majority all the world over but good lord—you can never pretend that it is right that the stupid folk should govern the clever ones i uproar and cries oh yes—you can shout me down i know but you cannot answer me the majority has might on its side—unfortunately but right it has not i am in the right—i and a few other scattered individuals the minority is always in the right renewed uproar

hovstad aha—so dr stockmann has become an aristocrat since the day before yesterday

dr stockmann i have already said that i dont intend to waste a word on the puny narrowchested shortwinded crew whom we are leaving astern pulsating life no longer concerns itself with them i am thinking of the few the scattered few amongst us who have absorbed new and vigorous truths such men stand as it were at the outposts so far ahead that the compact majority has not yet been able to come up with them and there they are fighting for truths that are too newlyborn into the world of consciousness to have any considerable number of people on their side as yet

hovstad so the doctor is a revolutionary now

dr stockmann good heavens—of course i am mr hovstad i propose to raise a revolution against the lie that the majority has the monopoly of the truth what sort of truths are they that the majority usually supports they are truths that are of such advanced age that they are beginning to break up and if a truth is as old as that it is also in a fair way to become a lie gentlemen laughter and mocking cries yes believe me or not as you like but truths are by no means as longlived at methuselah—as some folk imagine a normally constituted truth lives let us say as a rule seventeen or eighteen or at most twenty years—seldom longer but truths as aged as that are always worn frightfully thin and nevertheless it is only then that the majority recognises them and recommends them to the community as wholesome moral nourishment there is no great nutritive value in that sort of fare i can assure you and as a doctor i ought to know these majority truths are like last years cured meat—like rancid tainted ham and they are the origin of the moral scurvy that is rampant in our communities

aslaksen it appears to me that the speaker is wandering a long way from his subject

peter stockmann i quite agree with the chairman

dr stockmann have you gone clean out of your senses peter i am sticking as closely to my subject as i can for my subject is precisely this that it is the masses the majority—this infernal compact majority—that poisons the sources of our moral life and infects the ground we stand on

hovstad and all this because the great broadminded majority of the people is prudent enough to show deference only to wellascertained and wellapproved truths

dr stockmann ah my good mr hovstad dont talk nonsense about wellascertained truths the truths of which the masses now approve are the very truths that the fighters at the outposts held to in the days of our grandfathers we fighters at the outposts nowadays no longer approve of them and i do not believe there is any other wellascertained truth except this that no community can live a healthy life if it is nourished only on such old marrowless truths

hovstad but instead of standing there using vague generalities it would be interesting if you would tell us what these old marrowless truths are that we are nourished on

applause from many quarters

dr stockmann oh i could give you a whole string of such abominations but to begin with i will confine myself to one wellapproved truth which at bottom is a foul lie but upon which nevertheless mr hovstad and the peoples messenger and all the messengers supporters are nourished

hovstad and that is—

dr stockmann that is the doctrine you have inherited from your forefathers and proclaim thoughtlessly far and wide—the doctrine that the public the crowd the masses are the essential part of the population—that they constitute the people—that the common folk the ignorant and incomplete element in the community have the same right to pronounce judgment and to approve to direct and to govern as the isolated intellectually superior personalities in it

billing well damn me if ever i—

hovstad at the same time shouting out fellowcitizens take good note of that

a number of voices angrily oho—we are not the people only the superior folk are to govern are they

a workman turn the fellow out for talking such rubbish

another out with him

another calling out blow your horn evensen

a horn is blown loudly amidst hisses and an angry uproar

dr stockmann when the noise has somewhat abated be reasonable cant you stand hearing the voice of truth for once i dont in the least expect you to agree with me all at once but i must say i did expect mr hovstad to admit i was right when he had recovered his composure a little he claims to be a freethinker—

voices in murmurs of astonishment freethinker did he say is hovstad a freethinker

hovstad shouting prove it dr stockmann when have i said so in print

dr stockmann reflecting no confound it you are right—you have never had the courage to well i wont put you in a hole mr hovstad let us say it is i that am the freethinker then i am going to prove to you scientifically that the peoples messenger leads you by the nose in a shameful manner when it tells you that you—that the common people the crowd the masses are the real essence of the people that is only a newspaper lie i tell you the common people are nothing more than the raw material of which a people is made groans laughter and uproar well isnt that the case isnt there an enormous difference between a wellbred and an illbred strain of animals take for instance a common barndoor hen what sort of eating do you get from a shrivelled up old scrag of a fowl like that not much do you and what sort of eggs does it lay a fairly good crow or a raven can lay pretty nearly as good an egg but take a wellbred spanish or japanese hen or a good pheasant or a turkey—then you will see the difference or take the case of dogs with whom we humans are on such intimate terms think first of an ordinary common cur—i mean one of the horrible coarsehaired lowbred curs that do nothing but run about the streets and befoul the walls of the houses compare one of these curs with a poodle whose sires for many generations have been bred in a gentlemans house where they have had the best of food and had the opportunity of hearing soft voices and music do you not think that the poodles brain is developed to quite a different degree from that of the cur of course it is it is puppies of wellbred poodles like that that showmen train to do incredibly clever tricks—things that a common cur could never learn to do even if it stood on its head uproar and mocking cries

a citizen calls out are you going to make out we are dogs now

another citizen we are not animals doctor

dr stockmann yes but bless my soul we are my friend it is true we are the finest animals anyone could wish for but even among us exceptionally fine animals are rare there is a tremendous difference between poodlemen and curmen and the amusing part of it is that mr hovstad quite agrees with me as long as it is a question of fourfooted animals—

hovstad yes it is true enough as far as they are concerned

dr stockmann very well but as soon as i extend the principle and apply it to twolegged animals mr hovstad stops short he no longer dares to think independently or to pursue his ideas to their logical conclusion so he turns the whole theory upside down and proclaims in the peoples messenger that it is the barndoor hens and street curs that are the finest specimens in the menagerie but that is always the way as long as a man retains the traces of common origin and has not worked his way up to intellectual distinction

hovstad i lay no claim to any sort of distinction i am the son of humble countryfolk and i am proud that the stock i come from is rooted deep among the common people he insults

voices bravo hovstad bravo bravo

dr stockmann the kind of common people i mean are not only to be found low down in the social scale they crawl and swarm all around us—even in the highest social positions you have only to look at your own fine distinguished mayor my brother peter is every bit as plebeian as anyone that walks in two shoes— laughter and hisses

peter stockmann i protest against personal allusions of this kind

dr stockmann imperturbably—and that not because he is like myself descended from some old rascal of a pirate from pomerania or thereabouts—because that is who we are descended from—

peter stockmann an absurd legend i deny it

dr stockmann —but because he thinks what his superiors think and holds the same opinions as they people who do that are intellectually speaking common people and that is why my magnificent brother peter is in reality so very far from any distinction—and consequently also so far from being liberalminded

peter stockmann mr chairman—

hovstad so it is only the distinguished men that are liberalminded in this country we are learning something quite new laughter

dr stockmann yes that is part of my new discovery too and another part of it is that broadmindedness is almost precisely the same thing as morality that is why i maintain that it is absolutely inexcusable in the peoples messenger to proclaim day in and day out the false doctrine that it is the masses the crowd the compact majority that have the monopoly of broadmindedness and morality—and that vice and corruption and every kind of intellectual depravity are the result of culture just as all the filth that is draining into our baths is the result of the tanneries up at molledal uproar and interruptions dr stockmann is undisturbed and goes on carried away by his ardour with a smile and yet this same peoples messenger can go on preaching that the masses ought to be elevated to higher conditions of life but bless my soul if the messengers teaching is to be depended upon this very raising up the masses would mean nothing more or less than setting them straightway upon the paths of depravity happily the theory that culture demoralises is only an old falsehood that our forefathers believed in and we have inherited no it is ignorance poverty ugly conditions of life that do the devils work in a house which does not get aired and swept every day—my wife katherine maintains that the floor ought to be scrubbed as well but that is a debatable question—in such a house let me tell you people will lose within two or three years the power of thinking or acting in a moral manner lack of oxygen weakens the conscience and there must be a plentiful lack of oxygen in very many houses in this town i should think judging from the fact that the whole compact majority can be unconscientious enough to wish to build the towns prosperity on a quagmire of falsehood and deceit

aslaksen we cannot allow such a grave accusation to be flung at a citizen community

a citizen i move that the chairman direct the speaker to sit down

voices angrily hear hear quite right make him sit down

dr stockmann losing his selfcontrol then i will go and shout the truth at every street corner i will write it in other towns newspapers the whole country shall know what is going on here

hovstad it almost seems as if dr stockmanns intention were to ruin the town

dr stockmann yes my native town is so dear to me that i would rather ruin it than see it flourishing upon a lie

aslaksen this is really serious uproar and catcalls mrs stockmann coughs but to no purpose her husband does not listen to her any longer

hovstad shouting above the din a man must be a public enemy to wish to ruin a whole community

dr stockmann with growing fervor what does the destruction of a community matter if it lives on lies it ought to be razed to the ground i tell you— all who live by lies ought to be exterminated like vermin you will end by infecting the whole country you will bring about such a state of things that the whole country will deserve to be ruined and if things come to that pass i shall say from the bottom of my heart let the whole country perish let all these people be exterminated

voices from the crowd that is talking like an outandout enemy of the people

billing there sounded the voice of the people by all thats holy

the whole crowd shouting yes yes he is an enemy of the people he hates his country he hates his own people

aslaksen both as a citizen and as an individual i am profoundly disturbed by what we have had to listen to dr stockmann has shown himself in a light i should never have dreamed of i am unhappily obliged to subscribe to the opinion which i have just heard my estimable fellowcitizens utter and i propose that we should give expression to that opinion in a resolution i propose a resolution as follows this meeting declares that it considers dr thomas stockmann medical officer of the baths to be an enemy of the people a storm of cheers and applause a number of men surround the doctor and hiss him mrs stockmann and petra have got up from their seats morten and ejlif are fighting the other schoolboys for hissing some of their elders separate them

dr stockmann to the men who are hissing him oh you fools i tell you that—

aslaksen ringing his bell we cannot hear you now doctor a formal vote is about to be taken but out of regard for personal feelings it shall be by ballot and not verbal have you any clean paper mr billing

billing i have both blue and white here

aslaksen going to him that will do nicely we shall get on more quickly that way cut it up into small strips—yes thats it to the meeting blue means no white means yes i will come round myself and collect votes peter stockmann leaves the hall aslaksen and one or two others go round the room with the slips of paper in their hats

1st citizen to hovstad i say what has come to the doctor what are we to think of it

hovstad oh you know how headstrong he is

2nd citizen to billing billing you go to their house—have you ever noticed if the fellow drinks

billing well im hanged if i know what to say there are always spirits on the table when you go

3rd citizen i rather think he goes quite off his head sometimes

1st citizen i wonder if there is any madness in his family

billing i shouldnt wonder if there were

4th citizen no it is nothing more than sheer malice he wants to get even with somebody for something or other

billing well certainly he suggested a rise in his salary on one occasion lately and did not get it

the citizens together ah—then it is easy to understand how it is

the drunken man who has got among the audience again i want a blue one i do and i want a white one too

voices its that drunken chap again turn him out

morten kiil going up to dr stockmann well stockmann do you see what these monkey tricks of yours lead to

dr stockmann i have done my duty

morten kiil what was that you said about the tanneries at molledal

dr stockmann you heard well enough i said they were the source of all the filth

morten kiil my tannery too

dr stockmann unfortunately your tannery is by far the worst

morten kiil are you going to put that in the papers

dr stockmann i shall conceal nothing

morten kiil that may cost you dearly stockmann goes out

a stout man going up to captain horster without taking any notice of the ladies well captain so you lend your house to enemies of the people

horster i imagine i can do what i like with my own possessions mr vik

the stout man then you can have no objection to my doing the same with mine

horster what do you mean sir

the stout man you shall hear from me in the morning turns his back on him and moves off

petra was that not your owner captain horster

horster yes that was mr vik the shipowner

aslaksen with the votingpapers in his hands gets up on to the platform and rings his bell gentlemen allow me to announce the result by the votes of every one here except one person—

a young man that is the drunk chap

aslaksen by the votes of everyone here except a tipsy man this meeting of citizens declares dr thomas stockmann to be an enemy of the people shouts and applause three cheers for our ancient and honourable citizen community renewed applause three cheers for our able and energetic mayor who has so loyally suppressed the promptings of family feeling cheers the meeting is dissolved gets down

billing three cheers for the chairman

the whole crowd three cheers for aslaksen hurrah

dr stockmann my hat and coat petra captain have you room on your ship for passengers to the new world

horster for you and yours we will make room doctor

dr stockmann as petra helps him into his coat good come katherine come boys

mrs stockmann in an undertone thomas dear let us go out by the back way

dr stockmann no back ways for me katherine raising his voice you will hear more of this enemy of the people before he shakes the dust off his shoes upon you i am not so forgiving as a certain person i do not say i forgive you for ye know not what ye do

aslaksen shouting that is a blasphemous comparison dr stockmann

billing it is by god its dreadful for an earnest man to listen to

a coarse voice threatens us now does he

other voices excitedly lets go and break his windows duck him in the fjord

another voice blow your horn evensen pip pip

hornblowing hisses and wild cries dr stockmann goes out through the hall with his family horster elbowing a way for them
the whole crowd howling after them as they go enemy of the people enemy of the people

billing as he puts his papers together well im damned if i go and drink toddy with the stockmanns tonight

the crowd press towards the exit the uproar continues outside shouts of enemy of the people are heard from withoutembed"
