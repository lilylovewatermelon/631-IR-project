i can picture you now taking your makeup off
you come into my room and you kiss my lips
but this hotel life im not used to it
and you wear your heart right on your sleeve
but it took you a while to open up to me
i still love the way that you smile when you leave

prechorus
and i know you get scared when im away
but i think about you almost all the day
and i promise you that ill be back again
just can you remember oh can you remember when we were

chorus
dancing in hotel rooms it was just me and you
we wouldnt sleep all night with you sitting by my side
and every moment we had stolen was a feeling
cause it never mattered where we were
cause we were falling in love
your heart is my home your heart is my home
your heart is my home and im not letting go

verse 2
when i was feeling down you always picked me up
it didnt matter what i was doin wrong cause
ive lived my life without you for too long
see dean lewis liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likeprechorus
but when i walked through the door and i saw your face
ooh i knew in that moment that my world had changed
how could i live my life since you been and gone
but can you remember just try to remember when we were

chorus
dancing in hotel rooms it was just me and you
and we wouldnt sleep all night with you sitting by my side
and every moment we had stolen was a feeling
cause it never mattered where we were
cause we were falling in love
cause your heart is my home your heart is my home
your heart is my home and im not letting go

bridge
but in any single moment you can change
cause ive been gone so long and i can feel you slip away but
im getting closer and closer
can you remember just try to remember when we were

chorus
dancing in hotel rooms it was just me and you
we wouldnt sleep all night with you sitting by my side
and every moment we had stolen was a feeling
cause it never mattered where we were
cause we were falling in love
cause your heart is my home your heart is my home
your heart is my home and im not letting go
outro
cause your heart is my home your heart is my home
your heart is my home and im not letting go
cause your heart is my home your heart is my home
oh your heart is my home and im never letting goembed"
