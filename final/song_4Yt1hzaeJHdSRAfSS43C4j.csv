gives you somethin you can do with your hands
makes you look cool and feel like a man
in the morning youll probably regret me
me and your cigarettes

verse 2
started young it’s too late to quit
most call it a bad bad habit
your mama told you you could end up dead
with me me and your cigarettes

chorus
always there every time you need me
it aint love but just like nicotine
you’re addicted to a feeling you can only get
from me and your cigarettes

verse 3
light us up and then throw us down
walk away when we hit the ground
how they gonna feel when you come back around here and see
it’s just you and your cigarettes

chorus
always there every time you need me
it aint love but just like nicotine
you’re addicted to a feeling you can only get
from me and your cigarettessee miranda lambert liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like2embed"
