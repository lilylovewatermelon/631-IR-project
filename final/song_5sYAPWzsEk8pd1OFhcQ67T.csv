im tearing up
across your face
move dust through the light
to fide your name
its something fane
this is not a place
not yet awake
im raised of make

chorus
still alive for you love
still alive for you love
still alive for you love

verse 2
in a mother out a moth
furling forests for the soft
gotta know been lead aloft
so im ridding all your stories
what i know what it is is pouring wire it up
youre breaking your groundyou might also like13embed"
