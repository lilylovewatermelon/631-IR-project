recording mr pickwicks determination to be present at an election and containing a manuscript of the old clergymans
a night of quiet and repose in the profound silence of dingley dell and an hours breathing of its fresh and fragrant air on the ensuing morning completely recovered mr pickwick from the effects of his late fatigue of body and anxiety of mind that illustrious man had been separated from his friends and fol lowers for two whole days and it was with a degree of pleasure and delight which no common imagination can adequately conceive that he stepped forward to greet mr winkle and mr snodgrass as he encountered those gentlemen on his return from his early walk the pleasure was mutual for who could ever gaze on mr pickwicks beaming face without experiencing the sensation but still a cloud seemed to hang over his companions which that great man could not but be sensible of and was wholly at a loss to account for there was a mysterious air about them both as unusual as it was alarming

and how said mr pickwick when he had grasped his followers by the hand and exchanged warm salutations of welcome—how is tupman

mr winkle to whom the question was more peculiarly addressed made no reply he turned away his head and appeared absorbed in melancholy reflection

snodgrass said mr pickwick earnestly how is our friend—he is not ill

no replied mr snodgrass and a tear trembled on his sentimental eyelid like a raindrop on a windowframeno he is not ill

mr pickwick stopped and gazed on each of his friends in turn

winkle—snodgrass said mr pickwick what does this mean where is our friend what has happened speak—i conjure i entreat—nay i command you speak

there was a solemnity—a dignity—in mr pickwicks manner not to be withstood

he is gone said mr snodgrass

gone exclaimed mr pickwick gone

gone repeated mr snodgrass

where ejaculated mr pickwick
we can only guess from that communication replied mr snodgrass taking a letter from his pocket and placing it in his friends hand yesterday morning when a letter was received from mr wardle stating that you would be home with his sister at night the melancholy which had hung over our friend during the whole of the previous day was observed to increase he shortly afterwards disappeared he was missing during the whole day and in the evening this letter was brought by the hostler from the crown at muggleton it had been left in his charge in the morning with a strict injunction that it should not be delivered until night

mr pickwick opened the epistle it was in his friends handwriting and these were its contents—

my dear pickwick—you my dear friend are placed far beyond the reach of many mortal frailties and weaknesses which ordinary people cannot overcome you do not know what it is at one blow to be deserted by a lovely and fascinating creature and to fall a victim to the artifices of a villain who had the grin of cunning beneath the mask of friendship i hope you never may

any letter addressed to me at the leather bottle cobham kent will be forwarded—supposing i still exist i hasten from the sight of that world which has become odious to me should i hasten from it altogether pity—forgive me life my dear pickwick has become insupportable to me the spirit which burns within us is a porters knot on which to rest the heavy load of worldly cares and troubles and when that spirit fails us the burden is too heavy to be borne we sink beneath it you may tell rachael—ah that name—

tracy tupman

we must leave this place directly said mr pickwick as he refolded the note it would not have been decent for us to remain here under any circumstances after what has happened and now we are bound to follow in search of our friend and so saying he led the way to the house

his intention was rapidly communicated the entreaties to remain were pressing but mr pickwick was inflexible business he said required his immediate attendance

the old clergyman was present

you are not really going said he taking mr pickwick aside

mr pickwick reiterated his former determination

then here said the old gentleman is a little manuscript which i had hoped to have the pleasure of reading to you myself i found it on the death of a friend of mine—a medical man engaged in our county lunatic asylum—among a variety of papers which i had the option of destroying or preserving as i thought proper i can hardly believe that the manuscript is genuine though it certainly is not in my friends hand however whether it be the genuine production of a maniac or founded upon the ravings of some unhappy being which i think more probable read it and judge for yourself

mr pickwick received the manuscript and parted from the benevolent old gentleman with many expressions of goodwill and esteem

it was a more difficult task to take leave of the inmates of manor farm from whom they had received so much hospitality and kindness mr pickwick kissed the young ladies—we were going to say as if they were his own daughters only as he might possibly have infused a little more warmth into the salutation the comparison would not be quite appropriate—hugged the old lady with filial cordiality and patted the rosy cheeks of the female servants in a most patriarchal manner as he slipped into the hands of each some more substantial expression of his approval the exchange of cordialities with their fine old host and mr trundle was even more hearty and prolonged and it was not until mr snodgrass had been several times called for and at last emerged from a dark passage followed soon after by emily whose bright eyes looked unusually dim that the three friends were enabled to tear themselves from their friendly entertainers many a backward look they gave at the farm as they walked slowly away and many a kiss did mr snodgrass waft in the air in acknowledgment of something very like a ladys handkerchief which was waved from one of the upper windows until a turn of the lane hid the old house from their sight
at muggleton they procured a conveyance to rochester by the time they reached the lastnamed place the violence of their grief had sufficiently abated to admit of their making a very excellent early dinner and having procured the necessary information relative to the road the three friends set forward again in the afternoon to walk to cobham

a delightful walk it was for it was a pleasant afternoon in june and their way lay through a deep and shady wood cooled by the light wind which gently rustled the thick foliage and enlivened by the songs of the birds that perched upon the boughs the ivy and the moss crept in thick clusters over the old trees and the soft green turf overspread the ground like a silken mat they emerged upon an open park with an ancient hall displaying the quaint and picturesque architecture of elizabeths time long vistas of stately oaks and elm trees appeared on every side large herds of deer were cropping the fresh grass and occasionally a startled hare scoured along the ground with the speed of the shadows thrown by the light clouds which swept across a sunny landscape like a passing breath of summer

if this said mr pickwick looking about him—if this were the place to which all who are troubled with our friends complaint came i fancy their old attachment to this world would very soon return

i think so too said mr winkle

and really added mr pickwick after half an hours walking had brought them to the village really for a misanthropes choice this is one of the prettiest and most desirable places of residence i ever met with

in this opinion also both mr winkle and mr snodgrass expressed their concurrence and having been directed to the leather bottle a clean and commodious village alehouse the three travellers entered and at once inquired for a gentleman of the name of tupman

show the gentlemen into the parlour tom said the landlady

a stout country lad opened a door at the end of the passage and the three friends entered a long lowroofed room furnished with a large number of highbacked leathercushioned chairs of fantastic shapes and embellished with a great variety of old portraits and roughlycoloured prints of some antiquity at the upper end of the room was a table with a white cloth upon it well covered with a roast fowl bacon ale and et ceteras and at the table sat mr tupman looking as unlike a man who had taken his leave of the world as possible

on the entrance of his friends that gentleman laid down his knife and fork and with a mournful air advanced to meet them
i did not expect to see you here he said as he grasped mr pickwicks hand its very kind

ah said mr pickwick sitting down and wiping from his forehead the perspiration which the walk had engendered finish your dinner and walk out with me i wish to speak to you alone

mr tupman did as he was desired and mr pickwick having refreshed himself with a copious draught of ale waited his friends leisure the dinner was quickly despatched and they walked out together

for half an hour their forms might have been seen pacing the churchyard to and fro while mr pickwick was engaged in combating his companions resolution any repetition of his arguments would be useless for what language could convey to them that energy and force which their great originators manner communicated whether mr tupman was already tired of retirement or whether he was wholly unable to resist the eloquent appeal which was made to him matters not he did not resist it at last

it mattered little to him he said where he dragged out the miserable remainder of his days and since his friend laid so much stress upon his humble companionship he was willing to share his adventures
mr pickwick smiled they shook hands and walked back to rejoin their companions

it was at this moment that mr pickwick made that immortal discovery which has been the pride and boast of his friends and the envy of every antiquarian in this or any other country they had passed the door of their inn and walked a little way down the village before they recollected the precise spot in which it stood as they turned back mr pickwicks eye fell upon a small broken stone partially buried in the ground in front of a cottage door he paused

this is very strange said mr pickwick

what is strange inquired mr tupman staring eagerly at every object near him but the right one god bless me whats the matter

this last was an ejaculation of irrepressible astonishment occasioned by seeing mr pickwick in his enthusiasm for discovery fall on his knees before the little stone and commence wiping the dust off it with his pockethandkerchief

there is an inscription here said mr pickwick

is it possible said mr tupman

i can discerncontinued mr pickwick rubbing away with all his might and gazing intently through his spectacles—i can discern a cross and a 13 and then a t this is important continued mr pickwick starting up this is some very old inscription existing perhaps long before the ancient almshouses in this place it must not be lost

he tapped at the cottage door a labouring man opened it

do you know how this stone came here my friend inquired the benevolent mr pickwick

no i doant sir replied the man civilly it was here long afore i was born or any on us

mr pickwick glanced triumphantly at his companion

you—you—are not particularly attached to it i dare say said mr pickwick trembling with anxiety you wouldnt mind selling it now

ah but whod buy it inquired the man with an expression of face which he probably meant to be very cunning
ill give you ten shillings for it at once said mr pickwick if you would take it up for me

the astonishment of the village may be easily imagined when the little stone having been raised with one wrench of a spade mr pickwick by dint of great personal exertion bore it with his own hands to the inn and after having carefully washed it deposited it on the table

the exultation and joy of the pickwickians knew no bounds when their patience and assiduity their washing and scraping were crowned with success the stone was uneven and broken and the letters were straggling and irregular but the following fragment of an inscription was clearly to be deciphered—

mr pickwicks eyes sparkled with delight as he sat and gloated over the treasure he had discovered he had attained one of the greatest objects of his ambition in a county known to abound in the remains of the early ages in a village in which there still existed some memorials of the olden time he—he the chairman of the pickwick club—had discovered a strange and curious inscription of unquestionable antiquity which had wholly escaped the observation of the many learned men who had preceded him he could hardly trust the evidence of his senses

this—this said he determines me we return to town tomorrow

tomorrow exclaimed his admiring followers

tomorrow said mr pickwick this treasure must be at once deposited where it can be thoroughly investigated and properly understood i have another reason for this step in a few days an election is to take place for the borough of eatanswill at which mr perker a gentleman whom i lately met is the agent of one of the candidates we will behold and minutely examine a scene so interesting to every englishman

we will was the animated cry of three voices

mr pickwick looked round him the attachment and fervour of his followers lighted up a glow of enthusiasm within him he was their leader and he felt it

let us celebrate this happy meeting with a convivial glass said he this proposition like the other was received with unanimous applause having himself deposited the important stone in a small deal box purchased from the landlady for the purpose he placed himself in an armchair at the head of the table and the evening was devoted to festivity and conversation

it was past eleven oclock—a late hour for the little village of cobham—when mr pickwick retired to the bedroom which had been prepared for his reception he threw open the lattice window and setting his light upon the table fell into a train of meditation on the hurried events of the two preceding days

the hour and the place were both favourable to contemplation mr pickwick was roused by the church clock striking twelve the first stroke of the hour sounded solemnly in his ear but when the bell ceased the stillness seemed insupportable—he almost felt as if he had lost a companion he was nervous and excited and hastily undressing himself and placing his light in the chimney got into bed

every one has experienced that disagreeable state of mind in which a sensation of bodily weariness in vain contends against an inability to sleep it was mr pickwicks condition at this moment he tossed first on one side and then on the other and perseveringly closed his eyes as if to coax himself to slumber it was of no use whether it was the unwonted exertion he had undergone or the heat or the brandyandwater or the strange bed—whatever it was his thoughts kept reverting very uncomfortably to the grim pictures downstairs and the old stories to which they had given rise in the course of the evening after half an hours tumbling about he came to the unsatisfactory conclusion that it was of no use trying to sleep so he got up and partially dressed himself anything he thought was better than lying there fancying all kinds of horrors he looked out of the window—it was very dark he walked about the room—it was very lonely

he had taken a few turns from the door to the window and from the window to the door when the clergymans manuscript for the first time entered his head it was a good thought if it failed to interest him it might send him to sleep he took it from his coat pocket and drawing a small table towards his bedside trimmed the light put on his spectacles and composed himself to read it was a strange handwriting and the paper was much soiled and blotted the title gave him a sudden start too and he could not avoid casting a wistful glance round the room reflecting on the absurdity of giving way to such feelings however he trimmed the light again and read as follows—

 a madmans manuscript

yes—a madmans how that word would have struck to my heart many years ago how it would have roused the terror that used to come upon me sometimes sending the blood hissing and tingling through my veins till the cold dew of fear stood in large drops upon my skin and my knees knocked together with fright i like it now though its a fine name show me the monarch whose angry frown was ever feared like the glare of a madmans eye—whose cord and axe were ever half so sure as a madmans gripe ho ho its a grand thing to be mad to be peeped at like a wild lion through the iron bars—to gnash ones teeth and howl through the long still night to the merry ring of a heavy chain and to roll and twine among the straw transported with such brave music hurrah for the madhouse oh its a rare place

i remember days when i was afraid of being mad when i used to start from my sleep and fall upon my knees and pray to be spared from the curse of my race when i rushed from the sight of merriment or happiness to hide myself in some lonely place and spend the weary hours in watching the progress of the fever that was to consume my brain i knew that madness was mixed up with my very blood and the marrow of my bones that one generation had passed away without the pestilence appearing among them and that i was the first in whom it would revive i knew it must be so that so it always had been and so it ever would be and when i cowered in some obscure corner of a crowded room and saw men whisper and point and turn their eyes towards me i knew they were telling each other of the doomed madman and i slunk away again to mope in solitude

i did this for years long long years they were the nights here are long sometimes—very long but they are nothing to the restless nights and dreadful dreams i had at that time it makes me cold to remember them large dusky forms with sly and jeering faces crouched in the corners of the room and bent over my bed at night tempting me to madness they told me in low whispers that the floor of the old house in which my father died was stained with his own blood shed by his own hand in raging madness i drove my fingers into my ears but they screamed into my head till the room rang with it that in one generation before him the madness slumbered but that his grandfather had lived for years with his hands fettered to the ground to prevent his tearing himself to pieces i knew they told the truth—i knew it well i had found it out years before though they had tried to keep it from me ha ha i was too cunning for them madman as they thought me

at last it came upon me and i wondered how i could ever have feared it i could go into the world now and laugh and shout with the best among them i knew i was mad but they did not even suspect it how i used to hug myself with delight when i thought of the fine trick i was playing them after their old pointing and leering when i was not mad but only dreading that i might one day become so and how i used to laugh for joy when i was alone and thought how well i kept my secret and how quickly my kind friends would have fallen from me if they had known the truth i could have screamed with ecstasy when i dined alone with some fine roaring fellow to think how pale he would have turned and how fast he would have run if he had known that the dear friend who sat close to him sharpening a bright glittering knife was a madman with all the power and half the will to plunge it in his heart oh it was a merry life

riches became mine wealth poured in upon me and i rioted in pleasures enhanced a thousandfold to me by the consciousness of my wellkept secret i inherited an estate the law—the eagleeyed law itself—had been deceived and had handed over disputed thousands to a madmans hands where was the wit of the sharpsighted men of sound mind where the dexterity of the lawyers eager to discover a flaw the madmans cunning had overreached them all

i had money how i was courted i spent it profusely how i was praised how those three proud overbearing brothers humbled themselves before me the old whiteheaded father too—such deference—such respect—such devoted friendship—he worshipped me the old man had a daughter and the young men a sister and all the five were poor i was rich and when i married the girl i saw a smile of triumph play upon the faces of her needy relatives as they thought of their wellplanned scheme and their fine prize it was for me to smile to smile to laugh outright and tear my hair and roll upon the ground with shrieks of merriment they little thought they had married her to a madman

stay if they had known it would they have saved her a sisters happiness against her husbands gold the lightest feather i blow into the air against the gay chain that ornaments my body

in one thing i was deceived with all my cunning if i had not been mad—for though we madmen are sharpwitted enough we get bewildered sometimes—i should have known that the girl would rather have been placed stiff and cold in a dull leaden coffin than borne an envied bride to my rich glittering house i should have known that her heart was with the darkeyed boy whose name i once heard her breathe in her troubled sleep and that she had been sacrificed to me to relieve the poverty of the old whiteheaded man and the haughty brothers

i dont remember forms or faces now but i know the girl was beautiful i know she was for in the bright moonlight nights when i start up from my sleep and all is quiet about me i see standing still and motionless in one corner of this cell a slight and wasted figure with long black hair which streaming down her back stirs with no earthly wind and eyes that fix their gaze on me and never wink or close hush the blood chills at my heart as i write it down—that form is hers the face is very pale and the eyes are glassy bright but i know them well that figure never moves it never frowns and mouths as others do that fill this place sometimes but it is much more dreadful to me even than the spirits that tempted me many years ago—it comes fresh from the grave and is so very deathlike

for nearly a year i saw that face grow paler for nearly a year i saw the tears steal down the mournful cheeks and never knew the cause i found it out at last though they could not keep it from me long she had never liked me i had never thought she did she despised my wealth and hated the splendour in which she lived but i had not expected that she loved another this i had never thought of strange feelings came over me and thoughts forced upon me by some secret power whirled round and round my brain i did not hate her though i hated the boy she still wept for i pitied—yes i pitied—the wretched life to which her cold and selfish relations had doomed her i knew that she could not live long but the thought that before her death she might give birth to some illfated being destined to hand down madness to its offspring determined me i resolved to kill her

for many weeks i thought of poison and then of drowning and then of fire a fine sight the grand house in flames and the madmans wife smouldering away to cinders think of the jest of a large reward too and of some sane man swinging in the wind for a deed he never did and all through a madmans cunning i thought often of this but i gave it up at last oh the pleasure of stropping the razor day after day feeling the sharp edge and thinking of the gash one stroke of its thin bright edge would make at last the old spirits who had been with me so often before whispered in my ear that the time was come and thrust the open razor into my hand i grasped it firmly rose softly from the bed and leaned over my sleeping wife her face was buried in her hands i withdrew them softly and they fell listlessly on her bosom she had been weeping for the traces of the tears were still wet upon her cheek her face was calm and placid and even as i looked upon it a tranquil smile lighted up her pale features i laid my hand softly on her shoulder she started—it was only a passing dream i leaned forward again she screamed and woke

one motion of my hand and she would never again have uttered cry or sound but i was startled and drew back her eyes were fixed on mine i knew not how it was but they cowed and frightened me and i quailed beneath them she rose from the bed still gazing fixedly and steadily on me i trembled the razor was in my hand but i could not move she made towards the door as she neared it she turned and withdrew her eyes from my face the spell was broken i bounded forward and clutched her by the arm uttering shriek upon shriek she sank upon the ground

now i could have killed her without a struggle but the house was alarmed i heard the tread of footsteps on the stairs i replaced the razor in its usual drawer unfastened the door and called loudly for assistance

they came and raised her and placed her on the bed she lay bereft of animation for hours and when life look and speech returned her senses had deserted her and she raved wildly and furiously

doctors were called in—great men who rolled up to my door in easy carriages with fine horses and gaudy servants they were at her bedside for weeks they had a great meeting and consulted together in low and solemn voices in another room one the cleverest and most celebrated among them took me aside and bidding me prepare for the worst told me—me the madman—that my wife was mad he stood close beside me at an open window his eyes looking in my face and his hand laid upon my arm with one effort i could have hurled him into the street beneath it would have been rare sport to have done it but my secret was at stake and i let him go a few days after they told me i must place her under some restraint i must provide a keeper for her i i went into the open fields where none could hear me and laughed till the air resounded with my shouts

she died next day the whiteheaded old man followed her to the grave and the proud brothers dropped a tear over the insensible corpse of her whose sufferings they had regarded in her lifetime with muscles of iron all this was food for my secret mirth and i laughed behind the white handkerchief which i held up to my face as we rode home till the tears came into my eyes

but though i had carried my object and killed her i was restless and disturbed and i felt that before long my secret must be known i could not hide the wild mirth and joy which boiled within me and made me when i was alone at home jump up and beat my hands together and dance round and round and roar aloud when i went out and saw the busy crowds hurrying about the streets or to the theatre and heard the sound of music and beheld the people dancing i felt such glee that i could have rushed among them and torn them to pieces limb from limb and howled in transport but i ground my teeth and struck my feet upon the floor and drove my sharp nails into my hands i kept it down and no one knew i was a madman yet

i remember—though its one of the last things i can remember for now i mix up realities with my dreams and having so much to do and being always hurried here have no time to separate the two from some strange confusion in which they get involved—i remember how i let it out at last ha ha i think i see their frightened looks now and feel the ease with which i flung them from me and dashed my clenched fist into their white faces and then flew like the wind and left them screaming and shouting far behind the strength of a giant comes upon me when i think of it there—see how this iron bar bends beneath my furious wrench i could snap it like a twig only there are long galleries here with many doors—i dont think i could find my way along them and even if i could i know there are iron gates below which they keep locked and barred they know what a clever madman i have been and they are proud to have me here to show

let me see yes i had been out it was late at night when i reached home and found the proudest of the three proud brothers waiting to see me—urgent business he said i recollect it well i hated that man with all a madmans hate many and many a time had my fingers longed to tear him they told me he was there i ran swiftly upstairs he had a word to say to me i dismissed the servants it was late and we were alone together—for the first time

i kept my eyes carefully from him at first for i knew what he little thought—and i gloried in the knowledge—that the light of madness gleamed from them like fire we sat in silence for a few minutes he spoke at last my recent dissipation and strange remarks made so soon after his sisters death were an insult to her memory coupling together many circumstances which had at first escaped his observation he thought i had not treated her well he wished to know whether he was right in inferring that i meant to cast a reproach upon her memory and a disrespect upon her family it was due to the uniform he wore to demand this explanation

this man had a commission in the army—a commission purchased with my money and his sisters misery this was the man who had been foremost in the plot to ensnare me and grasp my wealth this was the man who had been the main instrument in forcing his sister to wed me well knowing that her heart was given to that puling boy due to his uniform the livery of his degradation i turned my eyes upon him—i could not help it—but i spoke not a word

i saw the sudden change that came upon him beneath my gaze he was a bold man but the colour faded from his face and he drew back his chair i dragged mine nearer to him and i laughed—i was very merry then—i saw him shudder i felt the madness rising within me he was afraid of me

you were very fond of your sister when she was alive i said—very

he looked uneasily round him and i saw his hand grasp the back of his chair but he said nothing

you villain said i i found you out i discovered your hellish plots against me i know her heart was fixed on some one else before you compelled her to marry me i know it—i know it

he jumped suddenly from his chair brandished it aloft and bid me stand back—for i took care to be getting closer to him all the time i spoke

i screamed rather than talked for i felt tumultuous passions eddying through my veins and the old spirits whispering and taunting me to tear his heart out

damn you said i starting up and rushing upon him i killed her i am a madman down with you blood blood i will have it

i turned aside with one blow the chair he hurled at me in his terror and closed with him and with a heavy crash we rolled upon the floor together it was a fine struggle that for he was a tall strong man fighting for his life and i a powerful madman thirsting to destroy him i knew no strength could equal mine and i was right right again though a madman his struggles grew fainter i knelt upon his chest and clasped his brawny throat firmly with both hands his face grew purple his eyes were starting from his head and with protruded tongue he seemed to mock me i squeezed the tighter the door was suddenly burst open with a loud noise and a crowd of people rushed forward crying aloud to each other to secure the madman
my secret was out and my only struggle now was for liberty and freedom i gained my feet before a hand was on me threw myself among my assailants and cleared my way with my strong arm as if i bore a hatchet in my hand and hewed them down before me i gained the door dropped over the banisters and in an instant was in the street

straight and swift i ran and no one dared to stop me i heard the noise of the feet behind and redoubled my speed it grew fainter and fainter in the distance and at length died away altogether but on i bounded through marsh and rivulet over fence and wall with a wild shout which was taken up by the strange beings that flocked around me on every side and swelled the sound till it pierced the air i was borne upon the arms of demons who swept along upon the wind and bore down bank and hedge before them and spun me round and round with a rustle and a speed that made my head swim until at last they threw me from them with a violent shock and i fell heavily upon the earth when i woke i found myself here—here in this gray cell where the sunlight seldom comes and the moon steals in in rays which only serve to show the dark shadows about me and that silent figure in its old corner when i lie awake i can sometimes hear strange shrieks and cries from distant parts of this large place what they are i know not but they neither come from that pale form nor does it regard them for from the first shades of dusk till the earliest light of morning it still stands motionless in the same place listening to the music of my iron chain and watching my gambols on my straw bed

at the end of the manuscript was written in another hand this note—

the unhappy man whose ravings are recorded above was a melancholy instance of the baneful results of energies misdirected in early life and excesses prolonged until their consequences could never be repaired the thoughtless riot dissipation and debauchery of his younger days produced fever and delirium the first effects of the latter was the strange delusion founded upon a wellknown medical theory strongly contended for by some and as strongly contested by others that an hereditary madness existed in his family this produced a settled gloom which in time developed a morbid insanity and finally terminated in raving madness there is every reason to believe that the events he detailed though distorted in the description by his diseased imagination really happened it is only matter of wonder to those who were acquainted with the vices of his early career that his passions when no longer controlled by reason did not lead him to the commission of still more frightful deeds

mr pickwicks candle was just expiring in the socket as he concluded the perusal of the old clergymans manuscript and when the light went suddenly out without any previous flicker by way of warning it communicated a very considerable start to his excited frame hastily throwing off such articles of clothing as he had put on when he rose from his uneasy bed and casting a fearful glance around he once more scrambled hastily between the sheets and soon fell fast asleep

the sun was shining brilliantly into his chamber when he awoke and the morning was far advanced the gloom which had oppressed him on the previous night had disappeared with the dark shadows which shrouded the landscape and his thoughts and feelings were as light and gay as the morning itself after a hearty breakfast the four gentlemen sallied forth to walk to gravesend followed by a man bearing the stone in its deal box they reached the town about one oclock their luggage they had directed to be forwarded to the city from rochester and being fortunate enough to secure places on the outside of a coach arrived in london in sound health and spirits on that same afternoon

the next three or four days were occupied with the preparations which were necessary for their journey to the borough of eatanswill as any references to that most important undertaking demands a separate chapter we may devote the few lines which remain at the close of this to narrate with great brevity the history of the antiquarian discovery

it appears from the transactions of the club then that mr pickwick lectured upon the discovery at a general club meeting convened on the night succeeding their return and entered into a variety of ingenious and erudite speculations on the meaning of the inscription it also appears that a skilful artist executed a faithful delineation of the curiosity which was engraven on stone and presented to the royal antiquarian society and other learned bodies that heartburnings and jealousies without number were created by rival controversies which were penned upon the subject and that mr pickwick himself wrote a pamphlet containing ninetysix pages of very small print and twentyseven different readings of the inscription that three old gentlemen cut off their eldest sons with a shilling apiece for presuming to doubt the antiquity of the fragment and that one enthusiastic individual cut himself off prematurely in despair at being unable to fathom its meaning that mr pickwick was elected an honorary member of seventeen native and foreign societies for making the discovery that none of the seventeen could make anything of it but that all the seventeen agreed it was very extraordinary

mr blotton indeed—and the name will be doomed to the undying contempt of those who cultivate the mysterious and the sublime—mr blotton we say with the doubt and cavilling peculiar to vulgar minds presumed to state a view of the case as degrading as ridiculous mr blotton with a mean desire to tarnish the lustre of the immortal name of pickwick actually undertook a journey to cobham in person and on his return sarcastically observed in an oration at the club that he had seen the man from whom the stone was purchased that the man presumed the stone to be ancient but solemnly denied the antiquity of the inscription—inasmuch as he represented it to have been rudely carved by himself in an idle mood and to display letters intended to bear neither more or less than the simple construction of—bill stumps his mark and that mr stumps being little in the habit of original composition and more accustomed to be guided by the sound of words than by the strict rules of orthography had omitted the concluding l of his christian name

the pickwick club as might have been expected from so enlightened an institution received this statement with the contempt it deserved expelled the presumptuous and illconditioned blotton from the society and voted mr pickwick a pair of gold spectacles in token of their confidence and approbation in return for which mr pickwick caused a portrait of himself to be painted and hung up in the club room

mr blotton was ejected but not conquered he also wrote a pamphlet addressed to the seventeen learned societies native and foreign containing a repetition of the statement he had already made and rather more than half intimating his opinion that the seventeen learned societies were so many humbugs hereupon the virtuous indignation of the seventeen learned societies being roused several fresh pamphlets appeared the foreign learned societies corresponded with the native learned societies the native learned societies translated the pamphlets of the foreign learned societies into english the foreign learned societies translated the pamphlets of the native learned societies into all sorts of languages and thus commenced that celebrated scientific discussion so well known to all men as the pickwick controversy

but this base attempt to injure mr pickwick recoiled upon the head of its calumnious author the seventeen learned societies unanimously voted the presumptuous blotton an ignorant meddler and forthwith set to work upon more treatises than ever and to this day the stone remains an illegible monument of mr pickwicks greatness and a lasting trophy to the littleness of his enemiesembed"
