and my eyes get low in that allwhite truck i can barely see shit
and my eyes get low in that allwhite truck i can barely see
girl i might be

verse
and i overflow like mercury
glowing with uncertainty glowing with uncertainty
circles at the chevron girl i might be
i might be forever gone bitch i might be gone
and my eyes get low in that allwhite truck i can barely see shit
hit the gas like you wouldnt believe it
thank god i was always healing
in a time so slow i was thinking bout us rearranging pieces
speeding up on that allblack demon
going west i dont got no reasons
i was throwing stones at hercules
throwing them so perfectly
circles at the chevron
i cant be forever young

outro
empty choir operated from above
my voice will be their voice until im free
my hands will be their hands until im freeyou might also like22embed"
