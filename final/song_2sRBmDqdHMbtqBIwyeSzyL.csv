we talked
together sharpening a knife
like killing partners for a life
hey we can hide the bodies on the ride home
now here we are
were licking skin to wipe us clean
strike a match pour gasoline
ditch the scene and watch this city burn
asleep my lap will be a pillow steering wheel turn

chorus
ill be reaching for the stars with you honey
who cares if no one else believes
so i set fire to everyone around
but i told you i told you wed do it
so ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
yeah we won

verse 2
we drive
to leave the past and clear the mind
to watch the sunset set its time
i swear youll find im your ride home
now close your eyes
its getting dark and the highways clear
no sign of life from front to rear
its just you my dear on the ride home
were going home
see blue october liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
ill be reaching for the stars with you honey
who cares if no one else believes
so i set fire to everyone around
but i told you i told you wed do it
so ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
yeah we won

verse 3
we talked
together sharpening a knife
like killing partners for a life
hey we can hide the bodies on the ride home
cause were going home

chorus
ill be reaching for the stars with you honey
who cares if no one else believes
so i set fire to everyone around
but i told you i told you wed do it
so ha ha ha ha we won
ha ha ha ha oh yeah we won
ha ha ha ha we won
ha ha ha ha
yeah we won
