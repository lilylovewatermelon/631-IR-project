verse 1
im out the door its automatic simple babe
why you wanna do that to me
im like a fire bottle busting in your face
why you wanna do that to me
so tired of you being up in my space
what you gonna do with that
how much more could i take
im tired of privates driving
need a general that ainâ€™t weak

prechorus
when i shut the door leaving with my bag
hit the scene in my new wagon
bet he gonna wish he knew
the type of fun im getting into
peekaboo he good
