white shirt now red my bloody nose
sleepin youre on your tippy toes
creepin around like no one knows
think youre so criminal
bruises on both my knees for you
dont say thank you or please
i do what i want when im wanting to
my soul so cynical

chorus
so youre a tough guy
like it really rough guy
just cant get enough guy
chest always so puffed guy
im that bad type
make your mama sad type
make your girlfriend mad tight
might seduce your dad type
im the bad guy
duh

postchorus
im the bad guy

verse 2
i like it when you take control
even if you know that you dont
own me ill let you play the role
ill be your animal
my mommy likes to sing along with me
but she wont sing this song
if she reads all the lyrics
shell pity the men i know
