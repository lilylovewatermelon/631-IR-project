i’m smoking everywhere i go
no stick no seeds just al green
i always gotta keep one rolled
i keep that need that got that
i’m rolling every gram i own
that purp that bomb that kush
don’t gotta understand they know
i smoke that fire that good that good that

verse 1 snoop dogg
concentrated everyday i’m faded
trees prepared and properly cultivated
i nursed ‘em sprayed down no chemicals
just me and my buddy ya hear me now
never treat ya wrong to each his own
snoop and wiz the new cheech and chong
we up in smoke making street schemes
smoking sticky green having sweet dreams
break it down put it in the zi zag
and pull the top back and let the ass drag
hit the switch quickest way to get a bitch
executive branch get a whiff of this
black card sack of dank
high school nigga what the fuck you think
i’m passing all my classes with flying colors
and everyday i’m high as a muthafucker

i’m smoking everywhere i go
no stick no seeds just al green
i always gotta keep one rolled
i keep that need that got that
i’m rolling every gram i own
that purp that bomb that kush
don’t gotta understand they know
i smoke that fire that good that good that

verse 2 wiz khalifa
sun roof open smoking while i’m rolling
my bitches only notice it if its potent
bottle of perignon we can go kick it by the ocean
get in between your legs
joint roaches and ashes all in your bed
you calling her babe she calling me instead
cause i put that game all in her head
she saw the crib she know that i’m balling
when he aint have nothing he used to stall em
now i with the boss dogg all the bad hoes want him
and my pockets on swole i’m talking rick ross big
and now when we shop we don’t care what the cost is
rolling up good smoking that bomb shit
blow a whole oz nigga thats boss shit
now she all fuck her man rubberbands in my pocket
getting money going hard for my profit
bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings
young nigga out here getting bread why knock it
hook wiz khalifa  snoop dogg
i’m smoking everywhere i go
no stick no seeds just al green
i always gotta keep one rolled
i keep that need that got that
i’m rolling every gram i own
that purp that bomb that kush
don’t gotta understand they know
i smoke that fire that good that good that
