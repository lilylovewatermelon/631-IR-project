softness in your voice it reminds me of back home
sing you all the songs that i wrote when i was alone
and now i go out drinking with all my shameless friends
ive been having trouble just finding hope again

verse 2
i love it when youre laughing sprawled out on a picnic chair
restless in my mind dies out when youre right here
finally made it over that damn fouryear drought
ill thank you and you alone for draggin my ass out

chorus
well the love that you got
is the love that i need
its in the air of these hills
and the blood that i bleed
and the love that you gave
for the awful shape im in
led me through the day
so i can find my hope again

verse 3
and i hope we make it out of all these younger years alive
sittin under sundowns in about ten years time
and im just there grinnin over the shit that ive been through
saying ive made it over cause the hope ive found in you

well the love that you got
is the love that i need
its in the air of these hills
and the blood that i bleed
and the love that you gave
for the awful shape im in
led me through the day
so i can find my hope again

outro
well the love that you got
is the love that i need
its in the air of these hills
and the blood that i bleed
and the love that you gave
for the awful shape im in
led me through the day
so i could find my hope again1embed"
