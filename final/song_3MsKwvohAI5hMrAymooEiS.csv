chorus
together we cry
together we cry

verse 1
jenny was a poor girl living in a rich world
named her baby hope when she was just fourteen
she was hoping for a better world for this little girl
but the apple doesnt fall too far from the tree

prechorus
when she gets that call hopes too far gone
her babys on the way with nothing left inside

chorus
together we cry

verse 2
what about the john play could have gone the whole way
lighting up the stage tryna get a deal
now hes lighting up the wrong way
something for the pain
man you wanna see this kid he was so fucking unreal
see the script liveget tickets as low as 119you might also likeprechorus
when he gets that call hes too far gone
cant get it together to sing one song
they wont hear tonight the words of a lullaby

chorus
together we cry yeah yeah
together we cry
ooh together we cry oh we cry we cry oh we cry we cry
together we cry

verse 3
oh marys ambition she wanna be a politician
shes been dreaming about it since she was a girl
she thought shed be the one who could change the world
always tryna pave the way for women in a mans world
but life happened house kids two cars
husband hits the jar
checks that dont go very far now
now she aint making changes
she keeps her mind on her wages
the only rattling cages are her own

chorus
together we cry
together we cry
theres so much sad gonna flood the ocean
were all in tears for a world thats broken
together we cry oh we cry we cry oh we cry
bridge
there comes a time where every bird has to fly
at some point every rose has to die
its hard to let your children go leave home
whered they go who knows
getting drunk getting stoned all alone
teach a man to fish and feed a man for life
show your kids the truth hope they never lie
instead of reading in a letter that theyve gone for something better
bet youre sorry now i wont be coming home tonight
im sick of looking for those heroes in the sky
to teach us how to fly
together we cry we cry we cry

chorus
together we cry cry
together we cry
theres so much sad gonna flood the ocean
were all in tears for a world thats broken
together we cry
oh yeah
