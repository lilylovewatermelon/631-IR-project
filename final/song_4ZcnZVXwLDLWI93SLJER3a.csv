virginia was a lotlizard from fla
she had a compound fracture in the trunk
it started when she ran away
thumbs out on the interstate
she hitched a ride to misery
mr whirly had a catastrophic incident
he fell into the city by the bay
he liquidated his estate
now he sleeps upon the haight
panhandling misery

chorus
and hes gonna get high high high
when hes low low low
the fire burns from better days
and she screams why oh why
i said i dont know
the catastrophic hymns from yesterday
of misery

verse 2
well vinnie was a hustler out of amsterdam
he ran the drug cartel in tinseltown
they found him in a cadillac
bludgeoned with a baseball bat
in the name of misery
then gina hit the roads to new york city
mysteriously the night vinnie croaked
she stopped in vegas to elope
with virginia and the dope
and kissed the bride eternally
see green day liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likechorus
and theyre gonna get high high high
when theyre low low low
the fire burns from better days
and she screamed why oh why
i said i dont know
the catastrophic hymns from yesterday
of misery

bridge
well hellhounds on your trail now once again boy
its gropin on your leg until it sleeps
the emptiness will fill your soul with sorrow
because its not what you make its what you leave

interlude
ah

chorus
and were gonna get high high high
when were low low low
the fire burns for better days
and she screams why oh why
i said i dont know
the catastrophic hymns from yesterday
of misery12embed"
