what a shame what a shame we all remain
such fragile broken things
a beauty half betrayed
butterflies with punctured wings
still there are darkened places deep in my heart
where once was blazing light now
theres a tiny spark

prechorus
oh glory
come and find me
oh glory
come and find me 

chorus
dancing all alone to the sound of an enemys song
ill be lost until you find me
fighting on my own in a war thats already been won
ill be lost until you come and find me here
oh glory

postchorus
here

verse 2
what a mess what a mystery weve made
of love and other simple things
learning to forgive even when it wasnt a mistake
i question every human who wont look in my eyes
scars left on my heart formed patterns in my mind

oh glory
you will find me

chorus
dancing all alone to the sound of an enemys song
ill be lost until you find me
fighting on my own in a war thats already been won
ill be lost until you come and find me here
oh glory

outro
ill be lost until
like the moon we borrow our light
i am nothing but a shadow in the night
so if you let me i will catch fire
to let your glory and mercy shine22embed"
