and explaining where people belong
i hate ignorant folks that pay money to see gigs
and talk through every fucking song
i hate people in nightclubs snorting coke
and explaining where youre going wrong
well if you agree then come hating with me
and feel free to sing along
and it goes
la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
wonderful love it
well i hate pointless status updates on facebook
fyi we were never m8s
we pretend to be friends on the internet
when in real life we have nothing to say
to each other oh brother i have love for my mother
for good times for music and my mates
yeah i laugh and live and i have love to give
but sometimes all you can do is hate
and it goes
la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
well i hate them fussy eaters you cook them fajitas
they only eat pizza and chips
i hate stepping outside for a smoke and some guy
coughs like your lungs are his
and i hate queuing up for festival toilets
especially when you need to shit
and i hate the xfactor for murdering music
you bunch of money grubbing pricks
and it goes
la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
and i hate them magazines aimed at insecure teens
that make ten year olds race to grow up
hey kids lets all be anorexic or better
eat chocolate until you throw up
keep your hollywood stars and their stupid cars
and the botox that makes them look fucked
just grow old with grace have you seen chers face
it looks like its been hit by a truck
and it goes
la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
one more time loud as you can
la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
