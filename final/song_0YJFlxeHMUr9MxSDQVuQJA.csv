my turn ima shine wit this shit
sweat and tears i put my grind in this shit
feels fine when im ridin and shit
but it aint safe so i ride wit my stick
heart swollen use my chain gotta ice my shit
all i wanted was some ice so i ice my wrist
if my brother got funk then i ride wit him
we gon slide wit them poles we aint fightin niggas

verse 1
if you my brother take your funk like its mine
oh we gon slide we gon slide and we gon hit they block
i aint never been a fuck or a bitch nigga
i keep a mothafuckin glock wit a stick on me
if i got a fuckin problem ima trip on em
real nigga in my section ask yo big homie
oh when we ride they gon die they gon die
die when we ride

chorus
my turn ima shine wit this shit
sweat and tears i put my grind in this shit

but it aint safe so i ride wit my stick
heart swollen use my chain gotta ice my shit
all i wanted was some ice so i ice my wrist
if my brother got funk then i ride wit him
we gon slide wit them poles we aint fightin niggas

been through so much shit in my lifetime
put it all on the line i wont stop mine
oh used to have a little now i got a lot now
foreign car beepbeep when im back out
when i was down on my ass ran me up a check

dont need the crowd ima do this shit to the neck
suckas slide ima leave em on they fuckin back
oh give a fuck about a sucka nigga
slide down and im cluckin niggas
chains on my body i aint tuckin nigga
so im clutchin i aint never ever trusted a nigga
oh make these bands flip again
spend it all up and get rich again
in the hood so im ridin wit the stick again
might hit his ass up and plead the fifth again

chorus
my turn ima shine wit this shit
sweat and tears i put my grind in this shit
feels fine when im ridin and shit
but it aint safe so i ride wit my stick
heart swollen use my chain gotta ice my shit
all i wanted was some ice so i ice my wrist
if my brother got funk then i ride wit him
we gon slide wit them poles we aint fightin niggasembed"
