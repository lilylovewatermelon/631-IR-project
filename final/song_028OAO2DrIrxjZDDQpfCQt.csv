i miss your soft lips
i miss your white sheets
i miss the scratch of your unshaved face on my cheek
and this is so hard that i didnt see
that you were the love of my life and it kills me
i see your face in strangers on the street
i still say your name when im talking in my sleep
and in the limelight i play it off fine
but i cant handle it when i turn off my night light

break 1
but i cant handle it when i turn off my night light

chorus
they say that true love hurts
well this could almost kill me
young love murdered that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone ohoh
the life is fading from me while you watch my heart bleed
young love murdered that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone ohoh

verse 2
remember the time we jumped the fence when
the stones were playin and we were too broke to get in
you held my hand and they made me cry while
i swore to god it was the best night of my life
or when you took me across the world we
promised that this would last forever but now i see
it was my past life a beautiful time
drunk off of nothing but each other til the sunrise
you might also likebreak 2
drunk off of nothing but each other

chorus
they say that true love hurts
well this could almost kill me
young love murdered that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone lone
the life is fading from me while you watch my heart bleed
young love murdered that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone lone

bridge
it was a past life
a beautiful time
drunk off of nothing
drunk off of nothing but each other
drunk off of nothing but each other til the sunrise

chorus
young love murdered that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone
the life is fading from me while you watch my heart bleed
young love murdered that is what this must be
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone lone
outro
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone
and i would give it all to not be sleeping alone
i would give it all
i would give it all to not be sleeping alone1embed"
