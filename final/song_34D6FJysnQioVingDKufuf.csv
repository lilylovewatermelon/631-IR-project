verse 1 drake
oh yeah yeah
kept the galleria open til ten for you and your friends
you know how i spend in houston
i get too crazy had a little baddina
we stay good friends we get too wavy
all i know is that when this cup ends the next one begins
my bae you know me and you knew me back then
and you know how it goes when i see you again
you know im making my way to your ends
and you know i need you to be there for me

verse 2 drake
you a little post oak baby
you a little fortyeight baby
got a little candy in her pocket
she gon take off like a—
you already know know know know know
dirtied up a cup im on the northside
text you but i know you probably courtside
no i got to come and check the whole man baby hold tight
i just touched the city with the gblock stainers
and we got it adopted by some fifth ward strangers
you know what it means when i twist these fingers
me and you been on a first name basis
why you think i hate it when you talk that drake shit
same reason that you never left me hangin
same reason that i tried to make you famous
same reason that i tried to show you just who i was
see drake liveget tickets as low as 89you might also likechorus drake
outside of the club outside the things that a man like me does
outside of the things that would cause you to judge
outside of the club
show you just who i was
outside of the club outside the things that a man like me does
outside of the things that would cause you to judge
outside of the club

interlude
