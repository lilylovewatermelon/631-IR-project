verse 3 tech n9ne
friend this industry is no kin to me
behold the flow of the century
but they scared of me
rappers they dont compare to me
fair to be said that they dares to be sincerely a rarity wow
check the soundscan look around man
wake up look at your jacob you in killa clown land
face paint and juggalettes with bubble butts
and we rockin plus the diddy women in the button ups
hands down we rock harder than kiss
but rap me kutt and krizz
but can i get two stomps and a clap in this bitch
n9na shot to the top cause i plots to get rich
tell ya executive im next for this
success it is yep the best for tech
this aint baptist pentecostal or methodist
this is the beast baby out i mean exodus
