two oruguitas in love and yearning
spend every evening and morning learnin
to hold each other their hunger burnin
to navigate a world
that turns and never stops turnin
together in this world
that turns and never stops turnin

verse 2
two oruguitas against the weather
the wind grows colder but theyre together
they hold each other no way of knowin
theyre all they have for shelter
and something inside them is growing
they long to stay togethеr
but something inside them is growing

chorus
ay oruguitas dont you hold on too tight
both of you know its your timе to grow to fall apart to reunite
wonders await you just on the other side
trust theyll be there and start to prepare the way for tomorrow
ay oruguitas dont you hold on too tight
both of you know its your time to grow to fall apart to reunite
wonders await you just on the other side
trust theyll be there and start to prepare the way for tomorrow

verse 3
two oruguitas cocooned and waiting
each in their own world anticipating
what happens after the rearranging
and so afraid of change
in a world that never stops changing
so let the walls come down
the world will never stop changing never stop changing
never stop changing never stop changing

chorus
ay mariposas dont you hold on too tight
both of you know its your time to go to fly apart to reunite
wonders surround you just let the walls come down
dont look behind you fly til you find your way toward tomorrow
ay mariposas dont you hold on too tight
both of you know its your time to go to fly apart to reunite
wonders surround you just let the walls come down
dont look behind you fly til you find your way toward tomorrow
ay mariposas dont you hold on too tight
both of you know its your time to go to fly apart to reunite
wonders surround you just let the walls come down
dont look behind you fly til you find your way toward tomorrow3embed"
