i thought that i had everybody on my side
but i went and blew it all sky high
and now she wont even spare a passing glance
all just because i ripped my pants
chorus the losers of the beach
when big larry came round just to put him down
spongebob turned into a clown
and no girl ever wants to dance
with a fool who went and ripped his pants
verse the losers of the beach
i know i shouldnt mope around i shouldnt curse
but the pain feels so much worse
cause windin up with no one is a lot less fun
than a burn from the sun
or sand in your buns
outro spongebob squarepants  the losers of the beach
now i learned a lesson i wont soon forget
so listen and you wont regret
be true to yourself dont miss your chance
and you wont end up like the fool who ripped his pantsyou might also like6embed"
