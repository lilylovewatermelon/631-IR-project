i work down at the pizza pit
and i drive an old hyundai

im a scifi fanatic mild asthmatic
ive never been to second base
but theres a whole nother me you need to see

im sixfootfive and i look damn good
i drive a maserati im a black belt in karate
and i love a good glass of wine
it turns girls on that im mysterious
i tell em i dont want nothin serious
cause even on a slow day i can have a threeway
chat with two women at one time

verse 2
i get home i kiss my mom
and she fixes me a snack
i head down to my basement bedroom
and fire up my mac
in real life the only time ive
ever even been to la
was when i got the chance with the marchin band
to play tuba in the rose parade
