left her in the trunk on highway 10

verse 1
im not a wandering slave i am a woman of choice
my veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
you ought to pity me cause was arranged one man to love
but in the bedroom the size of hims more than enough

chorus
do you wanna see me naked lover
do you wanna peek underneath the cover
do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura behind the aura
do you wanna touch me cosmic lover
do you wanna peek underneath the cover
do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura
behind the aura behind the aura behind the aura

enigma popstar is fun she wear burqa for fashion
its not a statement as much as just a move of passion
i may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
i hear you screaming is it because of pleasure or toil

chorus
do you wanna see me naked lover
do you wanna peek underneath the cover
do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura behind the aura
do you wanna touch me cosmic lover
do you wanna peek underneath the cover
do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura
behind the aura behind the curtain behind the burqa
