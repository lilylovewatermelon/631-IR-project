youre the kind of man
that takes what he can
and doesnt ask
well this trait i cant condone
but i am told that in this state
i acquiesce

occasionally a man for free
is exactly what i need
and how long has it been since i have given in
to what i see was right in front of me

prechorus
now i am all alone and far from home
and i dont always know whats good for me
the more time that we spend in my bed
and youre playing with my head
i get turned around around round

chorus
cause you use me up
and you wear me down
when im ahead i give up
when im glad i frown
oh im this way and im that way
cause its your way or the highway
see lake street dive liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likecause you use me up you use me up
and you wear me down and you wear me down
oh you use me up you use me up
and you wear me down

verse 2
well youre the kind of man
that wants what he cant have
and so he goes
i guess that im the same
so whos to blame
just the same id like to know

occasionally some room to breathe
is exactly what i need
and how long has it been since i have had a friend
thatll make me see whats right in front of me

prechorus
now i am all alone and far from home
and i dont always know whats good for me
the more time that we spend in my bed
and youre playing with my head
i get turned around around around
ooh
chorus
cause you use me up cause you use me up
and you wear me down and you wear me down
when im ahead i give up im ahead give up
when im glad im frown when im glad i–
oh im this way and im that way ooh
cause its your way or the highway ooh

oh you use me up cause you use me up
and you wear me down and you wear me down
when im ahead i give up im ahead give up
when im glad im frown when im glad i–
oh im this way and im that way ooh
cause its your way or the highway ooh

you use me up you use me up
and you wear me down and you wear me down
oh you use me up you use me up
and you wear me down and you wear me down
