lowkey no pressure
just hang with me and my weather
lowkey no pressure
just hang with me and my weather

verse 1
rosecolored boy
i hear you makin all that noise about the world you want to see
and oh im so annoyed
cause i just killed off what was left of the optimist in me

prechorus
and ooh hearts are breakin and wars are ragin on
and i have taken uh my glasses off
you got me nervous im right at the end of my rope
a halfempty girl dont make me laugh ill choke

chorus
just let me cry a little bit longer
i aint gon smile if i dont want to
hey man we all cant be like you
i wish we were all rosecolored too
my rosecolored boy

postchorus
lowkey no pressure

and really all ive got is just to stay pissed off

i say well maybe if you wanna go blind
you say my eyes are gettin too dark now
but boy you aint ever seen my mind
