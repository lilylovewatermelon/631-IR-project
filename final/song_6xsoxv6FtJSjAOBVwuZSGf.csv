you like control well i do too
take off my clothes and watch me move
you can come closer ill let you hurt me

help me with the zipper on my skirt its stuck
as you kneel ill be watching you fix me
this view of you of the top of your head makes me forgive you

chorus 1
but how long how long can we play this way
im tired im tired of not loving you
my heart my heart wants to hold you
but i know i know i know the rules

verse 3
blue light dark room the white of your teeth
as you smile at my trembling shoulders
but your skin did you notice your skin
it cries a soft weep like mine
