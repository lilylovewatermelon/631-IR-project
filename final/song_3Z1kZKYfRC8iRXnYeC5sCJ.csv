verse 1 taylor swift
all i knew this morning when i woke
is i know something now

and all ive seen since 18 hours ago
is green eyes and freckles and your smile
in the back of my mind making me feel like

prechorus taylor swift   ed sheeran
i just wanna know you better
know you better know you better now
i just wanna know you better

chorus taylor swift  ed sheeran
cause all i know is we said hello
and your eyes look like coming home
all i know is a simple name
and everything has changed
