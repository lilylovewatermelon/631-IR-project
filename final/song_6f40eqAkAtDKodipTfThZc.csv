if you get a little dirt on your new boots
if you roll in late to work from hittin snooze
if them school boys aint got no luck cause you start turnin your nose up
at them downtown lights cause they aint your kind of view
i hope the next boy that falls for you dont blame you

chorus
if you roll your eyes when them other guys try to take you out on the city
if you quit sippin wine and you start likin shootin whiskey
if you start talkin with a drawl and feelin all kinds of pretty
if youre up to see the sun before you fall asleep
oh baby blame it on me
oh baby blame it on me

verse 2
if your friends start asking you whats going on
cause all you wanna hear is them country songs
if you start takin gravel roads and stoppin off at texacos
and you wanna watch the full moon all night long its my fault ha

chorus
if you roll your eyеs when them other guys try to takе you out on the city
if you quit sippin wine and you start likin shootin whiskey
if you start talkin with a drawl and feelin all kinds of pretty
if youre up to see the sun before you fall asleep
oh baby blame it on me
oh baby blame it on me

forgive me if i set the bar too high
with a sixpack and a bass boat fishtail slide
if them weekend boys get boring i dont mean to wreck it for you
yeah its my bad girl if you had the time of your life
its all right

chorus
if you roll your eyes when them other guys try to take you out on the city
if you quit sippin wine and you start likin shootin whiskey
if you start talkin with a drawl and feelin all kinds of pretty
if youre up to see the sun before you fall asleep
oh baby blame it on me
oh baby blame it on me

outro

oh blame it on oh blame it on
