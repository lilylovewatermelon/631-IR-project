its gonna take a little time while youre waiting like a factory line
ill ride across the park backseat on the 79
wasted days youve come to pass
so go i know you would not stay
it wasnt true but anyway
pollination yellow cab

refrain
ohh ohh

verse 2
you walk up the stairs see the french kids by the door
up one more flight see the buddha on the second floor
coronation rickshaw grab
so go i know you would not stay
it wasnt true but anyway
racist dreams you should not have

refrain
ohh ohh

no excuse to be so callous
dress yourself in bleeding madras
charm your way across the khyber pass
stay awake to break the habit
sing in praise of jackson crowter
watch your step along the arch of
