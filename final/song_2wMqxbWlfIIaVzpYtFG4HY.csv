this is the first thing i remember
now its the last thing left on my mind
afraid of the dark do you hear me whisper
an empty heart replaced with paranoia
where do we go lifes temporary
after were gone like new years resolutions
why is this hard do you recognize me
i know im wrong but i cant help believing

verse mark hoppus
im so lost im barely here
i wish i could explain myself but words escape me
its too late to save me
youre too late youre too late

bridge mark hoppus
youre cold with disappointment while im drowning in the next room
the last contagious victim of this plague between us
im sick with apprehension im crippled from exhaustion
and i dread the moment when you finally come to kill me
chorus tom delonge  mark hoppus
this is the first thing i remember
now its the last thing left on my mind
afraid of the dark do you hear me whisper
an empty heart replaced with paranoia
where do we go lifes temporary
after were gone like new years resolutions
why is this hard do you recognize me
i know im wrong but i cant help believingyou might also like10embed"
