i was a quick wet boy
diving too deep for coins
all of your street light eyes
wide on my plastic toys
then when the cops closed the fair
i cut my long baby hair
stole me a dogeared map
and called for you everywhere

chorus
have i found you flightless bird
jealous weeping
or lost you american mouth
big pill looming

verse 2
now im a fat house cat
nursing my sore blunt tongue
watching the warm poison rats
curl through the wide fence cracks
pissing on magazine photos
those fishing lures
thrown in the cold and clean
blood of christ mountain stream
see iron  wine liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likechorus
have i found you flightless bird
grounded bleeding
or lost you american mouth
big pill stuck going down50embed"
