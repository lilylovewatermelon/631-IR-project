one snap for the dying
one click to end the day
another story with a mangled scene
it couldnt happen any other way
you wanna talk about it
im begging you to walk in my shoes any time
watch the clock til you unwind
you wanna cry about it
its making me consider that ive lost my mind
the way i see you must be blind
so this is the world you left behind
this is the guilt that consumes you

chorus
so die alone
this is the one thing that i wont do
so say your prayers
cause i aint leaving here without you

verse 2
cant bribe me with money
cant shower me with shame
another killer from a broken home
until you cover me with manic fame
you wanna know about it
but ima be fucking with you every time
story broken youre behind
and when you ask about it
you can rest assured ill give you my best side
seems we all have friends to find
so this is the hate ive been born to
full are the tales of the untrue
see avenged sevenfold liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
so die alone
this is the one thing that i wont do
so say your prayers
cause i aint leaving here without you

guitar solo

bridge
and im waiting
waiting for the days to slowly pass me by
and all the promises ill find
no hesitating
you pull the trigger now your storys left behind
i know you wanna see me fry
like my soul you wont survive

guitar solo

chorus
so die alone
this is the one thing that i wont do
so say your prayers
cause i aint leaving here without you

outro
to die unknown
would crush the fishlens we all see through
to kill the glare
expose the ugliness we hold true9embed"
