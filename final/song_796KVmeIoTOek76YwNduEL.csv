take another look around and find someone else to play
needless to say that youve got problems
theres no fuckin way that im gonna solve them
its never the same every time you slip then you fall down down down

ever wonder what i been thinkin about 
i been thinkin bout throwin you out

im so happy about you im fed up so get up and get out
im so happy now were through im fed up so get up and get out
i was so afraid now youre gone away
sent you packing look whos laughin now
im so happy that i feel this way
im so happy that i threw you away

put your problems down and pick up whats left of the pain
take a good look at yourself and see whos really to blame
needless to say you got issues
theres no fuckin way that im gonna fix you
its never the same ever since you went fallin down down down

ever wonder what i been thinkin about 
i been thinkin bout throwin you out

im so happy about you im fed up so get up and get out
im so happy now were through im fed up so get up and get out
i was so afraid now youre gone away
sent you packing look whos laughin now
im so happy that i feel this way
