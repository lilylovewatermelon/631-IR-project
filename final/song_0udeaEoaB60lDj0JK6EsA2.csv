verse 1
lonely longin troubadour i know that youve been here before
but there aint no cure for a restless man
if you came to run from your bad reputation
to sleep in wherever you land
what state you in tonight and did you get into a fight
are you more drunk than you were last week
when i call you on the phone you are never alone
and your jaws sewn closed when you speak

chorus
she said run down the road go where you need to go
but i need you to understand
there aint no homе and there is no cure
for a nogood ramblin man

verse 2
lonеly longin troubadour you aint the boy you were before
this world has truly thickened your skin
cause everyone you talk to acts like they walked through
hell with you way back when
who are you to say i cant live this way
i was born to be a man of the night
im twelve foot tall and im livin proof
that highway boys dont die

she said run down the road go where you need to go
but i need you to understand
there aint no home and there is no cure
for a nogood ramblin man

outro
she said run down the road go where you need to go
but i need you to understand
there aint no home and there is no cure
for a nogood ramblin manembed"
