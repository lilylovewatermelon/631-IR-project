if you think i couldnt hold my own believe me i can
believe me i can believe me i can
if it aint so awful and were all together i can
believe me i can believe me i can
if you think i couldnt roll with you believe me i can
believe me i can believe me i can
if ideally we should feel like this forever i can
believe me i can believe me i can

breathe a little deeper

and let those colours run

so do this and get through this
and come find me when youre done
so we can be as one

if you think no one is feeling what youre feeling i am
believe me i am believe me i am
