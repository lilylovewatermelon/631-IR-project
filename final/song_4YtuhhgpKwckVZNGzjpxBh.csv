i wasnt there for you
i wasnt there for you

verse 1 serj tankian
i know weathers gonna be fine
but i cant see you cross the streamline
my love waits for me in daytime
but i cant see you through the snowblind

chorus serj tankian with daron malakian
but i wasnt there for you you are gone
and i wasnt there for you goodbyes are long
goodbye
and i wasnt there for you goodbye
i wasnt there for goodbye
i wasnt there for goodbye

verse 2 serj tankian with daron malakian
well i know time reveals in hindsight
i can wrestle with the stormy night
because your love lasts a lifetime
but i can see you through the snowblind

chorus serj tankian with daron malakian
but i wasnt there for you you are gone
and i wasnt there for you goodbyes are long
you are gone
and i wasnt there for you goodbyes are long
and i wasnt there for you goodbye
