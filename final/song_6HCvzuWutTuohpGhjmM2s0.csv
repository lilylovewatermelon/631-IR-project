some folks call me crazy
my momma calls me hon
and depending on the mood your in
i might be either one
hey i get up and i go to work
and i got to work some more
when i get home i take it off
and i throw it on the floor

chorus
im a country boy and im a rock and roller
like a little crown in my cocacola
say a little prayer for all the soldiers
fighting for the usa
i never was captain of the football team
and you aint never been a prom queen
its just us and thats okay
if i got you well its a good day
good day to be me

verse 2
you werent wearing makeup baby
on the night you said you would
its the funny things that i remember
when im feeling good
a dollar in my pocket
and a catfish on the line
a song about a simple love
thats stronger than the pines

if i got you well its a good day
