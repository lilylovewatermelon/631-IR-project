rip the womb
feeling so sorry selfish and sore
wish i wasnt born
piece by piece i can carry it all
strength to be driven
so unforgiving anything is possible
like leaving you all
im turning my back on this killing so small

chorus
step by step i will push you through this
all of you get away from me
eye for an eye ill push you through this my law
step by step i will push you through this
all of you get away from me
tooth for a tooth ill push you through this through you

verse 2
salt the wound
cut through a conscience ive failed to explore
the calm before the storm
speak your peace and prepare for the fall
words have been chosen
tainting the gift lying truths so incredible
so fuck you all
im turning my back on this killing so small

step by step i will push you through this
all of you get away from me
eye for an eye ill push you through this my law
step by step i will push you through this
all of you get away from me
tooth for a tooth ill push you through this through you

bridge
spread the word the killing is over
spread the word the killing is over

severed more than i am more than i ever was
blindside threatened my worth sequestered deliverance
you stole a part of me youve taken a part of me

verse 3
try you wanted to be wanted to have a
life you wanted to fight wanted the right
lies spoken to me without a conscience no right
why breaking a mold breaking the trust
child innocence lost ultimate cost
loss life so undone deserted the seed
you buried the bottle

chorus
step by step i will push you through this
all of you get away from me
eye for an eye ill push you through this my law
step by step i will push you through this
all of you get away from me
tooth for a tooth ill push you through this through you
outro
step by step i will push you through
eye for an eye ill push you through
tooth for a tooth ill push you through
push it through push it through
push it through push it through
pushing pushing pushing pushing through1embed"
