shit

verse 1 tyler the creator
my mother warned me that some niggas aint my right hand
to trust her only my heart and that elder white man
his name is clancy i fancy him gotta give him props
he half the reason why dealerships even let me cop
so now im speedin and tryna drive away from the fact
that she was right so i triple left tryna double back
the streets are filled with some clues like how i aint notice that hey how i aint see that
fuck it i seen some familiar stuck in the culdesac
i pull up get out what up i wanna help
but what you want for some some niggas
really dont want for themself
now do i stay do i go thats my dilemma
and traffic is picking up if i dont leave ima get stuck skrt
so i speed off we talk barely and it seems awkward
and i heard through some words that youre off it
i got too much drive dont wanna steer off path
and crash and get distracted
but i listen to that weather man cause it might rain
keep my windshield wipers prepared
cause yall throw so much shade so much
and i got jacket in trunk but thats in the front
i also got power for both of us if youre ever in need of jump
just let me know my nigga

i had to switch gears on em
fishtail in the rearview mirror on em skrrt
i had to switch gears on em
you know swerve left turn steerin wheel on em
nigga thats a pothole watch out for the pothole
watch out for the pothole watch out for the pothole
look out for the pothole watch out for the pothole
watch out for the pothole watch out for the pothole

verse 2 tyler the creator
snakes in the grass but i walk
i got some new boots on the back it says golf
so i be prepared for their bites theyre all talk
i left the condom in the grass so fuck off
watchin clarence in a mansion with nobody in it
young successful nigga ride mclaren with no windows tinted
i drive by piggies when im in it cause it feels amazin
the irony is i stopped eatin bacon
dont get it twisted nigga im still hungry oh he lonely
all my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies
but all i can show em is a couple cars and more things
that ive made in the couple past month hes on please
everyone is a sheep me a lone wolf
nobody gon make a peep cause everyone wants some wool
since everyone is a sheep not everyone here is cool
man id rather drown in a pool by myself
than fuck with their fleece
see man tman fans be seesaw
wind blows they go which way who knows
one day fuck no the next day okay
but fuck yall i know that t is four for four
i just want that garden and that batmobile
good health success time on earth worthwhile
find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards
but my vehicles good for now thats in a couple of miles
now keep it pushin nigga
chorus jaden smith  tyler the creator
i had to switch gears on em
fishtail in the rearview mirror on em skrrrrrt
i had to switch gears on em
you know swerve left turn steerin wheel on em
nigga thats a pothole watch out for the pothole
watch out for the pothole watch out for the pothole
look out for the pothole watch out for the pothole
watch out for the pothole watch out for the pothole

outro tyler the creator
