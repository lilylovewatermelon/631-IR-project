took me down to the river
so i could drown drown drown
looking up through the water
i kept sinking down down down
i feel like im dying
i got one foot in the ground
never knew what love was
until you came around

chorus
youre going down
youre going down down
you walk all over me
you never thought id be
the one whos laughing now
now that youre going down

verse 2
take you down to the basement
you look around round round
and we sit there in silence
i watch you go down down down
i feel like im flying
i got my head in the clouds
never thought i was crazy
until you came around
