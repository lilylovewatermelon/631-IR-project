i cut you into pieces
searching for your imperfections
i had plans to make you whole
but all my threads couldnt stop the bleeding
theres nothing left but im not leaving
when all i know is you

chorus
ive been looking for a way to bring you back to life
and if i could find a way then i would bring you back tonight
id make you look id make you lie
id take the coldness from your eyes
but you told me
if you love me
let it die

verse 2
your eyes stare right through me
ignoring my failed attempts to
breathe back life into your veins
but i cant start your cold heart beating
youre so far gone but im not leaving
when all i know is you

chorus
ive been looking for a way to bring you back to life
and if i could find a way then i would bring you back tonight
id make you look id make you lie
id take the coldness from your eyes
but you told me
if you love me
let it die
you might also likebridge
and you left me
more dead than youll ever know
when you left me
alone

chorus
ive been looking for a way to bring you back to life
and if i could find a way then i would bring you back tonight
id make you look id make you lie
id take the coldness from your eyes
but you told me
if you love me
let it die let it die
let it die let it die8embed"
