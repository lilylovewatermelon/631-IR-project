black hair its bigger than death
black hair dont leave me in the dirt
black hair ill show you what im worth
its not what you are
its just what you did
dont hang up the phone
i love you to death
eternal return
eternal return
eternal return
eternal return
black hair its swimming in my head
black hair its bigger than death
black hair is melting in the sun
black hair just look at what youve doneyou might also likeembed"
