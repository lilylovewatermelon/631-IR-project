im all bottled up
floating in the deep blue
and youre an open book
anyone could read you
im losing my voice
barking up the wrong tree
when you cant be yourself
theres just too much to be
lets get on with it
you have got too much time
and i dont want to stay here
where the sun dont ever shine
so say the word and open up the blinds
well it came like a dream
but it went just as fast
like a dream
left out in the trash
she said i know what you mean
but i dont know who you are
ah were just two of many fractions of a partx2
they said it couldnt be done
but you went out and did it
but it was more than you were looking for it
and there aint no way to get it

im only guilty i admit it
im only guilty i admit it

outro
excuse me forgive me
i only wear blue
excuse me forgive me
i only wear blue
excuse me1embed"
