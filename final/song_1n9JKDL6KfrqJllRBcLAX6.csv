wonder why wonder why wonder why
why must we pretend
why cant we be more than friends
lets be more than friends

verse 1
what are you afraid of
weve been playing games love
together we crazy good i mean baby
so why you gotta change up
baby when we make love in ways i never made love
feels so real but something still is missing from the picture

everywhere i go people wanna know
wonder where i been whats the deal with him
is yall really cool is he just a friend
now im asking you tell me what it is

look me in my eyes you dont have to lie
must think im a fool fucking around with you
need to give me proof i need to hear the truth
i just got one question for you

chorus x 2
wonder why wonder why wonder why
why must we pretend
why cant we be more than friends
lets be more than friends

i think you see me as your play thing
your friday to sunday thing
im not your weekend love your secret fuck
brother im not playing

and if i wanted to be part time
id be working at the checkout line
at the liquor store the picture show
let me give you piece of my mind

why dont you put your arms around me huh
acting different when your friends around
see nah when we together we fire
and no i never tell my friends your a friend
youre my guy were together uh huh

calling my phone about we needed a break
how we gonna break up when we aint willing to date
you say you want that real woman when you get her you run
how come i never met the family like your dad and your mum

and i dont wanna hear it stop being a bitch
you making me respect you less im really starting to switch
youre saying that and this and youre heart broken
yeah you sound like shit like youre taking a piss
somebody wanna see ya chick ya see the problem with this is
im waiting in vain im waiting for you to change
we aint kicking it no we aint chilling no
we aint doing a ting blud
im more like a full time thing

see fam you got your own sock drawer
you can call me much more
more than just your friend much more than before
dont play me like an extra i got speaking roles
i am not that hoe i am so much more
i wonder why

chorus x 2
wonder why wonder why wonder why
why must we pretend
why cant we be more than friends
lets be more than friends

dont act like im tryna press you
its just you know
its obvious its all there like
what you waiting for
why cant we be more than friends lets be more than friends

lets be more than friends lets be more than friends
