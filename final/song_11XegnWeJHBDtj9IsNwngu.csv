chorus
when its all said and done who you gon ride for
who you gon slide for who you down to die for
i gave her my heart she was tellin lies though
sleepin with my guys though that shit turned my heart cold
i came from the bottom i didnt have a dime bro
apartments with the blinds bro still got on my grind though
i know my mama proud everybody fine bro
this shit took some time bro finally get my shine on

verse 1
i done been betrayed yeah i done been backstabbed

and we carry big straps i suggest you back back
i just speak the truth im not with thе rap cap

i dont talk to bitches bitches talk the bullshit
i bought every pair of amiris in the boutique
you know we want all the smoke nigga lucy
ill never fall off i might take a break
you know either way it go my family gon be straight
still in debt from all the losses that i had to take
when you out here tryna evolve they gon call you fake
i cant turn my back on the gang no matter what i make
i done took a lot of risks to make sure niggas ate
superhero in my hood i dont need a cape
i be lost sometimes feelin like im runnin in place
chorus

i came from the bottom i didnt have a dime bro
apartments with the blinds bro still got on my grind though
i know my mama proud everybody fine bro
this shit took some time bro finally get my shine on

outro morgan freeman  young thug
metro
when all is said and done
we can only judge punish reward enslave and free ourselves
there will always be doubters and haters but they only have the power you give them
remain focused move forward and never lose faith in yourself
until next time stay in savage mode
because anything else would be too damn civilized
