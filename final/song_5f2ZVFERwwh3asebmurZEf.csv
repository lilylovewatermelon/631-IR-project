outro anthony kiedis
listen to me what i said
try to get it through your head
a little bit of circumstance and a chance to make out
livin in a citadel its hard enough to be yourself
waiting for the bell to toll and i am wide awake now
it must have been a hundred miles or any of a hundred styles
its not about the smile you wear but the way we make out
when i was another loner nothin but a two beach comber
anybody seen the sky
im im wide awake now5embed"
