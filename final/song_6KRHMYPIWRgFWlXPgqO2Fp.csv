the issue on the table france is on the verge of war with england
and do we provide aid and our troops to our french allies or do we stay out of it
remember my decision on this matter is not subject to congressional approval
the only person you have to convince is me
secretary jefferson you have the floor sir

jefferson
when we were on death’s door when we were needy
we made a promise we signed a treaty
we needed money and guns and half a chance
who provided those funds
madison
france

jefferson
in return they didn’t ask for land
only a promise that we’d lend a hand
and stand with them if they fought against oppressors
and revolution is messy but now is the time to stand
stand with our brothers as they fight against tyranny
i know that alexander hamilton is here and he
would rather not have this debate
i’ll remind you that he is not secretary of state
he knows nothing of loyalty
smells like new money dresses like fake royalty
desperate to rise above his station
everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation

ooh

jefferson
hey and if ya don’t know now ya know mr president

washington
thank you secretary jefferson secretary hamilton your response

hamilton
you must be out of your goddamn mind if you think
the president is gonna bring the nation to the brink
of meddling in the middle of a military mess
a game of chess where france is queen and kingless
we signed a treaty with a king whose head is now in a basket
would you like to take it out and ask it
“should we honor our treaty king louis’ head”
“uh… do whatever you want i’m super dead”

washington
enough hamilton is right

jefferson
mr president—

washington
we’re too fragile to start another fight
jefferson
but sir do we not fight for freedom

washington
sure when the french figure out who’s gonna lead ‘em

jefferson
the people are leading—

washington
the people are rioting
there’s a difference frankly it’s a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality
hamilton

hamilton
sir

washington
draft a statement of neutrality
jefferson
did you forget lafayette

hamilton
what
jefferson
have you an ounce of regret
you accumulate debt you accumulate power
yet in their hour of need you forget

hamilton
lafayette’s a smart man he’ll be fine
and before he was your friend he was mine
if we try to fight in every revolution in the world we never stop
where do we draw the line
jefferson
so quickwitted

hamilton
alas i admit it

jefferson
i bet you were quite a lawyer

hamilton
my defendants got acquitted

jefferson
yeah well someone oughta remind you

hamilton
what

jefferson
you’re nothing without washington behind you

washington
hamilton

jefferson
