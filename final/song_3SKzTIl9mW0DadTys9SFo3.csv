they sent me away to find them a fortune
a chest filled with diamonds and gold
the house was awake with shadows and monsters
the hallways they echoed and groaned
i sat alone in bed till the morning
im crying theyre coming for me
and i tried to hold these secrets inside me
my minds like a deadly disease

prechorus
im bigger than my body
im colder than this home
im meaner than my demons
im bigger than these bones
chorus
and all the kids cried out please stop youre scaring me
i cant help this awful energy
god damn right you should be scared of me
who is in control

verse 2
i paced around for hours on empty
i jumped at the slightest of sounds
and i couldnt stand the person inside me
i turned all the mirrors around

and all the kids cried out please stop youre scaring me

im well acquainted with villains that live in my bed
they beg me to write them so theyll never die when im dead
and ive grown familiar with villains that live in my head
they beg me to write them so ill never die when im dead

prechorus
im bigger than my body
im colder than this home
im meaner than my demons
im bigger than these bones
