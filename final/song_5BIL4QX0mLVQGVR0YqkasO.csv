verse 1
i can hear planes
flying over my head
just hours before
you occupied my bed
in our darkness
we conjured up sunlight
in our haste our need our thirst
we lost our sight
but i was inspired
tracing the lines on your face
to the poetry the first time
i heard your name
when i trip from your lips
my heart was like a kickdrum
and it silenced the guilt
i wasnt raised to hurt anyone

uh oh does he know
that im lying in the afterglow
that im lying but i cant go cant say no
make him think hes crazy
while his paranoia grows
what he should be asking
is where did our love go
then i wouldnt be basking
in another mans afterglow
where did the beat go in another mans afterglow
where is the beat
where did the beat go

verse 2
so how do i justify
to the judge and the jury
the voices in my head
that caused this fury
never had to play
with matches to start a fire
but it got so cold
and i thought id forgotten desire
i was your concubine
and your madonna
you couldnt see anything
behind your babys mama
how long is lonely supposed to last
i was naked and waiting
for you to come back
mm
chorus
uh oh does he know
that im lying in the afterglow
that im lying but i cant go cant say no
make him think hes crazy
while his paranoia grows
what he should be asking
is where did our love go
then i wouldnt be basking
in another mans afterglow
where did the beat go in another mans afterglow
where is the beat
where did the beat go

bridge
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
theres a cause and effect
although i took the steps
i dove off the bridge
cause i had nothing left
all i ever wanted was you
and in the absence of you
i fell through

chorus
uh oh does he know
that im lying in the afterglow
that im lying but i cant go cant say no
make him think hes crazy
while his paranoia grows
what he should be asking
is where did our love go
then i wouldnt be basking
in another mans afterglow
where did the beat go
in another mans afterglow
where is the beat
where did the beat go
outro
where is the beat
where did the beat go
in another mans afterglow
where is the beat
where did the beat go
where did the love go
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
where did the beat go
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
where did the love go1embed"
