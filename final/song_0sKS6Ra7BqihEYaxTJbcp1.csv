take me to loveland
and no one is gonna find me
cause im leaving this old place
i dont care
nothings too far
i handle that
oh trust me
when were leaving this old place
i dont care
its like she has flowers in her hair
and you you have flowers in your mouth
cause your heart is upside down
and you get dizzy because of her charisma
she will love you like a twister
youll be swept away
youll be swept away

chorus
like we were so so soo so sooo in love
like we were so so soo so sooo in love

verse 2
take me to loveland
and no ones gonna find me
cause im leaving this old place
i dont care
nothings too far
i handle that
oh trust me
when were leaving this old place
i dont care
its like she has flower in her hair
and you have flowers in your mouth
cause your heart is upside down
and you get dizzy just of her charisma
she will love you like a twister
youll be swept away
youll be swept away
