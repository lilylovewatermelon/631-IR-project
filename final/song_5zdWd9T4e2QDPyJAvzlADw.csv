run that back turbo

chorus lil baby
lotta blue hunnids they came from the bank
i drank this shit by the pint
if we leave then we fucking tonight
jeans expensive they fitting me tight
i cant do this the rest of my life
free the bros down the road doing life
trying to sleep every night with a knife
know its hard but you gotta survive
man they got twenty deep on the flight
going wherever we like

fuck with snakes cause you niggas be mice
diamonds hitting who cut off the lights
in the clouds we balling like mike yeah

verse 1 lil baby
soon as i get my money im gon blow it
fuck that ima take mine and put it up

verse 2 moneybagg yo
residue on me im fresh out the trap bando
i gotta dust off my lap

hundred round shots in the scrap
im on their face like a slap

i hit your bitch you was wide open
im in her stomach like cramps
yeah whatd you do howd you do it
soon as i got my money i ran through it
i fucked up some commas
i couldnt believe i saved some i thought i blew it
i thought it was all gone
i just downed a whole pint im under the influence
then i popped an adderall to give me endurance
im up i cannot get tired your bitch on molly she wired
tossed her with moneybagg myers
plenty chains clang clang 50k plain jane
go get some money quit saying you cant
they thought i was born in the vault of the bank
chorus lil baby
lotta blue hunnids they came from the bank
i drank this shit by the pint
if we leave then we fucking tonight
jeans expensive they fitting me tight
i cant do this the rest of my life
free the bros down the road doing life
trying to sleep every night with a knife
know its hard but you gotta survive
man they got twenty deep on the flight

im on top and im hot it feel nice
fuck with snakes cause you niggas be mice
