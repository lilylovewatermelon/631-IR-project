lover come over look what ive done
ive been alone so long i feel like im on the run
lover come over kick up the dust
ive got a secret starting to rust

chorus
she said im looking like a bad man smooth criminal
she said my spirit doesnt move like it did before
she said that i dont look like me no more no more
i said im just tired she said youre just high
and i said i saw you in the water
and i said i saw you in the water

verse 2
lover come hold me heads on the fritz
gaudy intoxicated feelings comfortably mixed
lover come hold me could you forget
ive got a secret digging a debt

chorus
she said im looking like a bad man smooth criminal
she said my spirit doesnt move like it did before
she said that i dont look like me no more no more
i said im just tired she said youre just high
and i said i saw you in the water
and i said i saw you in the water
see matt maeson liveget tickets as low as 55you might also likebridge
sweating all your sins out
putting all your thoughts back together
oh we just dont blend now
all of my attempts seem to weather
oh i make you cringe now
dont i make you cringe
oh i make you cringe now
dont i make you cringe

chorus
she said im looking like a bad man smooth criminal
she said my spirit doesnt move like it did before
she said that i dont look like me no more no more
i said im just tired
she said im looking like a bad man smooth criminal
she said my spirit doesnt move like it did before
she said that i dont look like me no more no more
i said im just tired she said youre just high
and i said i saw you in the water do i make you cringe
and i said i saw you in the water do i make you cringe
and i said i saw you in the water do i make you cringe
and i said i saw you in the water do i make you cringe11embed"
