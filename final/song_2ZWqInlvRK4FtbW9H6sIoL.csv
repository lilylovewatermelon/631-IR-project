broke down stone mountain georgia many miles from my home
a trail of tears that ive left searchin some of yours and my own
so im out here prayin to jesus for ghost in the night
cause all they want is a simple dollar a song i wont write

chorus
mama let it be
aint no man gonna take it from me
hard times carry on
theyve only seen the calm before the storm

verse 2
i heard faith in a bottle of bourbon i seen truth on the road
there aint a man in this land that aint hurtin were all carryin a load
so roll on ill see ya sweet mama when their day is done
with some strength and love from the family your oldest son

chorus
mama let it be
aint no man gonna take this from me
hard times carry on
theyve only seen the calm before the storm

verse 3
let it storm
i got a few things on my mind
they want to take it and brake it
and make it their own
and its time i keep mine
see whiskey myers liveget tickets as low as 44you might also likechorus
mama let it be
there aint no man gonna take it from me
hard times carry on
theyve only seen the calm before the storm
