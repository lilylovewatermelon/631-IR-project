born in a hurry always late
havent been early since 88
texas is hot i can be cold
grandma cried when i pierced my nose
good in a glass good on green
good when youre putting your hands all over me

chorus
im alright with a slow burn
taking my time let the world turn
im gonna do it my way itll be alright
if we burn it down and it takes all night
its a slow burn yeah

verse 2
in tennessee the suns goin down
but in beijing theyre heading out to work
you know the bar down the street dont close for an hour
we should take a walk and look at all the flowers

chorus
cause im alright with a slow burn
taking my time let the world turn
im gonna do it my way itll be alright
if we burn it down and it takes all night
its a slow burn
