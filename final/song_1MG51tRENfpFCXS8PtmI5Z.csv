verse 1
they putting pressure on me son now they want me to snap
end up like x and whitney in my mansion smoking crack
im paranoid im feeling like niggas is trying to get me
forget the kids im shaving off my fucking head like britney
man dre wont mix my records now i need to talk to jimmy
im falling back in my old ways im riding with the semi
whos calling me its chris hes on the other line with diddy
but i dont wanna talk right now my day is going shitty
whys jay rocking that urkel look man isnt he from marcy
they say hes growin dreads and now hes talking like a yardie
man everything is changing i dont understand a thing
i guess this is that bullshit that all the money brings
im on flight

verse 2
my baby mama boyfriend like to talk like he can hurt me
im laughing cause she kissed him in his mouth and gave him herpes
that just makes him one of 50 niggas wanting to murk me
niggas found my truck and burnt it up out there in jersey
you can ask my son hell tell you my dads fucking crazy
she filled his head with shit and now i think he fuckin hates me
shady didnt invent me but a star is what he made me
ill blow your fuckin mind out if i told you what he paid me
he gave me all the pills he had left thats why im so high
it makes me feel so good now that im not so scared to die
i wish a nigga would i dare a motherfucker try
you get at me and miss you kiss your black ass goodbye
im on flight

verse 3
my lawyers on retainers every month i give ‘em stacks
in case they wanna send me up for murder like max
man i wasnt the shooter i was never on the scene
so if they do forensics theyll find out it wasnt me
theres no need for a lie detector i aint sayin shit
the more you talk the higher chances youre doing a bid
today i read the paper it said tru life caught a case
they said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face
i spoke to michael vick i told him im happy he home
you tell them crackers sorry nigga then you get back on
when dogs are fighting in the hood nobody gives a fuck
so you get back and shake it on the field show them whats up
im on flight
