i love to hear you say that you love me
with words so sweet
and i love the way with just one whisper
you tell me everything
and when you say those words
its the sweetest thing ive ever heard

chorus
but when your eyes say it
thats when i know that its true
i feel it
i feel the love coming through
i know it
i know that you truly care for me
cause its there to see
when your eyes say it

verse 2
i love all the ways that you show me
youll never leave
and the way your kisses they always convince me
your feelings run so deep
i love the things you say
and i love the love your touch conveys
