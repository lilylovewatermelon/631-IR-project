once upon a time
somewhere in your past
someone said forever
but that promise didnt last
now you dont believe
love is ever true
steel yourself against the day
when i stopped loving you

chorus
when the day comes that i dont love you
every star will fall out of the sky
and every mountain will tumble down
and every river run dry

verse 2
every drop of rain
that ever touched the ground
for every tear that ever fell
and never made a sound
ill be there
to hear you call
and ill be there to catch you baby
should you ever fall
see brooks  dunn liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likechorus
when the day comes that i dont love you
every star will fall out of the sky
and every mountain will tumble down
and every river run dry
when the day comes that i dont love you
every star will fall out of the sky
and every mountain will tumble down
and every river run dry
and every river run dryembed"
