standing in the open light
within the swelter of the night
i found myself staring at you
and every time our fingers touched
i felt like it would be too much
and too little to hang onto

prechorus
i cannot fall in love with you
i cannot feel this way so soon so soon
i cannot be this way with you
i cannot fall in love with you

chorus
i knew it when you looked my way
that id be begging you to stay
i couldnt say it to myself
i couldnt say it to myself
i felt it burning in the way
i held on when you pulled away
i couldnt say it to myself
i couldnt say it to myself
i couldnt say it
i couldnt just say it

and every evening every time
i keep replaying in my mind
and wondering if you do the same
and if it makes you lose your breath
and if it makes you just forget
that all of its a bit insane

prechorus
i cannot fall in love with you
i cannot feel this way so soon
i cannot be this way with you
i cannot fall in love with you

chorus
i knew it when you looked my way
that id be begging you to stay
i couldnt say it to myself
i couldnt say it to myself
i felt it burning in the way
i held on when you pulled away
i couldnt say it to myself
i couldnt say it to myself
i knew it when you looked my way
that id be begging you to stay
i couldnt say it to myself
i couldnt say it to myself
i felt it burning in the way
i held on when you pulled away
i couldnt say it to myself
i couldnt say it to myself
i couldnt say it
i couldnt just say it
outro
but i cannot fall in love with you
i cannot feel this way so soon so soon
i cannot be this way with you
i cannot fall in love with you7embed"
