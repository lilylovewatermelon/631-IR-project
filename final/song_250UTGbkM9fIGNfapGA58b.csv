we got somethin we both know it
we dont talk too much about it
aint no real big secret all the same
somehow we get around it

prechorus
listen it dont really matter to me baby
you believe what you want to believe

chorus
you see you dont have to live like a refugee
dont have to live like a refugee

verse 2
somewhere somehow somebody
must have kicked you around some
tell me why you wanna lay there
and revel in your abandon

prechorus
honey it dont make no difference to me baby
everybodys had to fight to be free

chorus
you see you dont have to live like a refugee
dont have to live like a refugee
no baby you dont have to live like a refugee
dont have to live like a refugee
you might also likebridge
baby we aint the first
im sure a lot of other lovers been burned
right now this seems real to you
but its one of those things
you got to feel to be true

verse 3
somewhere somehow somebody
must have kicked you around some
who knows maybe you were kidnapped
tied up taken away and held for ransom

prechorus
honey it dont really matter to me baby
everybodys had to fight to be free

chorus
you see you dont have to live like a refugee
dont have to live like a refugee
no you dont have to live like a refugee
dont have to live like a refugee
you dont have to live like a refugee
dont have to live like a refugee2embed"
