chorus
saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
flashbacks waking me up
i get drunk but its not enough
’cause the morning comes and youre not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandeliers still flickering here
’cause i cant pretend its okay when its not
its death by a thousand cuts

verse
i dress to kill my time i take the long way home
i ask the traffic lights if itll be alright
they say i dont know
and what once was ours is no ones now
i see you everywhere the only thing we share
is this small town
you said it was a great love one for the ages
but if the story’s over why am i still writing pages

’cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
flashbacks waking me up
i get drunk but its not enough
’cause the morning comes and youre not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandeliers still flickering here
cause i can’t pretend its okay when its not
its death by a thousand cuts

bridge
my heart my hips my body my love
tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch
gave up on me like i was a bad drug
now im searching for signs in a haunted club
our songs our films united we stand
our country guess it was a lawless land
quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
paper cut stings from our paperthin plans
my time my wine my spirit my trust
tryna find a part of me you didnt take up
gave you too much but it wasnt enough
but ill be alright its just a thousand cuts

chorus
i get drunk but its not enough
cause youre not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandeliers still flickering here
cause i cant pretend its okay when its not
no its not
its death by a thousand cuts you didnt touch
postchorus
tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch
my body my love my trust its death by a thousand cuts
but it wasnt enough it wasnt enough no no

outro
i take the long way home
i ask the traffic lights if itll be alright
