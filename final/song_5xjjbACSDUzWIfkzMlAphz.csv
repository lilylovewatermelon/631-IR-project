verse 1 yung plague
overcast fame wait until it rains flames
got an acidwashed brain looking like bleach stains
i blame the reign of fucking chains
thats why all of us are tame staying in a fucking cage
i cant live this way while we harvest limited grain
they stay sipping cold moet
satan hears me pray yes i became his prey
blood leaks out my veins
got my palms pressed together as i whisper namaste

verse 3 dragonmane
what is that stain
that is a mess
made on your shirt
sunk on your chest
dripping out wet and im leaving the set
taking your heart with no evidence left
better expect
to run out of breath
your life will consist of the end of reality
tell the police im baraka on coppas
my kombat is mortal from all the brutalities
put in the work with the deadliest faculties
this is a robbery coming to peace
visit the haters vacate in the heat
the devils are proud of me now that i teach it
the classes are over i am released
the classes to wake up the students asleep
citizens playing the game 
its lucifer shows at a pretty
