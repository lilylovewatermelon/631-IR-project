verse 1 redfoo
i see my dream son
every time i dive in my pool its hard to be humble
when i do the breaststroke through an underground tunnel
and come up on the other side in a jacuzzi
being greeted by two naked models with suds on their booties
they give me hugs and lots of kisses and they ask me what my wish is
i say go and call your bitches cause theres gonna be a party
next they wash my body as a team
and they say foo your royal penis is clean
and im like

verse 2
wakin up next to a beautiful girl
step outside and say hello to my beautiful world
grandmas cooking breakfast she makes pancakes the best
i check my myspace and ive got a lot of friend requests
yes
i get to dancing as i walk through my mansion cause i
own property from california to the hamptons and i
sip from my water fountain that dispenses soda
look out the window and wave at my next door neighbor oprah
i check to see how my albums doing today
the group lmfao goes double platinum hey
i gotta party man thats how i live
so i take my elevator to the club in my crib like
