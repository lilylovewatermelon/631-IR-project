they told me once theres a place where love conquers all
a city with the streets full of milk and honey
i havent found it yet but im still searching
all i know is a hopeless place that flows with the blood of my kin
perhaps hopeless isnt a place nothing but a state of mind
they told me once dont trust the moon shes always changing
the shores bend and break for her
and she begs to be loved but nothing here is as it seems
