moolah babe

verse 1
she was a young girl in pursuit of glory and fame
she would do anything she could to feel the flame
when everybody know your move and the things you pay
she finally made all her dreams come true and then she screamed

chorus
oh no this aint paradise oh no this aint paradise
oh no this aint paradise yeah
oh no this aint paradise oh no this aint paradise
you know this aint paradise

verse 2
he was a young boy in pursuit of money and fame
and he would do anything he could to kill the pain
when everybody know your moves they speak of your name
and oh all over the late night local news i heard him scream

chorus
oh no this aint paradise oh no this aint paradise
oh no this aint paradise yeah
oh no this aint paradise oh no this aint paradise
you know this aint paradise

verse 3
sometimes we try to find the road to the riches
need roadside assistance
blisters on my knees from beggin for forgiveness
aint no dollars on my trees but mileage on my feet
cause i been climbin to the peak and runnin from the bullshit
im tired of playin the same song who told the dj bring it back
dead presidents bullet in abraham lincoln hat
starin at big poster i swear that he be winkin back
cut school sell crack sorry im just thinkin back
call me crazy ive been called worse
its like i have it all but whats it all worth
haha im probably better in my afterlife
i should cherish life but this just aint paradise

outro
oh no this aint paradise oh no this aint paradise
oh no this aint paradise oh oh oh oh
this aint paradise no this aint paradise
this aint paradise6embed"
