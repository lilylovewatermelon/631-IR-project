so dont sit back and watch the days go by
are you ever going to live before you die
and when things fall apart
the world has come undone
leave it all behind
leave the loneliness alone
you wait forever blind

chorus
so come on and leave the years
when you watched the days go by
come on and leave the fears
that you were afraid to find
cause while you wait inside
the days go by

verse 2
so all the memories fade
and the days go by
forget the lonely yesterdays in mind
i know its never going to  be the way you like
i know you dont want to think about the endlessness you find
you wait forever blind

chorus
so come on and leave the years
when you watched the days go by
come on and leave the fears
that you were afraid to find
cause while you wait inside
the days go by

so come on and leave the years
when you watched the days go by
come on and leave the fears
that you were afraid to find
cause while you wait inside
the days go by

chorus
so come on and leave the years
when you watched the days go by
come on and leave the fears
that you were afraid to find
cause while you wait inside
the days go by1embed"
