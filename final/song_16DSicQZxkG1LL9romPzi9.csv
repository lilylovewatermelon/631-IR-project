now feel it the pain was gettin me hypеd and so violent
but wally was the worst of us all
pump in his chest and hе never knew it
poor wally had to fall victim a casualty
but i lay my soul down and i think it all better when it falls down
everybody got problems to face to face everyday
with it when theres so many lost souls lost souls

layzie bone
god bless you workin on a plan to heaven follow the lord all 24
7 days god is who we praise even though the devils all up in my face
but he keepin me safe and in my place say grace
and maybe you people should do to the same the game
recognize a good game man its an everyday thang how we gotta maintain
