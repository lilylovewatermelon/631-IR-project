yeah well

verse 1
i got a bone to pick like roses roses
i aint feelin broken no more
balled a fist they gossipin i notice
talkin shit i wander through the motives
wonder who the fuck were supposed to be
i aint worried now til i leave
im just tryna ride and feel the breeze
with somethin bad beside n next to me
wind in my face dont stop now when it feels so great
you can run til you slip on the sidewalk
and the same bone that you picked gon break thats a motif
thats a motif yeah
when its comin right back so familiar never been realer
never felt so damn good where im at
i dont know what its all about
runnin through too many thoughts to count thats way better
still aint addin up ill let you know when ive had enough yeah
