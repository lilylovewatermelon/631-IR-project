every boyfriend is the one
until otherwise proven
the good are never easy the easy never good
and love it never happens like you think it really should
deception and perfection are wonderful traits
one will breed love the other hate
youll find me in the lonely hearts
under im after a brand new start

prechorus
and i dont belong to anyone

chorus
they call me homewrecker homewrecker
they call me homewrecker homewrecker

verse 2
girls and their curls and their gourmet vomit
boys and their toys and their six inch rockets
were all very lovely til we get to know each other
as we stop becoming friends and we start becoming lovers

prechorus
and i dont belong to anyone

they call me homewrecker homewrecker
im only happy when im on the run
they call me homewrecker homewrecker
i broke a million hearts just for fun
they call me homewrecker homewrecker
im only happy when im on the run
they call me homewrecker homewrecker
i broke a million hearts just for fun

bridge
im only happy when im on the run
i break a million hearts just for fun
i dont belong to anyone
i guess you could say that my lifes a mess
but im still looking pretty in this dress
im the image of deception

verse 3
when everything is life and death
you may feel like theres nothing left
instead of love and trust and laughter
what you get is happy never after
but deep down all you want is love
the pure kind we all dream of
but we cannot escape the past
so you and i will never last
chorus

im only happy when im on the run
cause im a homewrecker homewrecker
i broke a million hearts just for fun
cause im a homewrecker homewrecker
im only happy when im on the run
cause im a homewrecker homewrecker
i broke a million hearts just for fun
