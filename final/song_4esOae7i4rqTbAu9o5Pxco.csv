shes just a girl and shes on fire
hotter than a fantasy
lonely like a highway
shes livin in a world and its on fire
filled with catastrophe
but she knows she can fly away

prechorus
ohoh she got both feet on the ground
and shes burnin it down
ohoh she got her head in the clouds
and shes not backin down

chorus
this girl is on fire
this girl is on fire
shes walkin on fire
this girl is on fire

verse 2
looks like a girl but shes a flame
so bright she can burn your eyes
better look the other way
you can try but youll never forget her name
shes on top of the world
hottest of the hottest girls say

ohoh we got our feet on the ground
and were burnin it down
ohoh got our head in the clouds
and were not comin down

oh everybody stares as she goes by
cause they can see the flame thats in her eyes
watch her when shes lightin up the night
nobody knows that shes a lonely girl
and its a lonely world
but she gon let it burn baby burn baby
