something good
oh something good
oh something good
oh something good tonight
will make me forget about you for now

bridge
get high hit the floor before you go
matador estocada youre my blood sport

chorus
but something good
oh something good
oh something good
oh something good tonight
will make me forget about you for now

verse 1
fortyeight thousand seats
bleats and roars for my memories of you
now that im fully clean
the matador is no more and is dragged from view
