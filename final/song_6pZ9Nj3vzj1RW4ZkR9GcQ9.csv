hmm ohoh

verse 1
blackbirds will sing in the same key
as you play in the shoes that i bought you
and sweet baby jane dont know a thing
about my songs but she knows im a monsoon

chorus
and baby you all the things you do
and the ways you move send me straight to heaven
and baby you what you never knew
what i never said is youre my living legend

verse 2
hipsters will sing just like a dream
in siné or the back brooklyn bayou
but you never cared about my name
and darling i never meant to defy you

chorus
but baby you all them things you do
and those ways you moved send me straight to heaven
and baby you i never said to you
you really are my living legend

i got guns in the summertime and horses too
guns in the summertime and horses too
i never meant to be bad or unwell
i was just living on the edge
right between heaven and hell
and im tired of it

chorus
oh all the things you do
and the ways you move send me straight to heaven
and baby you what i never said to you
cause you really are my living legend

outro
