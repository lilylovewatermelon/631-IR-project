drift aloft
in some effortless place
bound by delicate dread
saving no face
air dissolves
where one game is designed
somethings elegant find
so the program goes

verse 2 zubin sedghi stephanie koenig  both
fate decides
how these columns align
birth by chess or benign
every moment
marble gods
tango circles in space
round the already dead
hung by staircase up

break zubin sedghi and stephanie koenig
ahah i panicked
wow
haha
haha

on and on
the awakening light
will bathe slumbers
of ethereal sights
today is renewed is reborn
each day i am new i am yours

verse 3 zubin sedghi with stephanie koenig
so please dismiss
what they claim about this
being in vain to explain
how expressed with a kiss
taking passionate steps
floor suspending abyss

outro zubin sedghi with stephanie koenig
such impossible bliss
such impossible bliss
such impossible bliss
such impossible bliss
such impossible bliss
such impossible bliss9embed"
