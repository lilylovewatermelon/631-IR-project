slow dancin on the boulevard
in the quiet moments while the citys still dark
sleepwalkin through the summer rain
in the tired spaces you could hear her name
when she was warm and tender and you
held her arms around you
there was nothin but her love and affection
she was crazy for you
now shes part of somethin that you lost

chorus
and for all you know this could be
the difference between what you need
and what you wanna be
yeah what you wanna be

verse 2
night swimmin in her diamond dress
making small circles move across the surface
stand watchin from the steady shore
feelin wide open and waitin for
somethin warm and tender
now shes movin further from you
there was nothin that could make it easy on you
every step you take reminds you that shes walkin on
see matchbox twenty liveget tickets as low as 77you might also likechorus
yeah for all you know this could be
the difference between what you need
and what you want

bridge
every word you never said
echoes down your empty hallway
and everything that was your world
just came down

verse 3
day breakin on the boulevard
feel the sun warmin up your secondhand heart
light swimmin right across your face and you think
maybe someday yeah maybe someday

chorus
for all you know yeah this could be
the difference between what you need
and what you want

outro
yeah for all you know
for all you know
yeah for all that you know
this is what you wanna be
girl what you wanna beembed"
