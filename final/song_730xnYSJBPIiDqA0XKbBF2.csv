cut to various shots from inside the high school as brian continues to narrate

brian dear mr vernon we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong what we did was wrong but we think you’re crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are what do you care you see us as you want to see us in the simplest terms in the most convenient definitions you see us as a brain an athlete a basket case princess and a criminal correct that’s the way we saw each other at seven o’clock this morning we were brainwashed

outside the school claire sits in a car with her father

claire i can’t believe you can’t get me out of this it’s so absurd i have to be here on a saturday it’s not like i’m a defective or anything

claire’s dad sighs and turns to her

claire’s dad i’ll make it up to you

he hands her a bag from the back seat

claire’s dad honey ditching class to go shopping doesn’t make you a defective have a good day

john it’s out of my hands

with the door propped open andrew clumsily tries to get back inside but slips vernon tries to help him up

she sticks a tube of lipstick between her breasts she leans her head down and swings it either way when she brings her head up she’s successfully applied lipstick to her lips the other kids clap

andrew alright great where’d you learn to do that

brian i was thinking i mean i know it’s kind of a weird time but i was just wondering um… what is going to happen to us on monday when we’re all together again i mean i consider you guys my friends i’m not wrong am i

andrew no

brian so on monday what happens

claire are we still friends you mean if we’re friends now that is

brian yeah

claire do you want the truth

brian yeah i want the truth

claire i don’t think so

allison with all of us or just john

claire with all of you

andrew that’s a real nice attitude claire

claire oh be honest andy if brian came walking up to you in the hall on monday what would you do i mean picture this you’re there with all the sports i know exactly what you’d do you’d say hi to him and when he left you’d cut him all up so your friends wouldn’t think that you really liked him

andrew no way

allison what if i came up to you

claire same exact thing

john you are a bitch

claire why ‘cause i’m telling the truth that makes me a bitch

john no ‘cause you know how shitty that is to do to someone and you don’t got the balls to stand up to your friends and tell them that you’re going to like who you want to like

claire okay what about you you hypocrite why don’t you take allison to one of your heavy metal vomit parties

allison chuckles

claire or take brian out to the parking lot at lunch to get high or what about andy for that matter what about me what would your friends say if we were walking down the hall together they’d laugh their asses off and you’d probably tell them that you were doing it with me so they’d forgive you for being seen with me

john don’t you ever talk about my friends you don’t know any of my friends you don’t look at any of my friends and you certainly wouldn’t condescend to speak to any of my friends so you just stick to the things that you know shopping nail bolish your father’s bmw and your poor rich drunk mother in the caribbean

claire shut up

john and as far as being concerned about what’s going to happen when you and i walk down the hallways at school you can forget it because it’s never going to happen just bury your head in the sand and wait for your fucking prom

claire i hate you

john yeah good

brian okay then i assume allison and i are better people than you guys huh us weirdos would you… would you do that to me

allison i don’t have any friends

brian well if you did

allison no i don’t think the kind of friends i’d have would mind

brian i just wanna tell each of you that i wouldnt do that i wouldnt and i will not cause i think thats real shitty

claire your friends wouldnt mind because they look up to us

brian youre so conceited claire youre so conceited youre so like full of yourself why are you like that

claire im not saying that to be conceited i hate it i hate having to go along with everything my friends say

brian well then why do you do it

claire i dont know i dont you dont understand you dont youre not friends with the same kind of people that andy and i are friends with you know you just dont understand the pressure that they can put on you

brian i dont understand what you think i dont understand pressure claire well fuck you fuck you

brian begins to cry into his sleeve

everyone begins to laugh

the laughter continues cut to brian playing music on the radio in an office allison dances around the middle of the room the camera follows her and we see john in the background shaking the statue while on top of it brian dances in the office he throws some papers claire dances on the stairs andrew sits on a railing drumming on his knee a montage plays of the kids dancing in various ways and combinations the montage ends and john makes his way back across the ceiling to the room he was locked in the other four kids sit on a railing

brian writes something down john sits in the closet and looks up as the door opens claire enters

john you lost

brian continues writing andrew looks up as allison enters she walks over andrew hops down from the railing brian looks up at her

allison thank you

back in the closet claire kisses john’s neck

john why’d you do that

john you know how you said before how your parents use you to get back at each other wouldn’t i be outstanding in that capacity

claire were you really disgusted about what i did with my lipstick

he nods

john no

back in the detention room brian takes one last look at the paper and kisses it

andrew what happened to you

allison why claire did it

he doesn’t say anything

allison what’s wrong

andrew nothing’s wrong it’s just you’re so different i can see your face

andrew it’s good

she smiles brian gives himself a pat on the arm cut to the five of them walking through the hallway they pass carl on the way out

carl see you brian

brian hey carl

cut to them exiting the building brian approaches his dad in the car andrew and allison kiss she rips a patch off of his jersey and walks to her car andrew’s dad pulls up andrew gets in the car claire gives john one of her earrings he kisses her she gets in the car and drives away john puts on the earring she gave him cut to vernon in the detention room reading brian’s essay

brian dear mr vernon we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong but we think youre crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are you see us as you want to see us in the simplest terms in the most convenient definitions

as the letter continues john walks across a football field

brian but what we found out is that each one of us is a brain

andrew and an athlete

allison and a basket case

claire a princess

john and a criminal

brian does that answer your question sincerely yours the breakfast club

john throws a fist up into the air and the frame freezes
