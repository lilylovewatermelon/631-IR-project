chorus frank ocean
human beings in a mob
whats a mob to a king
whats a king to a god
whats a god to a nonbeliever
who dont believe in anything
will he make it out alive
alright alright
no church in the wild
verse 1 jayz
tears on the mausoleum floor
blood stains the colosseum doors
lies on the lips of a priest
thanksgiving disguised as a feast
rolling in the rollsroyce corniche
only the doctors got this im hiding from police
cocaine seats
all white like i got the whole thing bleached
drug dealer chic
im wondering if a thugs prayers reach
is pius pious cause god loves pious
socrates asked whose bias do yall seek
all for plato screech
im out here balling i know yall hear my sneaks
jesus was a carpenter yeezy laid beats
hova flow the holy ghost get the hell up out your seats

i live by you desire
i stand by you walk through the fire
your love is my scripture
let me in through your encryption
yeah yeah
verse 2 kanye west
coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
i call that jungle fever
you will not control the threesome
just roll the weed up until i get me some
we formed a new religion
no sins as long as theres permission
and deception is the only felony
so never fuck nobody without telling me
sunglasses and advil
last night was mad real
sun coming up 5 am
i wonder if they got cabs still
thinking bout the girl in all leopard
who was rubbing the wood like kiki shepard
two tattoos one read no apologies
the other said love is cursed by monogamy
thats something that the pastor dont preach
thats something that a teacher cant teach
when we die the money we cant keep
but well probably spend it all cause the pain aint cheap
preach
