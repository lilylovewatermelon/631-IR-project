i saw you standing there
sandy blonde hair the way it came tumbling down
just like a waterfall
and if you need a light
ill be the match to your candle
my darling im ready to burst into flames for you

prechorus
i was just coasting till we met
you remind me just how good it can get

chorus
well ive been on fire dreaming of you
tell me you dont
it feels like you do
looking like that youll open some wounds
how does it start
and when does it end
only been here for a moment but i know i want you
but is it too soon
to know that im with you
theres nothing i can do

verse 2
and sometime around one
we fell asleep to escape from the sun
and we woke up to the sound of a storm outside
we stood at your front door
you looked at me and said baby this rain changes everything
and my heart ran away from me

chorus
well ive been on fire dreaming of you
tell me you dont
it feels like you do
opening up can open some wounds
how does it start
and when does it end
only been here for a moment but i know i want you
darling i do
im with you

bridge
theres nothing i wont do to see you shine
ill swing for the fences
ill run to the line
and its high time that you love me
cause you do it so well to see you shine
ill swing for the fences
ill run to the line
and its high high time

chorus
oh darling im with you
oh darling im with you
theres nothing i wont do
theres nothing i wont do
im with you
oh darling im with you10embed"
