wasn’t what i imagined from the start
this house is a mess and falling apart
makes me dread thinking of my bank account
when i know it’s in drought
with this fluorescence buzzing overhead
i can’t concentrate i switch off instead
against the backdrop of pink neon
and this cold embrace that makes my body feel wrong about

chorus
moving out
i had my doubts
but a boy must become
a man of the house

verse 2
life only seems down for the day
i know this feeling will fade away
might be broke but i’ll be okay
little things give me a reason to stay
i’ve made too many memories here
so wholesome so golden they won’t disappear
so despite all your flaws
you’re starting to feel like home i guess i was wrong about
you might also likechorus
moving out
i had my doubts
but a boy must become
a man of the house

post chorus
you can’t live forever in the safety of your mother
you can’t live forever in the safety of your father

chorus
moving out
i had my doubts
but a boy must become
a man of the house7embed"
