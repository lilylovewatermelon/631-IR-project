ill buy you a diamond ring my friend if it makes you feel alright
ill get you anything my friend if it makes you feel alright

ill give you all ive got to give if you say you love me too
i may not have a lot to give but what i got ill give to you
i dont care too
much for money
money cant buy me love
cant buy me love everybody tells me so
cant buy me love no no no no

say you dont need no diamond rings and ill be satisfied
tell me that you want the kind of things that money just cant buy
i dont care too
much for money
money cant buy me love

cant buy me love everybody tells me so
cant buy me love no no no no
