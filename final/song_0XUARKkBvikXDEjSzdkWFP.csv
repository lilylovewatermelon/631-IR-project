theres dasher
and dancer
prancer and vixen
comet and cupid
donner and blitzen
but do you recall
the most famous
reindeer of all

rudolph
the rednosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose
and if you ever saw him
you would even say it glows

all of the other reindeer
used to laugh
and call him names
they never let poor rudolph
join in any reindeer games

then one foggy christmas eve
santa came to say
rudolph with your nose so bright
wont you guide my sleigh tonight
you might also likethen how the reindeer loved him
as they shouted out with glee
rudolph the rednosed reindeer
youll go down in history

then one foggy christmas eve
santa came to say
hey rudolph
with your nose so bright
wont you guide
my sleigh tonight

then how the reindeer loved him
as they shouted out with glee
hey
rudolph the rednosed reindeer
youll go down in historyembed"
