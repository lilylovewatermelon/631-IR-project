this time if you want me to come back its up to you
but remember i wont allow the things you used to do
youre gonna have to toe the mark and walk the line
this time will be the last time
this time if i should feel unwanted i wont stay
each tomorrow will depend on the love you give today
its all up to you but keep in mind
this time will be the last time
