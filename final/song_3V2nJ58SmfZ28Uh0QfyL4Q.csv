yeah
so i guess this is what it is huh
think its obvious
we aint never gonna see eye to eye
but its funny
as much as i hate you
i need you
this is music to be murdered by

chorus nikki grier
got a premonition
i feel the end is near
the beauty starts to fade
the joy has turned to pain
i hear the symphony playin
ten thousand violins
souls floating away like feathers in the wind

verse eminem
they said my last album i sounded bitter
no i sound like a spitter
who ninety percent of
these hypocrites are tryna get rid of
but why would i get a chip on my shoulder
i was considered one time as the illest
bitch im still as fly as your zipper
true i just get richer
but if it was ever all about skrilla
then i woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
bitch shut the fuck up
i should go say that shit to tech n9ne or to jigga
nobody said shit about 2 chainz as long as hes been here shit
no wonder youre mad now im
looking at them plaques count em yeah
im ll cool j bigger and deffer thats how come uh
i sell like four mil when i put out a bad album what
revival flopped came back and i scared the crap out em
but rolling stone stars i get two and a half outta
five and ill laugh out loud
cause thats what they gave bad back in the day
which actually made me not feel as bad now cause
if it happened to james
it can happen to shady
they do the same shit to brady
more people hate me than love me
this game will make you go crazy
bout to go for broke
i was the g the oat
once i was played in rotation
at every radio station
they said im lyrically amazing
but i have nothing to say
but then when i put out revival and i had something to say
they said that they hated the awake me
i lose the rage im too tame
i get it back they say im too angry
i need to get me some dre beats
no i should hook up with tay keith
fans keep on pulling me one way
haters pull me in another
got more hooks in me than swae lee
bout to pick up some weights and lift til my tattoo of hailies face stretches
they said im just a whiner i sound like a baby
i dish it out but cant take it
but i take it dish it back out
and they get all bent out of shape
this shits almost comical
wait and i meant no disrespect
i wasnt dissin tech that was not a shot at 2 chainz or to jayz
they probably feel the same way because lately
instead of us being credited for longevity
and being able to keep it up for this long at this level we
get told well never be what we were
bitch if i was as half as good as i was
im still twice as good as youll ever be
only way that youre ahead of mes alphabetically
cause if you diss me im coming after you like the letter v
killing everything play this tune its your eulogy
its your funeral prepare to die
this is music for you to be murdered byyou might also like182embed"
