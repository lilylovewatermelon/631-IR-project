what you wanna battle me
yo man how much money you got
what you wanna battle me
yo man how much money you got

verse 1
i used to guzzle 40s and own a beat up caddy
since the hood still love me ill turn the heat up daddy
i went from mackin fly honeys on the train
to straight relaxin on the beach countin money gettin brain
soon as you rappers get a chance you wanna floss a lot
you buy a iced out watch because it cost a lot
then you in the club stylin with dough
profilin with hoes that we boned a while ago
you rookies havent done enough laps around the track
you had one hot single but then your album sounds wack
son you bore me with your war stories
you aint even do that shit so thats just more stories
how you expect us to take you seriously
the look in my eye punk has got you scared of me
im blastin your sons im snatchin your funds
you catch a royal asswhoopin youve been askin for one

bitch you dont even know the half about me
i bring it straight to your chest ask your staff about me
im just a little bit older plus a whole lot wiser
i might advise ya or i might pulverize ya
i can visit any city get respect in the street
while you alone in your room shook to death of the streets
ill take a second to speak i keep my weapon in reach
i aint talkin romance but youll get swept off your feet
i keeps a ghetto chick that loves to blast and she peddle shit
groupies fake moves i get her to settle shit
you cant compare to the status right here
legendary worldwide we can battle right here
listen junior ima tear back your wig
this aint tv but ill show you what a fear factor is
stop grillin me and all that frontin is killin me
you leave me no choice but to hurt your feelings g
