verse 1
at a wedding or a party or some downtown bar
it dont matter where we are she’s gon shine
when her song comes on you know its over yeah
even if she is completely sober

chorus
my baby’s barefoot on the dance floor spinning all around
head up in the clouds feet barely touch the ground
dont know why i bought em dont know why she brought em
got her shoes up in her hand like shes somewhere in the sand
my babys barefoot on the dance floor
my babys barefoot on the dance floor

verse 2
ooh ooh i spent on a lot on money on high heels
for her to stick ’em in her purse
’fore the band makes it through the first verse yeah
i stand back and watch her go crazy
i just laugh and say thats my baby baby

chorus
my baby’s barefoot on the dance floor spinning all around
head up in the clouds feet barely touch the ground
dont know why i bought em dont know why she brought ’em
got her shoes up in her hand like shes somewhere in the sand
my babys barefoot on the dance floor
my babys barefoot on the dance floor
