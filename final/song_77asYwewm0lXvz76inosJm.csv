go

verse 1
i cant get rid of you
i dont know what to do
i dont even know who is growing on who
yeahyeah
cause everywhere i go youre there
i cant get you out of my hair
i cant pretend that i dont care
its not fair

prechorus
im being punished for all my offences
i want to touch you but im afraid of the consequences
i want to banish you from whence you came
but youre part of me now and ive only got myself to blame

chorus
youre really growing on me or am i growing on you
youre really growing on me or am i growing on you
any fool can see

verse 2
sleepin in an empty bed
i cant get you off my head
and i wont have a life until youre dead

see the darkness liveget tickets as low as 36you might also likeprechorus
i wanna shake you off but you just wont go oh
and youre all over me but i dont want anyone to know

wont you leave me leave me leave me alone

chorus
youre really growing on me or am i growing on you
youre really growing on me or am i growing on you
any fool can see
