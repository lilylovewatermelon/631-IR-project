i cant believe its been all these years
i cant believe ive cried all these tears
my friends tell me i shouldve moved on
a long long time ago
but what do they know
what do they know

chorus
and i dont mean to be selfish
but my heart breaks every time
that i see you smile
cause i know that its not me
who brings it out of you anymore
you found somebody new
you put me in the past
i dont even know if our memories will last
but if by chance it doesnt work out with her
youll always have a chance with me in my world

verse 2
i wonder what happens when you hear our song
do you brush it away or do you sing along
do you talk about the future the way we did
is there room for me in it
is there room for me in it

and i dont mean to be selfish
but my heart breaks every time
that i see you smile
cause i know that its not me
who brings it out of you anymore
you found somebody new
you put me in the past
i dont even know if our memories will last
but if by chance it doesnt work out with her
youll always have a chance with me in my world

bridge
is it so wrong of me to hope she breaks your heart
is it so wrong of me to pray she tears you apart
and i know that in the darkest part of you
you pray and hope and wish for it too

chorus
cause you dont mean to be selfish
but your heart breaks every time
that you see me smile
cause you know that its not you
who brings it out of me anymore
you found somebody new
you put me in the past
i dont even know if our memories will last
but if by chance it doesnt work out with her
youll always have a chance with me in my world3embed"
