a nigga told me the record companys the pimp
the artist is the ho the stage is the corner
and the audience is the trick god damn

verse 1
incredible young nigga you cant believe im just one nigga
god damn ive gotten bigger
intellect superior
walk in a room and make the whole interior inferior
if you look me in my eyes
you might fuck around and lose control
of your mind body and your soul grab ahold
undisputed on the microphone whatchu think
if you wink ill make you ich think
did you blink did you ever drink your own brain matter
shotgun enema this aint no cinema
all praises due to the creator
for this man here that cant no nigga stand near
true inventor of the w
whatchu wanna do i got the red and the blue
show me one nigga dedicated to raps
ill show you ten niggas dedicated to snaps
record company death traps settin decoys
just to pimp young bboys
with a cup full of yak studio contact
maniac with a contract
well turn up the bass and the motherfuckin treble
about to do a deal with the devil for my vocal level
bullshit points plus he want to rub it in
and take all my publishin god damn
do i take it up the rectum
just to rock the spectrum
give up a right arm just to do the form
hell no all you motherfukers goan leave this bitch limpin

verse 2
imma keep it simple it went from please listen to my demo
to get your ass out my limo
stretch presidential
its essential cuz the record company will have your ass in a rental
if you let em you have to behead em
contracts you never read em
ceos you never met em
sent to a attorney burnstein and burney
nigga thats his lawyer aint got nothin for ya
treat ya like they employ ya im a warrior
bite you in the ass like a georgetown hoya
when they ignore ya cause you got to hold your balls
catch a motherfucker slippin in bathroom stalls
and then you show em that you aint a rookie
let em know that youd rather have more points than more pussy
pimp turned bookie
now how the fuck i get in so much debt
god damn we just met
he said welcome to the rap game
motherfucker be confused and broke before he know whats happenin
you can be the star and fuck women
imma just play the back and keep pimpin
chorus
