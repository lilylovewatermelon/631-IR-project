when the men take me to the devils tree
i will be free and shining like before
papa dont tell me what i shouldve done
shes the one shes the one who begged me
take me take me home

verse 2
when the wind wraps me like the reapers hand
i will swing free until they cut me down

take me take me home

when the sea takes me like my mothers arms
