the day starts like the rest weve seen
another carbon copy of an old routine

becky
days keep coming

dawn
one out one in

becky dawn  jenna
they keep coming
you might also likecal spoken
and make the coffee strong enough to chew

jenna
i dont know what i wish i had
but theres no time now for thinking things like that
weve got too much to do

becky  dawn
too much to do

jenna becky  dawn
all these same things
were always

opening up
letting the day in
over a cup
well say hello how ya been
looking around
seeing the same things
every day brings
hello how ya been
thank you come again
some things never change
becky
i wouldnt call this place a happy end
but i been round the block and just came back again
a small town like ours aint much
but sometimes home is where your ass ends up

cal
order up

dawn
ordered up is how the day will find me
everything in its place and time
and i like the way most of the days look exactly the same

cal
order up

jenna becky  dawn
check the clock
tick tick tock

cal
dont stop
serve with a smile

jenna becky  dawn
hurry up fill the coffee cup
and then in a while
take a breath when you need
to be reminded that with days like these
we can only do the best we can
til we do it again
cal
come on move it now

jenna becky  dawn
opening up
letting the day in
opening up
some things never change
hello how ya been
thank you come again
some things never change2embed"
