only been a few hours but it felt like days
only been days but it feel like months
i been gone for a year only wrote like once
life moves fast when you do what you want
i guess im doing what i want
hope you doing what you want what else
but what you want
i dont know

verse 1
my new bitch look like halle berry
but she dont love me she too scary
my old bitch fine like jackie brown
i dont wanna love her she too down
will you be my leading lady
i want a contract girl no maybe
in the meantime i guess im doing what i want
get some metime hope you doing what you want

bridge

only been a few hours but it felt like days
only been days but it feel like months
i been gone for a year only wrote like once
life moves fast when you do what you want
i guess im doing what i want you dont gotta front when lifes a water front
hope you doing what you want what else
but what you want
i dont know
you could play it loud

verse 2
crib by the beach like ordell
no beaumont my killers dont tell
chateau marmont grabbed the louis off the shelf
now my bitch addicted to chanel
will you be my leading lady
i want a contract girl no maybe
in the meantime i guess im doing what i want
get some metime i dont know
hope you doing what you want
my new bitch look like halle berry
but she dont love me she too scary
my old bitch fine like jackie brown2embed"
