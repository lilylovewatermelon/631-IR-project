breathe in right away
nothing seems to fill this place
i need this every time
so take your lies get off my case
someday i will find
a love that flows through me like this
this will fall away
this will fall away

chorus
youre getting closer
to pushing me off of lifes little edge
cause im a loser
and sooner or later you know ill be dead
youre getting closer
youre holding the rope and im taking the fall
cause im a loser
im a loser yeah

verse 2
this is getting old
i cant break these chains that i hold
my bodys growing cold
theres nothing left of this mind or my soul
addiction needs a pacifier
the buzz of this poison is taking me higher
and this will fall away
this will fall away

to pushing me off of lifes little edge
