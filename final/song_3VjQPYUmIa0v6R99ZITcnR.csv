you and your museum of lovers
the precious collection youve housed in your covers
my simpleness threatened by my own admission
and the bags are much too heavy
in my insecure condition
my pregnant mind is fat full with envy again

chorus
but i still love to wash in your old bathwater
love to think that you couldnt love another
i cant help it youre my kind of man

verse 2
wanted and adored by attractive women
bountiful selection at your discretion
i know im diving into my own destruction
so why do we choose the boys that are naughty
i dont fit in so why do you want me
and i know i cant tame you but i just keep trying

chorus
cause i love to wash in your old bathwater
love to think that you couldnt love another
im on your list with all your other women
but i still love to wash in your old bathwater
you make me feel like i couldnt love another
i cant help it youre my kind of man yeah

mmm mmm
why do the good girls always want the bad boys

bridge
so i pacify problems with kisses and cuddles
diligently doubtful through all kinds of trouble
then i find myself choking on all my contradictions

chorus
cause i still love to wash in your old bathwater
love to think that you couldnt love another
share a toothbrush youre my kind of man
i still love to wash in your old bathwater
make me feel like i couldnt love another
i cant help it youre my kind of man

i cant help myself
i still love to wash in your old bathwater
