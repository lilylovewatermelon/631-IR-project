here we go
yeah

verse
yesterday morning was crazy
i had to come to terms with the fact that its not a maybe
that shit is in stone sealed and signed
she not my lover like billie jean but the kid is mine
sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time and all it took was one time
shit we only met two times two times
and both times were nothin like the new times
now its rough times im out here on front lines
just tryin to make sure that i see him sometimes
its breakin my spirit
single father i hate when i hear it
i used to challenge my parents on every album
now im embarrassed to tell em i ended up as a coparent
always promised the family unit
i wanted it to be different because ive been through it
but this is the harsh truth now
and fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories i tell you now
i dont want you worry bout whose house
you live at or who loves you more or whos not there
who did what to who fore you got here
nah look im too proud to let that come between me and you now
realize i gotta think for two now
i gotta make it i better make it
i promise if im not dead then im dedicated
this the first positive dna we ever celebrated
i cant forget the looks on they faces
got the news in miami that now we all got ones that we raisin
tell gelo bring some mod ros√© and the baccarats out
for our cheers to the next generation
but this champagne toast is shortlived
i got an empty crib in my empty crib
i only met you one time introduced you to saint nick
i think he mustve brought you like twenty gifts
your mother say you growin so fast that they dont even really fit
but man you know
i still had to get it for my boy though you know
you havent met your grandfather yet that nigga a trip
he probably coulda did standup
yeah but at the same time hes a stand up
and thats how you gon be when its time to man up
october baby for ironys sake of course
i got this 11 tatted for somebody now its yours
and believe me i cant wait to get a hundred more
sorry im ventin tryna cover ground
they said that in two weeks youre supposed to come in town
hopefully by the time you hear this
me and your mother will have come around
instead of always cuttin each other down
god willin i got a good feelin
you got a good spirit
well talk more when you hear this my g

im changing from boy to a man
no one to guide me im all alone
no one to cry on
i need shelter from the rain to ease the pain
of changing from boy to a man
no one to guide me im all alone
no one to cry on
i need shelter from the rain to ease the pain
of changing from boy to a man
im all alone
no one to cry on
i need shelter from the rain to ease the pain
of changing from boy to a man
here we go again29embed"
