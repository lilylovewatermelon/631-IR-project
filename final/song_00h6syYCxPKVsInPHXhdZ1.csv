i was fine just a guy living on my own
waiting for the sky to fall
then you called and changed it all doll
velvet lips and the eyes to pull me in
we both know youd already win
mmm your original sin

prechorus
you fooled me once with your eyes now honey
you fooled me twice with your lies and i say

chorus
sarah smiles like sarah doesnt care
she lives in her world so unaware
does she know that my destiny lies with her
sarah sarah sarah sarah
oh sarah sarah are you saving me

verse 2
waking up to a kiss and youre on your way
i really hoped that you would stay
but you left and went your own way babe
i dont mind take your time i got things to do
besides sit around and wait for you
oh and i hope you do too
you might also likeprechorus
you fooled me once with your eyes now honey
you fooled me twice with your lies and i say

chorus
sarah smiles like sarah doesnt care
she lives in her world so unaware
does she know that my destiny lies with her
sarah
oh sarah are you saving me

bridge
and its killing me inside
consuming all my time youve left me blind
and when i think im right you strip away my pride
you cast it all aside but i say

chorus
sarah smiles like sarah doesnt care
she lives in her world so unaware
does she know that my destiny lies with her
sarah sarah
oh sarah sarah are you saving me21embed"
