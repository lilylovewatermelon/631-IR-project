she says it helps with the lights out
her rabid glow is like braille to the night
she swears im a slave to the details
but if your life is such a big joke why should i care

chorus 1
the clock is set for nine but you know youre gonna make it eight
so that you two can take some time teach each other to reciprocate

verse 2
she feels that my sentimental side should be held with kids gloves
but she doesnt know that i left my urge in the icebox
she swears im just prey for the female
well then hook me up and throw me baby cakes cause i like to get hooked

chorus 2
the clock is set for nine but you know youre gonna make it eight
all the people that youve loved theyre all bound to leave some keepsakes
ive been swinging all the time think its time i learned your way
i picture you and me together in the jungle it would be okay

bridge
ill bring you when my lifeboat sails through the night
that is supposing that you dont sleep tonight
its like learning a new language
helps me catch up on my mime
if you dont bring up those lonely parts
this could be a good time
its like learning a new language
you come here to me
well collect those lonely parts and set them down
you come here to me
