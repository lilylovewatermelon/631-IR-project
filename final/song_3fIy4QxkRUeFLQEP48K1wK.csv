a cigarette a fireescape

walked this line
with dust in our pockets for the bedford station line to take us

crazy
the drunkard playing the casio
were quiet
every time we start starin up
and hear
all the loneliest crickets play their violins

oh what a shame
a subway ride was never meant to lastsee gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeembed"
