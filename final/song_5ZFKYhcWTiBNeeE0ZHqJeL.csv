im broken between disillusions
outside the window noonday communion
i never understood kids in the neighborhood
playing in the front yard loosely committed
now as i look upon them in the front lawn
it doesn’t take long for me to get it

prechorus
and oh oh oh oh oh oh
ive been losing my mind for quite some time
and oh oh oh oh oh oh
i find again that it has been something
i i i i i i
i have been so untrue true true oh
cause where where where where where where
where did i lose you

chorus
oh i was something so remarkable
it seems to me that she was only in my head
for a moment i told you i lost it
tornado over conscious
spinning around the room
you move in ways i’ll never understand
so my guess at best is only just a second man

her fingers were crossed behind her back
well they say its fair game
but i dont trust like that
i guess the game we play is taking different shape
we make up new rules as we go along
and all her other friends line up along the fence
im in the last draft as i expected

prechorus
and oh oh oh oh oh
ive been losing my mind for quite some time
and oh oh oh oh oh oh
i find again that it has been something
i i i i i i
i have been so untrue true true oh
cause where where where where where where
where did i lose you

chorus
oh i was something so remarkable
it seems to me that she was only in my head
for a moment i told you i lost it
tornado over conscious
spinning around the room
you move in ways ill never understand
so my guess at best is only just a second man
bridge
oh i can see whats happening to us
i saw it from a mile away okay oh well

chorus
oh i was something so remarkable
it seems to me that she was only in my head
for a moment i told you i lost it
tornado over conscious
spinning around the room
you move in ways i’ll never understand
so my guess at best is only just a second man3embed"
