its the most beautiful time of the year
lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
i should be playing in the winter snow
but ima be under the mistletoe
i dont wanna miss out on the holiday

but ima be under the mistletoe

everyones gathering around the fire
chestnuts roasting like a hot july
i should be chilling with my folks i know

reindeers flying through the sky so high
