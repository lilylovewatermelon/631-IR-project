that makes my heart sing
been looking for a melody
that makes the church bells ring
not looking for the fame
or the fortune it might bring
in love in music in life

jesus preached the golden rule
buddha taught it too
gandhi said eye for an eye
makes the whole world go blind
with a little understanding
we can break these chains that we’ve been handed
ive got the medication
love is the remedy

pray to be stronger and wiser
know you get what you give
love one another
amen amen amen

ive been thinking about the mark
that i’ll be leaving
been looking for a truth
i can believe in
i got everything i need
let this heart be my guide
in love in music in life

heaven knows there’s much that im still finding
making my way down this winding road
holding on to what i love
yeah and leaving the rest behind
for love for music for life

pray to be stronger and wiser
know you get what you give
love one another

love is the remedy
were all in this world together
lifes a gift that we have to treasure
happiness now that is the measure
love is the remedy
love is the remedy

everyone can be forgiven
one love and one religion
open up your heart and listen
love is the remedy

pray to be stronger and wiser
and know you get what you give
god is love one another
amen amen amen amen amen1embed"
