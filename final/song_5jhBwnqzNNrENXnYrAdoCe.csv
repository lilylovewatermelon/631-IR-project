everybody dies surprise surprise
we tell each other lies sometimes we try
to make it feel like we might be right
we might not be alone
be alone

verse 2
everybody dies thats what they say
and maybe in a couple hundred years theyll find another way
i just wonder why youd wanna stay
if everybody goes
youd still be alone

verse 3
i dont wanna cry some days i do
but not about you
its just a lot to think about the world im used to
the one i cant get back at lеast not for a while
i sure have a knack for seein lifе more like a child
its not my fault its not so wrong to wonder why
everybody dies
and when will i

verse 4
you oughta know
that even when its time you might not wanna go
but its okay to cry and its alright to fold
but you are not alone
you are not unknownyou might also like44embed"
