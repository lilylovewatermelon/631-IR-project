verse 3
picture me rollin through downtown in a a4
picture my signature on a pair of some j 4s
picture me carin what niggas sayin on wifi they dont pay for
knew i needed love but i think i value the hate more
to push towards things that i prayed for
retrograde energy shifts are what i was made for
and dont you dare hit me back with no k sure
soon as i tell you that you the one i would wait for
you too saucy too flossy you moved in and moved off me
all to be with niggas who just startin to move bossy
maybe i just handled you too softly
them boys got no kelis in they blood
if your whole heart wasnt in it i know a piece of it was
posted that pic you sent me it wasnt recent enough
how im supposed to wife it you not ayesha enough
you love getting td up
love showin the cakes you know that they eat it up
love touchin the road as soon as its heatin up
invited you over you said that you showin up
all them spelling mistakes i know that you drunk as fuck
all them other mistakes lets let it be what it was
them niggas just cant understand it
i want you to change my mind im praying you pulling up
know who you be around i know that they teaming up
telling you you better off leavin me in the dust
chorus
i wanted you to race my mind i got the keys
please for me
since youre comin home intoxicated oh
for me please
i wanted you to race my mind yeah

outro
i got the keys
please for me
since youre coming home intoxicated oh
for me please13embed"
