some dont last the way they should
some make you feel good for a little while
and then you throw em away
some are up on a shelf for some other time
some are high dollar some aint worth a dime
but you keep em anyway

prechorus
everybodys looking for something
so how do i catch your eye eye eye

if youre shoe shopping walk a mile with me
slip a cinderella slipper right on your feet
take my arm strut down the street tonight
strut down that street tonight
if youre downtown on the browse about
