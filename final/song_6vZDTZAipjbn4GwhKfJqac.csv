do you like it when the meters jumpin
you like the sound of them horses runnin
do you like it when the twitters tweetin
do you like it when the backseats bumpin
do you like a little kick in your coke
do you like it goin up in smoke
do you like it on a gravel road
where we can keep it on the down low

chorus
tell me how you like it tell me how you like it
you know i wanna try it know i wanna try it
baby if you dont mind it if you dont mind it
we can kick it down to four and you can drive
pretty girl you can ride it
we can all night it we can all night it
you dont have to hide it you dont have to hide it
just tell me how tell me how you like it

verse 2
do you like it on a riverbank
do you like it when the sun done sank
do you like it when the full moons high
and its shinin down into your drink
do you like it when the tailgates down
do you like it when we take it to the ground
tell me baby how does that sound
either way you know its goin down
you might also likechorus
tell me how you like it tell me how you like it
you know i wanna try it know i wanna try it
baby if you dont mind it if you dont mind it
we can kick it down to four and you can drive
pretty girl you can ride it
we can all night it we can all night it
you dont have to hide it you dont have to hide it
just tell me how tell me how you like it

verse 3

chorus

verse 4
do you like it in the shotgun seat
with the highway flyin right under your feet
do you like it with the radio on
just tell me how tell me how you like it
do you like it by the bonfire heat
if it gets too hot we can take it to the creek
i need to know
lets make it last all night long
just tell me how tell me how you like it2embed"
