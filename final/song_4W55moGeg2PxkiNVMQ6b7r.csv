lets say there are many times i looked
and saw reflections of my son
i argued sometimes consulted
i saw results and said well done

i thought of him constantly
and silently asked why
i tried fervently
and just cannot say goodbye

i lived with visions twined and twisted
passion so cold
and withered thoughts battered and shattered
i dreamed dreams
cherished memories
housed friendship
and promises that mattered

in the end
time is treasured
but love for my son
its everlastingembed"
