you gave my shirt back i dont really get the meaning
its like youre giving up before it all goes wrong
ive been told but i dont really like the feeling
ive been away ive been away too long

iii wanna go wherever you are
iii wanna be wherever you are
iii wanna see whatever you are

made of glass
but i think your heart is a muscle your heart is a muscle
you gotta work it out make it stronger
try for me just a little longer

if i could turn this plane around
id fly to where you are right now
write your name into the sky
hope that it will light up your eyes light up your eyes
