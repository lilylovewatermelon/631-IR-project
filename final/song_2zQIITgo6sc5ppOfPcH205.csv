youre in control is there anywhere you wanna go
youre in control is there anything you wanna know
the futures for discovering
the space in which were travelling

chorus
from the top of the first page
to the end of the last day
from the start in your own way
you just want存omebody listening to what you say
it doesnt matter who you are

verse 2
under the surface trying to break through
deciphering the codes in you
i need a compass draw me a map
im on the top i cant get back
woah woah

chorus
the first line of the first page
to the end of the last place you were looking
from the start in your own way
you just want存omebody listening to what you say
it doesnt matter who you are
it doesnt matter who you are

ooh
you just want存omebody listening to what you say
you just want存omebody listening to what you say
it doesnt matter who you are
it doesnt matter who you are

outro
is there anybody out there who
is lost and hurt and lonely too
are they bleeding all your colours into one
and if you come undone as if youd been run through
some catapult it fired you
you wonder if your chancell ever come
well if youre stuck in square one14embed"
