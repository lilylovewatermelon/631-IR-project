stopped by that house on nesbitt lake
hes sittin in his easy chair watchin a sunday evenin race
tells me my grandmas in the other room
guess he forgot we laid her down itll be a year come june
then he mumbles about vietnam
he dont know who the hell i am
but the drivers well he tells me who they are
i guess he still knows the numbers on the cars

verse 2
we try to get him out like we used to
but now i load the truck and i drive the boat
cause there aint much he can do no
cast him a line and watched it as it sank
thinkin how wed used to talk for hours
now he just stares at the bank
he used to know every stump in this fishin hole
though he probably thinks that were in mexico
but he knows his way around that boat even in the dark
and he still knows the numbers on the cars

bridge
i know he aint all there but i dont care
my minds still full of memories with him
and he may not know all the words to the songs
but he still knows merle haggards voice when he hears it
see riley green liveget tickets as low as 7you might also likeverse 3
i stopped by that house on nesbitt lake
with a couple of tickets to go see a sunday evenin race
as we watched those cars fly around the track
i asked the lord if just one more time
hed bring my old friend back
then somewhere around lap 23
that old man turned and smiled at me
and for a moment i know he knows where we are
cause he still knows the numbers
yeah he still knows the numbers
he still knows the numbers numbers on the cars
yeah he still knows the numbersembed"
