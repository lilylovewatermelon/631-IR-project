ever since i was young coming up coming up
always marching to a drum bradadum bradadum
always focused on me one one one one
now i wish that i could hold someone someone

prechorus 1
so tell my mom i love her
call my baby sister
shouldve hugged and kissed her
cause life is just a mystery
and its gone before you know it
so if you love me wont you show it

chorus
cause this life is one big symphony
this night is one for you and me
im the strings and youre the timpani
youre my constant tambourine
this life is one big symphony
so glad ive got you next to mе
im the chords and youre the mеlody
this lifes one big symphony

postchorus
she was the piano
im the xylophone
you can have the trumpet
im the saxophone
see imagine dragons liveget tickets as low as 120you might also likeverse 2
life is skipping rope keep going keep going
finding solace in a note dote dote dote dote
had to struggle when i was broke so low so low
writing music just to cope no hope no hope

prechorus 2
yeah life is just perspective
laughing when youve wrecked it
smiling when you kept it together
you weathered the storm
at the end of the play you sang all the way
doesnt matter how offkey if you did it your way

chorus
this life is one big symphony
this night is one for you and me
im the strings and youre the timpani
youre my constant tambourine
this life is one big symphony
so glad ive got you next to me
im the chords and youre the melody
this lifes one big symphony

bridge
would you care if i played you the flute
see its my favorite one because its so delicate and beautiful
i pull out the trombone if its more suitable
wanna make you smile
its been a little while since ive seen the white of your teeth
been a hard year
lucky the guitars here
guitar solo

chorus
life is just one big symphony
this life is one big symphony
this night is one for you and me
im the strings and youre the timpani
youre my constant tambourine
this life is one big symphony
so glad ive got you next to me
im the chords and youre the melody
this lifes one big symphony1embed"
