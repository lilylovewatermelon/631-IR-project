classification and organization is ruining the minds of our generation
i said it
that’s why they’re always spraying up in the sky they had a new design today
but theyre on their phone and im on a roll
and i do not care cause i am the oldest one
up in my mind but not in real time
im just a teenager
but i feel angrier than a swarm of hornets
they call us whores but its just because
we do just what we want and dont look back once
is that what its come to no no
my parents are 1 and 2 and i am their child
i am 3 i am the wild
i am free
we are the children that sing the ancient song
and we can sing it very well
but theres still so much to learn
theres still so much to earn
but i yearn

who am i scared
who cut us open

verse 2
organization and classification is ruining the hearts of our generation
i said it
but actually true told me that
true made the map
true took us to the forest to the top of the mountain
you might also likeits true its true its true
he told me to get on the mic and spit whats in my lung
i tried to say i tried to tell him
boy i dont do that i dont do the things that you do
but then he looked at me and said you do you do
 got face too went into my room at night
they tried to talk about who
and im like let me sleep
but they just wake me up
they just try to tell me the things i know already
in my cerebral capacity
but its locked why cant i get in
maybe i should ask finn maybe i should ask jake
maybe we go to a lake that i found
maybe we go right now
and its snowing but its warm outside
write a letter on the beach at night
go to bed and then i see those lights
i see those lights i see their eyes
staring back at me telling me about the symmetry
telling me about atomic structure
the way she loves her the way
the ocean rolls around and round and round
and round and round and round and round and round
and the taurus goes around and down
and down and down and down and down it never stops
never rock
i call it crystal now you call it rock
im in the spot
you dont want to walk around on the hot coals of selfacceptance
man i get you msfts here to rep yah
well do this together
outro
organization and classification is ruining the souls of our generation
we said it
and the kids know very well
and the kids will dig the well
deep inside of their third eye and get all the messages inside10embed"
