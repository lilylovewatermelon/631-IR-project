when the world has turned its back
when the days have turned pitch black
when the fear abducts your tongue
when the fires dead and gone

chorus 1
so what now
where go i

verse 2
when you think its all said and done
when you are the ostracized
selfish ridden dead goodbyes
twisting of the tourniquet
when the pieces never fit

chorus 1
so what now
where go i
when you think its all said and done

chorus 2
bow down
sell your soul to me
i will set you free
pacify your demons
bow down
surrender unto me
submit infectiously
sanctify your demons
into abyss
you dont exist
cannot resist
the judas kiss
see metallica liveget tickets as low as 66you might also likeverse 3
when the storm has blacked your sky
intuition crucify
when the ego strips your reign
assassinate the living flame

chorus 1
so what now
where go i

verse 4
when you think its all said and done
venom of a life insane
bites into your fragile veins
internalize and decimate
patronize and complicate

chorus 1
so what now
where go i
when you think its all said and done

chorus 2
bow down
sell your soul to me
i will set you free
pacify your demons
bow down
surrender unto me
submit infectiously
sanctify your demons
into abyss
you dont exist
cannot resist
the judas kiss
bridge
judas lives recite this vow
ive become your new god now

verse 5
followed you from dawn of time
whisper thoughts into your mind
watched your towers hit the ground
lured the children never found
helped your kings abuse their crown
in the heart of feeble man
plant the seeds of my own plan
the strong and powerful will fall
find a piece of me in all
inside you all

chorus 2
bow down
sell your soul to me
i will set you free
pacify your demons
bow down
surrender unto me
submit infectiously
sanctify your demons
into abyss
you dont exist
cannot resist
the judas kiss
