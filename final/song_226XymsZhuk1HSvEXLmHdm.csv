send her your love
with a dozen roses
make sure that she knows it
with a flower from your heart

chorus 2
show him your love
dont hold back your feelings
you dont need a reason
when its straight from the heart

verse 1
ive heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
and people falling in love is so old fashioned
but waiting are they the day they once let slip away
hiding need to fulfill their hearts desire for love’s passion

chorus 1
send her your love
with a dozen roses
make sure that she knows it
with a flower from your heart

chorus 2
show him your love
dont hold back your feelings
you dont need a reason
when its straight from the heart

i know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal
and can only happen in make believe stories
but so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
for around us are miracles of love’s glory

chorus 2
show him your love
dont hold back your feelings
you dont need a reason
when its straight from the heartembed"
