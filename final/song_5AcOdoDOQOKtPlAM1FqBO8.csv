its so loud inside my head
with words that i should have said
as i drown in my regrets
i cant take back the words i never said
i cant take back the words i never said

verse 1 lupe fiasco
i really think the war on terror is a bunch of bullshit
just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
how much money does it take to really make a full clip
911 building 7 did they really pull it
uh and a bunch of other coverups
your childs future was the first to go with budget cuts
if you think that hurts then wait here comes the uppercut
the school was garbage in the first place thats on the up and up
keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
you get it then they move it so you never keeping up enough
if you turn on tv all you sees a bunch of whatthefucks
dude is dating so and so blabbering bout such and such
and that aint jersey shore homie thats the news
and these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
limbaugh is a racist glenn beck is a racist
gaza strip was getting bombed obama didnt say shit
thats why i aint vote for him next one either
im a part of the problem my problem is im peaceful
and i believe in the people yeah

verse 2 lupe fiasco
now we can say it aint our fault if we never heard it
but if we know better then we probably deserve it
jihad is not holy war wheres that in the worship
murdering is not islam and you are not observant
and you are not a muslim
israel dont take my side cause look how far youve pushed them
walk with me into the ghetto this where all the kush went
complain about the liquor store but what you drinking liquor for
complain about the gloom but whend you pick a broom up
just listening to pac aint gon make it stop
a rebel in your thoughts aint gon make it halt
if you dont become a actor youll never be a factor
pills with million side effects take em when the pains felt
wash em down with diet soda killing off your brain cells
crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today
so if you ever miss a payment they can take your home away
chorus skylar grey
its so loud inside my head
with words that i should have said
as i drown in my regrets
i cant take back the words i never said never said
i cant take back the words i never said
verse 3 lupe fiasco
i think that all the silence is worse than all the violence
fear is such a weak emotion thats why i despise it
we scared of almost everything afraid to even tell the truth
so scared of what you think of me im scared of even telling you
sometimes im like the only person i feel safe to tell it to
im locked inside a cell in me i know that theres a jail in you
consider this your bailing out so take a breath inhale a few
my screams is finally getting free my thoughts is finally yelling through

chorus skylar grey
its so loud inside my head
with words that i should have said
as i drown in my regrets
i cant take back the words i never said51embed"
