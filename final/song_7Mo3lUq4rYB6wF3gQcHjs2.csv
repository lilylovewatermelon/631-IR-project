oh we were standing there
when the moon broke through
and i wonder still
what it meant to you

do the months roll by
when youre far from home
are you doing fine
have you grown wistful on your own

verse 1
by now all the crowds inside
through the glass door pairs of shifting lights
i can understand
why youd live this life
content to wait awhile
this view is rather nice

chorus
oh we were standing there
when the moon broke through
and i wonder still
what it meant to you

do the months roll by
when youre far from home
are you doing fine
have you grown wistful on your own

airs still on the balconys edge
then the months gone
with everything we said
i contextualize on a frame and screen
nondiegetic tunes with striking color schemes

chorus
oh we were standing there
when the moon broke through
and i wonder still
what it meant to you

every county road
every coastal view
moments meant to fade to
an image youll flip through2embed"
