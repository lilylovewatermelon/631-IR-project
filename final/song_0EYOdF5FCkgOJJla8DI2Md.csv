you
why do they always send the poor

verse 1 serj tankian
barbarisms by barbaras with pointed heels
victorious victorias kneel for brand new spanking deals
marching forward hypocritic and hypnotic computers
you depend on our protection yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth

chorus serj tankian
la la la la la la la la la la oohooh
everybodys going to the party have a real good time
dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine

verse 2 serj tankian
kneeling roses disappearing into moses dry mouth
breaking into fort knox stealing our intentions
hangars sitting dripped in oil crying freedom
handed to obsoletion still you feed us lies from the table cloth

chorus serj tankian with daron malakian
la la la la la la la la la la oohooh
everybodys going to the party have a real good time
dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine
everybodys going to the party have a real good time
dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine

blast off its party time
and we dont live in a fascist nation
blast off its party time
and where the fuck are you

refrain daron malakian with serj tankian
where the fuck are you
where the fuck are you
why dont presidents fight the war
why do they always send the poor
why dont presidents fight the war
why do they always send the poor
why do they always send the poor
why do they always send the poor
why they always send the poor

verse 2 serj tankian
kneeling roses disappearing into moses dry mouth
breaking into fort knox stealing our intentions
hangars sitting dripped in oil crying freedom
handed to obsoletion still you feed us lies from the table cloth

chorus serj tankian with daron malakian

everybodys going to the party have a real good time
dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine
everybodys going to the party have a real good time
dancing in the desert blowing up the sun
