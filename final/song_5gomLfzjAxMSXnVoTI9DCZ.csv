the ceilings falling in
every time i dont know where youve been
out on love
at this point i realize love is not an emotion i can neglect
seventeen to lifetime i thought i knew
my queen thought i wasnt ready for love she was right
the seasons change when we all stay the same
what did love mean to me it didnt mean anything
the pain compassion affection
i felt back then wont ever go away
i just knew i wanted her back
echoes call me back to the feeling again
cant be a king without love
echoes call me back to the feeling again love
echoes call me back to the feeling againsee tyga liveget tickets as low as 300you might also like1embed"
