if only you you could see
the darkest place that you could be
oh maybe then youd understand
from desert heat to cobbled streets
from broken home to the city beat
theres so much more than you could know

chorus
so take me back when i believed
back when i was unafraid just like a thief
and all the heights that i could reach
back when i was unafraid just like a thief

verse 2
if i could live a thousand times
if i could make a thousand tries
oh maybe then id get it right
the more i see the more i know
that everyone just wants a show
no we dont want to see the truth

chorus
so take me back when i believed
back when i was unafraid just like a thief
and all the heights that i could reach
back when i was unafraid just like a thief

when the stars look down on me
what do they see
when the stars look down on me
what do they see
when the stars look down on me
what do they see
when the stars look down on me
what do they see
when the stars look down on me
what do they see

chorus
so take me back when i believed
back when i was unafraid just like a thief
and all the heights that i could reach
back when i was unafraid just like a thief
