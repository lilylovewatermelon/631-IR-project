raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
brown paper packages tied up with strings
these are a few of my favorite things

verse 2
cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
these are a few of my favorite things

verse 3
girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
silver white winters that melt into springs
these are a few of my favorite things

bridge
when the dog bites
when the bee stings
when im feeling sad
i simply remember my favorite things
and then i dont feel so bad

brown paper packages tied up with strings
