i hear you call it civilization
its a jungle out there
its a jungle out there
unending nights of temptation
its a jungle out there
but you just dont care

verse 1
each night you dress up to kill them
down at the watering hole
you stalk your prey with high fashion
with self control you bladeroll
the lonely and the lonely heart hunters
the neon love life oh it cuts like a knife

chorus
i hear you call it civilization
its a jungle out there
its a jungle out there

verse 2
the sounds and shadows surround you
youre swinging vine to vine
below the nightmare it gathers
its like a jungle at feeding time
clawing through the crowd each night
oh you set your trap so carefully a trophy for your wall
someone has you in their sights
you are both the hunters and the prey no winners at all
