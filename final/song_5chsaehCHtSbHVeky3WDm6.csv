its far beyond your reach it holds a place in time
somewhere ahead is the back of the line
i cant relate to your mistakes
awkwardly speaking with nothing to say

verse 2
caught up in your life excuses are so lame
you may be different but im still the same
the reasons that you thought the intention that you caught
you say things are simple we both know theyre not

prechorus
you cant let it go
whoaohohohohoh
you cant but i know
whoaohohohohoh
whoaoh you dont even know

chorus
its not in what you do more in what you say
its not in what you do more in what you say
its not in what you do more in what you say
its not in what you do what you do

verse 3
a million questions asked the remnants of the past
youve always been denied but always by your side
ive always tried to to understand you
the worlds not learning from you

its not in what you do more in what you say
