theres a shotgun on the rack and that rearviews got a picture of us
that radio dial stays on 953 cause its the only one around here that plays country

if ya want to get to get to know me it aint that hard
its sitting on some goodyears there in the yard
got some dents got some dings been my best friend since i was 16
baptized in dirty water handed down to me from my father
if ya wanna know wanna know what im made of just look at my truck

that headlights still busted out from the night they tried to take my keys
and that tailgates all rusted now but you wouldnt believe the good times its seen
and when the girls would come and it can haul some ass
youd never seen an 85 hit a hundred that fast

if ya want to get to get to know me it aint that hard
its sitting on some goodyears there in the yard
got some dents got some dings been my best friend since i was 16
baptized in dirty water handed down to me from my father
if ya wanna know wanna know what im made of just look at my truck

yeah plenty of stop sign birds on the power line shot in the daylight on county road 39
plenty of full moons plenty of me and you plenty of memories in the rearview

if ya want to get to get to know me it aint that hard
its sitting on some goodyears there in the yard
got some dents got some dings been my best friend since i was 16
baptized in dirty water handed down to me from my father
if ya wanna know wanna know what im made of
i said if ya wanna know wanna know what im made of just look at my truck
