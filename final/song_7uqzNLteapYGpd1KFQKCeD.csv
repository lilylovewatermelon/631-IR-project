lift our idleness thinking will we die sometime
who will sing and make our dreams wake up tonight
for an unknown wasteland came into the light

i know that youre waiting for me
no girl this aint makebelieve
i know that youre waiting for me
no girl this aint makebelieve

let me think a moment for the second time
stay inside while i find past still very blind
left me somewhere sitting patient still right mind
brightness into always sun shines bright as skies

i know that youre waiting for me
no girl this aint makebelieve
i know that youre waiting for me
no girl this aint makebelieve

i know that youre waiting for me
no girl this aint makebelieve
i know that youre waiting for me
no girl this aint makebelieveyou might also like3embed"
