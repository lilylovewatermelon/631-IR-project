im slowly killing myself
im trying so hard at the back of the shelf
its just the same every day
im writing these songs that will never get played
i get told whats wrong and whats right
i dont have a romantic life
and everyones dying so i keep on trying
to make em proud before they are gone

chorus
but cant someone help me
oh please someone help me
i dont care anyone anything
cause im so sick of being so lonely
miss all my family
i dont care anyone anything
cause im so sick of being so lonely

verse 2
im spending more than i earn
drink all the time to forget im not her
cause i go to parties sometimes
and ill kiss a boy and pretend for the night
cause i dont know much about me
im still ashamed of who i used to be
so i try way too hard but i still miss the mark to fit in
fit in woah
