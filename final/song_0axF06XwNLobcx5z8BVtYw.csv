oh baby here comes the sound
verse 1
took a train outta new orleans
and they shot me full of ephedrine
this is how we like to do it in the murder scene
can we settle up the score
chorus
if you were here id never have a fear
so go on live your life
but i miss you more than i did yesterday

postchorus
youre beautiful
verse 2
well im a total wreck and almost every day
like the firing squad or the mess you made
well dont i look pretty walking down the street
in the best damn dress i own
chorus
if you were here id never have a fear
so go on live your life
but i miss you more than i did yesterday
youre so far away
so cmon show me how
cause i mean this more than words could ever say
see my chemical romance liveget tickets as low as 445you might also likebridge
some might say we are made from the sharpest things you say
we are young and we dont care woahoh
your dreams and your hopeless hair woahoh
we never wanted it to be this way for all our lives
do you care at all

chorus
if you were here id never have a fear
so go on live your life
but i miss you more than i did yesterday
youre so far away
so cmon show me how
cause i mean this more than words could ever say
outro

well theres no way im kissing that guy
well come on come on come on come on
