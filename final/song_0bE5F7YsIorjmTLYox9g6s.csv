i was born on a sidewalk in a city i dont know
in 65 i took arms and got on a boat
they told me to shoot at wherever i saw smoke
i could not stop laughing lord it seemed like a joke
oh oh
oh oh

verse 2
in 75 at twentyfive i had me a son
and he died when he was young because of my gun
left out in the open in case i had to run
i could not believe it neither did anyone
oh oh
oh oh

verse 3
they found me in shreveport just me and my knife
they cleaned off my blood and they sent me to life
for thirty years i lay awake in the night
thinkin bout the jungle and blood and the fight
oh fight

verse 4
then in 2005 is let out on the street
a young fiftyfive and now thats where i sleep
i do my best workin with a cup and a sign
askin folks please spare some change or some time
or some time
oh some time

yesterday a young man came and stood at my feet
he asked me what i wanted i said something to eat
he said killers with guns they belong on the street
i thought about that and i laughed till i cried
thats the best damn joke id heard in a long time
a very long time
well a very long time time time
a very long time

lord a very long time
a very long time
a very long timeembed"
