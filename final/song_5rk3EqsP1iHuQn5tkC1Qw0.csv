fuck rap ive been rich crack by my stick shift
oxy like concerts always my bread first
get mine my nickname ox and cocaine
nina my new thing blew up before fame
heart filled with octane fire in my soul
burn through my shoestring came up from boosting
durags and flatlines drivebys at bedtime
get down i heard mom someone lost they grandson
thank god that im straight no wonder my mom prayed
lost one of my cuzzos cursed from them devils
good weed and me time goodbye to nissan
cause one day this rappin gon pay

my time to show out finally the illest crip
and i guarantee i spit harder than concrete
surprised i got teeth my lungs inhale keef
peyote with thc swinging for the fence
i hope i make it out the park where the baseheads slide
after dark where the bangers get caught
hid the gun in the trees arrest me by the court
i just wanna smoke weed and sip lean by the quart for real
good weed i hit that crack rock i sold that
oxy i hid that right by my nutsack
fuck pigs i bust back learned that from deuce rat
peanut and bloon had gats before racks
way fore i found rap bitch i had them things wrapped
astro on my cap this shot aint no phone app
chucks on my young heel make sure that my sag ill
learn my set trip grill trade in my big wheel
good grades and skipped school this life gon catch up soon
sure nough that shit did twentyyearold kid
got off my behind write me some sweet lines
cause one day my story gon pay
