and then i found out how hard it is to really change
even hell can get comfy once youve settled in
i just wanted the numb inside me to leave
no matter how fucked you get
sorrow is there when you come back down
funny thing is all i ever wanted i already had
theres glimpses of heaven in every day
in the friends i have the music i make with the love i feel
i just had to start again

verse 1
the days are a deathwish
a witchhunt for an exit
i am powerless
the fragile the broken
sit in circles and stay unspoken
we are powerless
because we all walk alone on an empty staircase
silent halls and nameless faces
i am powerless

prechorus
everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die
i cant fear death no longer ive died a thousand times
why explore the universe when we dont know ourselves
theres an emptiness inside our heads that no one dares to dwell

throw me to the flames
watch me burn
set my world ablaze
watch me burn
verse 2
how are we on a scale of one to ten
could you tell me what you see
do you wanna talk about it
how does that make you feel
have you ever took a blade to your wrists
have you been skipping meals
were gonna try something new today
how does that make you feel
