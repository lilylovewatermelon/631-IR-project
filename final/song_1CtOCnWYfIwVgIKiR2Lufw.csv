there is no future
there is no past

roger
thank god this moments not the last

mimi  roger
theres only us
theres only this
forget regret or life is yours to miss

all
no other road no other way
no day but today

mimi maureen joanne
i cant control
my destiny
i trust my soul
my only goal is just to be

roger mark benny tom overlapping
will i lose my dignity
will someone care
will i wake tomorrow
from this nightmare
you might also likemimi maureen joanne
without you
the hand gropes
the ear hears
the pulse beats
life goes on
but im gone
cause i die
without you
i die without you
i die without you
i die without you

roger mark benny tom overlapping
theres only now
theres only here
give in to love
or live in fear
no other path
no other way
no day but today
no day but today
no day but today
no day but today

all
no day but today1embed"
