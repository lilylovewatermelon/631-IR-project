im drowning in the bottom of a bottle
running from a man i swore id never be
no one ever has to face tomorrow
but im the one that has to face me

prechorus 1
its the demons ive created for myself
the tragic truth
its hard for me to understand myself
so it has to be hard as hell for you for you you

chorus
are we born to be broken sinners and thieves
someone tell the heavens im ready to escape you
this is not what i wanted not what i need
take it all tear it all rip it all away

verse 2
i cant say the devil made me do it
i chose to be the one i am the way i am today
i wish there was but theres no way around it
in the end i made the choice and will not die ashamed

prechorus 2
its the voices screaming in my head
the tragic truth
its hard for me to understand myself
so it has to be hard as hell for you you you
