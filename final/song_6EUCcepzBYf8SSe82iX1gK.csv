pop a top again
ive just got time for one more round
set em up my friend
then ill be gone
and you can let
some other fool sit down

verse 1
id like for you to listen to
a joke i heard today
from a woman who
said she was through and calmly walked away
i tried to smile and did a while
but it felt so outta place
did you ever hear of a clown with teardrops
streamin down his face

chorus
pop a top again
i think ill have another round
set em up my friend
then ill be gone
and you can let
some other fool sit down
see alan jackson liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likeverse 2
home for me is misery
and here im wastin time
cause a row of fools on a row of stools
is not whats on my mind
but then you see her leaving me
its not what i prefer
so its either here just drinkin beer
or home remembering her

chorus
pop a top again
i think ill have another round
set em up my friend
then ill be gone
and you can let
some other fool sit down

outro
