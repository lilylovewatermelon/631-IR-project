ayy lace em up lace em up lace em up lace em
blue suede shoes stay crispy like bacon
nikes on my feet make my cypher complete uh
i stay shining like the lights on the street in the night
revis take me shoppin when im up in new york

im in la eatin twentytwo course
young boss bitch paper in my pockets
i got a closet filled with shoeboxes
mom said my spending habit little bit obnoxious
but a pilot stay fresh up in his cockpit
used to rock handmedowns

hit the club bitches pull they cameras out
livin in a dream they beginnin to believe

verse 2 mac miller
i make em so mad they got no swag
pippens on my feet they the throwbacks look
my money good but these hoes bad
so they stay attached to my gonads uh

open up my closet to that new shoe smell
i guess im doin well
smokin all the weed that i used to sell
but once my album goes in the shelves
its going nextel how its finna sell
for now were sellin tapes out my shoebox
any spot just set up my shop
youre mad that your girl always says that im hot
she buyin my tshirts but she spendin your guap uh
say what up if you see me around
nike airs separate my feet from the ground its just
