we listen to the tales and romanticize
how wed follow the path of the hero
boast about the day when the rivers overrun
how we rise to the height of our halo
listen to the tales as we all rationalize
our way into the arms of the savior
feigning all the trials and the tribulations
none of us have actually been there
not like you

verse 2
ignorant siblings at the congregation
gather around spewing sympathy
spare me
none of them can even hold a candle up to you
blinded by choice these hypocrites wont see
but enough about the collective judas
who could deny you were the one who
illuminated your little piece of the divine
and this little light of mine a gift you passed on to me
im gonna let it shine to guide you safely on your way
your way home

verse 3
oh what are they gonna do when the lights go down
without you to guide them all to zion
what are they gonna do when the rivers overrun
other than tremble incessantly
high is the way but all eyes are upon the ground
you were the light and the way theyll only read about
i only pray heaven knows when to lift you out
ten thousand days in the fire is long enough
youre going home
see tool liveget tickets as low as 64you might also likechorus
youre the only one who can hold your head up high
shake your fists at the gates saying
i have come home now
fetch me the spirit the son and the father
tell them their pillar of faith has ascended
its time now my time now
give me my give me my wings

postchorus
give me my
give me my
give me my
give me my
give me my
give me my wings
you are the light and way that they will only read about

bridge
set as i am in my ways and my arrogance
burden of proof tossed upon nonbelievers
you were my witness my eyes my evidence
judith marie unconditional one

outro
daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence
difficult to see you in this light
please forgive this bold suggestion
should you see your makers face tonight
look him in the eye look him in the eye and tell him
i never lived a lie never took a life but surely saved one
hallelujah its time for you to bring me home37embed"
