alone on a train aimless in wander
an outdated map crumpled in my pocket
but i didnt care where i was going
theyre all different names for the same place

verse 2
the coast disappeared when the sea drowned the sun
i knew no words to share it with anyone
the boundaries of language i quietly cursed
and all the different names for the same thing

instrumental break

chorus
there are different names for the same thing
there are different names for the same thing
there are different names there are there are different names
there are there are different names there are there are different names
there are there are different names there are there are different names
there are there are different names different names there are there are different names
there are
