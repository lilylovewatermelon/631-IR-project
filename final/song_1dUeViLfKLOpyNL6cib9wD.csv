chchchchildren put on your angry faces
mothers hide your daughters
ive been busy burning bridges
hovering over troubled waters
city folk will never understand
the country mouses jokes
theyd rather sit and watch the lemmings
lead each other to the slaughter
this is me thanking you dearly
sincerely from the bottom of whats left of my misery magnet
guess i been too busy being stagnant
and if i ever steer you wrong
grab the wheel and jerk it left
im only human but admitted
im such a beautiful mess

hook
with the mad hatter cackle
and the cheshire cat smile haha
put the jabberwocks cadaver
with derelict juvenile oh
the futures got travie engraved
on a name plate that i copped on fulton
while the passers poppin pills
somewhere on the other side of brooklyn
see gym class heroes liveget tickets as low as 97you might also likeso this is me in front of the class naked
this reoccurring nightmare never ending

and now im screaming hello now im screaming hello

this reoccurring nightmare never ending
so im saying hello so im saying hello
and now im screaming hello

verse 2
baby lets ride the steel horse
until it stops galloping
and let the nerds get revenge
on these stars with lamars javelin
here betty put this vader mask on
and take me to the dark side bumpin your favorite song
and i promise ill stand still
until the feeling is gone
and if i slip and bust its
cause we must be doing it wrong
oh by the way
if you happen to meet the asshole
that wrote the manual
tellem large marge sent me to murkem and make it casual
hook
with the mad hatter cackle
and the cheshire cat smile haha

bridge
so im leaving the grocery store the other day
probably one of the hardest things i have to do
in a regular basis you know
with my anxiety and all
and a women walks up to me hey arent you travie
she doesnt say hello
she just grabs me
and i can feel my heart beating harder and harder and harder
im from upstate too uh cool
i can feel the skin on my chest getting tighter and tighter
until i just until i just
fucking spontaniously combust
hook
with the mad hatter cackle
and the cheshire cat smile haha
put the jabberwocks cadaver
with derelict juvenile oh
the futures got travie engraved
on a name plate that i copped on fulton
while the passers poppin pills
somewhere on the other side of brooklyn

so this is me in front of the class naked
this reoccurring nightmare never ending
so im saying hello so im saying hello
and now im screaming hello now im screaming hello
is anybody out there
now this is me in front of the class naked
this reoccurring nightmare never ending
so im saying hello so im saying hello
and now im screaming hello
can anybody hear me

can anybody hear me

outro
hi did you like the music
i liked it
it was awesome
hey my favorite song was the one where the base went
bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
and the guitar went wee wee wee wee
and the drums went drummy drum drum drum drum drum drum drum drum
do you remember that song
i liked that
i want more music
hey have you ever wondered if a seahorse could win
a game of backgammon against an invisible wizard
i think the invisible wizard would win
because the seahorse does not have hands
hey have you ever seen an invisible wizard
probably not
because its invisible
hey remember that time when we were on that spaceship
and there were talking dinosaurs
and then one of the dinosaurs said
i cannot talk
and i said you just did
and the dinosaur didnt say anything else because
he couldnt talk
hey are you listening to me
remember that stick of broccoli that used
to play the banjo at the annual platypus convention
he owes me money
hey im cool
hey good nightembed"
