im sixteen living in paradise
with the lions and birds and stuff
but im sixteen and it’s not enough

im alone i mean theres mom and dad
and the animals we observe
but frankly theyre all on my last nerve

nobody on the savanna understands
none of my closest friends even has hands
i got dreams exciting me
like a fire igniting me
i tried to confide in my lions
but they keep biting me
did you ever get a feeling
everybody else is happy
everybody else has friends
and theyre better friends than yours

its a very recent feeling
but its running through my body
and it roars
it roars

mrs heron spoken

cady
mom i would love that lets all try something new
we live in a tent
adventure is what we do

mrs heron spoken
true 

cady
i got no time to cry
i got new things to try
like high school and skateboards and rapping
and starbucks venti chai

did you ever get a feeling
that a whole new world is waiting
to bring happiness and friends
to the brave girl who explores
it’s a scary kind of feeling but its so exhilarating
how it roars
it roars
it roars
okay maybe they didnt see me
they stare at their little screens
plus its crowded
with all these teens
hi teens
