this day could be the worst one yet
i just wont relax i cant catch my breath
because im sick and tired of youll be fine
well how do you know can you read minds

prechorus 1
so take it while you can so you can meet demands
my insanity is what you thrive on
so rip it from my soul so everyone will know in the end
we were never friends

chorus
have you ever felt lost inside
so unloved within that you almost died
have you ever stepped out of the light
and realized theres a stranger inside

verse 2
dont push your ignorance on me
im not unrehearsed to your jealousy
and i know you think i dont see the signs
well how do you know do i look blind

prechorus 2
so take it while you can so you can meet demands
my breakdown is what you thrive on
so rip it from my soul so everyone will know in the end
im the break youre the bend
