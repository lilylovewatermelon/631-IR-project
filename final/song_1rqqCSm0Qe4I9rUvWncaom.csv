high high hopes
chorus
had to have high high hopes for a living
shooting for the stars when i couldnt make a killing
didnt have a dime but i always had a vision
always had high high hopes high high hopes
had to have high high hopes for a living
didnt know how but i always had a feeling
i was gonna be that one in a million
always had high high hopes

verse 1
mama said fulfill the prophecy
be something greater go make a legacy
manifest destiny back in the days
we wanted everything wanted everything
mama said burn your biographies
rewrite your history light up your wildest dreams
museum victories every day
we wanted everything wanted everything

all tied up no more love and id hate to see you waiting
