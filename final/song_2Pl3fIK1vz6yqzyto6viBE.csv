breaking the silence is the hardest thing in life
knowing that youre wrong feeling like you cant go on
ive been a victim so many times
but im man enough to know when im wrong

with the fresh cut mullets back row in sight
pass the packed bullet im gonna rock all night
uptight right wingers tryin to say im what
but im a flight bound singer not giving a fuck
hard luck of the devil with the grace of god
on a level of oz and it makes you nod
with the body of a sinner mind of a saint
im everything you love everything you hate
hit a lot of curves hard roads and hills
got nerves of steel and watched time stand still
it took too long but i stood my height
you can say im wrong but you aint right

chorus
you arent right you you you aint right
you arent right right
you arent you arent you arent right
you arent you arent you arent right
you arent you arent you arent right
see kid rock liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeverse 2
you can save the environment with all your wit
but can you save your children from a world of bullshit
you look at me with a loss for love
but if you took me out would your kid still do drugs
you want to point your finger in the unclear
you want to point your finger in the unclear
you want to point your finger in the unclear
you ought to point your finger in the mirror
you want to trip quit because im a keep ripping
you can bitch but the strippers going to keep stripping
im singing songs in the key of life
and you can say im wrong but you arent right

chorus
you arent right you you you arent right
you arent right

we just came to get on down and rock
rock on
cowboy baby cowboy baby
