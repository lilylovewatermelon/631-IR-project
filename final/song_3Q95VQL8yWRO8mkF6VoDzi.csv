tryna set myself up for the win
some people got a dream thats so much bigger than the town theyre in
so give me love give me love give me peace give me peace of mind
i know that theres an ought to a start and i need a little help with mine

prechorus sandro cavazza
california dont let me down
seems so golden but theres struggle all around
sunset jesus came to me
he once was a waiter now hes a savior making money on the street

chorus sandro cavazza
my dreams are made of gold
my hearts been broken and im down along the road
but i know my dreams keep fading till i get old
breathe for a minute breathe for a minute ill be okay

verse 2 sandro cavazza
staring at the billboard from the bus
looking at the faces thinking that could be anyone of us
so give me hope give me hope give me hope on this lonely ride
cause i know one day i will be the one in the sky

prechorus sandro cavazza
california dont let me down
seems so golden but theres struggle all around
sunset jesus came to me
he once was a waiter now hes a savior making money on the street
