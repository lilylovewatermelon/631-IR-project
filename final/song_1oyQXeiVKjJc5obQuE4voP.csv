oh well you left me here so i could sit and cry
well golly gee what have you done to me
i guess it doesnt matter anymore

do you remember baby last september
how you held me tight each and every night
well hopes and dazy how you drove me crazy
i guess it doesnt matter anymore

theres no use in me cryin
ive done everything and now im sick and tryin
ive thrown away my days
wasted all my night over you

well youll go your way and ill go mine
now and forever till the end of time
ill find somebody new baby well say were through
and you wont matter anymore

youll go your way and ill go mine
now and forever till the end of time
ill find somebody new baby well say were through
and you wont matter anymore
