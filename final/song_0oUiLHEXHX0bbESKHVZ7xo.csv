now im dying to forget you
and that is what i know
though i dreamed i would fall
like a wounded cannonball
sinking down with my heart in tow

bright lights like white lightning
who shot me down
who cut me down
im frozen in my bed
till the day comes around
how im lost how im found

theres a man all alone
telling me his friends are gone
that theyve died and flown away
so i told him he was wrong
that your friends are never gone
if you look to the sky and pray

bright lights like white lightning
who shot me down
who will cut me down
im frozen in my bed
till the day comes around
how im lost how im found
see brandi carlile liveget tickets as low as 189you might also likesomeone told me a lie
someone looked me in the eye
and said time will ease your pain
but behold when you fall
its that same old cannonball
coming back for your heart again

bright lights like white lightning
who shot me down
who will cut me down
im frozen in my bed
till the day comes around
and it may come around
until the day comes around
how im lost how im found

i was born when i met you
now im dying to forget you
and that is what i know1embed"
