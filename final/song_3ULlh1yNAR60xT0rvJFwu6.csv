after a moments silence raphael said with a careless gesture

perhaps it is an effect of the fumes of punch—i really cannot tell—this clearness of mind that enables me to comprise my whole life in a single picture where figures and hues lights shades and halftones are faithfully rendered i should not have been so surprised at this poetical play of imagination if it were not accompanied with a sort of scorn for my past joys and sorrows seen from afar my life appears to contract by some mental process that long slow agony of ten years duration can be brought to memory today in some few phrases in which pain is resolved into a mere idea and pleasure becomes a philosophical reflection instead of feeling things i weigh and consider them——

you are as tiresome as the explanation of an amendment cried emile

very likely said raphael submissively i spare you the first seventeen years of my life for fear of abusing a listeners patience till that time like you and thousands of others i had lived my life at school or the lycee with its imaginary troubles and genuine happinesses which are so pleasant to look back upon our jaded palates still crave for that lenten fare so long as we have not tried it afresh it was a pleasant life with the tasks that we thought so contemptible but which taught us application for all that

let the drama begin said emile halfplaintively halfcomically

when i left school raphael went on with a gesture that claimed the right of speaking my father submitted me to a strict discipline he installed me in a room near his own study and i had to rise at five in the morning and be in bed by nine at night he meant me to take my law studies seriously i attended the schools and read with an advocate as well but my lectures and work were so narrowly circumscribed by the laws of time and space and my father required such a strict account of my doings at dinner that

what is this to me asked emile

the devil take you said raphael how are you to enter into my feelings if i do not relate the facts that insensibly shaped my character made me timid and prolonged the period of youthful simplicity in this manner i cowered under as strict a despotism as a monarchs till i came of age to depict the tedium of my life it will be perhaps enough to portray my father to you he was tall thin and slight with a hatchet face and pale complexion a man of few words fidgety as an old maid exacting as a senior clerk his paternal solicitude hovered over my merriment and gleeful thoughts and seemed to cover them with a leaden pall any effusive demonstration on my part was received by him as a childish absurdity i was far more afraid of him than i had been of any of our masters at school

i seem to see him before me at this moment in his chestnutbrown frockcoat he looked like a red herring wrapped up in the cover of a pamphlet and he held himself as erect as an easter candle but i was fond of my father and at heart he was right enough perhaps we never hate severity when it has its source in greatness of character and pure morals and is skilfully tempered with kindness my father it is true never left me a moment to myself and only when i was twenty years old gave me so much as ten francs of my own ten knavish prodigals of francs such a hoard as i had long vainly desired which set me adreaming of unutterable felicity yet for all that he sought to procure relaxations for me when he had promised me a treat beforehand he would take me to les boufoons or to a concert or ball where i hoped to find a mistress a mistress that meant independence but bashful and timid as i was knowing nobody and ignorant of the dialect of drawingrooms i always came back as awkward as ever and swelling with unsatisfied desires to be put in harness like a troop horse next day by my father and to return with morning to my advocate the palais de justice and the law to have swerved from the straight course which my father had mapped out for me would have drawn down his wrath upon me at my first delinquency he threatened to ship me off as a cabinboy to the antilles a dreadful shiver ran through me if i had ventured to spend a couple of hours in some pleasure party

imagine the most wandering imagination and passionate temperament the tenderest soul and most artistic nature dwelling continually in the presence of the most flinthearted atrabilious and frigid man on earth think of me as a young girl married to a skeleton and you will understand the life whose curious scenes can only be a hearsay tale to you the plans for running away that perished at the sight of my father the despair soothed by slumber the dark broodings charmed away by music i breathed my sorrows forth in melodies beethoven or mozart would keep my confidences sacred nowadays i smile at recollections of the scruples which burdened my conscience at that epoch of innocence and virtue

if i set foot in a restaurant i gave myself up for lost my fancy led me to look on a cafe as a disreputable haunt where men lost their characters and embarrassed their fortunes as for engaging in play i had not the money to risk oh if i needed to send you to sleep i would tell you about one of the most frightful pleasures of my life one of those pleasures with fangs that bury themselves in the heart as the brandingiron enters the convicts shoulder i was at a ball at the house of the duc de navarreins my fathers cousin but to make my position the more perfectly clear you must know that i wore a threadbare coat illfitting shoes a tie fit for a stableman and a soiled pair of gloves i shrank into a corner to eat ices and watch the pretty faces at my leisure my father noticed me actuated by some motive that i did not fathom so dumfounded was i by this act of confidence he handed me his keys and purse to keep ten paces away some men were gambling i heard the rattling of gold i was twenty years old i longed to be steeped for one whole day in the follies of my time of life it was a license of the imagination that would find a parallel neither in the freaks of courtesans nor in the dreams of young girls for a year past i had beheld myself well dressed in a carriage with a pretty woman by my side playing the great lord dining at verys deciding not to go back home till the morrow but was prepared for my father with a plot more intricate than the marriage of figaro which he could not possibly have unraveled all this bliss would cost i estimated fifty crowns was it not the artless idea of playing truant that still had charms for me

i went into a small adjoining room and when alone counted my fathers money with smarting eyes and trembling fingers—a hundred crowns the joys of my escapade rose before me at the thought of the amount joys that flitted about me like macbeths witches round their caldron joys how alluring how thrilling how delicious i became a deliberate rascal i heeded neither my tingling ears nor the violent beating of my heart but took out two twentyfranc pieces that i seem to see yet the dates had been erased and bonapartes head simpered upon them after i had put back the purse in my pocket i returned to the gamingtable with the two pieces of gold in the palms of my damp hands prowling about the players like a sparrowhawk round a coop of chickens tormented by inexpressible terror i flung a sudden clairvoyant glance round me and feeling quite sure that i was seen by none of my acquaintance betted on a stout jovial little man heaping upon his head more prayers and vows than are put up during two or three storms at sea then with an intuitive scoundrelism or machiavelism surprising in one of my age i went and stood in the door and looked about me in the rooms though i saw nothing for both mind and eyes hovered about that fateful green cloth
that evening fixes the date of a first observation of a physiological kind to it i owe a kind of insight into certain mysteries of our double nature that i have since been enabled to penetrate i had my back turned on the table where my future felicity lay at stake a felicity but so much the more intense that it was criminal between me and the players stood a wall of onlookers some five feet deep who were chatting the murmur of voices drowned the clinking of gold which mingled in the sounds sent up by this orchestra yet despite all obstacles i distinctly heard the words of the two players by a gift accorded to the passions which enables them to annihilate time and space i saw the points they made i knew which of the two turned up the king as well as if i had actually seen the cards at a distance of ten paces in short the fortunes of play blanched my face

my father suddenly went by and then i knew what the scripture meant by the spirit of god passed before his face i had won i slipped through the crowd of men who had gathered about the players with the quickness of an eel escaping through a broken mesh in a net my nerves thrilled with joy instead of anguish i felt like some criminal on the way to torture released by a chance meeting with the king it happened that a man with a decoration found himself short by forty francs uneasy eyes suspected me i turned pale and drops of perspiration stood on my forehead i was well punished i thought for having robbed my father then the kind little stout man said in a voice like an angels surely all these gentlemen have paid their stakes and put down the forty francs himself i raised my head in triumph upon the players after i had returned the money i had taken from it to my fathers purse i left my winnings with that honest and worthy gentleman who continued to win as soon as i found myself possessed of a hundred and sixty francs i wrapped them up in my handkerchief so that they could neither move or rattle on the way back and i played no more

what were you doing at the cardtable said my father as we stepped into the carriage

i was looking on i answered trembling

but it would have been nothing out of the common if you had been prompted by selflove to put some money down on the table in the eyes of men of the world you are quite old enough to assume the right to commit such follies so i should have pardoned you raphael if you had made use of my purse

i did not answer when we reached home i returned the keys and money to my father as he entered his study he emptied out his purse on the mantelpiece counted the money and turned to me with a kindly look saying with more or less long and significant pauses between each phrase

my boy you are very nearly twenty now i am satisfied with you you ought to have an allowance if only to teach you how to lay it out and to gain some acquaintance with everyday business henceforward i shall let you have a hundred francs each month here is your first quarters income for this year he added fingering a pile of gold as if to make sure that the amount was correct do what you please with it

i confess that i was ready to fling myself at his feet to tell him that i was a thief a scoundrel and worse than all a liar but a feeling of shame held me back i went up to him for an embrace but he gently pushed me away

you are a man now my child he said what i have just done was a very proper and simple thing for which there is no need to thank me if i have any claim to your gratitude raphael he went on in a kind but dignified way it is because i have preserved your youth from the evils that destroy young men in paris we will be two friends henceforth in a years time you will be a doctor of law not without some hardship and privations you have acquired the sound knowledge and the love of and application to work that is indispensable to public men you must learn to know me raphael i do not want to make either an advocate or a notary of you but a statesman who shall be the pride of our poor house goodnight he added

from that day my father took me fully into confidence i was an only son and ten years before i had lost my mother in time past my father the head of a historic family remembered even now in auvergne had come to paris to fight against his evil star dissatisfied at the prospect of tilling the soil with his useless sword by his side he was endowed with the shrewdness that gives the men of the south of france a certain ascendency when energy goes with it almost unaided he made a position for himself near the fountain of power the revolution brought a reverse of fortune but he had managed to marry an heiress of good family and in the time of the empire appeared to be on the point of restoring to our house its ancient splendor

the restoration while it brought back considerable property to my mother was my fathers ruin he had formerly purchased several estates abroad conferred by the emperor on his generals and now for ten years he struggled with liquidators diplomatists and prussian and bavarian courts of law over the disputed possession of these unfortunate endowments my father plunged me into the intricate labyrinths of law proceedings on which our future depended we might be compelled to return the rents as well as the proceeds arising from sales of timber made during the years 1814 to 1817 in that case my mothers property would have barely saved our credit so it fell out that the day on which my father in a fashion emancipated me brought me under a most galling yoke i entered on a conflict like a battlefield i must work day and night seek interviews with statesmen surprise their convictions try to interest them in our affairs and gain them over with their wives and servants and their very dogs and all this abominable business had to take the form of pretty speeches and polite attentions then i knew the mortifications that had left their blighting traces on my fathers face for about a year i led outwardly the life of a man of the world but enormous labors lay beneath the surface of gadding about and eager efforts to attach myself to influential kinsmen or to people likely to be useful to us my relaxations were lawsuits and memorials still furnished the staple of my conversation hitherto my life had been blameless from the sheer impossibility of indulging the desires of youth but now i became my own master and in dread of involving us both in ruin by some piece of negligence i did not dare to allow myself any pleasure or expenditure

while we are young and before the world has rubbed off the delicate bloom from our sentiments the freshness of our impressions the noble purity of conscience which will never allow us to palter with evil the sense of duty is very strong within us the voice of honor clamors within us and we are open and straightforward at that time i was all these things i wished to justify my fathers confidence in me but lately i would have stolen a paltry sum from him with secret delight but now that i shared the burden of his affairs of his name and of his house i would secretly have given up my fortune and my hopes for him as i was sacrificing my pleasures and even have been glad of the sacrifice so when m de villele exhumed for our special benefit an imperial decree concerning forfeitures and had ruined us i authorized the sale of my property only retaining an island in the middle of the loire where my mother was buried perhaps arguments and evasions philosophical philanthropic and political considerations would not fail me now to hinder the perpetration of what my solicitor termed a folly but at oneandtwenty i repeat we are all aglow with generosity and affection the tears that stood in my fathers eyes were to me the most splendid of fortunes and the thought of those tears has often soothed my sorrow ten months after he had paid his creditors my father died of grief i was his idol and he had ruined me the thought killed him towards the end of the autumn of 1826 at the age of twentytwo i was the sole mourner at his graveside—the grave of my father and my earliest friend not many young men have found themselves alone with their thoughts as they followed a hearse or have seen themselves lost in crowded paris and without money or prospects orphans rescued by public charity have at any rate the future of the battlefield before them and find a shelter in some institution and a father in the government or in the procureur du roi i had nothing

three months later an agent made over to me eleven hundred and twelve francs the net proceeds of the winding up of my fathers affairs our creditors had driven us to sell our furniture from my childhood i had been used to set a high value on the articles of luxury about us and i could not help showing my astonishment at the sight of this meagre balance
oh rococo all of it said the auctioneer a terrible word that fell like a blight on the sacred memories of my childhood and dispelled my earliest illusions the dearest of all my entire fortune was comprised in this account rendered my future lay in a linen bag with eleven hundred and twelve francs in it human society stood before me in the person of an auctioneers clerk who kept his hat on while he spoke jonathan an old servant who was much attached to me and whom my mother had formerly pensioned with an annuity of four hundred francs spoke to me as i was leaving the house that i had so often gaily left for a drive in my childhood

be very economical monsieur raphael

the good fellow was crying

such were the events dear emile that ruled my destinies moulded my character and set me while still young in an utterly false social position said raphael after a pause family ties weak ones it is true bound me to a few wealthy houses but my own pride would have kept me aloof from them if contempt and indifference had not shut their doors on me in the first place i was related to people who were very influential and who lavished their patronage on strangers but i found neither relations nor patrons in them continually circumscribed in my affections they recoiled upon me unreserved and simple by nature i must have appeared frigid and sophisticated my fathers discipline had destroyed all confidence in myself i was shy and awkward i could not believe that my opinion carried any weight whatever i took no pleasure in myself i thought myself ugly and was ashamed to meet my own eyes in spite of the inward voice that must be the stay of a man with anything in him in all his struggles the voice that cries courage go forward in spite of sudden revelations of my own strength in my solitude in spite of the hopes that thrilled me as i compared new works that the public admired so much with the schemes that hovered in my brain—in spite of all this i had a childish mistrust of myself

an overweening ambition preyed upon me i believed that i was meant for great things and yet i felt myself to be nothing i had need of other men and i was friendless i found i must make my way in the world where i was quite alone and bashful rather than afraid

all through the year in which by my fathers wish i threw myself into the whirlpool of fashionable society i came away with an inexperienced heart and fresh in mind like every grown child i sighed in secret for a love affair i met among young men of my own age a set of swaggerers who held their heads high and talked about trifles as they seated themselves without a tremor beside women who inspired awe in me they chattered nonsense sucked the heads of their canes gave themselves affected airs appropriated the fairest women and laid or pretended that they had laid their heads on every pillow pleasure seemingly was at their beck and call they looked on the most virtuous and prudish as an easy prey ready to surrender at a word at the slightest impudent gesture or insolent look i declare on my soul and conscience that the attainment of power or of a great name in literature seemed to me an easier victory than a success with some young witty and gracious lady of high degree

so i found the tumult of my heart my feelings and my creeds all at variance with the axioms of society i had plenty of audacity in my character but none in my manner later i found out that women did not like to be implored i have from afar adored many a one to whom i devoted a soul proof against all tests a heart to break energy that shrank from no sacrifice and from no torture they accepted fools whom i would not have engaged as hall porters how often mute and motionless have i not admired the lady of my dreams swaying in the dance given up my life in thought to one eternal caress expressed all my hopes in a look and laid before her in my rapture a young mans love which should outstrip all fables at some moments i was ready to barter my whole life for one single night well as i could never find a listener for my impassioned proposals eyes to rest my own upon a heart made for my heart i lived on in all the sufferings of impotent force that consumes itself lacking either opportunity or courage or experience i despaired maybe of making myself understood or i feared to be understood but too well and yet the storm within me was ready to burst at every chance courteous look in spite of my readiness to take the semblance of interest in look or word for a tenderer solicitude i dared neither to speak nor to be silent seasonably my words grew insignificant and my silence stupid by sheer stress of emotion i was too ingenuous no doubt for that artificial life led by candlelight where every thought is expressed in conventional phrases or by words that fashion dictates and not only so i had not learned how to employ speech that says nothing and silence that says a great deal in short i concealed the fires that consumed me and with such a soul as women wish to find with all the elevation of soul that they long for and a mettle that fools plume themselves upon all women have been cruelly treacherous to me

so in my simplicity i admired the heroes of this set when they bragged about their conquests and never suspected them of lying no doubt it was a mistake to wish for a love that springs for a words sake to expect to find in the heart of a vain frivolous woman greedy for luxury and intoxicated with vanity the great sea of passion that surged tempestuously in my own breast oh to feel that you were born to love to make some womans happiness and yet to find not one not even a noble and courageous marceline not so much as an old marquise oh to carry a treasure in your wallet and not find even some child or inquisitive young girl to admire it in my despair i often wished to kill myself

finely tragical tonight cried emile

let me pass sentence on my life raphael answered if your friendship is not strong enough to bear with my elegy if you cannot put up with half an hours tedium for my sake go to sleep but then never ask again for the reason of suicide that hangs over me that comes nearer and calls to me that i bow myself before if you are to judge a man you must know his secret thoughts sorrows and feelings to know merely the outward events of a mans life would only serve to make a chronological table—a fools notion of history

emile was so much struck with the bitter tones in which these words were spoken that he began to pay close attention to raphael whom he watched with a bewildered expression

now continued the speaker all these things that befell me appear in a new light the sequence of events that i once thought so unfortunate created the splendid powers of which later i became so proud if i may believe you i possess the power of readily expressing my thoughts and i could take a forward place in the great field of knowledge and is not this the result of scientific curiosity of excessive application and a love of reading which possessed me from the age of seven till my entry on life the very neglect in which i was left and the consequent habits of selfrepression and selfconcentration did not these things teach me how to consider and reflect nothing in me was squandered in obedience to the exactions of the world which humble the proudest soul and reduce it to a mere husk and was it not this very fact that refined the emotional part of my nature till it became the perfected instrument of a loftier purpose than passionate desires i remember watching the women who mistook me with all the insight of contemned love

i can see now that my natural sincerity must have been displeasing to them women perhaps even require a little hypocrisy and i who in the same hours space am alternately a man and a child frivolous and thoughtful free from bias and brimful of superstition and oftentimes myself as much a woman as any of them how should they do otherwise than take my simplicity for cynicism my innocent candor for impudence they found my knowledge tiresome my feminine languor weakness i was held to be listless and incapable of love or of steady purpose a too active imagination that curse of poets was no doubt the cause my silence was idiotic and as i daresay i alarmed them by my efforts to please women one and all have condemned me with tears and mortification i bowed before the decision of the world but my distress was not barren i determined to revenge myself on society i would dominate the feminine intellect and so have the feminine soul at my mercy all eyes should be fixed upon me when the servant at the door announced my name i had determined from my childhood that i would be a great man i said with andre chenier as i struck my forehead there is something underneath that i felt i believed the thought within me that i must express the system i must establish the knowledge i must interpret
let me pour out my follies dear emile today i am barely twentysix years old certain of dying unrecognized and i have never been the lover of the woman i dreamed of possessing have we not all of us more or less believed in the reality of a thing because we wished it i would never have a young man for my friend who did not place himself in dreams upon a pedestal weave crowns for his head and have complaisant mistresses i myself would often be a general nay emperor i have been a byron and then a nobody after this sport on these pinnacles of human achievement i became aware that all the difficulties and steeps of life were yet to face my exuberant selfesteem came to my aid i had that intense belief in my destiny which perhaps amounts to genius in those who will not permit themselves to be distracted by contact with the world as sheep that leave their wool on the briars of every thicket they pass by i meant to cover myself with glory and to work in silence for the mistress i hoped to have one day women for me were resumed into a single type and this woman i looked to meet in the first that met my eyes but in each and all i saw a queen and as queens must make the first advances to their lovers they must draw near to me—to me so sickly shy and poor for her who should take pity on me my heart held in store such gratitude over and beyond love that i had worshiped her her whole life long later my observations have taught me bitter truths

in this way dear emile i ran the risk of remaining companionless for good the incomprehensible bent of womens minds appears to lead them to see nothing but the weak points in a clever man and the strong points of a fool they feel the liveliest sympathy with the fools good qualities which perpetually flatter their own defects while they find the man of talent hardly agreeable enough to compensate for his shortcomings all capacity is a sort of intermittent fever and no woman is anxious to share in its discomforts only they look to find in their lovers the wherewithal to gratify their own vanity it is themselves that they love in us but the artist poor and proud along with his endowment of creative power is furnished with an aggressive egotism everything about him is involved in i know not what whirlpool of his ideas and even his mistress must gyrate along with them how is a woman spoilt with praise to believe in the love of a man like that will she go to seek him out that sort of lover has not the leisure to sit beside a sofa and give himself up to the sentimental simperings that women are so fond of and on which the false and unfeeling pride themselves he cannot spare the time from his work and how can he afford to humble himself and go amasquerading i was ready to give my life once and for all but i could not degrade it in detail besides there is something indescribably paltry in a stockbrokers tactics who runs on errands for some insipid affected woman all this disgusts an artist love in the abstract is not enough for a great man in poverty he has need of its utmost devotion the frivolous creatures who spend their lives in trying on cashmeres or make themselves into clothespegs to hang the fashions from exact the devotion which is not theirs to give for them love means the pleasure of ruling and not of obeying she who is really a wife one in heart flesh and bone must follow wherever he leads in whom her life her strength her pride and happiness are centered ambitious men need those oriental women whose whole thought is given to the study of their requirements for unhappiness means for them the incompatibility of their means with their desires but i who took myself for a man of genius must needs feel attracted by these very shecoxcombs so as i cherished ideas so different from those generally received as i wished to scale the heavens without a ladder was possessed of wealth that could not circulate and of knowledge so wide and so imperfectly arranged and digested that it overtaxed my memory as i had neither relations nor friends in the midst of this lonely and ghastly desert a desert of paving stones full of animation life and thought wherein every one is worse than inimical indifferent to wit i made a very natural if foolish resolve which required such unknown impossibilities that my spirits rose it was as if i had laid a wager with myself for i was at once the player and the cards

this was my plan the eleven hundred francs must keep life in me for three years—the time i allowed myself in which to bring to light a work which should draw attention to me and make me either a name or a fortune i exulted at the thought of living on bread and milk like a hermit in the thebaid while i plunged into the world of books and ideas and so reached a lofty sphere beyond the tumult of paris a sphere of silent labor where i would entomb myself like a chrysalis to await a brilliant and splendid new birth i imperiled my life in order to live by reducing my requirements to real needs and the barest necessaries i found that three hundred and sixtyfive francs sufficed for a year of penury and in fact i managed to exist on that slender sum so long as i submitted to my own claustral discipline

impossible cried emile

i lived for nearly three years in that way raphael answered with a kind of pride let us reckon it out three sous for bread two for milk and three for cold meat kept me from dying of hunger and my mind in a state of peculiar lucidity i have observed as you know the wonderful effects produced by diet upon the imagination my lodgings cost me three sous daily i burnt three sous more in oil at night i did my own housework and wore flannel shirts so as to reduce the laundress bill to two sous per day the money i spent yearly in coal if divided up never cost more than two sous for each day i had three years supply of clothing and i only dressed when going out to some library or public lecture these expenses all told only amounted to eighteen sous so two were left over for emergencies i cannot recollect during that long period of toil either crossing the pont des arts or paying for water i went out to fetch it every morning from the fountain in the place saint michel at the corner of the rue de gres oh i wore my poverty proudly a man urged on towards a fair future walks through life like an innocent person to his death he feels no shame about it

i would not think of illness like aquilina i faced the hospital without terror i had not a moments doubt of my health and besides the poor can only take to their beds to die i cut my own hair till the day when an angel of love and kindness but i do not want to anticipate the state of things that i shall reach later you must simply know that i lived with one grand thought for a mistress a dream an illusion which deceives us all more or less at first today i laugh at myself at that self holy perhaps and heroic which is now no more i have since had a closer view of society and the world of our manners and customs and seen the dangers of my innocent credulity and the superfluous nature of my fervent toil stores of that sort are quite useless to aspirants for fame light should be the baggage of seekers after fortune

ambitious men spend their youth in rendering themselves worthy of patronage it is their great mistake while the foolish creatures are laying in stores of knowledge and energy so that they shall not sink under the weight of responsible posts that recede from them schemers come and go who are wealthy in words and destitute in ideas astonish the ignorant and creep into the confidence of those who have a little knowledge while the first kind study the second march ahead the one sort is modest and the other impudent the man of genius is silent about his own merits but these schemers make a flourish of theirs and they are bound to get on it is so strongly to the interest of men in office to believe in readymade capacity and in brazenfaced merit that it is downright childish of the learned to expect material rewards i do not seek to paraphrase the commonplace moral the song of songs that obscure genius is for ever singing i want to come in a logical manner by the reason of the frequent successes of mediocrity alas study shows us such a mothers kindness that it would be a sin perhaps to ask any other reward of her than the pure and delightful pleasures with which she sustains her children

often i remember soaking my bread in milk as i sat by the window to take the fresh air while my eyes wandered over a view of roofs—brown gray or red slated or tiled and covered with yellow or green mosses at first the prospect may have seemed monotonous but i very soon found peculiar beauties in it sometimes at night streams of light through halfclosed shutters would light up and color the dark abysses of this strange landscape sometimes the feeble lights of the street lamps sent up yellow gleams through the fog and in each street dimly outlined the undulations of a crowd of roofs like billows in a motionless sea very occasionally too a face appeared in this gloomy waste above the flowers in some skyey garden i caught a glimpse of an old womans crooked angular profile as she watered her nasturtiums or in a crazy attic window a young girl fancying herself quite alone as she dressed herself—a view of nothing more than a fair forehead and long tresses held above her by a pretty white arm

i liked to see the shortlived plantlife in the gutters—poor weeds that a storm soon washed away i studied the mosses with their colors revived by showers or transformed by the sun into a brown velvet that fitfully caught the light such things as these formed my recreations—the passing poetic moods of daylight the melancholy mists sudden gleams of sunlight the silence and the magic of night the mysteries of dawn the smoke wreaths from each chimney every chance event in fact in my curious world became familiar to me i came to love this prison of my own choosing this level parisian prairie of roofs beneath which lay populous abysses suited my humor and harmonized with my thoughts

sudden descents into the world from the divine height of scientific meditation are very exhausting and besides i had apprehended perfectly the bare life of the cloister when i made up my mind to carry out this new plan of life i looked for quarters in the most outoftheway parts of paris one evening as i returned home to the rue des cordiers from the place de lestrapade i saw a girl of fourteen playing with a battledore at the corner of the rue de cluny her winsome ways and laughter amused the neighbors september was not yet over it was warm and fine so that women sat chatting before their doors as if it were a feteday in some country town at first i watched the charming expression of the girls face and her graceful attitudes her pose fit for a painter it was a pretty sight i looked about me seeking to understand this blithe simplicity in the midst of paris and saw that the street was a blind alley and but little frequented i remembered that jean jacques had once lived here and looked up the hotel saintquentin its dilapidated condition awakened hopes of a cheap lodging and i determined to enter

i found myself in a room with a low ceiling the candles in classiclooking copper candlesticks were set in a row under each key the predominating cleanliness of the room made a striking contrast to the usual state of such places this one was as neat as a bit of genre there was a charming trimness about the blue coverlet the cooking pots and furniture the mistress of the house rose and came to me she seemed to be about forty years of age sorrows had left their traces on her features and weeping had dimmed her eyes i deferentially mentioned the amount i could pay it seemed to cause her no surprise she sought out a key from the row went up to the attics with me and showed me a room that looked out on the neighboring roofs and courts long poles with linen drying on them hung out of the window

nothing could be uglier than this garret awaiting its scholar with its dingy yellow walls and odor of poverty the roofing fell in a steep slope and the sky was visible through chinks in the tiles there was room for a bed a table and a few chairs and beneath the highest point of the roof my piano could stand not being rich enough to furnish this cage that might have been one of the piombi of venice the poor woman had never been able to let it and as i had saved from the recent sale the furniture that was in a fashion peculiarly mine i very soon came to terms with my landlady and moved in on the following day

for three years i lived in this airy sepulchre and worked unflaggingly day and night and so great was the pleasure that study seemed to me the fairest theme and the happiest solution of life the tranquillity and peace that a scholar needs is something as sweet and exhilarating as love unspeakable joys are showered on us by the exertion of our mental faculties the quest of ideas and the tranquil contemplation of knowledge delights indescribable because purely intellectual and impalpable to our senses so we are obliged to use material terms to express the mysteries of the soul the pleasure of striking out in some lonely lake of clear water with forests rocks and flowers around and the soft stirring of the warm breeze—all this would give to those who knew them not a very faint idea of the exultation with which my soul bathed itself in the beams of an unknown light hearkened to the awful and uncertain voice of inspiration as vision upon vision poured from some unknown source through my throbbing brain

no earthly pleasure can compare with the divine delight of watching the dawn of an idea in the space of abstractions as it rises like the morning sun an idea that better still attains gradually like a child to puberty and mans estate study lends a kind of enchantment to all our surroundings the wretched desk covered with brown leather at which i wrote my piano bed and armchair the odd wallpaper and furniture seemed to have for me a kind of life in them and to be humble friends of mine and mute partakers of my destiny how often have i confided my soul to them in a glance a warped bit of beading often met my eyes and suggested new developments—a striking proof of my system or a felicitous word by which to render my all but inexpressible thought by sheer contemplation of the things about me i discerned an expression and a character in each if the setting sun happened to steal in through my narrow window they would take new colors fade or shine grow dull or gay and always amaze me with some new effect these trifling incidents of a solitary life which escape those preoccupied with outward affairs make the solace of prisoners and what was i but the captive of an idea imprisoned in my system but sustained also by the prospect of a brilliant future at each obstacle that i overcame i seemed to kiss the soft hands of a woman with a fair face a wealthy welldressed woman who should some day say softly while she caressed my hair

poor angel how thou hast suffered

i had undertaken two great works—one a comedy that in a very short time must bring me wealth and fame and an entry into those circles whither i wished to return to exercise the royal privileges of a man of genius you all saw nothing in that masterpiece but the blunder of a young man fresh from college a babyish fiasco your jokes clipped the wings of a throng of illusions which have never stirred since within me you dear emile alone brought soothing to the deep wounds that others had made in my heart you alone will admire my theory of the will i devoted most of my time to that long work for which i studied oriental languages physiology and anatomy if i do not deceive myself my labors will complete the task begun by mesmer lavater gall and bichat and open up new paths in science

there ends that fair life of mine the daily sacrifice the unrecognized silkworms toil that is perhaps its own sole recompense since attaining years of discretion until the day when i finished my theory i observed learned wrote and read unintermittingly my life was one long imposition as schoolboys say though by nature effeminately attached to oriental indolence sensual in tastes and a wooer of dreams i worked incessantly and refused to taste any of the enjoyments of parisian life though a glutton i became abstemious and loving exercise and sea voyages as i did and haunted by the wish to visit many countries still child enough to play at ducks and drakes with pebbles over a pond i led a sedentary life with a pen in my fingers i liked talking but i went to sit and mutely listen to professors who gave public lectures at the bibliotheque or the museum i slept upon my solitary pallet like a benedictine brother though woman was my one chimera a chimera that fled from me as i wooed it in short my life has been a cruel contradiction a perpetual cheat after that judge a man

sometimes my natural propensities broke out like a fire long smothered i was debarred from the women whose society i desired stripped of everything and lodged in an artists garret and by a sort of mirage or calenture i was surrounded by captivating mistresses i drove through the streets of paris lolling on the soft cushions of a fine equipage i plunged into dissipation into corroding vice i desired and possessed everything for fasting had made me lightheaded like the tempted saint anthony slumber happily would put an end at last to these devastating trances and on the morrow science would beckon me smiling and i was faithful to her i imagine that women reputed virtuous must often fall a prey to these insane tempests of desire and passion which rise in us in spite of ourselves such dreams have a charm of their own they are something akin to evening gossip round the winter fire when one sets out for some voyage in china but what becomes of virtue during these delicious excursions when fancy overleaps all difficulties

during the first ten months of seclusion i led the life of poverty and solitude that i have described to you i used to steal out unobserved every morning to buy my own provisions for the day i tidied my room i was at once master and servant and played the diogenes with incredible spirit but afterwards while my hostess and her daughter watched my ways and behavior scrutinized my appearance and divined my poverty there could not but be some bonds between us perhaps because they were themselves so very poor pauline the charming child whose latent and unconscious grace had in a manner brought me there did me many services that i could not well refuse all women fallen on evil days are sisters they speak a common language they have the same generosity—the generosity that possesses nothing and so is lavish of its affection of its time and of its very self

imperceptibly pauline took me under her protection and would do things for me no kind of objection was made by her mother whom i even surprised mending my linen she blushed for the charitable occupation in spite of myself they took charge of me and i accepted their services

in order to understand the peculiar condition of my mind my preoccupation with work must be remembered the tyranny of ideas and the instinctive repugnance that a man who leads an intellectual life must ever feel for the material details of existence could i well repulse the delicate attentions of pauline who would noiselessly bring me my frugal repast when she noticed that i had taken nothing for seven or eight hours she had the tact of a woman and the inventiveness of a child she would smile as she made sign to me that i must not see her ariel glided under my roof in the form of a sylph who foresaw every want of mine

one evening pauline told me her story with touching simplicity her father had been a major in the horse grenadiers of the imperial guard he had been taken prisoner by the cossacks at the passage of beresina and when napoleon later on proposed an exchange the russian authorities made search for him in siberia in vain he had escaped with a view of reaching india and since then mme gaudin my landlady could hear no news of her husband then came the disasters of 1814 and 1815 and left alone and without resource she had decided to let furnished lodgings in order to keep herself and her daughter

she always hoped to see her husband again her greatest trouble was about her daughters education the princess borghese was her paulines godmother and pauline must not be unworthy of the fair future promised by her imperial protectress when mme gaudin confided to me this heavy trouble that preyed upon her she said with sharp pain in her voice i would give up the property and the scrap of paper that makes gaudin a baron of the empire and all our rights to the endowment of wistchnau if only pauline could be brought up at saintdenis her words struck me now i could show my gratitude for the kindnesses expended on me by the two women all at once the idea of offering to finish paulines education occurred to me and the offer was made and accepted in the most perfect simplicity in this way i came to have some hours of recreation pauline had natural aptitude she learned so quickly that she soon surpassed me at the piano as she became accustomed to think aloud in my presence she unfolded all the sweet refinements of a heart that was opening itself out to life as some flowercup opens slowly to the sun she listened to me pleased and thoughtful letting her dark velvet eyes rest upon me with a half smile in them she repeated her lessons in soft and gentle tones and showed childish glee when i was satisfied with her her mother grew more and more anxious every day to shield the young girl from every danger for all the beauty promised in early life was developing in the crescent moon and was glad to see her spend whole days indoors in study my piano was the only one she could use and while i was out she practised on it when i came home pauline would be in my room in her shabby dress but her slightest movement revealed her slender figure in its attractive grace in spite of the coarse materials that she wore as with the heroine of the fable of peaudane a dainty foot peeped out of the clumsy shoes but all her wealth of girlish beauty was as lost upon me i had laid commands upon myself to see a sister only in pauline i dreaded lest i should betray her mothers faith in me i admired the lovely girl as if she had been a picture or as the portrait of a dead mistress she was at once my child and my statue for me another pygmalion the maiden with the hues of life and the living voice was to become a form of inanimate marble i was very strict with her but the more i made her feel my pedagogues severity the more gentle and submissive she grew

if a generous feeling strengthened me in my reserve and selfrestraint prudent considerations were not lacking beside integrity of purpose cannot i think fail to accompany integrity in money matters to my mind to become insolvent or to betray a woman is the same sort of thing if you love a young girl or allow yourself to be beloved by her a contract is implied and its conditions should be thoroughly understood we are free to break with the woman who sells herself but not with the young girl who has given herself to us and does not know the extent of her sacrifice i must have married pauline and that would have been madness would it not have given over that sweet girlish heart to terrible misfortunes my poverty made its selfish voice heard and set an iron barrier between that gentle nature and mine besides i am ashamed to say that i cannot imagine love in the midst of poverty perhaps this is a vitiation due to that malady of mankind called civilization but a woman in squalid poverty would exert no fascination over me were she attractive as homers galatea the fair helen

ah vive lamour but let it be in silk and cashmere surrounded with the luxury which so marvelously embellishes it for is it not perhaps itself a luxury i enjoy making havoc with an elaborate erection of scented hair i like to crush flowers to disarrange and crease a smart toilette at will a bizarre attraction lies for me in burning eyes that blaze through a lace veil like flame through cannon smoke my way of love would be to mount by a silken ladder in the silence of a winter night and what bliss to reach all powdered with snow a perfumed room with hangings of painted silk to find a woman there who likewise shakes away the snow from her for what other name can be found for the white muslin wrappings that vaguely define her like some angel form issuing from a cloud and then i wish for furtive joys for the security of audacity i want to see once more that woman of mystery but let it be in the throng dazzling unapproachable adored on all sides dressed in laces and ablaze with diamonds laying her commands upon every one so exalted above us that she inspires awe and none dares to pay his homage to her

she gives me a stolen glance amid her court a look that exposes the unreality of all this that resigns for me the world and all men in it truly i have scorned myself for a passion for a few yards of lace velvet and fine lawn and the hairdressers feats of skill a love of waxlights a carriage and a title a heraldic coronet painted on window panes or engraved by a jeweler in short a liking for all that is adventitious and least woman in woman i have scorned and reasoned with myself but all in vain

a woman of rank with her subtle smile her highborn air and selfesteem captivates me the barriers she erects between herself and the world awaken my vanity a good half of love there would be more relish for me in bliss that all others envied if my mistress does nothing that other women do and neither lives nor conducts herself like them wears a cloak that they cannot attain breathes a perfume of her own then she seems to rise far above me the further she rises from earth even in the earthlier aspects of love the fairer she becomes for me

luckily for me we have had no queen in france these twenty years for i should have fallen in love with her a woman must be wealthy to acquire the manners of a princess what place had pauline among these farfetched imaginings could she bring me the love that is death that brings every faculty into play the nights that are paid for by life we hardly die i think for an insignificant girl who gives herself to us and i could never extinguish these feelings and poets dreams within me i was born for an inaccessible love and fortune has overtopped my desire

how often have i set satin shoes on paulines tiny feet confined her form slender as a young poplar in a robe of gauze and thrown a loose scarf about her as i saw her tread the carpets in her mansion and led her out to her splendid carriage in such guise i should have adored her i endowed her with all the pride she lacked stripped her of her virtues her natural simple charm and frank smile in order to plunge her heart in our styx of depravity that makes invulnerable load her with our crimes make of her the fantastical doll of our drawingrooms the frail being who lies about in the morning and comes to life again at night with the dawn of tapers pauline was freshhearted and affectionate—i would have had her cold and formal

in the last days of my frantic folly memory brought pauline before me as it brings the scenes of our childhood and made me pause to muse over past delicious moments that softened my heart i sometimes saw her the adorable girl who sat quietly sewing at my table wrapped in her meditations the faint light from my window fell upon her and was reflected back in silvery rays from her thick black hair sometimes i heard her young laughter or the rich tones of her voice singing some canzonet that she composed without effort and often my pauline seemed to grow greater as music flowed from her and her face bore a striking resemblance to the noble one that carlo dolci chose for the type of italy my cruel memory brought her back athwart the dissipations of my existence like a remorse or a symbol of purity but let us leave the poor child to her own fate whatever her troubles may have been at any rate i protected her from a menacing tempest—i did not drag her down into my hell

until last winter i led the uneventful studious life of which i have given you some faint picture in the earliest days of december 1829 i came across rastignac who in spite of the shabby condition of my wardrobe linked his arm in mine and inquired into my affairs with a quite brotherly interest caught by his engaging manner i gave him a brief account of my life and hopes he began to laugh and treated me as a mixture of a man of genius and a fool his gascon accent and knowledge of the world the easy life his clever management procured for him all produced an irresistible effect upon me i should die an unrecognized failure in a hospital rastignac said and be buried in a paupers grave he talked of charlatanism every man of genius was a charlatan he plainly showed me in that pleasant way of his that makes him so fascinating he insisted that i must be out of my senses and would be my own death if i lived on alone in the rue des cordiers according to him i ought to go into society to accustom people to the sound of my name and to rid myself of the simple title of monsieur which sits but ill on a great man in his lifetime

those who know no better he cried call this sort of business scheming and moral people condemn it for a dissipated life we need not stop to look at what people think but see the results you work you say very good but nothing will ever come of that now i am ready for anything and fit for nothing as lazy as a lobster very likely but i succeed everywhere i go out into society i push myself forward the others make way before me i brag and am believed i incur debts which somebody else pays dissipation dear boy is a methodical policy the life of a man who deliberately runs through his fortune often becomes a business speculation his friends his pleasures patrons and acquaintances are his capital suppose a merchant runs a risk of a million for twenty years he can neither sleep eat nor amuse himself he is brooding over his million it makes him run about all over europe he worries himself goes to the devil in every way that man has invented then comes a liquidation such as i have seen myself which very often leaves him penniless and without a reputation or a friend the spendthrift on the other hand takes life as a serious game and sees his horses run he loses his capital perhaps but he stands a chance of being nominated receivergeneral of making a wealthy marriage or of an appointment of attache to a minister or ambassador and he has his friends left and his name and he never wants money he knows the standing of everybody and uses every one for his own benefit is this logical or am i a madman after all havent you there all the moral of the comedy that goes on every day in this world your work is completed he went on after a pause you are immensely clever well you have only arrived at my startingpoint now you had better look after its success yourself it is the surest way you will make allies in every clique and secure applause beforehand i mean to go halves in your glory myself i shall be the jeweler who set the diamonds in your crown come here tomorrow evening by way of a beginning i will introduce you to a house where all paris goes all our paris that is—the paris of exquisites millionaires celebrities all the folk who talk gold like chrysostom when they have taken up a book that book becomes the fashion and if it is something really good for once they will have declared it to be a work of genius without knowing it if you have any sense my dear fellow you will ensure the success of your theory by a better understanding of the theory of success tomorrow evening you shall go to see that queen of the moment—the beautiful countess foedora

i have never heard of her

you hottentot laughed rastignac you do not know foedora a great match with an income of nearly eighty thousand livres who has taken a fancy to nobody or else no one has taken a fancy to her a sort of feminine enigma a half russian parisienne or a half parisian russian all the romantic productions that never get published are brought out at her house she is the handsomest woman in paris and the most gracious you are not even a hottentot you are something between the hottentot and the beast goodbye till tomorrow

he swung round on his heel and made off without waiting for my answer it never occurred to him that a reasoning being could refuse an introduction to foedora how can the fascination of a name be explained foedora haunted me like some evil thought with which you seek to come to terms a voice said in me you are going to see foedora in vain i reasoned with that voice saying that it lied to me all my arguments were defeated by the name foedora was not the name and even the woman herself the symbol of all my desires and the object of my life

the name called up recollections of the conventional glitter of the world the upper world of paris with its brilliant fetes and the tinsel of its vanities the woman brought before me all the problems of passion on which my mind continually ran perhaps it was neither the woman nor the name but my own propensities that sprang up within me and tempted me afresh here was the countess foedora rich and loveless proof against the temptations of paris was not this woman the very incarnation of my hopes and visions i fashioned her for myself drew her in fancy and dreamed of her i could not sleep that night i became her lover i overbrimmed a few hours with a whole lifetime—a lovers lifetime the experience of its prolific delights burned me

the next day i could not bear the tortures of delay i borrowed a novel and spent the whole day over it so that i could not possibly think nor keep account of the time till night foedoras name echoed through me even as i read but only as a distant sound though it could be heard it was not troublesome fortunately i owned a fairly creditable black coat and a white waistcoat of all my fortune there now remained abut thirty francs which i had distributed about among my clothes and in my drawers so as to erect between my whims and the spending of a fivefranc piece a thorny barrier of search and an adventurous peregrination round my room while i as dressing i dived about for my money in an ocean of papers this scarcity of specie will give you some idea of the value of that squandered upon gloves and cabhire a months bread disappeared at one fell swoop alas money is always forthcoming for our caprices we only grudge the cost of things that are useful or necessary we recklessly fling gold to an operadancer and haggle with a tradesman whose hungry family must wait for the settlement of our bill how many men are there that wear a coat that cost a hundred francs and carry a diamond in the head of their cane and dine for twentyfive sous for all that it seems as though we could never pay enough for the pleasures of vanity

rastignac punctual to his appointment smiled at the transformation and joked about it on the way he gave me benevolent advice as to my conduct with the countess he described her as mean vain and suspicious but though mean she was ostentatious her vanity was transparent and her mistrust goodhumored

you know i am pledged he said and what i should lose too if i tried a change in love so my observation of foedora has been quite cool and disinterested and my remarks must have some truth in them i was looking to your future when i thought of introducing you to her so mind very carefully what i am about to say she has a terrible memory she is clever enough to drive a diplomatist wild she would know it at once if he spoke the truth between ourselves i fancy that her marriage was not recognized by the emperor for the russian ambassador began to smile when i spoke of her he does not receive her either and only bows very coolly if he meets her in the bois for all that she is in madame de serizys set and visits mesdames de nucingen and de restaud there is no cloud over her here in france the duchesse de carigliano the moststraitlaced marechale in the whole bonapartist coterie often goes to spend the summer with her at her country house plenty of young fops sons of peers of france have offered her a title in exchange for her fortune and she has politely declined them all her susceptibilities maybe are not to be touched by anything less than a count arent you a marquis go ahead if you fancy her this is what you may call receiving your instructions

his raillery made me think that rastignac wished to joke and excite my curiosity so that i was in a paroxysm of my extemporized passion by the time that we stopped before a peristyle full of flowers my heart beat and my color rose as we went up the great carpeted staircase and i noticed about me all the studied refinements of english comfort i was infatuatedly bourgeois i forgot my origin and all my personal and family pride alas i had but just left a garret after three years of poverty and i could not just then set the treasures there acquired above such trifles as these nor could i rightly estimate the worth of the vast intellectual capital which turns to riches at the moment when opportunity comes within our reach opportunity that does not overwhelm because study has prepared us for the struggles of public life

i found a woman of about twentytwo years of age she was of average height was dressed in white and held a feather firescreen in her hand a group of men stood around her she rose at the sight of rastignac and came towards us with a gracious smile and a musicallyuttered compliment prepared no doubt beforehand for me our friend had spoken of me as a rising man and his clever way of making the most of me had procured me this flattering reception i was confused by the attention that every one paid to me but rastignac had luckily mentioned my modesty i was brought in contact with scholars men of letters exministers and peers of france the conversation interrupted a while by my coming was resumed i took courage feeling that i had a reputation to maintain and without abusing my privilege i spoke when it fell to me to speak trying to state the questions at issue in words more or less profound witty or trenchant and i made a certain sensation rastignac was a prophet for the thousandth time in his life as soon as the gathering was large enough to restore freedom to individuals he took my arm and we went round the rooms

dont look as if you were too much struck by the princess he said or she will guess your object in coming to visit her

the rooms were furnished in excellent taste each apartment had a character of its own as in wealthy english houses and the silken hangings the style of the furniture and the ornaments even the most trifling were all subordinated to the original idea in a gothic boudoir the doors were concealed by tapestried curtains and the paneling by hangings the clock and the pattern of the carpet were made to harmonize with the gothic surroundings the ceiling with its carved crossbeams of brown wood was full of charm and originality the panels were beautifully wrought nothing disturbed the general harmony of the scheme of decoration not even the windows with their rich colored glass i was surprised by the extensive knowledge of decoration that some artist had brought to bear on a little modern room it was so pleasant and fresh and not heavy but subdued with its dead gold hues it had all the vague sentiment of a german ballad it was a retreat fit for some romance of 1827 perfumed by the exotic flowers set in their stands another apartment in the suite was a gilded reproduction of the louis quatorze period with modern paintings on the walls in odd but pleasant contrast

you would not be so badly lodged was rastignacs slightly sarcastic comment it is captivating isnt it he added smiling as he sat down then suddenly he rose and led me by the hand into a bedroom where the softened light fell upon the bed under its canopy of muslin and white watered silk—a couch for a young fairy betrothed to one of the genii

isnt it wantonly bad taste insolent and unbounded coquetry he said lowering his voice that allows us to see this throne of love she gives herself to no one and anybody may leave his card here if i were not committed i should like to see her at my feet all tears and submission

are you so certain of her virtue

the boldest and even the cleverest adventurers among us acknowledge themselves defeated and continue to be her lovers and devoted friends isnt that woman a puzzle

his words seemed to intoxicate me i had jealous fears already of the past i leapt for joy and hurried back to the countess whom i had seen in the gothic boudoir she stopped me by a smile made me sit beside her and talked about my work seeming to take the greatest interest in it and all the more when i set forth my theories amusingly instead of adopting the formal language of a professor for their explanation it seemed to divert her to be told that the human will was a material force like steam that in the moral world nothing could resist its power if a man taught himself to concentrate it to economize it and to project continually its fluid mass in given directions upon other souls such a man i said could modify all things relatively to man even the peremptory laws of nature the questions foedora raised showed a certain keenness of intellect i took a pleasure in deciding some of them in her favor in order to flatter her then i confuted her feminine reasoning with a word and roused her curiosity by drawing her attention to an everyday matter—to sleep a thing so apparently commonplace that in reality is an insoluble problem for science the countess sat in silence for a moment when i told her that our ideas were complete organic beings existing in an invisible world and influencing our destinies and for witnesses i cited the opinions of descartes diderot and napoleon who had directed and still directed all the currents of the age

so i had the honor of amusing this woman who asked me to come to see her when she left me giving me les grande entrees in the language of the court whether it was by dint of substituting polite formulas for genuine expressions of feeling a commendable habit of mine or because foedora hailed in me a coming celebrity an addition to her learned menagerie for some reason i thought that i had pleased her i called all my previous physiological studies and knowledge of woman to my aid and minutely scrutinized this singular person and her ways all evening i concealed myself in the embrasure of a window and sought to discover her thoughts from her bearing i studied the tactics of the mistress of the house as she came and went sat and chatted beckoned to this one or that asked questions listened to the answers as she leaned against the frame of the door i detected a languid charm in her movements a grace in the flutterings of her dress remarked the nature of the feelings she so powerfully excited and became very incredulous as to her virtue if foedora would none of love today she had had strong passions at some time past experience of pleasure showed itself in the attitudes she chose in conversation in her coquettish way of leaning against the panel behind her she seemed scarcely able to stand alone and yet ready for flight from too bold a glance there was a kind of eloquence about her lightly folded arms which even for benevolent eyes breathed sentiment her fresh red lips sharply contrasted with her brilliantly pale complexion her brown hair brought out all the golden color in her eyes in which blue streaks mingled as in florentine marble their expression seemed to increase the significance of her words a studied grace lay in the charms of her bodice perhaps a rival might have found the lines of the thick eyebrows which almost met a little hard or found a fault in the almost invisible down that covered her features i saw the signs of passion everywhere written on those italian eyelids on the splendid shoulders worthy of the venus of milo on her features in the darker shade of down above a somewhat thick underlip she was not merely a woman but a romance the whole blended harmony of lines the feminine luxuriance of her frame and its passionate promise were subdued by a constant inexplicable reserve and modesty at variance with everything else about her it needed an observation as keen as my own to detect such signs as these in her character to explain myself more clearly there were two women in foedora divided perhaps by the line between head and body the one the head alone seemed to be susceptible and the other phlegmatic she prepared her glance before she looked at you something unspeakably mysterious some inward convulsion seemed revealed by her glittering eyes

so to be brief either my imperfect moral science had left me a good deal to learn in the moral world or a lofty soul dwelt in the countess lent to her face those charms that fascinated and subdued us and gave her an ascendency only the more complete because it comprehended a sympathy of desire

i went away completely enraptured with this woman dazzled by the luxury around her gratified in every faculty of my soul—noble and base good and evil when i felt myself so excited eager and elated i thought i understood the attraction that drew thither those artists diplomatists men in office those stockjobbers encased in triple brass they came no doubt to find in her society the delirious emotion that now thrilled through every fibre in me throbbing through my brain setting the blood atingle in every vein fretting even the tiniest nerve and she had given herself to none so as to keep them all a woman is a coquette so long as she knows not love

well i said to rastignac they married her or sold her perhaps to some old man and recollections of her first marriage have caused her aversion for love

i walked home from the faubourg st honore where foedora lived almost all the breadth of paris lies between her mansion and the rue des cordiers but the distance seemed short in spite of the cold and i was to lay siege to foedoras heart in winter and a bitter winter with only thirty francs in my possession and such a distance as that lay between us only a poor man knows what such a passion costs in cabhire gloves linen tailors bills and the like if the platonic stage lasts a little too long the affair grows ruinous as a matter of fact there is many a lauzun among students of law who finds it impossible to approach a ladylove living on a first floor and i sickly thin poorly dressed wan and pale as any artist convalescent after a work how could i compete with other young men curled handsome smart outcravatting croatia wealthy men equipped with tilburys and armed with assurance

bah death or foedora i cried as i went round by a bridge my fortune lies in foedora

that gothic boudoir and louis quatorze salon came before my eyes i saw the countess again in her white dress with its large graceful sleeves and all the fascinations of her form and movements these pictures of foedora and her luxurious surroundings haunted me even in my bare cold garret when at last i reached it as disheveled as any naturalists wig the contrast suggested evil counsel in such a way crimes are conceived i cursed my honest selfrespecting poverty my garret where such teeming fancies had stirred within me i trembled with fury i reproached god the devil social conditions my own father the whole universe indeed with my fate and my misfortunes i went hungry to bed muttering ludicrous imprecations but fully determined to win foedora her heart was my last ticket in the lottery my fortune depended upon it

i spare you the history of my earlier visits to reach the drama the sooner in my efforts to appeal to her i essayed to engage her intellect and her vanity on my side in order to secure her love i gave her any quantity of reasons for increasing her selfesteem i never left her in a state of indifference women like emotions at any cost i gave them to her in plenty i would rather have had her angry with me than indifferent

at first urged by a strong will and a desire for her love i assumed a little authority but my own feelings grew stronger and mastered me i relapsed into truth i lost my head and fell desperately in love

i am not very sure what we mean by the word love in our poetry and our talk but i know that i have never found in all the ready rhetorical phrases of jeanjacques rousseau in whose room perhaps i was lodging nor among the feeble inventions of two centuries of our literature nor in any picture that italy has produced a representation of the feelings that expanded all at once in my double nature the view of the lake of bienne some music of rossinis the madonna of murillos now in the possession of general soult lescombats letters a few sayings scattered through collections of anecdotes but most of all the prayers of religious ecstatics and passages in our fabliaux—these things alone have power to carry me back to the divine heights of my first love

nothing expressed in human language no thought reproducible in color marble sound or articulate speech could ever render the force the truth the completeness the suddenness with which love awoke in me to speak of art is to speak of illusion love passes through endless transformations before it passes for ever into our existence and makes it glow with its own color of flame the process is imperceptible and baffles the artists analysis its moans and complaints are tedious to an uninterested spectator one would need to be very much in love to share the furious transports of lovelace as one reads clarissa harlowe love is like some fresh spring that leaves its cresses its gravel bed and flowers to become first a stream and then a river changing its aspect and its nature as it flows to plunge itself in some boundless ocean where restricted natures only find monotony but where great souls are engulfed in endless contemplation

how can i dare to describe the hues of fleeting emotions the nothings beyond all price the spoken accents that beggar language the looks that hold more than all the wealth of poetry not one of the mysterious scenes that draw us insensibly nearer and nearer to a woman but has depths in it which can swallow up all the poetry that ever was written how can the inner life and mystery that stirs in our souls penetrate through our glozes when we have not even words to describe the visible and outward mysteries of beauty what enchantment steeped me for how many hours in unspeakable rapture filled with the sight of her what made me happy i know not that face of hers overflowed with light at such times it seemed in some way to glow with it the outlines of her face with the scarcely perceptible down on its delicate surface shone with a beauty belonging to the far distant horizon that melts into the sunlight the light of day seemed to caress her as she mingled in it rather it seemed that the light of her eyes was brighter than the daylight itself or some shadow passing over that fair face made a kind of change there altering its hues and its expression some thought would often seem to glow on her white brows her eyes appeared to dilate and her eyelids trembled a smile rippled over her features the living coral of her lips grew full of meaning as they closed and unclosed an indistinguishable something in her hair made brown shadows on her fair temples in each new phase foedora spoke every slight variation in her beauty made a new pleasure for my eyes disclosed charms my heart had never known before i tried to read a separate emotion or a hope in every change that passed over her face this mute converse passed between soul and soul like sound and answering echo and the shortlived delights then showered upon me have left indelible impressions behind her voice would cause a frenzy in me that i could hardly understand i could have copied the example of some prince of lorraine and held a live coal in the hollow of my hand if her fingers passed caressingly through my hair the while i felt no longer mere admiration and desire i was under the spell i had met my destiny when back again under my own roof i still vaguely saw foedora in her own home and had some indefinable share in her life if she felt ill i suffered too the next day i used to say to her

you were not well yesterday

how often has she not stood before me called by the power of ecstasy in the silence of the night sometimes she would break in upon me like a ray of light make me drop my pen and put science and study to flight in grief and alarm as she compelled my admiration by the alluring pose i had seen but a short time before sometimes i went to seek her in the spirit world and would bow down to her as to a hope entreating her to let me hear the silver sounds of her voice and i would wake at length in tears

once when she had promised to go to the theatre with me she took it suddenly into her head to refuse to go out and begged me to leave her alone i was in such despair over the perversity which cost me a days work and if i must confess it my last shilling as well that i went alone where she was to have been desiring to see the play she had wished to see i had scarcely seated myself when an electric shock went through me a voice told me she is here i looked round and saw the countess hidden in the shadow at the back of her box in the first tier my look did not waver my eyes saw her at once with incredible clearness my soul hovered about her life like an insect above its flower how had my senses received this warning there is something in these inward tremors that shallow people find astonishing but the phenomena of our inner consciousness are produced as simple as those of external vision so i was not surprised but much vexed my studies of our mental faculties so little understood helped me at any rate to find in my own excitement some living proofs of my theories there was something exceedingly odd in this combination of lover and man of science of downright idolatry of a woman with the love of knowledge the causes of the lovers despair were highly interesting to the man of science and the exultant lover on the other hand put science far away from him in his joy foedora saw me and grew grave i annoyed her i went to her box during the first interval and finding her alone i stayed there although we had not spoken of love i foresaw an explanation i had not told her my secret still there was a kind of understanding between us she used to tell me her plans for amusement and on the previous evening had asked with friendly eagerness if i meant to call the next day after any witticism of hers she would give me an inquiring glance as if she had sought to please me alone by it she would soothe me if i was vexed and if she pouted i had in some sort a right to ask an explanation before she would pardon any blunder she would keep me a suppliant for long all these things that we so relished were so many lovers quarrels what arch grace she threw into it all and what happiness it was to me

but now we stood before each other as strangers with the close relation between us both suspended the countess was glacial a presentiment of trouble filled me

will you come home with me she said when the play was over

there had been a sudden change in the weather and sleet was falling in showers as we went out foedoras carriage was unable to reach the doorway of the theatre at the sight of a welldressed woman about to cross the street a commissionaire held an umbrella above us and stood waiting at the carriagedoor for his tip i would have given ten years of life just then for a couple of halfpence but i had not a penny all the man in me and all my vainest susceptibilities were wrung with an infernal pain the words i havent a penny about me my good fellow came from me in the hard voice of thwarted passion and yet i was that mans brother in misfortune as i knew too well and once i had so lightly paid away seven hundred thousand francs the footman pushed the man aside and the horses sprang forward as we returned foedora in real or feigned abstraction answered all my questions curtly and by monosyllables i said no more it was a hateful moment when we reached her house we seated ourselves by the hearth and when the servant had stirred the fire and left us alone the countess turned to me with an inexplicable expression and spoke her manner was almost solemn

since my return to france more than one young man tempted by my money has made proposals to me which would have satisfied my pride i have come across men too whose attachment was so deep and sincere that they might have married me even if they had found me the penniless girl i used to be besides these monsieur de valentin you must know that new titles and newlyacquired wealth have been also offered to me and that i have never received again any of those who were so illadvised as to mention love to me if my regard for you was but slight i would not give you this warning which is dictated by friendship rather than by pride a woman lays herself open to a rebuff of some kind if she imagines herself to be loved and declines before it is uttered to listen to language which in its nature implies a compliment i am well acquainted with the parts played by arsinoe and araminta and with the sort of answer i might look for under such circumstances but i hope today that i shall not find myself misconstrued by a man of no ordinary character because i have frankly spoken my mind

she spoke with the cool selfpossession of some attorney or solicitor explaining the nature of a contract or the conduct of a lawsuit to a client there was not the least sign of feeling in the clear soft tones of her voice her steady face and dignified bearing seemed to me now full of diplomatic reserve and coldness she had planned this scene no doubt and carefully chosen her words beforehand oh my friend there are women who take pleasure in piercing hearts and deliberately plunge the dagger back again into the wound such women as these cannot but be worshiped for such women either love or would fain be loved a day comes when they make amends for all the pain they gave us they repay us for the pangs the keenness of which they recognize in joys a hundredfold even as god they tell us recompenses our good works does not their perversity spring from the strength of their feelings but to be so tortured by a woman who slaughters you with indifference was not the suffering hideous

foedora did not know it but in that minute she trampled all my hopes beneath her feet she maimed my life and she blighted my future with the cool indifference and unconscious barbarity of an inquisitive child who plucks its wings from a butterfly

later on resumed foedora you will learn i hope the stability of the affection that i keep for my friends you will always find that i have devotion and kindness for them i would give my life to serve my friends but you could only despise me if i allowed them to make love to me without return that is enough you are the only man to whom i have spoken such words as these last

at first i could not speak or master the tempest that arose within me but i soon repressed my emotions in the depths of my soul and began to smile

if i own that i love you i said you will banish me at once if i plead guilty to indifference you will make me suffer for it women magistrates and priests never quite lay the gown aside silence is noncommittal be pleased then madame to approve my silence you must have feared in some degree to lose me or i should not have received this friendly admonition and with that thought my pride ought to be satisfied let us banish all personal considerations you are perhaps the only woman with whom i could discuss rationally a resolution so contrary to the laws of nature considered with regard to your species you are a prodigy now let us investigate in good faith the causes of this psychological anomaly does there exist in you as in many women a certain pride in self a love of your own loveliness a refinement of egoism which makes you shudder at the idea of belonging to another is it the thought of resigning your own will and submitting to a superiority though only of convention which displeases you you would seem to me a thousand times fairer for it can love formerly have brought you suffering you probably set some value on your dainty figure and graceful appearance and may perhaps wish to avoid the disfigurements of maternity is not this one of your strongest reasons for refusing a too importunate love some natural defect perhaps makes you insusceptible in spite of yourself do not be angry my study my inquiry is absolutely dispassionate some are born blind and nature may easily have formed women who in like manner are blind deaf and dumb to love you are really an interesting subject for medical investigation you do not know your value you feel perhaps a very legitimate distaste for mankind in that i quite concur—to me they all seem ugly and detestable and you are right i added feeling my heart swell within me how can you do otherwise than despise us there is not a man living who is worthy of you

i will not repeat all the biting words with which i ridiculed her in vain my bitterest sarcasms and keenest irony never made her wince nor elicited a sign of vexation she heard me with the customary smile upon her lips and in her eyes the smile that she wore as a part of her clothing and that never varied for friends for mere acquaintances or for strangers

isnt it very nice of me to allow you to dissect me like this she said at last as i came to a temporary standstill and looked at her in silence you see she went on laughing that i have no foolish oversensitiveness about my friendship many a woman would shut her door on you by way of punishing you for your impertinence

you could banish me without needing to give me the reasons for your harshness as i spoke i felt that i could kill her if she dismissed me

you are mad she said smiling still

did you never think i went on of the effects of passionate love a desperate man has often murdered his mistress

it is better to die than to live in misery she said coolly such a man as that would run through his wifes money desert her and leave her at last in utter wretchedness

this calm calculation dumfounded me the gulf between us was made plain we could never understand each other

goodbye i said proudly

goodbye till tomorrow she answered with a little friendly bow

for a moments space i hurled at her in a glance all the love i must forego she stood there with than banal smile of hers the detestable chill smile of a marble statue with none of the warmth in it that it seemed to express can you form any idea my friend of the pain that overcame me on the way home through rain and snow across a league of icysheeted quays without a hope left oh to think that she not only had not guessed my poverty but believed me to be as wealthy as she was and likewise borne as softly over the rough ways of life what failure and deceit it was no mere question of money now but of the fate of all that lay within me

i went at haphazard going over the words of our strange conversation with myself i got so thoroughly lost in my reflections that i ended by doubts as to the actual value of words and ideas but i loved her all the same i loved this woman with the untouched heart that might surrender at any moment—a woman who daily disappointed the expectations of the previous evening by appearing as a new mistress on the morrow

as i passed under the gateway of the institute a fevered thrill ran through me i remembered that i was fasting and that i had not a penny to complete the measure of my misfortune my hat was spoiled by the rain how was i to appear in the drawingroom of a woman of fashion with an unpresentable hat i had always cursed the inane and stupid custom that compels us to exhibit the lining of our hats and to keep them always in our hands but with anxious care i had so far kept mine in a precarious state of efficiency it had been neither strikingly new nor utterly shabby neither napless nor overglossy and might have passed for the hat of a frugally given owner but its artificially prolonged existence had now reached the final stage it was crumpled forlorn and completely ruined a downright rag a fitting emblem of its master my painfully preserved elegance must collapse for want of thirty sous

what unrecognized sacrifices i had made in the past three months for foedora how often i had given the price of a weeks sustenance to see her for a moment to leave my work and go without food was the least of it i must traverse the streets of paris without getting splashed run to escape showers and reach her rooms at last as neat and spruce as any of the coxcombs about her for a poet and a distracted wooer the difficulties of this task were endless my happiness the course of my love might be affected by a speck of mud upon my only white waistcoat oh to miss the sight of her because i was wet through and bedraggled and had not so much as five sous to give to a shoeblack for removing the least little spot of mud from my boot the petty pangs of these nameless torments which an irritable man finds so great only strengthened my passion

the unfortunate must make sacrifices which they may not mention to women who lead refined and luxurious lives such women see things through a prism that gilds all men and their surroundings egoism leads them to take cheerful views and fashion makes them cruel they do not wish to reflect lest they lose their happiness and the absorbing nature of their pleasures absolves their indifference to the misfortunes of others a penny never means millions to them millions on the contrary seem a mere trifle perhaps love must plead his cause by great sacrifices but a veil must be lightly drawn across them they must go down into silence so when wealthy men pour out their devotion their fortunes and their lives they gain somewhat by these commonly entertained opinions an additional lustre hangs about their lovers follies their silence is eloquent there is a grace about the drawn veil but my terrible distress bound me over to suffer fearfully or ever i might speak of my love or of dying for her sake

was it a sacrifice after all was i not richly rewarded by the joy i took in sacrificing everything to her there was no commonest event of my daily life to which the countess had not given importance had not overfilled with happiness i had been hitherto careless of my clothes now i respected my coat as if it had been a second self i should not have hesitated between bodily harm and a tear in that garment you must enter wholly into my circumstances to understand the stormy thoughts the gathering frenzy that shook me as i went and which perhaps were increased by my walk i gloated in an infernal fashion which i cannot describe over the absolute completeness of my wretchedness i would have drawn from it an augury of my future but there is no limit to the possibilities of misfortune the door of my lodginghouse stood ajar a light streamed from the heartshaped opening cut in the shutters pauline and her mother were sitting up for me and talking i heard my name spoken and listened

raphael is much nicerlooking than the student in number seven said pauline his fair hair is such a pretty color dont you think there is something in his voice too i dont know what it is that gives you a sort of a thrill and then though he may be a little proud he is very kind and he has such fine manners i am sure that all the ladies must be quite wild about him

you might be fond of him yourself to hear you talk was madame gaudins comment

he is just as dear to me as a brother she laughed i should be finely ungrateful if i felt no friendship for him didnt he teach me music and drawing and grammar and everything i know in fact you dont much notice how i get on dear mother but i shall know enough in a while to give lessons myself and then we can keep a servant

i stole away softly made some noise outside and went into their room to take the lamp that pauline tried to light for me the dear child had just poured soothing balm into my wounds her outspoken admiration had given me fresh courage i so needed to believe in myself and to come by a just estimate of my advantages this revival of hope in me perhaps colored my surroundings perhaps also i had never before really looked at the picture that so often met my eyes of the two women in their room it was a scene such as flemish painters have reproduced so faithfully for us that i admired in its delightful reality the mother with the kind smile upon her lips sat knitting stockings by the dying fire pauline was painting handscreens her brushes and paints strewn over the tiny table made bright spots of color for the eye to dwell on when she had left her seat and stood lighting my lamp one must have been under the yoke of a terrible passion indeed not to admire her faintly flushed transparent hands the girlish charm of her attitude the ideal grace of her head as the lamplight fell full on her pale face night and silence added to the charms of this industrious vigil and peaceful interior the lightheartedness that sustained such continuous toil could only spring from devout submission and the lofty feelings that it brings

there was an indescribable harmony between them and their possessions the splendor of foedoras home did not satisfy it called out all my worst instincts something in this lowly poverty and unfeigned goodness revived me it may have been that luxury abased me in my own eyes while here my selfrespect was restored to me as i sought to extend the protection that a man is so eager to make felt over these two women who in the bare simplicity of the existence in their brown room seemed to live wholly in the feelings of their hearts as i came up to pauline she looked at me in an almost motherly way her hands shook a little as she held the lamp so that the light fell on me and cried

dieu how pale you are and you are wet through my mother will try to wipe you dry monsieur raphael she went on after a little pause you are so very fond of milk and tonight we happen to have some cream here will you not take some

she pounced like a kitten on a china bowl full of milk she did it so quickly and put it before me so prettily that i hesitated

you are going to refuse me she said and her tones changed

the pride in each felt for the others pride it was paulines poverty that seemed to humiliate her and to reproach me with my want of consideration and i melted at once and accepted the cream that might have been meant for her mornings breakfast the poor child tried not to show her joy but her eyes sparkled

i needed it badly i said as i sat down an anxious look passed over her face do you remember that passage pauline where bossuet tells how god gave more abundant reward for a cup of cold water than for a victory

yes she said her heart beating like some wild birds in a childs hands

well as we shall part very soon now i went on in an unsteady voice you must let me show my gratitude to you and to your mother for all the care you have taken of me

oh dont let us cast accounts she said laughing but her laughter covered an agitation that gave me pain i went on without appearing to hear her words

my piano is one of erards best instruments and you must take it pray accept it without hesitation i really could not take it with me on the journey i am about to make

perhaps the melancholy tones in which i spoke enlightened the two women for they seemed to understand and eyed me with curiosity and alarm here was the affection that i had looked for in the glacial regions of the great world true affection unostentatious but tender and possibly lasting

dont take it to heart so the mother said stay on here my husband is on his way towards us even now she went on i looked into the gospel of st john this evening while pauline hung our doorkey in a bible from her fingers the key turned that means that gaudin is in health and doing well pauline began again for you and for the young man in number seven—it turned for you but not for him we are all going to be rich gaudin will come back a millionaire i dreamed once that i saw him in a ship full of serpents luckily the water was rough and that means gold or precious stones from oversea

the silly friendly words were like the crooning lullaby with which a mother soothes her sick child they in a manner calmed me there was a pleasant heartiness in the worthy womans looks and tones which if it could not remove trouble at any rate soothed and quieted it and deadened the pain pauline keenersighted than her mother studied me uneasily her quick eyes seemed to read my life and my future i thanked the mother and daughter by an inclination of the head and hurried away i was afraid i should break down

i found myself alone under my roof and laid myself down in my misery my unhappy imagination suggested numberless baseless projects and prescribed impossible resolutions when a man is struggling in the wreck of his fortunes he is not quite without resources but i was engulfed ah my dear fellow we are too ready to blame the wretched let us be less harsh on the results of the most powerful of all social solvents where poverty is absolute there exist no such things as shame or crime or virtue or intelligence i knew not what to do i was as defenceless as a maiden on her knees before a beast of prey a penniless man who has no ties to bind him is master of himself at any rate but a luckless wretch who is in love no longer belongs to himself and may not take his own life love makes us almost sacred in our own eyes it is the life of another that we revere within us then and so it begins for us the cruelest trouble of all—the misery with a hope in it a hope for which we must even bear our torments i thought i would go to rastignac on the morrow to confide foedoras strange resolution to him and with that i slept

ah ha cried rastignac as he saw me enter his lodging at nine oclock in the morning i know what brings you here foedora has dismissed you some kind souls who were jealous of your ascendency over the countess gave out that you were going to be married heaven only knows what follies your rivals have equipped you with and what slanders have been directed at you

that explains everything i exclaimed i remembered all my presumptuous speeches and gave the countess credit for no little magnanimity it pleased me to think that i was a miscreant who had not been punished nearly enough and i saw nothing in her indulgence but the longsuffering charity of love

not quite so fast urged the prudent gascon foedora has all the sagacity natural to a profoundly selfish woman perhaps she may have taken your measure while you still coveted only her money and her splendor in spite of all your care she could have read you through and through she can dissemble far too well to let any dissimulation pass undetected i fear he went on that i have brought you into a bad way in spite of her cleverness and her tact she seems to me a domineering sort of person like every woman who can only feel pleasure through her brain happiness for her lies entirely in a comfortable life and in social pleasures her sentiment is only assumed she will make you miserable you will be her head footman

he spoke to the deaf i broke in upon him disclosing with an affectation of lightheartedness the state of my finances

yesterday evening he rejoined luck ran against me and that carried off all my available cash but for that trivial mishap i would gladly have shared my purse with you but let us go and breakfast at the restaurant perhaps there is good counsel in oysters

he dressed and had his tilbury brought round we went to the cafe de paris like a couple of millionaires armed with all the audacious impertinence of the speculator whose capital is imaginary that devil of a gascon quite disconcerted me by the coolness of his manners and his absolute selfpossession while we were taking coffee after an excellent and wellordered repast a young dandy entered who did not escape rastignac he had been nodding here and there among the crowd to this or that young man distinguished both by personal attractions and elegant attire and now he said to me

heres your man as he beckoned to this gentleman with a wonderful cravat who seemed to be looking for a table that suited his ideas

that rogue has been decorated for bringing out books that he doesnt understand a word of whispered rastignac he is a chemist a historian a novelist and a political writer he has gone halves thirds or quarters in the authorship of i dont know how many plays and he is as ignorant as dom miguels mule he is not a man so much as a name a label that the public is familiar with so he would do well to avoid shops inscribed with the motto ici lon peut ecrire soimeme he is acute enough to deceive an entire congress of diplomatists in a couple of words he is a moral halfcaste not quite a fraud nor entirely genuine but hush he has succeeded already nobody asks anything further and every one calls him an illustrious man

well my esteemed and excellent friend and how may your intelligence be so rastignac addressed the stranger as he sat down at a neighboring table

neither well nor ill i am overwhelmed with work i have all the necessary materials for some very curious historical memoirs in my hands and i cannot find any one to whom i can ascribe them it worries me for i shall have to be quick about it memoirs are falling out of fashion

what are the memoirs—contemporaneous ancient or memoirs of the court or what

they relate to the necklace affair

now isnt that a coincidence said rastignac turning to me and laughing he looked again to the literary speculation and said indicating me

this is m de valentin one of my friends whom i must introduce to you as one of our future literary celebrities he had formerly an aunt a marquise much in favor once at court and for about two years he has been writing a royalist history of the revolution

then bending over this singular man of business he went on

he is a man of talent and a simpleton that will do your memoirs for you in his aunts name for a hundred crowns a volume

its a bargain said the other adjusting his cravat waiter my oysters

yes but you must give me twentyfive louis as commission and you will pay him in advance for each volume said rastignac

no no he shall only have fifty crowns on account and then i shall be sure of having my manuscript punctually

rastignac repeated this business conversation to me in low tones and then without giving me any voice in the matter he replied

we agree to your proposal when can we call upon you to arrange the affair

oh well come and dine here tomorrow at seven oclock

we rose rastignac flung some money to the waiter put the bill in his pocket and we went out i was quite stupified by the flippancy and ease with which he had sold my venerable aunt la marquise de montbauron

i would sooner take ship for the brazils and give the indians lessons in algebra though i dont know a word of it than tarnish my family name

rastignac burst out laughing

how dense you are take the fifty crowns in the first instance and write the memoirs when you have finished them you will decline to publish them in your aunts name imbecile madame de montbauron with her hooped petticoat her rank and beauty rouge and slippers and her death upon the scaffold is worth a great deal more than six hundred francs and then if the trade will not give your aunt her due some old adventurer or some shady countess or other will be found to put her name to the memoirs

oh i groaned why did i quit the blameless life in my garret this world has aspects that are very vilely dishonorable

yes said rastignac that is all very poetical but this is a matter of business what a child you are now listen to me as to your work the public will decide upon it and as for my literary middleman hasnt he devoted eight years of his life to obtaining a footing in the booktrade and paid heavily for his experience you divide the money and the labor of the book with him very unequally but isnt yours the better part twentyfive louis means as much to you as a thousand francs does to him come you can write historical memoirs a work of art such as never was since diderot once wrote six sermons for a hundred crowns

after all i said in agitation i cannot choose but do it so my dear friend my thanks are due to you i shall be quite rich with twentyfive louis

richer than you think he laughed if i have my commission from finot in this matter it goes to you cant you see now let us go to the bois de boulogne he said we shall see your countess there and i will show you the pretty little widow that i am to marry—a charming woman an alsacienne rather plump she reads kant schiller jean paul and a host of lachrymose books she has a mania for continually asking my opinion and i have to look as if i entered into all this german sensibility and to know a pack of ballads—drugs all of them that my doctor absolutely prohibits as yet i have not been able to wean her from her literary enthusiasms she sheds torrents of tears as she reads goethe and i have to weep a little myself to please her for she has an income of fifty thousand livres my dear boy and the prettiest little hand and foot in the world oh if she would only say mon ange and brouiller instead of mon anche and prouiller she would be perfection

we saw the countess radiant amid the splendors of her equipage the coquette bowed very graciously to us both and the smile she gave me seemed to me to be divine and full of love i was very happy i fancied myself beloved i had money a wealth of love in my heart and my troubles were over i was lighthearted blithe and content i found my friends ladylove charming earth and air and heaven—all nature—seemed to reflect foedoras smile for me

as we returned through the champselysees we paid a visit to rastignacs hatter and tailor thanks to the necklace my insignificant peacefooting was to end and i made formidable preparations for a campaign henceforward i need not shrink from a contest with the spruce and fashionable young men who made foedoras circle i went home locked myself in and stood by my dormer window outwardly calm enough but in reality i bade a last goodbye to the roofs without i began to live in the future rehearsed my life drama and discounted love and its happiness ah how stormy life can grow to be within the four walls of a garret the soul within us is like a fairy she turns straw into diamonds for us and for us at a touch of her wand enchanted palaces arise as flowers in the meadows spring up towards the sun

towards noon next day pauline knocked gently at my door and brought me—who could guess it—a note from foedora the countess asked me to take her to the luxembourg and to go thence to see with her the museum and jardin des plantes

the man is waiting for an answer said pauline after quietly waiting for a moment

i hastily scrawled my acknowledgements and pauline took the note i changed my dress when my toilette was ended and i looked at myself with some complaisance an icy shiver ran through me as i thought

will foedora walk or drive will it rain or shine—no matter though i said to myself whichever it is can one ever reckon with feminine caprice she will have no money about her and will want to give a dozen francs to some little savoyard because his rags are picturesque

i had not a brass farthing and should have no money till the evening came how dearly a poet pays for the intellectual prowess that method and toil have brought him at such crises of our youth innumerable painfully vivid thoughts pierced me like barbs i looked out of my window the weather was very unsettled if things fell out badly i might easily hire a cab for the day but would not the fear lie on me every moment that i might not meet finot in the evening i felt too weak to endure such fears in the midst of my felicity though i felt sure that i should find nothing i began a grand search through my room i looked for imaginary coins in the recesses of my mattress i hunted about everywhere—i even shook out my old boots a nervous fever seized me i looked with wild eyes at the furniture when i had ransacked it all will you understand i wonder the excitement that possessed me when plunged deep in the listlessness of despair i opened my writingtable drawer and found a fair and splendid tenfranc piece that shone like a rising star new and sparkling and slily hiding in a cranny between two boards i did not try to account for its previous reserve and the cruelty of which it had been guilty in thus lying hidden i kissed it for a friend faithful in adversity and hailed it with a cry that found an echo and made me turn sharply to find pauline with a face grown white

i thought she faltered that you had hurt yourself the man who brought the letter—— she broke off as if something smothered her voice but mother has paid him she added and flitted away like a wayward capricious child poor little one i wanted her to share in my happiness i seemed to have all the happiness in the world within me just then and i would fain have returned to the unhappy all that i felt as if i had stolen from them

the intuitive perception of adversity is sound for the most part the countess had sent away her carriage one of those freaks that pretty women can scarcely explain to themselves had determined her to go on foot by way of the boulevards to the jardin des plantes

it will rain i told her and it pleased her to contradict me

as it fell out the weather was fine while we went through the luxembourg when we came out some drops fell from a great cloud whose progress i had watched uneasily and we took a cab at the museum i was about to dismiss the vehicle and foedora what agonies asked me not to do so but it was like a dream in broad daylight for me to chat with her to wander in the jardin des plantes to stray down the shady alleys to feel her hand upon my arm the secret transports repressed in me were reduced no doubt to a fixed and foolish smile upon my lips there was something unreal about it all yet in all her movements however alluring whether we stood or whether we walked there was nothing either tender or loverlike when i tried to share in a measure the action of movement prompted by her life i became aware of a check or of something strange in her that i cannot explain or an inner activity concealed in her nature there is no suavity about the movements of women who have no soul in them our wills were opposed and we did not keep step together words are wanting to describe this outward dissonance between two beings we are not accustomed to read a thought in a movement we instinctively feel this phenomenon of our nature but it cannot be expressed

i did not dissect my sensations during those violent seizures of passion raphael went on after a moment of silence as if he were replying to an objection raised by himself i did not analyze my pleasures nor count my heartbeats then as a miser scrutinizes and weighs his gold pieces no experience sheds its melancholy light over the events of the past today and memory brings these pictures back as the seawaves in fair weather cast up fragment after fragment of the debris of a wrecked vessel upon the strand

it is in your power to render me a rather important service said the countess looking at me in an embarrassed way after confiding in you my aversion to lovers i feel myself more at liberty to entreat your good offices in the name of friendship will there not be very much more merit in obliging me today she asked laughing

i looked at her in anguish her manner was coaxing but in no wise affectionate she felt nothing for me she seemed to be playing a part and i thought her a consummate actress then all at once my hopes awoke once more at a single look and word yet if reviving love expressed itself in my eyes she bore its light without any change in the clearness of her own they seemed like a tigers eyes to have a sheet of metal behind them i used to hate her in such moments

the influence of the duc de navarreins would be very useful to me with an allpowerful person in russia she went on persuasion in every modulation of her voice whose intervention i need in order to have justice done me in a matter that concerns both my fortune and my position in the world that is to say the recognition of my marriage by the emperor is not the duc de navarreins a cousin of yours a letter from him would settle everything

i am yours i answered command me

you are very nice she said pressing my hand come and have dinner with me and i will tell you everything as if you were my confessor

so this discreet suspicious woman who had never been heard to speak a word about her affairs to any one was going to consult me

oh how dear to me is this silence that you have imposed on me i cried but i would rather have had some sharper ordeal still and she smiled upon the intoxication in my eyes she did not reject my admiration in any way surely she loved me

fortunately my purse held just enough to satisfy her cabman the day spent in her house alone with her was delicious it was the first time that i had seen her in this way hitherto we had always been kept apart by the presence of others and by her formal politeness and reserved manners even during her magnificent dinners but now it was as if i lived beneath her own roof—i had her all to myself so to speak my wandering fancy broke down barriers arranged the events of life to my liking and steeped me in happiness and love i seemed to myself her husband i liked to watch her busied with little details it was a pleasure to me even to see her take off her bonnet and shawl she left me alone for a little and came back charming with her hair newly arranged and this dainty change of toilette had been made for me

during the dinner she lavished attention upon me and put charm without end into those numberless trifles to all seeming that make up half of our existence nevertheless as we sat together before a crackling fire on silken cushions surrounded by the most desirable creations of oriental luxury as i saw this woman whose famous beauty made every heart beat so close to me an unapproachable woman who was talking and bringing all her powers of coquetry to bear upon me then my blissful pleasure rose almost to the point of suffering to my vexation i recollected the important business to be concluded i determined to go to keep the appointment made for me for this evening

so soon she said seeing me take my hat

she loved me then or i thought so at least from the bland tones in which those two words were uttered i would then have bartered a couple of years of life for every hour she chose to grant to me and so prolong my ecstasy my happiness was increased by the extent of the money i sacrificed it was midnight before she dismissed me but on the morrow for all that my heroism cost me a good many remorseful pangs i was afraid the affair of the memoirs now of such importance for me might have fallen through and rushed off to rastignac we found the nominal author of my future labors just getting up

finot read over a brief agreement to me in which nothing whatever was said about my aunt and when it had been signed he paid me down fifty crowns and the three of us breakfasted together i had only thirty francs left over when i had paid for my new hat for sixty tickets at thirty sous each and settled my debts but for some days to come the difficulties of living were removed if i had but listened to rastignac i might have had abundance by frankly adopting the english system he really wanted to establish my credit by setting me to raise loans on the theory that borrowing is the basis of credit to hear him talk the future was the largest and most secure kind of capital in the world my future luck was hypothecated for the benefit of my creditors and he gave my custom to his tailor an artist and a young mans tailor who was to leave me in peace until i married

the monastic life of study that i had led for three years past ended on this day i frequented foedoras house very diligently and tried to outshine the heroes or the swaggerers to be found in her circle when i believed that i had left poverty for ever behind me i regained my freedom of mind humiliated my rivals and was looked upon as a very attractive dazzling and irresistible sort of man but acute folk used to say with regard to me a fellow as clever as that will keep all his enthusiasms in his brain and charitably extolled my faculties at the expense of my feelings isnt he lucky not to be in love they exclaimed if he were could he be so lighthearted and animated yet in foedoras presence i was as dull as love could make me when i was alone with her i had not a word to say or if i did speak i renounced love and i affected gaiety but ill like a courtier who has a bitter mortification to hide i tried in every way to make myself indispensable in her life and necessary to her vanity and to her comfort i was a plaything at her pleasure a slave always at her side and when i had frittered away the day in this way i went back to my work at night securing merely two or three hours sleep in the early morning

but i had not like rastignac the english system at my fingerends and i very soon saw myself without a penny i fell at once into that precarious way of life which industriously hides cold and miserable depths beneath an elusive surface of luxury i was a coxcomb without conquests a penniless fop a nameless gallant the old sufferings were renewed but less sharply no doubt i was growing used to the painful crisis very often my sole diet consisted of the scanty provision of cakes and tea that is offered in drawingrooms or one of the countess great dinners must sustain me for two whole days i used all my time and exerted every effort and all my powers of observation to penetrate the impenetrable character of foedora alternate hope and despair had swayed my opinions for me she was sometimes the tenderest sometimes the most unfeeling of women but these transitions from joy to sadness became unendurable i sought to end the horrible conflict within me by extinguishing love by the light of warning gleams my soul sometimes recognized the gulfs that lay between us the countess confirmed all my fears i had never yet detected any tear in her eyes an affecting scene in a play left her smiling and unmoved all her instincts were selfish she could not divine anothers joy or sorrow she had made a fool of me in fact

i had rejoiced over a sacrifice to make for her and almost humiliated myself in seeking out my kinsman the duc de navarreins a selfish man who was ashamed of my poverty and had injured me too deeply not to hate me he received me with the polite coldness that makes every word and gesture seem an insult he looked so ill at ease that i pitied him i blushed for this pettiness amid grandeur and penuriousness surrounded by luxury he began to talk to me of his heavy losses in the three per cents and then i told him the object of my visit the change in his manners hitherto glacial which now gradually became affectionate disgusted me

well he called upon the countess and completely eclipsed me with her

on him foedora exercised spells and witcheries unheard of she drew him into her power and arranged her whole mysterious business with him i was left out i heard not a word of it she had made a tool of me she did not seem to be aware of my existence while my cousin was present she received me less cordially perhaps than when i was first presented to her one evening she chose to mortify me before the duke by a look a gesture that it is useless to try to express in words i went away with tears in my eyes planning terrible and outrageous schemes of vengeance without end

i often used to go with her to the theatre love utterly absorbed me as i sat beside her as i looked at her i used to give myself up to the pleasure of listening to the music putting all my soul into the double joy of love and of hearing every emotion of my heart translated into musical cadences it was my passion that filled the air and the stage that was triumphant everywhere but with my mistress then i would take foedoras hand i used to scan her features and her eyes imploring of them some indication that one blended feeling possessed us both seeking for the sudden harmony awakened by the power of music which makes our souls vibrate in unison but her hand was passive her eyes said nothing

when the fire that burned in me glowed too fiercely from the face i turned upon her she met it with that studied smile of hers the conventional expression that sits on the lips of every portrait in every exhibition she was not listening to the music the divine pages of rossini cimarosa or zingarelli called up no emotion gave no voice to any poetry in her life her soul was a desert

foedora presented herself as a drama before a drama her lorgnette traveled restlessly over the boxes she was restless too beneath the apparent calm fashion tyrannized over her her box her bonnet her carriage her own personality absorbed her entirely my merciless knowledge thoroughly tore away all my illusions if good breeding consists in selfforgetfulness and consideration for others in constantly showing gentleness in voice and bearing in pleasing others and in making them content in themselves all traces of her plebeian origin were not yet obliterated in foedora in spite of her cleverness her selfforgetfulness was a sham her manners were not innate but painfully acquired her politeness was rather subservient and yet for those she singled out her honeyed words expressed natural kindness her pretentious exaggeration was exalted enthusiasm i alone had scrutinized her grimacings and stripped away the thin rind that sufficed to conceal her real nature from the world her trickery no longer deceived me i had sounded the depths of that feline nature i blushed for her when some donkey or other flattered and complimented her and yet i loved her through it all i hoped that her snows would melt with the warmth of a poets love if i could only have made her feel all the greatness that lies in devotion then i should have seen her perfected she would have been an angel i loved her as a man a lover and an artist if it had been necessary not to love her so that i might win her some coolheaded coxcomb some selfpossessed calculator would perhaps have had an advantage over me she was so vain and sophisticated that the language of vanity would appeal to her she would have allowed herself to be taken in the toils of an intrigue a hard cold nature would have gained a complete ascendency over her keen grief had pierced me to my very soul as she unconsciously revealed her absolute love of self i seemed to see her as she one day would be alone in the world with no one to whom she could stretch her hand with no friendly eyes for her own to meet and rest upon i was bold enough to set this before her one evening i painted in vivid colors her lonely sad deserted old age her comment on this prospect of so terrible a revenge of thwarted nature was horrible

i shall always have money she said and with money we can always inspire such sentiments as are necessary for our comfort in those about us

i went away confounded by the arguments of luxury by the reasoning of this woman of the world in which she lived and blamed myself for my infatuated idolatry i myself had not loved pauline because she was poor and had not the wealthy foedora a right to repulse raphael conscience is our unerring judge until we finally stifle it a specious voice said within me foedora is neither attracted to nor repulses any one she has her liberty but once upon a time she sold herself to the russian count her husband or her lover for gold but temptation is certain to enter into her life wait till that moment comes she lived remote from humanity in a sphere apart in a hell or a heaven of her own she was neither frail nor virtuous this feminine enigma in embroideries and cashmeres had brought into play every emotion of the human heart in me—pride ambition love curiosity

there was a craze just then for praising a play at a little boulevard theatre prompted perhaps by a wish to appear original that besets us all or due to some freak of fashion the countess showed some signs of a wish to see the floured face of the actor who had so delighted several people of taste and i obtained the honor of taking her to a first presentation of some wretched farce or other a box scarcely cost five francs but i had not a brass farthing i was but halfway through the volume of memoirs i dared not beg for assistance of finot and rastignac my providence was away these constant perplexities were the bane of my life

we had once come out of the theatre when it was raining heavily foedora had called a cab for me before i could escape from her show of concern she would not admit any of my excuses—my liking for wet weather and my wish to go to the gamingtable she did not read my poverty in my embarrassed attitude or in my forced jests my eyes would redden but she did not understand a look a young mans life is at the mercy of the strangest whims at every revolution of the wheels during the journey thoughts that burned stirred in my heart i tried to pull up a plank from the bottom of the vehicle hoping to slip through the hole into the street but finding insuperable obstacles i burst into a fit of laughter and then sat stupefied in calm dejection like a man in a pillory when i reached my lodging pauline broke in through my first stammering words with

if you havent any money——

ah the music of rossini was as nothing compared with those words but to return to the performance at the funambules

i thought of pawning the circlet of gold round my mothers portrait in order to escort the countess although the pawnbroker loomed in my thoughts as one of the doors of a convicts prison i would rather myself have carried my bed thither than have begged for alms there is something so painful in the expression of a man who asks money of you there are loans that mulct us of our selfrespect just as some rebuffs from a friends lips sweep away our last illusion

pauline was working her mother had gone to bed i flung a stealthy glance over the bed the curtains were drawn back a little madame gaudin was in a deep sleep i thought when i saw her quiet sallow profile outlined against the pillow

you are in trouble pauline said dipping her brush into the coloring

it is in your power to do me a great service my dear child i answered

the gladness in her eyes frightened me

is it possible that she loves me i thought pauline i began i went and sat near to her so as to study her my tones had been so searching that she read my thought her eyes fell and i scrutinized her face it was so pure and frank that i fancied i could see as clearly into her heart as into my own

do you love me i asked

a little—passionately—not a bit she cried

then she did not love me her jesting tones and a little gleeful movement that escaped her expressed nothing beyond a girlish blithe goodwill i told her about my distress and the predicament in which i found myself and asked her to help me

you do not wish to go to the pawnbrokers yourself m raphael she answered and yet you would send me

i blushed in confusion at the childs reasoning she took my hand in hers as if she wanted to compensate for this hometruth by her light touch upon it

oh i would willingly go she said but it is not necessary i found two fivefranc pieces at the back of the piano that had slipped without your knowledge between the frame and the keyboard and i laid them on your table

you will soon be coming into some money m raphael said the kind mother showing her face between the curtains and i can easily lend you a few crowns meanwhile

oh pauline i cried as i pressed her hand how i wish that i were rich

bah why should you she said petulantly her hand shook in mine with the throbbing of her pulse she snatched it away and looked at both of mine

you will marry a rich wife she said but she will give you a great deal of trouble ah dieu she will be your death—i am sure of it

in her exclamation there was something like belief in her mothers absurd superstitions

you are very credulous pauline

the woman whom you will love is going to kill you—there is no doubt of it she said looking at me with alarm

she took up her brush again and dipped it in the color her great agitation was evident she looked at me no longer i was ready to give credence just then to superstitious fancies no man is utterly wretched so long as he is superstitious a belief of that kind is often in reality a hope

i found that those two magnificent fivefranc pieces were lying in fact upon my table when i reached my room during the first confused thoughts of early slumber i tried to audit my accounts so as to explain this unhopedfor windfall but i lost myself in useless calculations and slept just as i was leaving my room to engage a box the next morning pauline came to see me

perhaps your ten francs is not enough said the amiable kindhearted girl my mother told me to offer you this money take it please take it

she laid three crowns upon the table and tried to escape but i would not let her go admiration dried the tears that sprang to my eyes

you are an angel pauline i said it is not the loan that touches me so much as the delicacy with which it is offered i used to wish for a rich wife a fashionable woman of rank and now alas i would rather possess millions and find some girl as poor as you are with a generous nature like your own and i would renounce a fatal passion which will kill me perhaps what you told me will come true

that is enough she said and fled away the fresh trills of her birdlike voice rang up the staircase

she is very happy in not yet knowing love i said to myself thinking of the torments i had endured for many months past

paulines fifteen francs were invaluable to me foedora thinking of the stifling odor of the crowded place where we were to spend several hours was sorry that she had not brought a bouquet i went in search of flowers for her as i had laid already my life and my fate at her feet with a pleasure in which compunction mingled i gave her a bouquet i learned from its price the extravagance of superficial gallantry in the world but very soon she complained of the heavy scent of a mexican jessamine the interior of the theatre the bare bench on which she was to sit filled her with intolerable disgust she upbraided me for bringing her there although she sat beside me she wished to go and she went i had spent sleepless nights and squandered two months of my life for her and i could not please her never had that tormenting spirit been more unfeeling or more fascinating

i sat beside her in the cramped back seat of the vehicle all the way i could feel her breath on me and the contact of her perfumed glove i saw distinctly all her exceeding beauty i inhaled a vague scent of orrisroot so wholly a woman she was with no touch of womanhood just then a sudden gleam of light lit up the depths of this mysterious life for me i thought all at once of a book just published by a poet a genuine conception of the artist in the shape of the statue of polycletus

i seemed to see that monstrous creation at one time an officer breaking in a spirited horse at another a girl who gives herself up to her toilette and breaks her lovers hearts or again a false lover driving a timid and gentle maid to despair unable to analyze foedora by any other process i told her this fanciful story but no hint of her resemblance to this poetry of the impossible crossed her—it simply diverted her she was like a child over a story from the arabian nights

foedora must be shielded by some talisman i thought to myself as i went back or she could not resist the love of a man of my age the infectious fever of that splendid malady of the soul is foedora like lady delacour a prey to a cancer her life is certainly an unnatural one

i shuddered at the thought then i decided on a plan at once the wildest and the most rational that lover ever dreamed of i would study this woman from a physical point of view as i had already studied her intellectually and to this end i made up my mind to spend a night in her room without her knowledge this project preyed upon me as a thirst for revenge gnaws at the heart of a corsican monk this is how i carried it out on the days when foedora received her rooms were far too crowded for the hallporter to keep the balance even between goers and comers i could remain in the house i felt sure without causing a scandal in it and i waited the countess coming soiree with impatience as i dressed i put a little english penknife into my waistcoat pocket instead of a poniard that literary implement if found upon me could awaken no suspicion but i knew not whither my romantic resolution might lead and i wished to be prepared

as soon as the rooms began to fill i entered the bedroom and examined the arrangements the inner and outer shutters were closed this was a good beginning and as the waitingmaid might come to draw back the curtains that hung over the windows i pulled them together i was running great risks in venturing to manoeuvre beforehand in this way but i had accepted the situation and had deliberately reckoned with its dangers

about midnight i hid myself in the embrasure of the window i tried to scramble on to a ledge of the wainscoting hanging on by the fastening of the shutters with my back against the wall in such a position that my feet could not be visible when i had carefully considered my points of support and the space between me and the curtains i had become sufficiently acquainted with all the difficulties of my position to stay in it without fear of detection if undisturbed by cramp coughs or sneezings to avoid useless fatigue i remained standing until the critical moment when i must hang suspended like a spider in its web the whitewatered silk and muslin of the curtains spread before me in great pleats like organpipes with my penknife i cut loopholes in them through which i could see

i heard vague murmurs from the salons the laughter and the louder tones of the speakers the smothered commotion and vague uproar lessened by slow degrees one man and another came for his hat from the countess chest of drawers close to where i stood i shivered if the curtains were disturbed at the thought of the mischances consequent on the confused and hasty investigations made by the men in a hurry to depart who were rummaging everywhere when i experienced no misfortunes of this kind i augured well of my enterprise an old wooer of foedoras came for the last hat he thought himself quite alone looked at the bed and heaved a great sigh accompanied by some inaudible exclamation into which he threw sufficient energy in the boudoir close by the countess finding only some five or six intimate acquaintances about her proposed tea the scandals for which existing society has reserved the little faculty of belief that it retains mingled with epigrams and trenchant witticisms and the clatter of cups and spoons rastignac drew roars of laughter by merciless sarcasms at the expense of my rivals

m de rastignac is a man with whom it is better not to quarrel said the countess laughing

i am quite of that opinion was his candid reply i have always been right about my aversions—and my friendships as well he added perhaps my enemies are quite as useful to me as my friends i have made a particular study of modern phraseology and of the natural craft that is used in all attack or defence official eloquence is one of our perfect social products

one of your friends is not clever so you speak of his integrity and his candor anothers work is heavy you introduce it as a piece of conscientious labor and if the book is ill written you extol the ideas it contains such an one is treacherous and fickle slips through your fingers every moment bah he is attractive bewitching he is delightful suppose they are enemies you fling every one dead or alive in their teeth you reverse your phraseology for their benefit and you are as keen in detecting their faults as you were before adroit in bringing out the virtues of your friends this way of using the mental lorgnette is the secret of conversation nowadays and the whole art of the complete courtier if you neglect it you might as well go out as an unarmed knightbanneret to fight against men in armor and i make use of it and even abuse it at times so we are respected—i and my friends and moreover my sword is quite as sharp as my tongue

one of foedoras most fervid worshipers whose presumption was notorious and who even made it contribute to his success took up the glove thrown down so scornfully by rastignac he began an unmeasured eulogy of me my performances and my character rastignac had overlooked this method of detraction his sarcastic encomiums misled the countess who sacrificed without mercy she betrayed my secrets and derided my pretensions and my hopes to divert her friends

there is a future before him said rastignac some day he may be in a position to take a cruel revenge his talents are at least equal to his courage and i should consider those who attack him very rash for he has a good memory——

and writes memoirs put in the countess who seemed to object to the deep silence that prevailed

memoirs of a sham countess madame replied rastignac another sort of courage is needed to write that sort of thing

i give him credit for plenty of courage she answered he is faithful to me

i was greatly tempted to show myself suddenly among the railers like the shade of banquo in macbeth i should have lost a mistress but i had a friend but love inspired me all at once with one of those treacherous and fallacious subtleties that it can use to soothe all our pangs

if foedora loved me i thought she would be sure to disguise her feelings by some mocking jest how often the heart protests against a lie on the lips

well very soon my audacious rival left alone with the countess rose to go

what already asked she in a coaxing voice that set my heart beating will you not give me a few more minutes have you nothing more to say to me will you never sacrifice any of your pleasures for me

he went away

ah she yawned how very tiresome they all are

she pulled a cord energetically till the sound of a bell rang through the place then humming a few notes of pria che spunti the countess entered her room no one had ever heard her sing her muteness had called forth the wildest explanations she had promised her first lover so it was said who had been held captive by her talent and whose jealousy over her stretched beyond his grave that she would never allow others to experience a happiness that he wished to be his and his alone

i exerted every power of my soul to catch the sounds higher and higher rose the notes foedoras life seemed to dilate within her her throat poured forth all its richest tones something wellnigh divine entered into the melody there was a bright purity and clearness of tone in the countess voice a thrilling harmony which reached the heart and stirred its pulses musicians are seldom unemotional a woman who could sing like that must know how to love indeed her beautiful voice made one more puzzle in a woman mysterious enough before i beheld her then as plainly as i see you at this moment she seemed to listen to herself to experience a secret rapture of her own she felt as it were an ecstasy like that of love

she stood before the hearth during the execution of the principal theme of the rondo and when she ceased her face changed she looked tired her features seemed to alter she had laid the mask aside her part as an actress was over yet the faded look that came over her beautiful face a result either of this performance or of the evenings fatigues had its charms too

this is her real self i thought

she set her foot on a bronze bar of the fender as if to warm it took off her gloves and drew over her head the gold chain from which her bejeweled scentbottle hung it gave me a quite indescribable pleasure to watch the feline grace of every movement the supple grace a cat displays as it adjusts its toilette in the sun she looked at herself in the mirror and said aloud illhumoredly—i did not look well this evening my complexion is going with alarming rapidity perhaps i ought to keep earlier hours and give up this life of dissipation does justine mean to trifle with me she rang again her maid hurried in where she had been i cannot tell she came in by a secret staircase i was anxious to make a study of her i had lodged accusations in my romantic imaginings against this invisible waitingwoman a tall wellmade brunette

did madame ring

yes twice answered foedora are you really growing deaf nowadays

i was preparing madames milk of almonds

justine knelt down before her unlaced her sandals and drew them off while her mistress lay carelessly back on her cushioned armchair beside the fire yawned and scratched her head every movement was perfectly natural there was nothing whatever to indicate the secret sufferings or emotions with which i had credited her

george must be in love she remarked i shall dismiss him he has drawn the curtains again tonight what does he mean by it

all the blood in my veins rushed to my heart at this observation but no more was said about curtains

life is very empty the countess went on ah be careful not to scratch me as you did yesterday just look here i still have the marks of your nails about me and she held out a silken knee she thrust her bare feet into velvet slippers bound with swansdown and unfastened her dress while justine prepared to comb her hair

you ought to marry madame and have children

children she cried it wants no more than that to finish me at once and a husband what man is there to whom i could—— was my hair well arranged tonight

not particularly

you are a fool

that way of crimping your hair too much is the least becoming way possible for you large smooth curls suit you a great deal better

really

yes really madame that wavy style only looks nice in fair hair

marriage never never marriage is a commercial arrangement for which i was never made

what a disheartening scene for a lover here was a lonely woman without friends or kin without the religion of love without faith in any affection yet however slightly she might feel the need to pour out her heart a craving that every human being feels it could only be satisfied by gossiping with her maid by trivial and indifferent talk i grieved for her

justine unlaced her i watched her carefully when she was at last unveiled her maidenly form in its rosetinged whiteness was visible through her shift in the taper light as dazzling as some silver statue behind its gauze covering no there was no defect that need shrink from the stolen glances of love alas a fair form will overcome the stoutest resolutions

the maid lighted the taper in the alabaster sconce that hung before the bed while her mistress sat thoughtful and silent before the fire justine went for a warmingpan turned down the bed and helped to lay her mistress in it then after some further time spent in punctiliously rendering various services that showed how seriously foedora respected herself her maid left her the countess turned to and fro several times and sighed she was ill at ease faint just perceptible sounds like sighs of impatience escaped from her lips she reached out a hand to the table and took a flask from it from which she shook four or five drops of some brown liquid into some milk before taking it again there followed some painful sighs and the exclamation mon dieu

the cry and the tone in which it was uttered wrung my heart by degrees she lay motionless this frightened me but very soon i heard a sleepers heavy regular breathing i drew the rustling silk curtains apart left my post went to the foot of the bed and gazed at her with feelings that i cannot define she was so enchanting as she lay like a child with her arm above her head but the sweetness of the fair quiet visage surrounded by the lace only irritated me i had not been prepared for the torture to which i was compelled to submit

mon dieu that scrap of a thought which i understood not but must even take as my sole light had suddenly modified my opinion of foedora trite or profoundly significant frivolous or of deep import the words might be construed as expressive of either pleasure or pain of physical or of mental suffering was it a prayer or a malediction a forecast or a memory a fear or a regret a whole life lay in that utterance a life of wealth or of penury perhaps it contained a crime

the mystery that lurked beneath this fair semblance of womanhood grew afresh there were so many ways of explaining foedora that she became inexplicable a sort of language seemed to flow from between her lips i put thoughts and feelings into the accidents of her breathing whether weak or regular gentle or labored i shared her dreams i would fain have divined her secrets by reading them through her slumber i hesitated among contradictory opinions and decisions without number i could not deny my heart to the woman i saw before me with the calm pure beauty in her face i resolved to make one more effort if i told her the story of my life my love my sacrifices might i not awaken pity in her or draw a tear from her who never wept

as i set all my hopes on this last experiment the sounds in the streets showed that day was at hand for a moments space i pictured foedora waking to find herself in my arms i could have stolen softly to her side and slipped them about her in a close embrace resolved to resist the cruel tyranny of this thought i hurried into the salon heedless of any sounds i might make but luckily i came upon a secret door leading to a little staircase as i expected the key was in the lock i slammed the door went boldly out into the court and gained the street in three bounds without looking round to see whether i was observed

a dramatist was to read a comedy at the countess house in two days time i went thither intending to outstay the others so as to make a rather singular request to her i meant to ask her to keep the following evening for me alone and to deny herself to other comers but when i found myself alone with her my courage failed every tick of the clock alarmed me it wanted only a quarter of an hour of midnight

if i do not speak i thought to myself i must smash my head against the corner of the mantelpiece

i gave myself three minutes grace the three minutes went by and i did not smash my head upon the marble my heart grew heavy like a sponge with water

you are exceedingly amusing said she

ah madame if you could but understand me i answered

what is the matter with you she asked you are turning pale

i am hesitating to ask a favor of you

her gesture revived my courage i asked her to make the appointment with me

willingly she answered but why will you not speak to me now

to be candid with you i ought to explain the full scope of your promise i want to spend this evening by your side as if we were brother and sister have no fear i am aware of your antipathies you must have divined me sufficiently to feel sure that i should wish you to do nothing that could be displeasing to you presumption moreover would not thus approach you you have been a friend to me you have shown me kindness and great indulgence know therefore that tomorrow i must bid you farewell—do not take back your word i exclaimed seeing her about to speak and i went away

at eight oclock one evening towards the end of may foedora and i were alone together in her gothic boudoir i feared no longer i was secure of happiness my mistress should be mine or i would seek a refuge in death i had condemned my fainthearted love and a man who acknowledges his weakness is strong indeed

the countess in her blue cashmere gown was reclining on a sofa with her feet on a cushion she wore an oriental turban such as painters assign to early hebrews its strangeness added an indescribable coquettish grace to her attractions a transitory charm seemed to have laid its spell on her face it might have furnished the argument that at every instant we become new and unparalleled beings without any resemblance to the us of the future or of the past i had never yet seen her so radiant

do you know that you have piqued my curiosity she said laughing

i will not disappoint it i said quietly as i seated myself near to her and took the hand that she surrendered to me you have a very beautiful voice

you have never heard me sing she exclaimed starting involuntarily with surprise

i will prove that it is quite otherwise whenever it is necessary is your delightful singing still to remain a mystery have no fear i do not wish to penetrate it

we spent about an hour in familiar talk while i adopted the attitude and manner of a man to whom foedora must refuse nothing i showed her all a lovers deference acting in this way i received a favor—i was allowed to kiss her hand she daintily drew off the glove and my whole soul was dissolved and poured forth in that kiss i was steeped in the bliss of an illusion in which i tried to believe

foedora lent herself most unexpectedly to my caress and my flatteries do not accuse me of faintheartedness if i had gone a step beyond these fraternal compliments the claws would have been out of the sheath and into me we remained perfectly silent for nearly ten minutes i was admiring her investing her with the charms she had not she was mine just then and mine only—this enchanting being was mine as was permissible in my imagination my longing wrapped her round and held her close in my soul i wedded her the countess was subdued and fascinated by my magnetic influence ever since i have regretted that this subjugation was not absolute but just then i yearned for her soul her heart alone and for nothing else i longed for an ideal and perfect happiness a fair illusion that cannot last for very long at last i spoke feeling that the last hours of my frenzy were at hand

hear me madame i love you and you know it i have said so a hundred times you must have understood me i would not take upon me the airs of a coxcomb nor would i flatter you nor urge myself upon you like a fool i would not owe your love to such arts as these so i have been misunderstood what sufferings have i not endured for your sake for these however you were not to blame but in a few minutes you shall decide for yourself there are two kinds of poverty madame one kind openly walks the street in rags an unconscious imitator of diogenes on a scanty diet reducing life to its simplest terms he is happier maybe than the rich he has fewer cares at any rate and accepts such portions of the world as stronger spirits refuse then there is poverty in splendor a spanish pauper concealing the life of a beggar by his title his bravery and his pride poverty that wears a white waistcoat and yellow kid gloves a beggar with a carriage whose whole career will be wrecked for lack of a halfpenny poverty of the first kind belongs to the populace the second kind is that of blacklegs of kings and of men of talent i am neither a man of the people nor a king nor a swindler possibly i have no talent either i am an exception with the name i bear i must die sooner than beg set your mind at rest madame i said today i have abundance i possess sufficient of the clay for my needs for the hard look passed over her face which we wear whenever a welldressed beggar takes us by surprise do you remember the day when you wished to go to the gymnase without me never believing that i should be there i went on

she nodded

i had laid out my last fivefranc piece that i might see you there—do you recollect our walk in the jardin des plantes the hire of your cab took everything i had

i told her about my sacrifices and described the life i led heated not with wine as i am today but by the generous enthusiasm of my heart my passion overflowed in burning words i have forgotten how the feelings within me blazed forth neither memory nor skill of mine could possibly reproduce it it was no colorless chronicle of blighted affections my love was strengthened by fair hopes and such words came to me by loves inspiration that each had power to set forth a whole life—like echoes of the cries of a soul in torment in such tones the last prayers ascend from dying men on the battlefield i stopped for she was weeping grand dieu i had reaped an actors reward the success of a counterfeit passion displayed at the cost of five francs paid at the theatre door i had drawn tears from her

if i had known—— she said

do not finish the sentence i broke in even now i love you well enough to murder you——

she reached for the bellpull i burst into a roar of laughter

do not call any one i said i shall leave you to finish your life in peace it would be a blundering kind of hatred that would murder you you need not fear violence of any kind i have spent a whole night at the foot of your bed without——

monsieur—— she said blushing but after that first impulse of modesty that even the most hardened women must surely own she flung a scornful glance at me and said

you must have been very cold

do you think that i set such value on your beauty madame i answered guessing the thoughts that moved her your beautiful face is for me a promise of a soul yet more beautiful madame those to whom a woman is merely a woman can always purchase odalisques fit for the seraglio and achieve their happiness at a small cost but i aspired to something higher i wanted the life of close communion of heart and heart with you that have no heart i know that now if you were to belong to another i could kill him and yet no for you would love him and his death might hurt you perhaps what agony this is i cried

if it is any comfort to you she retorted cheerfully i can assure you that i shall never belong to any one——

so you offer an affront to god himself i interrupted and you will be punished for it some day you will lie upon your sofa suffering unheardof ills unable to endure the light or the slightest sound condemned to live as it were in the tomb then when you seek the causes of those lingering and avenging torments you will remember the woes that you distributed so lavishly upon your way you have sown curses and hatred will be your reward we are the real judges the executioners of a justice that reigns here below which overrules the justice of man and the laws of god

no doubt it is very culpable in me not to love you she said laughing am i to blame no i do not love you you are a man that is sufficient i am happy by myself why should i give up my way of living a selfish way if you will for the caprices of a master marriage is a sacrament by virtue of which each imparts nothing but vexations to the other children moreover worry me did i not faithfully warn you about my nature why are you not satisfied to have my friendship i wish i could make you amends for all the troubles i have caused you through not guessing the value of your poor fivefranc pieces i appreciate the extent of your sacrifices but your devotion and delicate tact can be repaid by love alone and i care so little for you that this scene has a disagreeable effect upon me

i am fully aware of my absurdity i said unable to restrain my tears pardon me i went on it was a delight to hear those cruel words you have just uttered so well i love you o if i could testify my love with every drop of blood in me

men always repeat these classic formulas to us more or less effectively she answered still smiling but it appears very difficult to die at our feet for i see corpses of that kind about everywhere it is twelve oclock allow me to go to bed

and in two hours time you will cry to yourself ah mon dieu

like the day before yesterday yes she said i was thinking of my stockbroker i had forgotten to tell him to convert my five per cent stock into threes and the three per cents had fallen during the day

i looked at her and my eyes glittered with anger sometimes a crime may be a whole romance i understood that just then she was so accustomed no doubt to the most impassioned declarations of this kind that my words and my tears were forgotten already

would you marry a peer of france i demanded abruptly

if he were a duke i might

i seized my hat and made her a bow

permit me to accompany you to the door she said cutting irony in her tones in the poise of her head and in her gesture

madame——

monsieur

i shall never see you again

i hope not and she insolently inclined her head

you wish to be a duchess i cried excited by a sort of madness that her insolence roused in me you are wild for honors and titles well only let me love you bid my pen write and my voice speak for you alone be the inmost soul of my life my guiding star then only accept me for your husband as a minister a peer of france a duke i will make of myself whatever you would have me be

you made good use of the time you spent with the advocate she said smiling there is a fervency about your pleadings

the present is yours i cried but the future is mine i only lose a woman you are losing a name and a family time is big with my revenge time will spoil your beauty and yours will be a solitary death and glory waits for me

thanks for your peroration she said repressing a yawn the wish that she might never see me again was expressed in her whole bearing

that remark silenced me i flung at her a glance full of hatred and hurried away

foedora must be forgotten i must cure myself of my infatuation and betake myself once more to my lonely studies or die so i set myself tremendous tasks i determined to complete my labors for fifteen days i never left my garret spending whole nights in pallid thought i worked with difficulty and by fits and starts despite my courage and the stimulation of despair the music had fled i could not exorcise the brilliant mocking image of foedora something morbid brooded over every thought a vague longing as dreadful as remorse i imitated the anchorites of the thebaid if i did not pray as they did i lived a life in the desert like theirs hewing out my ideas as they were wont to hew their rocks i could at need have girdled my waist with spikes that physical suffering might quell mental anguish

one evening pauline found her way into my room

you are killing yourself she said imploringly you should go out and see your friends——

pauline you were a true prophet foedora is killing me i want to die my life is intolerable

is there only one woman in the world she asked smiling why make yourself so miserable in so short a life

i looked at pauline in bewilderment she left me before i noticed her departure the sound of her words had reached me but not their sense very soon i had to take my memoirs in manuscript to my literarycontractor i was so absorbed by my passion that i could not remember how i had managed to live without money i only knew that the four hundred and fifty francs due to me would pay my debts so i went to receive my salary and met rastignac who thought me changed and thinner

what hospital have you been discharged from he asked

that woman is killing me i answered i can neither despise her nor forget her

you had much better kill her then perhaps you would think no more of her he said laughing

i have often thought of it i replied but though sometimes the thought of a crime revives my spirits of violence and murder either or both i am really incapable of carrying out the design the countess is an admirable monster who would crave for pardon and not every man is an othello

she is like every woman who is beyond our reach rastignac interrupted

i am mad i cried i can feel the madness raging at times in my brain my ideas are like shadows they flit before me and i cannot grasp them death would be preferable to this life and i have carefully considered the best way of putting an end to the struggle i am not thinking of the living foedora in the faubourg saint honore but of my foedora here and i tapped my forehead what to you say to opium

pshaw horrid agonies said rastignac

or charcoal fumes

a low dodge

or the seine

the dragnets and the morgue too are filthy

a pistolshot

and if you miscalculate you disfigure yourself for life listen to me he went on like all young men i have pondered over suicide which of us hasnt killed himself two or three times before he is thirty i find there is no better course than to use existence as a means of pleasure go in for thorough dissipation and your passion or you will perish in it intemperance my dear fellow commands all forms of death does she not wield the thunderbolt of apoplexy apoplexy is a pistolshot that does not miscalculate orgies are lavish in all physical pleasures is not that the small change for opium and the riot that makes us drink to excess bears a challenge to mortal combat with wine that butt of malmsey of the duke of clarences must have had a pleasanter flavor than seine mud when we sink gloriously under the table is not that a periodical death by drowning on a small scale if we are picked up by the police and stretched out on those chilly benches of theirs at the policestation do we not enjoy all the pleasures of the morgue for though we are not blue and green muddy and swollen corpses on the other hand we have the consciousness of the climax

ah he went on this protracted suicide has nothing in common with the bankrupt grocers demise tradespeople have brought the river into disrepute they fling themselves in to soften their creditors hearts in your place i should endeavor to die gracefully and if you wish to invent a novel way of doing it by struggling with life after this manner i will be your second i am disappointed and sick of everything the alsacienne whom it was proposed that i should marry had six toes on her left foot i cannot possibly live with a woman who has six toes it would get about to a certainty and then i should be ridiculous her income was only eighteen thousand francs her fortune diminished in quantity as her toes increased the devil take it if we begin an outrageous sort of life we may come on some bit of luck perhaps

rastignacs eloquence carried me away the attractions of the plan shone too temptingly hopes were kindled the poetical aspects of the matter appealed to a poet

how about money i said

havent you four hundred and fifty francs

yes but debts to my landlady and the tailor——

you would pay your tailor you will never be anything whatever not so much as a minister

but what can one do with twenty louis

go to the gamingtable

i shuddered

you are going to launch out into what i call systematic dissipation said he noticing my scruples and yet you are afraid of a green tablecloth

listen to me i answered i promised my father never to set foot in a gaminghouse not only is that a sacred promise but i still feel an unconquerable disgust whenever i pass a gamblinghell take the money and go without me while our fortune is at stake i will set my own affairs straight and then i will go to your lodgings and wait for you

that was the way i went to perdition a young man has only to come across a woman who will not love him or a woman who loves him too well and his whole life becomes a chaos prosperity swallows up our energy just as adversity obscures our virtues back once more in my hotel de saintquentin i gazed about me a long while in the garret where i had led my scholars temperate life a life which would perhaps have been a long and honorable one and that i ought not to have quitted for the fevered existence which had urged me to the brink of a precipice pauline surprised me in this dejected attitude

why what is the matter with you she asked

i rose and quietly counted out the money owing to her mother and added to it sufficient to pay for six months rent in advance she watched me in some alarm

i am going to leave you dear pauline

i knew it she exclaimed

listen my child i have not given up the idea of coming back keep my room for me for six months if i do not return by the fifteenth of november you will come into possession of my things this sealed packet of manuscript is the fair copy of my great work on the will i went on pointing to a package will you deposit it in the kings library and you may do as you wish with everything that is left here

her look weighed heavily on my heart pauline was an embodiment of conscience there before me

i shall have no more lessons she said pointing to the piano

i did not answer that

will you write to me

goodbye pauline

i gently drew her towards me and set a kiss on that innocent fair brow of hers like snow that has not yet touched the earth—a fathers or a brothers kiss she fled i would not see madame gaudin hung my key in its wonted place and departed i was almost at the end of the rue de cluny when i heard a womans light footstep behind me

i have embroidered this purse for you pauline said will you refuse even that

by the light of the street lamp i thought i saw tears in paulines eyes and i groaned moved perhaps by a common impulse we parted in haste like people who fear the contagion of the plague

as i waited with dignified calmness for rastignacs return his room seemed a grotesque interpretation of the sort of life i was about to enter upon the clock on the chimneypiece was surmounted by a venus resting on her tortoise a halfsmoked cigar lay in her arms costly furniture of various kinds—love tokens very likely—was scattered about old shoes lay on a luxurious sofa the comfortable armchair into which i had thrown myself bore as many scars as a veteran the arms were gnashed the back was overlaid with a thick stale deposit of pomade and hairoil from the heads of all his visitors splendor and squalor were oddly mingled on the walls the bed and everywhere you might have thought of a neapolitan palace and the groups of lazzaroni about it it was the room of a gambler or a mauvais sujet where the luxury exists for one individual who leads the life of the senses and does not trouble himself over inconsistencies

there was a certain imaginative element about the picture it presented life was suddenly revealed there in its rags and spangles as the incomplete thing it really is of course but so vividly and picturesquely it was like a den where a brigand has heaped up all the plunder in which he delights some pages were missing from a copy of byrons poems they had gone to light a fire of a few sticks for this young person who played for stakes of a thousand francs and had not a faggot he kept a tilbury and had not a whole shirt to his back any day a countess or an actress or a run of luck at ecarte might set him up with an outfit worthy of a king a candle had been stuck into the green bronze sheath of a vestaholder a womans portrait lay yonder torn out of its carved gold setting how was it possible that a young man whose nature craved excitement could renounce a life so attractive by reason of its contradictions a life that afforded all the delights of war in the midst of peace i was growing drowsy when rastignac kicked the door open and shouted

victory now we can take our time about dying

he held out his hat filled with gold to me and put it down on the table then we pranced round it like a pair of cannibals about to eat a victim we stamped and danced and yelled and sang we gave each other blows fit to kill an elephant at sight of all the pleasures of the world contained in that hat

twentyseven thousand francs said rastignac adding a few banknotes to the pile of gold that would be enough for other folk to live upon will it be sufficient for us to die on yes we will breathe our last in a bath of gold—hurrah and we capered afresh

we divided the windfall we began with doublenapoleons and came down to the smaller coins one by one this for you this for me we kept saying distilling our joy drop by drop

we wont go to sleep cried rastignac joseph some punch

he threw gold to his faithful attendant

there is your share he said go and bury yourself if you can

next day i went to lesage and chose my furniture took the rooms that you know in the rue taitbout and left the decoration to one of the best upholsterers i bought horses i plunged into a vortex of pleasures at once hollow and real i went in for play gaining and losing enormous sums but only at friends houses and in ballrooms never in gaminghouses for which i still retained the holy horror of my early days without meaning it i made some friends either through quarrels or owing to the easy confidence established among those who are going to the bad together nothing possibly makes us cling to one another so tightly as our evil propensities

i made several ventures in literature which were flatteringly received great men who followed the profession of letters having nothing to fear from me belauded me not so much on account of my merits as to cast a slur on those of their rivals

i became a freeliver to make use of the picturesque expression appropriated by the language of excess i made it a point of honor not to be long about dying and that my zeal and prowess should eclipse those displayed by all others in the jolliest company i was always spruce and carefully dressed i had some reputation for cleverness there was no sign about me of the fearful way of living which makes a man into a mere disgusting apparatus a funnel a pampered beast

very soon debauch rose before me in all the majesty of its horror and i grasped all that it meant those prudent steadygoing characters who are laying down wine in bottles for their heirs can barely conceive it is true of so wide a theory of life nor appreciate its normal condition but when will you instill poetry into the provincial intellect opium and tea with all their delights are merely drugs to folk of that calibre

is not the imperfect sybarite to be met with even in paris itself that intellectual metropolis unfit to endure the fatigues of pleasure this sort of person after a drinking bout is very much like those worthy bourgeois who fall foul of music after hearing a new opera by rossini does he not renounce these courses in the same frame of mind that leads an abstemious man to forswear ruffec pates because the first one forsooth gave him the indigestion

debauch is as surely an art as poetry and is not for craven spirits to penetrate its mysteries and appreciate its charms conscientious application is required and as with every path of knowledge the way is thorny and forbidding at the outset the great pleasures of humanity are hedged about with formidable obstacles not its single enjoyments but enjoyment as a system a system which establishes seldom experienced sensations and makes them habitual which concentrates and multiplies them for us creating a dramatic life within our life and imperatively demanding a prompt and enormous expenditure of vitality war power art like debauch are all forms of demoralization equally remote from the faculties of humanity equally profound and all are alike difficult of access but when man has once stormed the heights of these grand mysteries does he not walk in another world are not generals ministers and artists carried more or less towards destruction by the need of violent distractions in an existence so remote from ordinary life as theirs

war after all is the excess of bloodshed as the excess of selfinterest produces politics excesses of every sort are brothers these social enormities possess the attraction of the abyss they draw towards themselves as st helena beckoned napoleon we are fascinated our heads swim we wish to sound their depths though we cannot account for the wish perhaps the thought of infinity dwells in these precipices perhaps they contain some colossal flattery for the soul of man for is he not then wholly absorbed in himself

the wearied artist needs a complete contrast to his paradise of imaginings and of studious hours he either craves like god the seventh day of rest or with satan the pleasures of hell so that his senses may have free play in opposition to the employment of his faculties byron could never have taken for his relaxation to the independent gentlemans delights of boston and gossip for he was a poet and so must needs pit greece against mahmoud

in war is not man an angel of extirpation a sort of executioner on a gigantic scale must not the spell be strong indeed that makes us undergo such horrid sufferings so hostile to our weak frames sufferings that encircle every strong passion with a hedge of thorns the tobacco smoker is seized with convulsions and goes through a kind of agony consequent upon his excesses but has he not borne a part in delightful festivals in realms unknown has europe ever ceased from wars she has never given herself time to wipe the stains from her feet that are steeped in blood to the ankle mankind at large is carried away by fits of intoxication as nature has its accessions of love

for men in private life for a vegetating mirabeau dreaming of storms in a time of calm excess comprises all things it perpetually embraces the whole sum of life it is something better still—it is a duel with an antagonist of unknown power a monster terrible at first sight that must be seized by the horns a labor that cannot be imagined

suppose that nature has endowed you with a feeble stomach or one of limited capacity you acquire a mastery over it and improve it you learn to carry your liquor you grow accustomed to being drunk you pass whole nights without sleep at last you acquire the constitution of a colonel of cuirassiers and in this way you create yourself afresh as if to fly in the face of providence

a man transformed after this sort is like a neophyte who has at last become a veteran has accustomed his mind to shot and shell and his legs to lengthy marches when the monsters hold on him is still uncertain and it is not yet known which will have the better of it they roll over and over alternately victor and vanquished in a world where everything is wonderful where every ache of the soul is laid to sleep where only the shadows of ideas are revived

this furious struggle has already become a necessity for us the prodigal has struck a bargain for all the enjoyments with which life teems abundantly at the price of his own death like the mythical persons in legends who sold themselves to the devil for the power of doing evil for them instead of flowing quietly on in its monotonous course in the depths of some countinghouse or study life is poured out in a boiling torrent

excess is in short for the body what the mystics ecstasy is for the soul intoxication steeps you in fantastic imaginings every whit as strange as those of ecstatics you know hours as full of rapture as a young girls dreams you travel without fatigue you chat pleasantly with your friends words come to you with a whole life in each and fresh pleasures without regrets poems are set forth for you in a few brief phrases the coarse animal satisfaction in which science has tried to find a soul is followed by the enchanted drowsiness that men sigh for under the burden of consciousness is it not because they all feel the need of absolute repose because excess is a sort of toll that genius pays to pain

look at all great men nature made them pleasureloving or base every one some mocking or jealous power corrupted them in either soul or body so as to make all their powers futile and their efforts of no avail

all men and all things appear before you in the guise you choose in those hours when wine has sway you are lord of all creation you transform it at your pleasure and throughout this unceasing delirium play may pour at your will its molten lead into your veins

some day you will fall into the monsters power then you will have as i had a frenzied awakening with impotence sitting by your pillow are you an old soldier phthisis attacks you a diplomatist an aneurism hangs death in your heart by a thread it will perhaps be consumption that will cry out to me let us be going as to raphael of urbino in old time killed by an excess of love

in this way i have existed i was launched into the world too early or too late my energy would have been dangerous there no doubt if i had not have squandered it in such ways as these was not the world rid of an alexander by the cup of hercules at the close of a drinking bout

there are some the sport of destiny who must either have heaven or hell the hospice of st bernard or riotous excess only just now i lacked the heart to moralize about those two and he pointed to euphrasia and aquilina they are types of my own personal history images of my life i could scarcely reproach them they stood before me like judges

in the midst of this drama that i was enacting and while my distracting disorder was at its height two crises supervened each brought me keen and abundant pangs the first came a few days after i had flung myself like sardanapalus on my pyre i met foedora under the peristyle of the bouffons we both were waiting for our carriages

ah so you are living yet

that was the meaning of her smile and probably of the spiteful words she murmured in the ear of her cicisbeo telling him my history no doubt rating mine as a common love affair she was deceived yet she was applauding her perspicacity oh that i should be dying for her must still adore her always see her through my potations see her still when i was overcome with wine or in the arms of courtesans and know that i was a target for her scornful jests oh that i should be unable to tear the love of her out of my breast and to fling it at her feet

well i quickly exhausted my funds but owing to those three years of discipline i enjoyed the most robust health and on the day that i found myself without a penny i felt remarkably well in order to carry on the process of dying i signed bills at short dates and the day came when they must be met painful excitements but how they quicken the pulses of youth i was not prematurely aged i was young yet and full of vigor and life

at my first debt all my virtues came to life slowly and despairingly they seemed to pace towards me but i could compound with them—they were like aged aunts that begin with a scolding and end by bestowing tears and money upon you

imagination was less yielding i saw my name bandied about through every city in europe ones name is oneself says eusebe salverte after these excursions i returned to the room i had never quitted like a doppelganger in a german tale and came to myself with a start

i used to see with indifference a bankers messenger going on his errands through the streets of paris like a commercial nemesis wearing his masters livery—a gray coat and a silver badge but now i hated the species in advance one of them came one morning to ask me to meet some eleven bills that i had scrawled my name upon my signature was worth three thousand francs taking me altogether i myself was not worth that amount sheriffs deputies rose up before me turning their callous faces upon my despair as the hangman regards the criminal to whom he says it has just struck halfpast three i was in the power of their clerks they could scribble my name drag it through the mire and jeer at it i was a defaulter has a debtor any right to himself could not other men call me to account for my way of living why had i eaten puddings a la chipolata why had i iced my wine why had i slept or walked or thought or amused myself when i had not paid them

at any moment in the middle of a poem during some train of thought or while i was gaily breakfasting in the pleasant company of my friends i might look to see a gentleman enter in a coat of chestnutbrown with a shabby hat in his hand this gentlemans appearance would signify my debt the bill i had drawn the spectre would compel me to leave the table to speak to him blight my spirits despoil me of my cheerfulness of my mistress of all i possessed down to my very bedstead

remorse itself is more easily endured remorse does not drive us into the street nor into the prison of saintepelagie it does not force us into the detestable sink of vice remorse only brings us to the scaffold where the executioner invests us with a certain dignity as we pay the extreme penalty everybody believes in our innocence but people will not credit a penniless prodigal with a single virtue

my debts had other incarnations there is the kind that goes about on two feet in a green cloth coat and blue spectacles carrying umbrellas of various hues you come face to face with him at the corner of some street in the midst of your mirth these have the detestable prerogative of saying m de valentin owes me something and does not pay i have a hold on him he had better not show me any offensive airs you must bow to your creditors and moreover bow politely when are you going to pay me say they and you must lie and beg money of another man and cringe to a fool seated on his strongbox and receive sour looks in return from these horseleeches a blow would be less hateful you must put up with their crass ignorance and calculating morality a debt is a feat of the imaginative that they cannot appreciate a borrower is often carried away and overmastered by generous impulses nothing great nothing magnanimous can move or dominate those who live for money and recognize nothing but money i myself held money in abhorrence

or a bill may undergo a final transformation into some meritorious old man with a family dependent upon him my creditor might be a living picture for greuze a paralytic with his children round him a soldiers widow holding out beseeching hands to me terrible creditors are these with whom we are forced to sympathize and when their claims are satisfied we owe them a further debt of assistance

the night before the bills fell due i lay down with the false calm of those who sleep before their approaching execution or with a duel in prospect rocked as they are by delusive hopes but when i woke when i was cool and collected when i found myself imprisoned in a bankers portfolio and floundering in statements covered with red ink—then my debts sprang up everywhere like grasshoppers before my eyes there were my debts my clock my armchairs my debts were inlaid in the very furniture which i liked best to use these gentle inanimate slaves were to fall prey to the harpies of the chatelet were to be carried off by the brokers men and brutally thrown on the market ah my property was a part of myself

the sound of the doorbell rang through my heart while it seemed to strike at me where kings should be struck at—in the head mine was a martyrdom without heaven for its reward for a magnanimous nature debt is a hell and a hell moreover with sheriffs officers and brokers in it an undischarged debt is something mean and sordid it is a beginning of knavery it is something worse it is a lie it prepares the way for crime and brings together the planks for the scaffold my bills were protested three days afterwards i met them and this is how it happened

a speculator came offering to buy the island in the loire belonging to me where my mother lay buried i closed with him when i went to his solicitor to sign the deeds i felt a cavernlike chill in the dark office that made me shudder it was the same cold dampness that had laid hold upon me at the brink of my fathers grave i looked upon this as an evil omen i seemed to see the shade of my mother and to hear her voice what power was it that made my own name ring vaguely in my ears in spite of the clamor of bells

the money paid down for my island when all my debts were discharged left me in possession of two thousand francs i could now have returned to the scholars tranquil life it is true i could have gone back to my garret after having gained an experience of life with my head filled with the results of extensive observation and with a certain sort of reputation attaching to me but foedoras hold upon her victim was not relaxed we often met i compelled her admirers to sound my name in her ears by dint of astonishing them with my cleverness and success with my horses and equipages it all found her impassive and uninterested so did an ugly phrase of rastignacs he is killing himself for you

i charged the world at large with my revenge but i was not happy while i was fathoming the miry depths of life i only recognized the more keenly at all times the happiness of reciprocal affection it was a shadow that i followed through all that befell me in my extravagance and in my wildest moments it was my misfortune to be deceived in my fairest beliefs to be punished by ingratitude for benefiting others and to receive uncounted pleasures as the reward of my errors—a sinister doctrine but a true one for the prodigal

the contagious leprosy of foedoras vanity had taken hold of me at last i probed my soul and found it cankered and rotten i bore the marks of the devils claw upon my forehead it was impossible to me thenceforward to do without the incessant agitation of a life fraught with danger at every moment or to dispense with the execrable refinements of luxury if i had possessed millions i should still have gambled reveled and racketed about i wished never to be alone with myself and i must have false friends and courtesans wine and good cheer to distract me the ties that attach a man to family life had been permanently broken for me i had become a galleyslave of pleasure and must accomplish my destiny of suicide during the last days of my prosperity i spent every night in the most incredible excesses but every morning death cast me back upon life again i would have taken a conflagration with as little concern as any man with a life annuity however i at last found myself alone with a twentyfranc piece i bethought me then of rastignacs luck——

eh eh—— raphael exclaimed interrupting himself as he remembered the talisman and drew it from his pocket perhaps he was wearied by the long days strain and had no more strength left wherewith to pilot his head through the seas of wine and punch or perhaps exasperated by this symbol of his own existence the torrent of his own eloquence gradually overwhelmed him raphael became excited and elated and like one completely deprived of reason

the devil take death he shouted brandishing the skin i mean to live i am rich i have every virtue nothing will withstand me who would not be generous when everything is in his power aha aha i wished for two hundred thousand livres a year and i shall have them bow down before me all of you wallowing on the carpets like swine in the mire you all belong to me—a precious property truly i am rich i could buy you all even the deputy snoring over there scum of society give me your benediction i am the pope

raphaels vociferations had been hitherto drowned by a thoroughbass of snores but now they became suddenly audible most of the sleepers started up with a cry saw the cause of the disturbance on his feet tottering uncertainly and cursed him in concert for a drunken brawler

silence shouted raphael back to your kennels you dogs emile i have riches i will give you havana cigars

i am listening the poet replied death or foedora on with you that silky foedora deceived you women are all daughters of eve there is nothing dramatic about that rigmarole of yours

ah but you were sleeping slyboots

no—death or foedora—i have it

wake up raphael shouted beating emile with the piece of shagreen as if he meant to draw electric fluid out of it

tonnerre said emile springing up and flinging his arms round raphael my friend remember the sort of women you are with

i am a millionaire

if you are not a millionaire you are most certainly drunk

drunk with power i can kill you—silence i am nero i am nebuchadnezzar

but raphael we are in queer company and you ought to keep quiet for the sake of your own dignity

my life has been silent too long i mean to have my revenge now on the world at large i will not amuse myself by squandering paltry fivefranc pieces i will reproduce and sum up my epoch by absorbing human lives human minds and human souls there are the treasures of pestilence—that is no paltry kind of wealth is it i will wrestle with fevers—yellow blue or green—with whole armies with gibbets i can possess foedora—yet no i do not want foedora she is a disease i am dying of foedora i want to forget foedora

if you keep on calling out like this i shall take you into the diningroom

do you see this skin it is solomons will solomon belongs to me—a little varlet of a king arabia is mine arabia petraea to boot and the universe and you too if i choose if i choose—ah be careful i can buy up all our journalists shop you shall be my valet you shall be my valet you shall manage my newspaper valet valet that is to say free from aches and pains because he has no brains

at the word emile carried raphael off into the diningroom

all right he remarked yes my friend i am your valet but you are about to be editorinchief of a newspaper so be quiet and behave properly for my sake have you no regard for me

regard for you you shall have havana cigars with this bit of shagreen always with this skin this supreme bit of shagreen it is a cure for corns and efficacious remedy do you suffer i will remove them

never have i known you so senseless——

senseless my friend not at all this skin contracts whenever i form a wish—tis a paradox there is a brahmin underneath it the brahmin must be a droll fellow for our desires look you are bound to expand——

yes yes——

i tell you——

yes yes very true i am quite of your opinion—our desires expand——

the skin i tell you

yes

you dont believe me i know you my friend you are as full of lies as a newmade king

how can you expect me to follow your drunken maunderings

i will bet you i can prove it let us measure it——

goodness he will never get off to sleep exclaimed emile as he watched raphael rummaging busily in the diningroom

thanks to the peculiar clearness with which external objects are sometimes projected on an inebriated brain in sharp contrast to its own obscure imaginings valentin found an inkstand and a tablenapkin with the quickness of a monkey repeating all the time

let us measure it let us measure it

all right said emile let us measure it

the two friends spread out the tablenapkin and laid the magic skin upon it as emiles hand appeared to be steadier than raphaels he drew a line with pen and ink round the talisman while his friend said

i wished for an income of two hundred thousand livres didnt i well when that comes you will observe a mighty diminution of my chagrin

yes—now go to sleep shall i make you comfortable on that sofa now then are you all right

yes my nursling of the press you shall amuse me you shall drive the flies away from me the friend of adversity should be the friend of prosperity so i will give you some hava—na—cig——

come now sleep sleep off your gold you millionaire

you sleep off your paragraphs goodnight say goodnight to nebuchadnezzar—love wine france—glory and tr—treas——

very soon the snorings of the two friends were added to the music with which the rooms resounded—an ineffectual concert the lights went out one by one their crystal sconces cracking in the final flare night threw dark shadows over this prolonged revelry in which raphaels narrative had been a second orgy of speech of words without ideas of ideas for which words had often been lacking

towards noon next day the fair aquilina bestirred herself she yawned wearily she had slept with her head upon a painted velvet footstool and her cheeks were mottled over by contact with the surface her movement awoke euphrasia who suddenly sprang up with a hoarse cry her pretty face that had been so fresh and fair in the evening was sallow now and pallid she looked like a candidate for the hospital the rest awoke also by degrees with portentous groanings to feel themselves over in every stiffened limb and to experience the infinite varieties of weariness that weighed upon them

a servant came in to throw back the shutters and open the windows there they all stood brought back to consciousness by the warm rays of sunlight that shone upon the sleepers heads their movements during slumber had disordered the elaborately arranged hair and toilettes of the women they presented a ghastly spectacle in the bright daylight their hair fell ungracefully about them their eyes lately so brilliant were heavy and dim the expression of their faces was entirely changed the sickly hues which daylight brings out so strongly were frightful an olive tint had crept over the lymphatic faces so fair and soft when in repose the dainty red lips were grown pale and dry and bore tokens of the degradation of excess each disowned his mistress of the night before the women looked wan and discolored like flowers trampled under foot by a passing procession

the men who scorned them looked even more horrible those human faces would have made you shudder the hollow eyes with the dark circles round them seemed to see nothing they were dull with wine and stupefied with heavy slumbers that had been exhausting rather than refreshing there was an indescribable ferocious and stolid bestiality about these haggard faces where bare physical appetite appeared shorn of all the poetical illusion with which the intellect invests it even these fearless champions accustomed to measure themselves with excess were struck with horror at this awakening of vice stripped of its disguises at being confronted thus with sin the skeleton in rags lifeless and hollow bereft of the sophistries of the intellect and the enchantments of luxury artists and courtesans scrutinized in silence and with haggard glances the surrounding disorder the rooms where everything had been laid waste at the havoc wrought by heated passions

demoniac laughter broke out when taillefer catching the smothered murmurs of his guests tried to greet them with a grin his darkly flushed perspiring countenance loomed upon this pandemonium like the image of a crime that knows no remorse see lauberge rouge the picture was complete a picture of a foul life in the midst of luxury a hideous mixture of the pomp and squalor of humanity an awakening after the frenzy of debauch has crushed and squeezed all the fruits of life in her strong hands till nothing but unsightly refuse is left to her and lies in which she believes no longer you might have thought of death gloating over a family stricken with the plague

the sweet scents and dazzling lights the mirth and the excitement were all no more disgust with its nauseous sensations and searching philosophy was there instead the sun shone in like truth the pure outer air was like virtue in contrast with the heated atmosphere heavy with the fumes of the previous night of revelry

accustomed as they were to their life many of the girls thought of other days and other wakings pure and innocent days when they looked out and saw the roses and honeysuckle about the casement and the fresh countryside without enraptured by the glad music of the skylark while earth lay in mists lighted by the dawn and in all the glittering radiance of dew others imagined the family breakfast the father and children round the table the innocent laughter the unspeakable charm that pervaded it all the simple hearts and their meal as simple

an artist mused upon his quiet studio on his statue in its severe beauty and the graceful model who was waiting for him a young man recollected a lawsuit on which the fortunes of a family hung and an important transaction that needed his presence the scholar regretted his study and that noble work that called for him emile appeared just then as smiling blooming and fresh as the smartest assistant in a fashionable shop

you are all as ugly as bailiffs you wont be fit for anything today so this day is lost and i vote for breakfast

at this taillefer went out to give some orders the women went languidly up to the mirrors to set their toilettes in order each one shook herself the wilder sort lectured the steadier ones the courtesans made fun of those who looked unable to continue the boisterous festivity but these wan forms revived all at once stood in groups and talked and smiled some servants quickly and adroitly set the furniture and everything else in its place and a magnificent breakfast was got ready

the guests hurried into the diningroom everything there bore indelible marks of yesterdays excess it is true but there were at any rate some traces of ordinary rational existence such traces as may be found in a sick mans dying struggles and so the revelry was laid away and buried like carnival of a shrove tuesday by masks wearied out with dancing drunk with drunkenness and quite ready to be persuaded of the pleasures of lassitude lest they should be forced to admit their exhaustion

as soon as these bold spirits surrounded the capitalists breakfasttable cardot appeared he had left the rest to make a night of it after the dinner and finished the evening after his own fashion in the retirement of domestic life just now a sweet smile wandered over his features he seemed to have a presentiment that there would be some inheritance to sample and divide involving inventories and engrossing an inheritance rich in fees and deeds to draw up and something as juicy as the trembling fillet of beef in which their host had just plunged his knife

oh ho we are to have breakfast in the presence of a notary cried cursy

you have come here just at the right time said the banker indicating the breakfast you can jot down the numbers and initial off all the dishes

there is no will to make here but contracts of marriage there may be perhaps said the scholar who had made a satisfactory arrangement for the first time in twelve months

oh oh

ah ah

one moment cried cardot fairly deafened by a chorus of wretched jokes i came here on serious business i am bringing six millions for one of you dead silence monsieur he went on turning to raphael who at the moment was unceremoniously wiping his eyes on a corner of the tablenapkin was not your mother a mlle oflaharty

yes said raphael mechanically enough barbara marie

have you your certificate of birth about you cardot went on and mme de valentins as well

i believe so

very well then monsieur you are the sole heir of major oflaharty who died in august 1828 at calcutta

an incalcuttable fortune said the critic

the major having bequeathed several amounts to public institutions in his will the french government sent in a claim for the remainder to the east india company the notary continued the estate is clear and ready to be transferred at this moment i have been looking in vain for the heirs and assigns of mlle barbara marie oflaharty for a fortnight past when yesterday at dinner——

just then raphael suddenly staggered to his feet he looked like a man who has just received a blow acclamation took the form of silence for stifled envy had been the first feeling in every breast and all eyes devoured him like flames then a murmur rose and grew like the voice of a discontented audience or the first mutterings of a riot as everybody made some comment on this news of great wealth brought by the notary

this abrupt subservience of fate brought raphael thoroughly to his senses he immediately spread out the tablenapkin with which he had lately taken the measure of the piece of shagreen he heeded nothing as he laid the talisman upon it and shuddered involuntarily at the sight of a slight difference between the present size of the skin and the outline traced upon the linen

why what is the matter with him taillefer cried he comes by his fortune very cheaply

soutiensle chatillon said bixiou to emile the joy will kill him

a ghastly white hue overspread every line of the wan features of the heiratlaw his face was drawn every outline grew haggard the hollows in his livid countenance grew deeper and his eyes were fixed and staring he was facing death

the opulent banker surrounded by faded women and faces with satiety written on them the enjoyment that had reached the pitch of agony was a living illustration of his own life

raphael looked thrice at the talisman which lay passively within the merciless outlines on the tablenapkin he tried not to believe it but his incredulity vanished utterly before the light of an inner presentiment the whole world was his he could have all things but the will to possess them was utterly extinct like a traveler in the midst of the desert with but a little water left to quench his thirst he must measure his life by the draughts he took of it he saw what every desire of his must cost him in the days of his life he believed in the powers of the magic skin at last he listened to every breath he drew he felt ill already he asked himself

am i not consumptive did not my mother die of a lung complaint

aha raphael what fun you will have what will you give me asked aquilina

heres to the death of his uncle major oflaharty there is a man for you

he will be a peer of france

pooh what is a peer of france since july said the amateur critic

are you going to take a box at the bouffons

you are going to treat us all i hope put in bixiou

a man of his sort will be sure to do things in style said emile

the hurrah set up by the jovial assembly rang in valentins ears but he could not grasp the sense of a single word vague thoughts crossed him of the breton peasants life of mechanical labor without a wish of any kind he pictured him burdened with a family tilling the soil living on buckwheat meal drinking cider out of a pitcher believing in the virgin and the king taking the sacrament at easter dancing of a sunday on the green sward and understanding never a word of the rectors sermon the actual scene that lay before him the gilded furniture the courtesans the feast itself and the surrounding splendors seemed to catch him by the throat and made him cough

do you wish for some asparagus the banker cried

i wish for nothing thundered raphael

bravo taillefer exclaimed you understand your position a fortune confers the privilege of being impertinent you are one of us gentlemen let us drink to the might of gold m valentin here six times a millionaire has become a power he is a king like all the rich everything is at his disposal everything lies under his feet from this time forth the axiom that all frenchmen are alike in the eyes of the law is for him a fib at the head of the constitutional charter he is not going to obey the law—the law is going to obey him there are neither scaffolds nor executioners for millionaires

yes there are said raphael they are their own executioners

here is another victim of prejudices cried the banker

let us drink raphael said putting the talisman into his pocket

what are you doing said emile checking his movement gentlemen he added addressing the company who were rather taken aback by raphaels behavior you must know that our friend valentin here—what am i saying—i mean my lord marquis de valentin—is in the possession of a secret for obtaining wealth his wishes are fulfilled as soon as he knows them he will make us all rich together or he is a flunkey and devoid of all decent feeling

oh raphael dear i should like a set of pearl ornaments euphrasia exclaimed

if he has any gratitude in him he will give me a couple of carriages with fast steppers said aquilina

wish for a hundred thousand a year for me

indian shawls

pay my debts

send an apoplexy to my uncle the old stick

ten thousand a year in the funds and ill cry quits with you raphael

deeds of gift and no mistake was the notarys comment

he ought at least to rid me of the gout

lower the funds shouted the banker

these phrases flew about like the last discharge of rockets at the end of a display of fireworks and were uttered perhaps more in earnest than in jest

my good friend emile said solemnly i shall be quite satisfied with an income of two hundred thousand livres please to set about it at once

do you not know the cost emile asked raphael

a nice excuse the poet cried ought we not to sacrifice ourselves for our friends

i have almost a mind to wish that you all were dead valentin made answer with a dark inscrutable look at his boon companions

dying people are frightfully cruel said emile laughing you are rich now he went on gravely very well i will give you two months at most before you grow vilely selfish you are so dense already that you cannot understand a joke you have only to go a little further to believe in your magic skin

raphael kept silent fearing the banter of the company but he drank immoderately trying to drown in intoxication the recollection of his fatal power1embed"
