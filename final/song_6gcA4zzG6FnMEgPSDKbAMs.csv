feeling the reminisce
gone in an instance
blink of an eye
no goodbye
i had a notion
deep as the ocean
blue like the sky
oh my

prechorus
like a permanent stain
wishing i could just wash away away
hate our love was in vein
but were the blame
for all the pain
for all the pain

chorus
if i would have known
if i would have known
if i would have known
it could have been you
woah woah woah
if i had the chance
if i had the chance
id make us brand new
i never wanted to be
wanted to be
your enemy no no
but if i
if i would have known
if i would have known
it could have been you
been you

there repercussion
of missing your loving
haunts me at night
the ghosts are alive
all of the memories
of serenity
dwindle in my mind
all the time

prechorus
like a permanent stain
wishing i could just wash away away
hate our love was in vein
who was to blame
for all the pain
for all the pain

chorus
if i would have known
if i would have known
if i would have known
it could have been you
if i had a chance
if i had a chance
id make us brand new
i never wanted to be
wanted to be
your enemy no no
but if i
if i would have known
if i would have known
it could have been you
been you

chorus
if i would have known
if i would have known
if i would have known
it could have been you
if i had a chance
if i had a chance
id make us brand new
i never wanted to be
wanted to be
your enemy no no
but if i
