when i think about my life i
wonder if i will survive to
live to see 25 or will i just fall
like all my friends they just keep dyin
people round me always cryin
in this place that i like to call my home

prechorus
but not everybody knows that
everybody goes to a better place
and not everybody knows that
everybody could be living their last days
but the hard times will come
and well keep moving on were moving on

chorus
keep moving on life hope truth trust
and on and on faith pride love lust
keep moving on on without the things weve lost
and on and on the things weve gained well take with us

verse 2
and alls ive got are these two hands to
make myself a better man i
wonder if ill ever see the end of this
with all this rain it just keeps falling
on my head and now im calling
out to someone else to help me make it through
