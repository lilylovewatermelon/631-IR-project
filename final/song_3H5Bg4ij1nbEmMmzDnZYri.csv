your boyfriends in the bathroom and im holdin your hand
i wonder if he notices the things that i can
you dont even get it no you dont understand
i want you but i know im only one of your friends
i know all about you all your favorite things
i listen to your stories all your wildest dreams
and you go on for hours say hes not what you need
you know youre too good for him but if it were me

prechorus
id give you everything hmm

chorus
