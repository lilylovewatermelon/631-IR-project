just below the crowded avenue
watchin red lights fading out of view

oh the air feels heavy
everything just passes by
and i think that im a little shy

meet me outside above ground
i see you on your way
ill be with you someday someday

drawing lines above my head
but the fan keeps spinning over me
just my thoughts to keep me company

now i know im ready
pour the night into a glass
can i sip it slow and make it last

meet me outside above ground
i see you on your way
ill be with you someday someday

meet me outside above ground
i see you on your way
ill be with you someday
ill be with you someday
ill be with you someday
ill be with you somedaysee norah jones liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeembed"
