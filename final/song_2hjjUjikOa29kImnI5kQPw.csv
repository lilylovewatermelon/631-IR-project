knockknock mothafucks its me mr clusterfuck
what when where how like who gives a fuck
golf wang mob mopping niggas ante up
aint been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my granny up
rest in peace or lie in it life aint got no light in it
darker than that closet that nigga frankie was hiding in
open it dope in it bobby wheres my fucking pipe
dress my little dick as ike twenty says i hit your wife
this is life truthfully i just want to fly some kites
grab salem and slater and go around riding bikes
get some ice cream golf wang roscoes for the night
to skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise
nigga fuck it though going hard as riga mo
got a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows
cracked a couple kids in the head with this cast
had a blast out in europe had a swedish bitch licking toes
thats how it goes designing clothes
cats on everything cats on everything
you think all this money will make a happy me
but im bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat
everybodys sparking but me and i keep coughing
cant keep calm in this spots hot box and im getting nauseous
hop in the car ride to saugus and head straight to the office
pissed off at jasper because thats some faggot shit called pink dolphin
i roll here on a mean unicorn
green hat vans golf top is the team uniform
downing that capri sun tighten my bandana up
something like a lez im forgetting my damn manners cause
see tyler the creator liveget tickets as low as 425you might also likechorus
i am the cowboy on my own trip
and i am the cowboy on my own trip
and i am the cowboy on my own trip
and i am the cowboy

verse 2
when youre alone thoughts start coming in
punching in that dark lock box and they start rummaging
shit youve got to battle with wishing they could skedaddle
but it makes your shadow say none fun and grab the gun again
i needed to get out of the house
so i hit the dead sams and we went biking it out
in a black hoodie with an arizona and a bag of skittles
just to see what all that fucking hype is about rip
now everytime you see a roach you think of me ayy
cause everytime i see one i think what his parents would say
in court saying i ate him i wasnt present that day
i was with whitney smoking sitting at the dock of the bay

chorus
i am the cowboy on my own trip
and i am the cowboy on my own trip
and i am the cowboy on my own trip
and i am the cowboy
verse 3
do you know how weird it is knowing i make a bunch of cheese
while my friends cant afford little pizzas from little caesars
and their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls
so i dont feel bad when they not eating
but you still treating us you punk bitch
wolf haley got more methods than pinkman
im never civil fuck lincoln preme out the bag its no wrinkles
im okie dokie and loopy and booboo nana and caca
if you think im fucking kookoo try talking to my shrink then
