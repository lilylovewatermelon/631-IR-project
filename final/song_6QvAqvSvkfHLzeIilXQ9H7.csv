said im pulling down the shades for the long ride
i never knew that i could feel so black and blue
ive been holding onto something now for sometime
all i know is its a feeling fit for two
cause when the sunlight laid its head down on this dark night
and i was talking to myself in the rear view
yeah ive got questions but i know everything is alright
all i have to do is just remember you

prechorus 1
cause im never gonna lose you
ive got you deep inside my chest
and i can feel you beating like the soul of a drummer boy

chorus
weve gotta keep going
keep going
keep going
keep going
dont care what anybody say
let the law take us away
weve gotta keep going
keep going
keep going
keep going
dont care what anybody say
nah nah nah nah

ive been fake and ive been free
ive been you and ive been me
but now i stand up tall for what i believe
against all odds i walked that trail of fear
and tread on desperate leaves
but no ones leaving just yet
we all want that make believe

prechorus 2
tried and true tribulations
of who ive come to be
the less i know the more i learn
how much love means to me
every day im walking out the front door
leaning on your ghost
the best feeling of the day is one that i lean toward most

chorus
weve gotta keep going
keep going
keep going
keep going
dont care what anybody say
let the law take us away
weve gotta keep going
keep going
keep going
keep going
dont care what anybody say
