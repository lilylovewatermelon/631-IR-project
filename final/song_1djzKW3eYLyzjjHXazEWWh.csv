i still watch you when youre groovin
as if through water from the bottom of a pool
youre movin without movin
and when you move im moved
you are a call to motion
there all of you a verb in perfect view
like jonah on the ocean
when you move im moved

prechorus
when you move
im put to mind of all that i wanna be
when you move
i could never define all that you are to me

chorus
so move me baby
shake like the bough of a willow tree
you do it naturally
move me baby

verse 2
you are the rite of movement
its reasonin made lucid and cool
and though its no improvement
when you move i move
youre less polunin leapin
or fred astaire in sequins
honey you youre atlas in his sleepin
and when you move im moved
see hozier liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likeprechorus
when you move
i can recall somethin thats gone from me
when you move
honey im put in awe of somethin so flawed and free

chorus
so move me baby
shake like the bough of a willow tree
you do it naturally
move me baby
so move me baby
like youve nothin left to prove
and nothin to lose
move me baby

bridge
ooh ooh ooh
oh baby oh baby
move like grey skies
move like a bird of paradise
move like an odd sight come out at night

chorus
move me baby
shake like the bough of a willow tree
you do it naturally
move me baby
so move me baby
like youve nothin left to lose
and nothin to prove
move me baby
so move me baby
shake like the bough of a willow tree
you do it naturally
move me baby36embed"
