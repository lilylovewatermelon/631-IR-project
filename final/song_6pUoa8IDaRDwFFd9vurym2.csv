i changed my life so i can be with you
but you turned and walked away
tell me what to do
i changed my life so i can be with you
but you turned and walked away
tell me what to do
somehow i know you still believe
somehow i know you still believe

first verse
you interrupted my bliss
fuck this im sorry
it used to be steak and fish calamari
but now all you do is drink and party
girl you aint the greatest the greatest was ali
in the words of the late great bob marley
no woman no cry yes suh i do believe
i count my blessing every time i see my loved ones
wondering why i be stressing over a silly woman
boy get your head straight boy get your head right
keep on buzzin with your cousin
boy have a good time
sometime i know its right sometimes i know its wrong
sometimes i do it big sometimes im all alone
