verse 1
oh i didnt ask to go with you to mexico
i really didnt need the shopping spree in la or melrose
boy if you didnt know it well now you know
i didnt need the furs or the jewelry
because material things it dont mean much to me
and ever since youve been gone
ive been holdin us down on my own and no

prechorus
i never ever cheated i never ever lied
so you can stop askin askin me why
why i never left you and why i kept it real
and why im still with you

chorus
you shouldve known better than to think i would leave
you shouldve known better than to doubt me me
it dont matter if youre up matter if youre down
either way im gonna be around
you shouldve known that i would stay by your side side
shouldve known your girl was gonna ride or die
and it just dont matter
if youre rich or poor out or in doin five to ten
you shouldve known better
