oh i know how to levitate up off my feet
and ever since the seventh grade i learned to firebreathe
and though i feed on things that fell
you can learn to levitate with just a little help
learn to levitate with just a little help

bridge
come down come down
cowards only come through when the hours late
and everyones asleep mind you
now show up show up
i know i shouldnt say this
but a curse from you is all that i would need right now man
come down come down
cowards only come through when the hours late
and everyones asleep mind you
now show up show up
i know i shouldnt say this
but a curse from you is all that i would need right now man

verse
danger in the fabric of this thing i made
i probably shouldnt show you but its way too late
my heart is with you hiding but my minds not made
now they know it like we both knew for some time id say
theyre smirking at fresh blood theyre circling above
but this is not enough yeah this is not what you thought
no no we are not just graffiti on a passing train
i got back what i once bought back
in that slot i wont need to replace
this culture is a poacher of overexposure not today
dont feed me to the vultures i am a vulture who feeds on pain
sleep in a welllit room dont let the shadow through
and sever all i knew yeah sever all
i thought i could depend on my weekends
on the freezing ground that im sleeping on
please keep me from please keep me down from the ledges
better test it wooden wedges under doorways
keep your wooden wedges under doors
chorus verse chorus verse now here comes the eight
wait habits here too you’re the worst your structure compensates
but compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two
at least they all know all they hear comes from a place
you might also likechorus
oh i know how to levitate up off my feet
and ever since the seventh grade i learned to firebreathe
and though i feed on things that fell
you can learn to levitate with just a little help
you can levitate with just a little help
