i was hella broke then i aint have a dime
but i was always focused i aint waste no time
i aint have a car in my name i used to walk to work every day
me and my dawg like it or not i came out alright

prechorus
all the homies we came up the same way
and i swear aint nothing change
got a little bit of change in my pocket but i maintain
we were young and in this world chasin dreams and girls
runnin from our problems
i know that we older now but thats what we were all about

chorus
i remember we were young young and dumb
just some niggas in a rush to grow up
i remember we were young young and dumb
it was gang over love that was us

verse 2
i remember we would cut class my teachers used to hate me
the only reason that i did that was to keep from goin crazy
i didnt give a damn bout my grades thats probably why we failed the ninth grade
me and my dawg like it or not we came out okay
