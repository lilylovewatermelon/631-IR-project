we saw the western coast
i saw the hospital
and nursed the shoreline like a wound
reports of lovers trysts
were neither clear nor descript
we kept it safe and slow
the quiet things that no one ever knows

chorus jesse lacey  vincent accardi
so keep the blood in your head
and keep your feet on the ground
todays the day we get tired
todays the day we dropped out
gave up my body and bed
all for an empty hotel
wasting words on lowercases and capitals
so keep the blood in your head
and keep your feet on the ground
todays the day we get tired
todays the day we dropped out
gave up my body and bed
all for an empty hotel
wasting words on lowercases and capitals

verse 2 jesse lacey
i contemplate the day we wed
your friends are boring me to death
your veil is ruined in the rain
by then its you i can do without
theres nothing new to talk about
and though our kids are blessed
their parents let them shoulder all the blame
you might also likechorus jesse lacey  vincent accardi
so keep the blood in your head
and keep your feet on the ground
todays the day we get tired
todays the day we dropped out
gave up my body and bed
all for an empty hotel
wasting words on lowercases and capitals
so keep the blood in your head
and keep your feet on the ground
todays the day we get tired
todays the day we dropped out
gave up my body and bed
all for an empty hotel
wasting words on lowercases and capitals

bridge jesse lacey
i lie for only you
and i lie well
halleluh
i lie for only you
and i lie well
halleluh

chorus jesse lacey  vincent accardi
so keep the blood in your head
and keep your feet on the ground
todays the day we get tired
todays the day we dropped out
gave up my body and bed
all for an empty hotel
wasting words on lowercases and capitals
so keep the blood in your head
and keep your feet on the ground
todays the day we get tired
todays the day we dropped out
gave up my body and bed
all for an empty hotel
wasting words on lowercases and capitals19embed"
