chorus lil cut throat
pussy pussyboy back up off me fore you bleed
pussy pussyboy back up off me fore you bleed
back up off me fore you bleed

verse 1 lil cut throat
i got gorillas that surround me bitch im caesar
they know what im bout that boy out the south
forever im grieving
pussy pussyboy back up off me fore you bleed
we them crooks bitch im takin what im needing
rule number one im never shitting where im sleeping
think you the one but im the one that they call jesus
made masterpieces left the country stamped some visas
this now my kingdom put my flag up then im leavin
rest in pieces

chorus lil oozing
fuckboy pull up fuckboy pull up
fuckboy pull up fuckboy pull up

verse 2 lil oozing
fuckboy pull up with a pistol gripped ayy
hold up lil bitch what the fuck you think this is ayy
this aint a game we aint playin this is pit
those fangs in your throat range boy get a grip
shadow expanding without a cloud in the sky
a black spot where the sun once was
its that fullmooned bulletproof goon
looming in a tomb chewin up someones buzz
never releasin the doves keep em locked up and let em rot
let the whole flock gather in a spot
theres a hole marked rather end a plot flooded with bugs
the blood that floods us pools at the root of the cropsee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like30embed"
