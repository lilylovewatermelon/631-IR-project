so up rolls a riot van and sparks excitement in the boys
but the policemen look annoyed
perhaps these are ones they should avoid

verse 1
got a chase last night from men with truncheons dressed in hats
we didnt do that much wrong still ran away though for the laugh
just for the laugh
and please just stop talkin cause they wont find us if you do
oh those silly boys in blue
well they wont catch me and you

verse 2
have you been drinking son you dont look old enough to me
im sorry officer is there a certain age youre supposed to be
cause nobody told me
and up rolls the riot van and these lads just wind the coppers up
they ask why they dont catch proper crooks
they get their address and their names took
but they couldnt care less

outro
thrown in the riot van and all the coppers kicked him in
and there was no way he could win
just had to take it on the chinyou might also like44embed"
