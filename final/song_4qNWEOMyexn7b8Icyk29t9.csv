i trust that everyone is enjoying the music
as the title of the album suggests
this was meant for your listening pleasure
while you are being done in

verse 1
call this evil intent like me in a limo yeah
like the shade in these windows
smoke gray ladies go mental
but no way they can see in though nah
oj blade is a pencil yeah
propane tank in my cranium
codename titanium temple
i almost swallowed my car
i call my mercedes a benzo
bitch i ball like a baby
ball like j but not jay as in
jayz j as in leno
cause i got a huge mansion
no huge man chin new manson loose cannon
too scandalous sue atkins
the kinda crazy you can’t fix
im still the one that your parents hate
im in your house eating carrot cake
while i sit there and wait and i marinate
i’m irritated you bout to meet a scary fate
and come home to find yourself starin straight into a fuckin barrel like sharon tate
dres on concerto while i narrate
yeah you be on the straight and narrow like a fuckin arrow shape
i be on a higher plane in aerospace
with so much legroom and air space on this airplane
unlike you cause youre on a flight too but it’s a staircase

i have the right to remain violent

icicle veins micsll get slain
like they were strangled with bicycle chains
you’re gonna have to come identify the remains
