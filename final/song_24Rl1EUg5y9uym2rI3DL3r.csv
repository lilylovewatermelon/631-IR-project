dont wanna wait til the morning
dont wanna wait til the morning comes
you know the bigger picture changes when your colors run
i got my hand in my pocket
and theres a diamond at my fingertips
dont wanna wait til the morning
you and i we live for this

prechorus
i rip holes in my shirt
theres mud on my shoes
theres sun on my skin
i am brandnew
we shout at the cops
we howl at the moon
just a matter of time
dontcha get it

chorus
we are the kids that you never can kill
you never can kill you never can kill
you say that we wont but you know that we will
you know that we will keep on

verse 2
dont wanna wait for permission
we got our own fresh set of rules
we take that old school fashion shape it into something new
you got your hand in my pocket
you like to dance with my fingertips
dont gotta wait for permission
you and i we live for this
