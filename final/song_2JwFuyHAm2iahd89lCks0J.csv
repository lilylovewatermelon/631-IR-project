sometimes existential dread
comes ringin through loud and clear
ill adjust and simply let go
i guess it is what it is is
im not sure of whats coming next
but ill be alright as long as i keep breathin
i know ill be alright
i know ill be alrightsee thundercat liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeembed"
