all i really know is that i felt ok
when i met you in april
you were looking like may
i know you like to run girl
so go on set the pace
the liquor never tastes good
but i dont need to chase

prechorus nick jonas
take another hit
just fake it til you feel it
open up and let me in
i just wanna feel you

chorus nick jonas
closer closer
close enough to feel this moment

verse 2 nick jonas
like the sun in december
or a lemonade in june
i know what you want girl
cause i want it too
have you ever noticed
that i cant see straight
cause im hooked on your body
got me glued to your waist

she would and she would and she probably would too yup
im sittin on the couch like its my house
you a bad girl take a time out
matter fact you can bring a friend
my voice sound like silk in the wind
henny bottles on my table
the owner was a fan so thats already paid for
girls lookin at me like i got a halo
i dont do second dates thats just how the game go
look at my life i made that shit
look at my car i suede that shit
replay that shit
she dont fuck white boys
ima change that shit
