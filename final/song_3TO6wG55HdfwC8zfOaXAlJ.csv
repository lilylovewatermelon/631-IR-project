someday my pain
someday my pain will mark you
harness your blame
harness your blame and walk through

chorus
with the wild wolves around you
in the morning ill call you
send it farther on

solace my game
solace my game it stars you
swing wide your crane
swing wide your crane and run me through

chorus
and the storys all over you
in the morning ill call you
cant you find a clue
when your eyes are all painted sinatra blue
