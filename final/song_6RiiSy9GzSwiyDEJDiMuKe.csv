in the car cruising around with you
and my baby you know that i got you
hit the road im taking off with you
not in a hurry theres something about you oh

leave the car at the valet cash only
check me in pop the champagne dom perignon
pour me a glass shes got good taste so good
take off our clothes by the fire place sexy yeah

she looks just like a dream
the prettiest girl ive ever seen
from the cover of a magazine

in the car cruising around with you
and my baby you know that i got you
hit the road im taking off with you
not in a hurry theres something about you oh

denty may
wе stayed up all night and slept till noon
its so nice to wakе up next to you
lets start the day with breakfast in bed
think im gonna love you till im dead
i cant wait to buy you things
a brand new diamond ring
this is more than just a fling
