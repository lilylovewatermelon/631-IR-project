i cant be everything that you want me to
fill my mind up with silly dreams is all i seem to do
and people look like theyre specks of dust when youre this high off the ground
ill do my best not to let you down
so feet dont fail me now cause

chorus
i am walking the tightrope
i am walking it for you
i am living on high hopes
now theyre now theyre crashing through
so i hold my breath
and close my eyes
i grab my heart when i realize
i am walking the tightrope for you

verse 2
im fighting with gravity
trying not to fall
but how come the ones we love can make us feel so small
oh people look like theyre specks of dust when youre this high off the ground
but everyones got a line to walk
we got to keep from looking down oh

chorus
i am walking the tightrope
i am walking it for you
i am living on high hopes
now theyre now theyre crashing through
so i hold my breath
and close my eyes
i grab my heart when i realize
i am walking the tightrope for you
you might also likebridge
oh the higher we go the farther we fall
two hearts on the line and the winner takes all
but nobody wins when its all just a show
im losing my grip gonna slip now its time to let go

chorus
i am walking the tightrope
i am walking it for you
i am living on high hopes
now theyre now theyre crashing through
so i hold my breath
and close my eyes
i grab my heart when i realize
i am walking the tightrope for you for you for you oh
im walking the tightrope oh
im walking the tightrope

outro
i am walking the tightrope for you4embed"
