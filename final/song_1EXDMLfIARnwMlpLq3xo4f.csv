she aint much of a looker she can handle her paraldehyde
you were up all night at the captains table
drinking tango and gin by the old piano
playing cards and smoking cigars til the sun came up
or was it going down for the night

take another ride on the sunshine highway
take another ride try to turn it around
take another ride down the sunshine highway
take another ride try to turn it around tonight

drop me off sign me in clean me up and let me out
man that nurse is a bitch this sucks she says my jug aint allowed
ive had my share of mt pleasant messiahs
wearing slippers and robes trying to bum my smokes
im gonna thorazine shuffle straight out that door
head to the farm and find me a cure

take another ride on the sunshine highway
take another ride try to turn it around
take another ride down the sunshine highway
take another ride try to turn it around tonight

tonight yeah yeah yeah
i’m gonna make it right

take another ride down the sunshine highway
take another ride try to turn it around tonight
