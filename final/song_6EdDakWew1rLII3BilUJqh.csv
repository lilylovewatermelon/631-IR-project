i saw you blowing kisses down the wishing well again
when i say i love you just just say i know
you put your arms around me but its all for show
and then there you go wrecking my whole world
all fixed up my goodbye girl

you scatter in the wind just like a dandelion
reminding me again that you aint ever mine for long
but i know its gonna happen when the moon is right
youll show up at my door and pull me in just like a song
there you go wrecking my whole world
one more hello one more goodbye girl

it might seem crazy to keep loving you this way
but ill never bring myself to say goodbye girl

the sun is gonna make its way around again
but the rain is always waiting just around the bend
and there you go wrecking my whole world
one more hello one more goodbye girl
all fixed up my goodbye girl
goodbye girl
