and the little boy stared to the eyes of the night
button collects price of his time
little girl glared sheets of denial
bullet connects to the price of her crime

chorus serj tankian  daron malakian
what have we said wasnt in their bed
what of presence havent we paid penance
for the nüguns

verse 2 serj tankian
now the little boy sees through the eyes of delight
levers erect note of his rhyme
little girl bled sheets of the night
lovers connect to the price of his dime

chorus serj tankian  daron malakian
what have we said wasnt in their bed
what of presence havent we paid penance
for the nüguns for the nüguns

oud solo

chorus serj tankian  daron malakian
what have we said wasnt in their bed
what of presence havent we paid penance
what have we said wasnt in their bed
what of presence havent we paid penance
for the nüguns for the nüguns to yousee system of a down liveget tickets as low as 600you might also like1embed"
