verse 1 ludacris
look here
now im a man of many talents and a man of my word
but on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred
its all a part of growin up and seein life at its worst
then tryin to iron out my wrinkles puttin family first
it seems like the whole world is out for sinkin my boat
but with god as my navigator ill be stayin afloat
and i admit to bein caught by many foolish distractions
then im forced to pay the price as the result of my actions
im battlin with myself and every day its a war
curiosity killed the cat why im curious george
gotta keep my nose up outta thangs that aint none of my biz
and just cause somethin looks good dont really mean that it is
get through the agony and anger the pain and strife
and take the necessary steps to try to change my life
i got some questions for you lord cause my mentalitys hood
so why is everything thats bad for me feel so good

now im a only child so excuse some of my selfish ways
i got spoiled when i was young spoil myself today
oh but i feed at least a thousand stomachs and how ive done it
is from the ground up a hundred miles and runnin
dodgin and duckin everybody tryin to hammer me down
a selfmade millionaire baby look at me now
cant tell me nothin still hungry as the day i began
cause all i ever really needed was a pen in my hand
and a pad in my lap didnt matter in fact
me and my momma lived in one room and whats badder than that
was a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12
tryin to get in where i fit streets givin me hell
but yet i give it right  back so how you like  that
continue doin wrong til i was on the right  track
tell me bout heavy money i might give it a push
but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
come on

hook nate dogg
its gonna get in ya child of the night
baby i got and the hood rolls on
how do i begin to do this shit right
baby i got get my hustle on
its gonna get in ya child of the night
baby i got and the hood rolls on
how do i begin to do this shit right
baby i got get my hustle on
interlude ludacris
no matter how much older we get man we all still children at heart
we all make mistakes its all good

verse 3 ludacris
now ive tried plenty of times to get rid of my bad habits
livin life on the cuttin edge takin a stab at it
and learnin from my mistakes try not to make em twice
just admittin when im wrong tryin hard to make it right
and baby nobodys perfect in this world of ours
theres plenty people gettin stitches in this world of scars
but over time pray to god that he can heal your wounds
try to love and love again until they seal your tomb
cause life is short if you dont notice itll pass you by
thats why my head is in the clouds tryin to pass the sky
never blinkin for a minute keep my eyes on my foes
they wanna catch me in the open bring my life to a close
meanwhile thats why im bringin so much life to my shows
ive seen smiles im makin changes turnin glitter to gold
dont let these devils play you down or belittle your soul
just be happy with yoself and its so simple to grow
come on

hook to fade with adlibs nate dogg
its gonna get in ya child of the night
baby i got and the hood rolls on
how do i begin to do this shit right
baby i got get my hustle on7embed"
