fall in
fall out
fall along

verse 1
in the first of light
past the noachide
bodies wrapped in white
stranded every pain
baby pasts are slain
i got outta la grange

verse 2
in hinnom
all this time
with your heart in mind
didnt you edit
in hinnom
go the least
and the precious feast
the invetted

verse 3
sand it starts to steal
dirt and ice imbed in cheeks
in the potters field
solar peace
well it swirls and sweeps
you just set it
strangers scattering
nether passage in the wind
off pennant tension ring
armor down
on the wettest ground
not to vet ityou might also like4embed"
