wheres the life that was promised to me by my color tv
where did it all go wrong
how could i be alone again on this day
on this accursed day
so naïve such a fool to believe i could ever receive
anything better than this
wheres the love that can make it all go away
where are you when i need to hear you say…

chorus 1
turn around im right behind you
dont be afraid im here to remind you
ill be there to catch you when you fall
dry your eyes its not so bad at all…
well its all made up its imaginary
theres no love in february

verse 2
from the start i was played for a fool when i got out of school
i was handed a great big lie
cause they said just believe in a dream and try
oh yeah well thirteen years have gone by
and im still just running in a circle never getting any further
just a loser doomed to work until i die
wheres the love that can make it all go away
where are you when i need to hear you say…

turn around im right behind you
dont be afraid im here to remind you
ill be there to catch you when you fall
dry your eyes its not so bad at all…
well i spend my days still searchin for ya
you took my heart to california
stuck with the winter in new york city
theres no love in february

guitar solo

verse 3
everyday i get further away the love that we had
where did it all go bad
no dont think ill get out of bed today
cause the sky is a permanent shade of grey
and its not like im getting any younger no those days are gone forever
and i never even got a chance to try
wheres the love that can make it all go away
where were you when i needed to hear you say…

chorus 3
turn around im right behind you
dont be afraid im here to remind you
ill be there to catch you when you fall
dry your eyes its not so bad at all…
well its all made up its imaginary
theres no love in february
all made up its imaginary
theres no love in february2embed"
