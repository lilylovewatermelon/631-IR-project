one leads to another on a saturday night
dont you cross your heart unless you hope to die
drinkin dark whiskey tellin white lies
the first drop burns but the second one goes down smooth
and then that ol black label gets ahold of you
itll loosen your tongue but it dont ever tell the truth

drinkin dark whiskey tellin white lies
one leads to another on a saturday night
dont you cross your heart unless you hope to die
drinkin dark whiskey tellin white lies

when the bottle s talkin be careful what he might say
he talks in the dark like he never would in the day
then he gets in trouble just as soon as he gets his way

drinkin dark whiskey tellin white lies
one leads to another on a saturday night
dont you cross your heart unless you hope to die
drinkin dark whiskey tellin white lies

a little white lie dont mean anyone no good
when its makin the rounds all over the neighborhood
next thing you know youre all misunderstood
see the steeldrivers liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likedrinkin dark whiskey tellin white lies
one leads to another on a saturday night
dont you cross your heart unless you hope to die
drinkin dark whiskey tellin white lies
