well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
he fell in love with his best friend
when shes around he feels nothing but joy
but she was already broken and it made her blind
but she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

prechorus 1
but did you know that i loved you
or were you not aware
youre the smile on my face and i aint going nowhere
im here to make you happy im here to see you smile
ive been wanting to tell you this for a long while

chorus
whats gonna make you fall in love
i know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
dont have to be scared at all oh my love
but you cant fly unless you let your you cant fly unless you let yourself fall

verse 2
well i can tell youre afraid of what this might do
cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you dont wanna lose
well i dont wanna lose it either
and i dont think i can stand sitting around while youre hurting babe so take my hand
