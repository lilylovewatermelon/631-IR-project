and were all on our way to the beach
and everyone keeps laughing at those cars we are passing
as were sucking down that funny funny weed

oh yeah
oh yeah

and were rolling up to sand
take your shoes off man
we are skinny dipping underneath the sea
and its a chicken fight clan
throw your dukes up wham
we are splashing in the water to the beat

oh yeah
oh yeah

weeeoooowhoooooooooooo
crossing sandy dunes
hot day midjune
naked kids running wild and free
its summer time fun relax and stay young
you could be home with oprah winfrey
the water feels nice dive deep down under
the ships and treasures make reef
just one of those days had a blue perfect wave
come out and join youll see
we are lying in the sun when were done find a towel
now were thinking of where were gonna eat
back corner table order lobsters and black label
raise your glasses heres to living out our dreams
