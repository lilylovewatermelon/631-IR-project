ooh i know once you come to california
you wont ever look back
ooh just a little bit can make you wonder
you got it in

verse 1
hands up its a stick up
nobodys leaving this room for a minute
everyones breathing these fumes that are in it
sick of the people who make the decisions
put your hands up its a stick up
hopefully god is still down to forgive us
nobodys breathing who let the evil in

prechorus
whats in the water
are you bothered
whats the problem here

chorus
ooh i know once you come to california
you wont ever look back
ooh just a little bit can make you wonder
you got it in
you might also likebreak
i can feel it go down
i can feel it go down all the way all the way
give it to me slow now
give it to me slow then wash away
it comes and comes away

chorus
ooh i know once you come to california
you will never look back
ooh just a little bit can make you wonder

bridge
handcuffed and i thought of you
i made love and i thought of you
my daddy died i just thought of you
my sister cried and my mama too
i got a place and i thought of you
i tried to decorate and i thought of you
im seeing red but im singing blue
i never knew what black and white would fade into
anybody somebody please
im begging im even on my knees
ive got a dozen insecurities
but i dont think you should be worried for me
no i dont think you should be worried for me
chorus
ooh i know once you come to california
you wont ever look back
ooh just a little bit can make you wonder
you got it in20embed"
