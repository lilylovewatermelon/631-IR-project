some say a holy war is coming
going to be the end of mortal man
theres a tv preacher saying
armageddon is at hand
saying the jews the gays the junkies
the politicians and infidels
have conjured up the devil
opened wide the gates of hell

verse 1
i turn on the tv
lord i cant believe my eyes
oh terror walks the streets
while a million mothers cry
christians pray to jesus
lord help us if you can
send gabriel and his legions
to defend his promised land

chorus
they say a holy war is coming
going to be the end of mortal man
theres a tv preacher saying
armageddon is at hand
saying the jews the gays the junkies
the politicians and infidels
have conjured up the devil
opened wide the gates of hell
see brooks  dunn liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likeverse 2
all its prophets lead
while the blind sheep they follow
the path to damnation
with no future no tomorrow
justice she may be blind
tall and proud she marches on
judgment day its coming
god himself wrote that in stone

chorus
they say a holy war is coming
going to be the end of mortal man
theres a tv preacher saying
armageddon is at hand

bridge
they should fire me down from heaven
on the tires of babylon
whoa the innocent the sinners
they all died as one
now victory will be mine
both feeble and good say
but in the end and in its own way
righteousness will have its day
chorus
they say a holy war is coming
going to be the end of mortal man
theres a tv preacher saying
armageddon is at hand
saying the jews the gays the junkies
the politicians and infidels
have conjured up the devil
opened wide the gates of hell

chorus
they say a holy war is coming
going to be the end of mortal man
theres a tv preacher saying
armageddon is at hand
saying the jews the gays the junkies
the politicians and infidels
have conjured up the devil
opened wide the gates of hellembed"
