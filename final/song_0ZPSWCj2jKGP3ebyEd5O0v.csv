her venom makes me strong
stronger than i am on my own
before too long ill wake up to it gone
wondering how i ever was happy

chorus
hot venom is mixin with my blood
i can feel it on my fingers and taste it on her tongue
it feels so good to fall in love with you

verse 2
her power turns me on
turns me up on high and lets me burn
you cant go back now thats not how this works
and as long as shes gone i can never be happy

chorus
hot venom is mixin with my blood
i can feel it on my fingers and taste it on her tongue
it feels so good to fall in love with you

chorus
hot venom is mixin with my blood
i can feel it on my fingers and taste it on her tongue
it feels so good to fall in love with youyou might also likeembed"
