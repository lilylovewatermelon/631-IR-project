damn you know if its meant to be its meant to be
you cant run from love
this is how i found my baby again
bobby

verse 1
when i first met you i had these deep feelings
i knew that you could be the one
then back in grade school cause then on the school bus
we were young but just having fun
must have been destiny
now that were older and weve found each other again
ive learned a lesson that love will find you if you just let it in

chorus
ill never leave you god put us together
forever my angel
never leave you youre my best friend
and its to the end ill die for you
never leave you god put us together
my angel
never leave you youre my best friend
and its to the end ill die for you

verse 2
sometimes i pinch myself to see if im dreaming
cause this love we have is so real
cause when i saw you again
i didnt really know how you would really feel
every time that we make love it feels like the very first time
ive learned a lesson that love will find you because its so divine
