yung germ

verse 1
who the fuck needs you nobody thats who
i cant be the center of attention cause im not that cool
youll realize that soon
but i have to focus on acting like im the wolf in the room
and thats why i stay home
only time i can be myself not play along
only time i can visualize my halo
lifes on and on and on oh oh

chorus
nana nanana
everybody loves me but i dont deserve it
nana nanana
because i dont even know i dont even know my purpose
nana nanana
youll soon realize in your heart that it wasnt worth it
nana nanana
just like everybody does everybody does

verse 2
who the fuck needs me
wanna kill yourself and feelin down
well dont look at me for help
cause i cant even help myself
fighting off the demons in my head
and so i gotta get up now and feel incomplete
so i just lay down and i go to sleep
dream about what life just could have been
if i would have had trust in myself thats all as all
