dont know what i was looking for
when i went home i found me alone
and sometimes i need someone to say
youll be alright whats on your mind
but the waters shallow here and i am full of fear
and emptyhanded after two long years

chorus
another sunny day in california
im sure back home theyd love to see it
but they dont know that what you love is ripped away
before you get a chance to feel it

verse 2
back home i always thought i wanted so much more
now im not too sure
cause sometimes i miss knowing someones there for me
and feeling free
free to stand beside the ocean in moonlight
and light myself a smoke beneath the dark atlantic sky

chorus
another sunny day in california
im sure back home theyd love to see it
but they dont know that what you love is ripped away
before you get a chance to feel it
see yellowcard liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likebridge
everybody here is living life in fear of falling out of line
tearing lives apart and breaking lots of hearts just to pass the time
and the eyes get red in the back of your head this place will make you blind
put it all behind me and ill be just fine

chorus 2
another sunny day beneath this cloudless sky
sometimes i wish that it would rain here
and wash away the west coast dreaming from my eyes
theres nothing real for them to see here

outro
another starry night in california
im sure back home theyd love to see it
but they dont know that what you love is ripped away
before you get a chance
before you get a chance to feel itembed"
