hey vik ive been going over some of your notes and im afraid youre a couple of decimal points off on some of your figures
out i have no time for you
okay find out for yourself

verse 1 viktor vaughn
it lasts longer if you take a picture
its viktor the slickster
i pick her
sip schlitz malt liquor
still up in the mixture like a fixture
yall seen the sticker with the sick fillin vik sta
he stacks chips by any which way
and keep black lips fuck what any bitch say
it aint no time for no tit for tat
yall better aim for the head
just dont hit the fitted hat
when its his time to go its his time to go
as for right now though
the hour show rhyme flow
he got more of those and lines for dime hoes
and act fancy with more clothes than delancey
dont let him house you out on houston
or catch you downtown on broadway browsing
whoever got the most bags get followed
give it up or get you and the old hag hollowed
smash
its viktor the slickster

verse 2 viktor vaughn
its like limbo
how low can you go
v go lower than your bimbo pantyhose
damn yo i say thats pretty damn low
in the city streets with more ammo than rambo
hambone yall dont want v in it
make the coolest cat piss his coogi in a minute
when he blow and get ballin at the top slot
twenty gs a head for whoevers calling cop shot
kack kack kack kack kack—popsnot

interlude

verse 3 viktor vaughn
tenderheaded
get they wig split wit fro sheen
v manufacture gun cleaning kits for po dean
party people ask him how you so mean and still quiet
could it be the codeine in your diet
im like what i look like a doctor
let the pork stop i got the clear meat the vodka
cork tops step up the hustle like the new guy
gun busting and drugs the penalties too high
makes you wonder who they speak for
its only one side benefiting off the street war
and he skeet galore just to make ya badder
many gone stab they own man up like jacobs ladder
i still worry when im out on the hop hot
realer ill flurry that might pop ya knot
i feel that bill murray get more run then the whop got
shop for a yacht
