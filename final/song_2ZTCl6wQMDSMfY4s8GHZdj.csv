you tucked me in turned out the light
kept me safe and sound at night
little girls depend on things like that
brushed my teeth and combed my hair
had to drive me everywhere
you were always there when i looked back
you had to do it all alone
make a living make a home
must have been as hard as it could be
and when i couldnt sleep at night
scared things wouldnt turn out right
you would hold my hand and sing to me

chorus miley cyrus  billy ray cyrus
caterpillar in the tree
how you wonder who youll be
cant go far but you can always dream
wish you may and wish you might
dont you worry hold on tight
i promise you there will come a day
butterfly fly away

verse 2 miley cyrus billy ray cyrus  both
butterfly fly away butterfly fly away
got your wings now you cant stay
take those dreams and make them all come true
butterfly fly away butterfly fly away
youve been waiting for this day
all along youve known just what to do
you might also likeoutro both
butterfly butterfly butterfly
butterfly fly away
