late at night alone i was hoping you would show
just waiting for you trying to catch your eye
out here on my own there aint nowhere else to go
ive checked in all the places you could hide
late at night alone i was hoping you would come
walk me home cause i dont wanna stay
out here on my own i was hoping you would show
walk me home were headed the same way

chorus
its all i want
its all im dreaming
to keep you here forever

verse 2
if id ever got a hold i would never let it go
or everyone could see how hard i tried
id never been so bold but these feelings let me go
i never could have dreamed youd pass me by
the trail has gone cold and all the days of old
shine a light and lead me back that way
the storys all told the curtains unfold
make it bright and make sure that it stays

chorus
its all i want
its all im dreaming
to keep you here foreveryou might also likeembed"
