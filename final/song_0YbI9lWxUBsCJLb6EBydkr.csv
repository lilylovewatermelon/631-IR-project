if i forget to say goodbye
before i catch the plane
would you know the way that i
feel when im away
well see the same sky tonight
but the stars are out of place
youll never know the weight of my heart
every time i leave you babe

prechorus
its hard to break the landing
but ill see you again

chorus
im never gonna leave your life
even at the times im miles away you are always on my mind
forever and now i will be by your side
i know it can change from day to day but this lovell keep alight
im never gonna leave your life
i im never gonna leave your life

verse 2
oh i could never tell you ly
or put in words your finest traits
the darkest green and hazel eyes
and yet i cant describe the shade
you are all this heart of mine
and there you will remain
youll never know the weight of my
decisions when i leave your smilin face

chorus
oh i im never gonna leave your life
