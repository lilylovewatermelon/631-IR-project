take off my disguise
im living someone elses life
suppressing who i was inside
so i throw two thousand ones in the sky
together were alone together were alone
in vegas i feel so at home in vegas i feel so at home
im falling only for the night
so i throw two thousand ones in the sky the sky
oh oh oh how much to light up my star again
and rewire all my thoughts
oh baby wont you remind me what i am
and break break my little cold heart

chorus
call me up and ill send for you
take me down to your altitude
i dont know if i can be alone again alone again
i dont know if i can sleep alone again alone again
check my pulse for a second time a second time
i took too much i dont wanna die
i dont know if i can be alone again alone again
i dont know if i can sleep alone again
