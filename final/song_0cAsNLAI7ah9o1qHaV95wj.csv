there are a few people we need to thank tonight for bringing about this grand event neil portnow dana tamarkin rob light brian greenbaum don was and also want to thank president carter for coming it’s been a long night and i don’t want to talk too much but i’ll say a few things im glad for my songs to be honored like this but you know they didnt get here by themselves its been a long road and its taken a lot of doing these songs of mine i think of as mystery plays the kind that shakespeare saw when he was growing up i think you could trace what i do back that far they were on the fringes then and i think theyre on the fringes now and they sound like theyve been traveling on hard ground i need to mention a few people along the way who brought this about i know i should mention john hammond the great talent scout who way back when brought me to columbia records he signed me to that label when i was nobody it took a lot of faith to do that and he took a lot of ridicule but he was his own man and he was courageous and for that im eternally grateful the last person he discovered before me was aretha franklin and before that count basie billie holiday and a whole lot of other artists all noncommercial artists trends did not interest john and i was very noncommercial but he stayed with me he believed in my talent and thats all that mattered i cant thank him enough for that lou levy ran leeds music and they published my earliest songs but i didnt stay there too long levy himself he went back a long ways he signed me to that company and recorded my songs and i sang them into a tape recorder he told me outright there was no precedent for what i was doing that i was either before my time or behind it and if i brought him a song like stardust hed turn it down because it would be too late he told me that if i was before my time  and he didnt really know that for sure  but if it was happening and if it was true the public would usually take three to five years to catch up  so be prepared and that did happen the trouble was when the public did catch up i was already three to five years beyond that so it kind of complicated it but he was encouraging and he didnt judge me and ill always remember him for that artie mogull at witmark music signed me next to his company and he told me to just keep writing songs no matter what that i might be on to something well he too stood behind me and he could never wait to see what id give him next i didnt even think of myself as a songwriter before then ill always be grateful for him also for that attitudei also have to mention some of the early artists who recorded my songs very very early without having to be asked just something they felt about them that was right for them ive got to say thank you to peter paul and mary who i knew all separately before they ever became a group i didnt even think of myself as writing songs for others to sing but it was starting to happen and it couldnt have happened to or with a better group they took a song of mine that had been recorded before that was buried on one of my records and turned it into a hit song not the way i would have done it  they straightened it out but since then hundreds of people have recorded it and i dont think that would have happened if it wasnt for them they definitely started something for me the byrds the turtles sonny  cher  they made some of my songs top 10 hits but i wasnt a pop songwriter and i really didnt want to be that but it was good that it happened their versions of my songs were like commercials but i didnt really mind that because 50 years later my songs were being used in the commercials so that was good too i was glad it happened and i was glad theyd done it pervis staples and the staple singers  long before they were on stax they were on epic and they were one of my favorite groups of all time i met them all in 62 or 63 they heard my songs live and pervis wanted to record three or four of them and he did with the staples singers they were the type of artists that i wanted recording my songs if anybody was going to do it nina simone i used to cross paths with her in new york city in the village gate nightclub she was an artist a definitely looked up to she recorded some of my songs that she learned directly from me sitting in a dressing room she was an overwhelming artist piano player and singer very strong woman very outspoken and dynamite to see perform that she was recording my songs validated everything that i was about nina was the kind of artist that i loved and admired oh and cant forget jimi hendrix i actually saw jimi hendrix perform when he was in a band called jimmy james and the blue flames  something like that and jimi didnt even sing he was just the guitar player after he became famous he took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and pumped them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere and turned them all into classics i have to thank jimi too i wish he was here johnny cash recorded some of my songs early on too i met him in about 63 when he was all skin and bones he traveled long he traveled hard but he was a hero of mine i heard many of his songs growing up i knew them better than i knew my own big river i walk the line how high’s the water mama i wrote its alright ma im only bleeding with that song reverberating inside my head i still ask how high is the water mama johnny was an intense character and he saw that people were putting me down playing electric music and he posted letters to magazines scolding people telling them to shut up and let him sing in johnny cashs world  hardcore southern drama  that kind of thing didnt exist nobody told anybody what to sing or do they just didnt do that kind of thing where he came from im always going to thank him for that johnny cash was a giant of a man the man in black and ill always cherish the friendship we had until the day there is no more days oh and id be remiss if i didnt mention joan baez she was the queen of folk music then and now she took a liking to my songs and brought me with her to play concerts where she had crowds of thousands of people enthralled with her beauty and voice people would say what are you doing with that ragtag scrubby looking waif and shed tell everybody in no uncertain terms now you better be quiet and listen to the songs we even played a few of them together joan baez is as toughminded as they come loyal free minded and fiercely independent nobody can tell her what to do if she doesnt want to do it i learned a lot of things from her a woman of devastating honesty and for her kind of love and devotion i could never pay that back these songs didnt come out of thin air i didnt just make them up out of whole cloth contrary to what lou levy said there was a precedent it all came out of traditional music traditional folk music traditional rock n roll and traditional bigband swing orchestra music i learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to folk songs and i played them and i met other people that played them back when nobody was doing it sang nothing but these folk songs and they gave me the code for everything thats fair game that everything belongs to everyone for three or four years all i listened to were folk standards i went to sleep singing folk songs i sang them everywhere clubs parties bars coffeehouses fields festivals and i met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other i could learn one song and sing it next in an hour if id heard it just once if you sang john henry as many times as me  john henry was a steeldriving man  died with a hammer in his hand  john henry said a man aint nothin but a man  before i let that steam drill drive me down  ill die with that hammer in my handif you had sung that song as many times as i did youd have written how many roads must a man walk down too big bill broonzy had a song called key to the highway ive got a key to the highway  im booked and im bound to go  gonna leave here runnin because walking is most too slow i sang that a lot if you sing that a lot you just might write georgia sam he had a bloody nose welfare department they wouldn’t give him no clothes he asked poor howard where can i go howard said there’s only one place i know sam said tell me quick man i got to run howard just pointed with his gun and said that way down on highway 61 youd have written that too if youd sang key to the highway as much as me aint no use sit n cry  youll be an angel by and by  sail away ladies sail away im sailing away my own true love boots of spanish leather  sheryl crow just sung that roll the cotton down aw yeah roll the cotton down  ten dollars a day is a white mans pay  roll the cotton downa dollar a day is the black mans pay  roll the cotton down if you sang that song as many times as me youd be writing i aint gonna work on maggies farm no more too if you’d had listened to the robert johnson singing “better come in my kitchen ‘cause it’s gonna be raining out doors” as many time as i listened to it sometime later you just might write “a hard rain’s agonna fall” i sang a lot of come all you songs theres plenty of them theres way too many to be counted come along boys and listen to my tale  tell you of my troubles on the old chisholm trail or come all ye good people listen while i tell  the fate of floyd collins a lad we all know well” come all ye fair and tender ladies  take warning how you court your men  theyre like a star on a summer morning  they first appear and then theyre gone again and then there’s this one gather round people  a story i will tell  bout pretty boy floyd the outlaw  oklahoma knew him wellif you sung all these come all ye songs all the time like i did youd be writing come gather round people where ever you roam admit that the waters around you have grown  accept that soon youll be drenched to the bone  if your time to you is worth saving  and you better start swimming or youll sink like a stone  the times they are achanging youd have written that too theres nothing secret about it you just do it subliminally and unconsciously because thats all enough and thats all you know that was all that was dear to me they were the only kinds of songs that made sense when you go down to deep ellum keep your money in your socks  women on deep ellum put you on the rocks sing that song for a while and you just might come up with when youre lost in the rain in juarez and its easter time too  and your gravity’s down and negativity dont pull you through  don’t put on any airs  when you’re down on rue morgue avenue  they got some hungry women there  and they really make a mess outta you all these songs are connected dont be fooled i just opened up a different door in a different kind of way its just different saying the same thing i didnt think it was anything out of the ordinary well you know i just thought i was doing something natural but right from the start my songs were divisive for some reason they divided people i never knew why some got angered others loved them didnt know why my songs had detractors and supporters a strange environment to have to throw your songs into but i did it anyway last thing i thought of was who cared about what song i was writing i was just writing them i didnt think i was doing anything different i thought i was just extending the line maybe a little bit unruly but i was just elaborating on situations maybe hard to pin down but so what a lot of people are hard to pin down and you’ve just got to bear it in a sense everything evened itself out leiber and stoller didn’t think much of my songs they didnt like em but doc pomus did that was all right that they didnt like em because i never liked their songs either yakety yak dont talk back charlie brown is a clown baby im a hog for you novelty songs not serious docs songs they were better this magic moment lonely avenue “save the last dance for me” those songs broke my heart i figured id rather have his blessings any day than theirs ahmet ertegun didnt think much of my songs but sam phillips did ahmet founded atlantic records he produced some great records ray charles ruth brown laverne baker just to name a few there were some great records in there no doubt about it but sam phillips he recorded elvis and jerry lee carl perkins and johnny cash radical artists that shook the very essence of humanity revolutionaries with vision and foresight fearless and sensitive at the same time revolution in style and scope radical to the bone songs that cut you to the bone renegades in all degrees doing songs that would never decay and still resound to this day oh yeah id rather have sam phillips blessing any day merle haggard didnt think much of my songs but buck owens did and buck even recorded some of my early songs now i admire merle  mama tried tonight the bottle let me down im a lonesome fugitive i understand all that but i cant imagine waylon jennings singing the bottle let me down i love merle but he’s not buck buck owens wrote together again and that song trumps anything that ever came out of bakersfield buck owens and merle haggard if you have to have somebodys blessing  you figure it out what i’m saying here is that my songs seem to divide people even people in the music community people in the critical world too critics have always been on my tail since day one seems like they’ve always given me special treatment some of the music critics say i cant sing i croak sound like a frog why dont these same critics say similar things about tom waits they say my voice is shot that i have no voice why dont they say those things about leonard cohen why do i get special treatment critics say i cant carry a tune and i talk my way through a song really ive never heard that said about lou reed why does he get to go scotfree what have i done to deserve this special treatment why me lord no vocal range whens the last time you’ve read that about dr john you’ve never read that about dr john why dont they say that about him slur my words got no diction you have to wonder if these critics have ever heard charley patton or son house or wolf talk about slurred words and no diction why don’t they say those same things about them why me lord critics say i mangle my melodies render my songs unrecognizable oh really let me tell you something i was at a boxing match a few years ago seeing floyd mayweather fight a puerto rican guy and the puerto rican national anthem somebody sang it and it was beautiful it was heartfelt and it was moving after that it was time for our national anthem and a very popular soulsinging sister was chosen to sing she sang every note   that exists and some that dont exist talk about mangling a melody you take a onesyllable word and make it last for 15 minutes she was doing vocal gymnastics like she was a trapeze act but to me it was not funnywhere were the critics mangling lyrics mangling a melody mangling a treasured song no i get the blame but i dont really think i do that i just think critics say i do sam cooke said this when told he had a beautiful voice he said well thats very kind of you but voices ought not to be measured by how pretty they are instead they matter only if they convince you that they are telling the truth think about that the next time you are listening to a singer times always change they really do and you have to always be ready for something thats coming along and you never expected it way back when i was in nashville making some records and i read this article a tom t hall interview tom t hall he was bitching about some kind of new song and he couldnt understand what these new kinds of songs that were coming in were about now tom he was one of the most preeminent songwriters of the time in nashville a lot of people were recording his songs and he himself even did it but he was all in a fuss about james taylor a song james had called country road tom was going off in this interview  but james dont say nothing about a country road hes just says how you can feel it on the country road i dont understand that now some might say tom is a great songwriter im not going to doubt that at the time he was doing this interview i was actually listening to a song of his on the radio it was called i love i was listening to it in a recording studio and he was talking about all the things he loves an everyman kind of song trying to connect with people trying to make you think that hes just like you and youre just like him we all love the same things and were all in this together tom loves little baby ducks slowmoving trains and rain he loves old pickup trucks and little country streams sleep without dreams bourbon in a glass coffee in a cup tomatoes on the vine and onions now listen im not ever going to disparage another songwriter im not going to do that im not saying its a bad song im just saying it might be a little overcooked but you know it was in the top 10 anyway tom and a few other writers had the whole nashville scene sewed up in a box if you wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go to them and tom was one of the top guys they were all very comfortable doing their thing this was about the time that willie nelson picked up and moved to texas about the same time hes still in texas everything was very copacetic everything was all right until  until  kristofferson came to town oh they aint seen anybody like him he came into town like a wildcat that he was flew a helicopter into johnny cashsbackyard not your typical songwriter and he went for the throat sunday morning coming down well i woke up sunday morning with no way to hold my head that didnt hurt and the beer i had for breakfast wasnt bad so i had one more for dessert then i fumbled through my closet found my cleanest dirty shirt then i washed my face and combed my hair and stumbled down the stairs to meet the day you can look at nashville prekris and postkris because he changed everything that one song blew ol’ tom t halls world apart he couldn’t see it coming it might have sent him to the mad house god forbid he ever heard any of my songs you walk into the room with your pencil in your hand you see somebody naked you say “who is that man” you try so hard but you don’t understand just what youre gonna say when you get home but you don’t know what it is do you mister jones if sunday morning coming down rattled toms cage sent him into the loony bin my song surely would have made him blow his brains out right there in the loony bin hopefully he didnt hear iti just released an album of standards all the songs usually done by michael buble harry connick jr maybe brian wilsons done a couple linda ronstadt done em rod of course even paul has done some of this kind of material but the reviews of their records aren’t like mine in their reviews no one says anything in my reviews theyve got to look under every stone and report about it in the review they get you seldom see any of the songwriters names unlike mine theyve got to mention all the songwriters names well thats ok with me after all theyre great songwriters and these are standards ive seen the reviews come in and theyll mention all the songwriters in half the review as if everybody knows them nobodys heard of them not in this time anyway buddy kaye cy coleman carolyn leigh to name a few but you know im glad they mention their names and you know what im glad they got their names in the press it might have taken some time to do it but theyre finally there with importance and dignity i can only wonder why it took so long my only regret is that theyre not here to see it traditional rock n roll were talking about that its all about rhythm johnny cash said it best get rhythm get rhythm when you get the blues very few rock n roll bands today play with rhythm they dont know what it is rock n roll is a combination of blues and its a strange thing made up of two parts a lot of people dont know this but the blues which is an american music is not what you think it is its a combination of arabic violins and strauss waltzes working it out but its true the other half of rock n roll has got to be hillbilly and thats a derogatory term but it ought not to be thats a term that includes the delmore bros stanley bros roscoe holcomb git tanner and the skillet lickers  groups like that moonshine gone berserk fast cars on dirt roads thats the kind of combination that makes up rock n roll and it cant be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio you have to have the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music if you cant hardly play the blues and you don’t have the hillbilly feeling you’re not really playing rock n roll it might be something else but it’s not that you can fake it but you cant make it critics have said that i’ve made a career out of confounding expectations really because thats all i do thats how i think about it confounding expectations like i stay up late at night thinking about how to do it what do you do for a living man oh i confound expectations youre going to get a job the man says what do you do oh confound expectations and the man says well we already have that spot filled call us back or dont call us well call you confounding expectations i don’t even know what that means or who has time for it‘why me lord my work confounds them obviously but i really dont know how i do it the blackwood bros have been talking to me about making a record together that might confound expectations but it shouldnt of course it would be a gospel album i dont think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me not a bit one of the songs im thinking about singing is stand by me with the blackwood brothers not stand by me the pop song no the real stand by me the real one goes like this when the storm of life is raging  stand by me  when the storm of life is raging  stand by me  when the world is tossing me  like a ship upon the sea  thou who rulest wind and water  stand by me in the midst of tribulation  stand by me  in the midst of tribulation  stand by me  when the hosts of hell assail  and my strength begins to fail  thou whomever lost a battle  stand by me in the midst of faults and failures  stand by me  in the midst of faults and failures  stand by me  when i do the best i can  and my friends dont understand thou who knowest all about me  stand by me thats the song i like it better than the pop song if i record one by that name thats going to be the one im also thinking of recording a song not for that album though – a song called oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood but i don’t know it might be good on the gospel album too anyway im proud to be here tonight for musicares im honored to have all these artists singing my songs theres nothing like that great artists who all know how to sing the truth and you can hear it in their voices im proud to be here tonight for musicares i think a lot of this organization theyve helped many people many musicians who have contributed a lot to our culture id like to personally thank them for what they did for a friend of mine billy lee riley a friend of mine who they helped for six years when he was down and couldnt work billy was a sun rock n roll artist he was a true original he did it all played sang and wrote he would have been a bigger star but jerry lee came along and you know what happens when someone like that comes along you kind of have to take a step back you just dont stand a chance so billy became what is known in the industry  a condescending term by the way  as a onehit wonder but sometimes just sometimes once in a while a one hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star whos got 20 or 30 hits behind him and billys hit song was called red hot and it was red hot it could blast you out of your skull and make you feel happy about it change your life he did it with power and style and grace you wont find him in the rock and roll hall of fame hes not there metallica is abba is mamas and the papas  i know theyre in there jefferson airplane alice cooper steely dan  ive got nothing against metal soft rock hard rock psychedelic pop i got nothing against any of that stuff but after all it is called the rock and roll hall of fame billy lee riley is not there yet and it’s taking too long id see him a couple times a year and wed always spent time together and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit and wed cross paths now and again wed always spend time together he was a hero of mine id heard red hot i must have been only 15 or 16 when i did and its impressed me to this day i never grow tired of listening to it never got tired of watching billy lee perform either we spent time together just talking and playing into the night he was a deep truthful man he wasnt bitter or nostalgic he just accepted it he knew where he had come from and he was content with who he was and then one day he got sick and like my friend john mellencamp would sing  because john sang some truth today  one day you get sick and you dont get better thats from a song of his called life is short even on its longest days its one of the better songs of the last few years actually i aint lying and i aint lying when i tell you that musicares paid for my friends doctor bills mortgage and gave him spending money they were able to at least make his life comfortable tolerable to the end that is something that cant be repaid any organization that would do that would have to have my blessing im going to get out of here now im going to put an egg in my shoe and beat it i probably left out a lot of people and said too much about some but thats ok like the spiritual song im still just crossing over jordan too lets hope we meet again sometime and we will if like hank williams says the good lord willing and the creek dont rise”see bob
