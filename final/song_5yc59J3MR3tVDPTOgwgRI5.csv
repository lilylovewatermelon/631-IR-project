i want to live where soul meets body
and let the sun wrap its arms around me and
bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing
and feel feel what its like to be new

verse 2
cause in my head theres a greyhound station
where i send my thoughts to faroff destinations
so they may have a chance of finding a place where
theyre far more suited than here

verse 3
and i cannot guess what well discover
when we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
but i know our filthy hands can wash one anothers
and not one speck will remain

chorus
and i do believe its true
that there are roads left in both of our shoes
but if the silence takes you then i hope it takes me too
so brown eyes ill hold you near
cause youre the only song i want to hear
a melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
