well i met an old man dying on a train
no more destination no more pain
well he said one thing before i graduate
never let your fear decide your fate

chorus
i say you kill your heroes and
fly fly baby dont cry
no need to worry cause
everybody will die
every day we just
go go baby dont go
dont you worry we
love you more than you know

verse 2
well the sun one day will leave us all behind
unexplainable sightings in the sky
well i hate to be the one to ruin the night
right before your right before your eyes

chorus
i say you kill your heroes and
fly fly baby dont cry
no need to worry cause
everybody will die
every day we just
go go baby dont go
dont you worry we
love you more than you know
