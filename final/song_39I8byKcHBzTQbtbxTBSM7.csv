where i was raised there was no streetlights
just pitch black and passing headlights
and where we met‚ there must have been dark signs
omens in your skies

prechorus
most days‚ you reach for safety
remain calm‚ forget that you know me
and when we met i could see dark signs
alarm bells in your eyes

chorus
and i miss the man i was
i wont break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody
the moment we left off
i wont break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody
and i hate who i have become
i wont break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody
every time i wake up
i wont break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody

verse 2
and if you saw the marks on my dashboard
the new scars that i didnt ask for
and would you call asking for answers
tear my arms off

and most days you reach for safety
remain calm‚ forget that you know me
when we met i could see dark signs
alarm bells in your eyes

chorus
and i miss the man i was
i wont break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody
the moment we left off
i wont break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody
and i hate who i have become
i wont break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody
every time i wake up
i wont break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody

every time i wake up

i wont break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody

when we met‚ i could see dark signs oh
i wont break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody
