maybe one day we can go
hand in hand down a golden road
and if i get there before you go
ill be waiting at the do
in the future hopefully
well be together you and me

refrain
dont you worry baby please
cause honestly

chorus
if i could rewind
both the hands of time
still i would never find
a lovelier design than you

hook
nothings lovelier than you
nothings lovelier than you
nothings lovelier than you
nothings lovelier than you

verse 2
maybe one day girl i pray
we could float off to space
hold my hand ill lead the way
i wont let go or fall astray
aint no ifs butts and maybes
youre my baby my lady
you might also likerefrain
dont you worry baby please
cause honestly

chorus
if i could rewind
both the hands of time
still i would never find
a lovelier design than you

verse 3
im dangerously dangerously dangerously in love
i love her more than i love myself but still that aint enough hmm
if this a dream i dont wanna wake up
we go together like the tub and the shower head above huh
not even thousands and thousands of miles
could amount to my love id have countless sky miles
id climb up a mountain climb right back down
id run across the world then jog back around
a noun and a verb is just a sound and a word is not profound
enough to show my urge for her smile
id shout on a curb with a loud speaker
till the entire town heard how i felt and im out

hook
nothings lovelier than you
nothings lovelier than you
nothings lovelier than you
nothings lovelier than you
verse 1
