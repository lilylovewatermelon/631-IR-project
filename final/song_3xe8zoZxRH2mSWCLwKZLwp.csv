verse 2
hey hear the alarm time to start the day
rub my eyes light some weed send my mind on its way
im gone somewhere to my own dimension
i show these hoes no affection
just party every night gettin so demented
at that time im lookin in the mirror seein no reflection
got me wonderin why dont they get it
spend the night with me im sure you wont regret it
got some liquor on the way the weed is twistin you should stay
you still listen when they say the kid is spittin gettin paid
but my differences in age got me shittin with a rage
cause whats written on the page straight sicker than some aids
i came to get fucked up fucked up i i came to act wild wild
you you came to prepare for the future i live for right now now
prechorus
i dont think they want to interrupt my party
please dont interrupt my party
we just tryna find somebody for the night
i dont think they want to interrupt my party
please dont interrupt my party
we just tryna find somebody for the night
