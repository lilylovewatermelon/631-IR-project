my life won’t always go the way that i plan
there’ll be some stuff that i won’t understand
i’m gonna stumble every now and again
but i know when i fall i’m falling into your hands

i know you’re holding everything that i see
you’re sovereign over all my anxieties
you give me comfort like nobody else could
and i know you’re working everything for my good

chorus
every trial every heartache
every let down you’re raising it up for my good
every season every new day
every momеnt you’re making a way for my good
oh you’re making a way for my good

verse 2
sometimеs it’s hard to live the things i believe
sometimes my doubts still get the best of me
there’s days i struggle to trust like i should
still i know you’re working everything for my good

chorus
every trial every heartache
every let down you’re raising it up for my good
every season every new day
every moment you’re making a way for my good
oh you’re making a way for my good

so why would i worry
lord you are the great i am
i may not know what tomorrow holds
but i know who holds tomorrow in his hands
so why would i worry
lord you are the great i am
i may not know what tomorrow holds
but i know who holds tomorrow in his hands

chorus
every trial every heartache every trial every heartache
every let down you’re raising it up for my good
every season every new day every season
every moment you’re making a way for my good
oh you’re making a way for my good

outro
