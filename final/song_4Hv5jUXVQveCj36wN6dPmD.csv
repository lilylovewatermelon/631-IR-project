here now dont make a sound
say have you heard the news today
one flag was taken down
to raise another in its place
a heavy cross you bear
a stubborn heart remains unchanged
no home no life no love
no stranger singin in your name

prechorus
maybe the season
the colors change in the valley skies
dear god ive sealed my fate
runnin through hell heaven can wait

chorus
long road to ruin there in your eyes
under the cold streetlights
no tomorrow no dead end in sight

verse 2
lets say we take this town
no king or queen of any state
get up to shut it down
open the streets and raise the gates
i know one wall to scale
i know a field without a name
head on without a care
before its way too late
see foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeprechorus
maybe the season
the colors change in the valley skies
oh god ive sealed my fate
runnin through hell heaven can wait

chorus
long road to ruin there in your eyes
under the cold streetlights
no tomorrow no dead ends
long road to ruin there in your eyes
under the cold streetlights
no tomorrow no dead end in sight

bridge
for every piece to fall in place
forever gone without a trace
your horizon takes its shape
no turnin back dont turn that page
come now im leavin here tonight
come now lets leave it all behind
is that the price you pay
runnin through hell heaven can wait

chorus
long road to ruin there in your eyes
under the cold streetlights
no tomorrow no dead ends
long road to ruin there in your eyes
under the cold streetlights
no tomorrow no dead ends
long road to ruin there in your eyes
under the cold streetlights
no tomorrow no dead end in sight7embed"
