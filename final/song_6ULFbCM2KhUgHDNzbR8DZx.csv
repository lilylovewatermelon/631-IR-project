looking for the softest place on earth
someone to break me off
lets stick it to the bed get it nice and wet
never do it from the side just chest to chest
looking for the softest place
someone to break me off
ill kiss you on your neck then down your back
doing it all night like insomniacs
lookin for the softest place
someone to break me off
take the pillows off the couch put them on the floor
give it to you nice and strong
make you scream for more
lookin for the softest place on earth
someone to break me off
if your feeling me like im feeling you get on top of me

chorus
