smoking and blowing and choking on reefer
i swear to god that i feel like kalifah
theres so much smoke that i need me a breather
this ain’t sativa baby this the sleeper
sip some tequila  for diesel
im at war with these demons i need me some jesus
i scare at the steeple cause im a believer
and i know some people that died from a needle
high as the fucking sky
welcome to the other side
this that cocaine lullaby
how to pimp a butterfly
got partners that fighting cases
partners that’s tryna play me
more partners thats acting shady
but hide behind smiling faces
this game is so cold and i put that on everything
its part of the show
thats what they keep on telling me
the people you know are the ones with jealousy
but i gotta go
this shits out of control

chorus
all my friends are losers
all of us are users
there is no excuses the game is so ruthless
the truth is the bottom is where we belong
oohh oohh
the bottom is where we belong
oohh oohh
the bottom is where we belong
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likebridge
now listen here bubba
if i say it i mean it
if i tell you a donkeys finna shit ice cream
you should grab a bucket and a spoon
if i tell you a jackrabbit can pull a house
you better get that little motherfucker a harness you hear me

verse 2
every time that i walk out the door
put one in the chamber and pray to the lord
i found my peace preparing for war
keep checking the rearview im so paranoid
come from the bottom where talk is cheap
all of my partners are still in the streets
did this for chizzle may he rest in peace
came out the dirt like a pair of cleats
rose from the crack straight out the bottom
the police is watching hot as a sauna
do all that talking deal with the drama
and end up with trauma that’s on my mama
i’m with the bullshit dont want no problems
why do the men always wanna gossip
but all the women always keep it solid
don’t even bother i wont even hollar
chorus
all my friends are losers
all of us are users
there is no excuses the game is so ruthless
the truth is the bottom is where we belong
oohh oohh
the bottom is where we belong
oohh oohh
the bottom is where we belongembed"
