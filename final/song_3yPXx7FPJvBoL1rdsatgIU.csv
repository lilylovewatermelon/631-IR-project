i went out walkin through streets paved with gold
lifted some stones saw the skin and bones
of a city without a soul

verse 2
i went out walkin under an atomic sky
where the ground wont turn and the rain it burns
like the tears when i said goodbye

chorus
yeah i went with nothin
nothin but the thought of you
i went wandering

verse 3
i went drifting through the capitals of tin
where men cant walk or freely talk
and sons turn their fathers in

verse 4
i stopped outside a church house where the citizens like to sit
they say they want the kingdom
but they dont want god in it

verse 5
i went out ridin down that old eightlane
i passed by a thousand signs
looking for my own name
see u2 liveget tickets as low as 450you might also likechorus
i went with nothin
but the thought youd be there too
lookin for you

bridge
i went out there in search of experience
to taste and to touch and to feel as much
as a man can before he repents

verse 6
i went out searching looking for one good man
a spirit who would not bend or break
who would sit at his fathers right hand

verse 7
i went out walking with a bible and a gun
the word of god lay heavy on my heart
i was sure i was the one

verse 8
now jesus dont you wait up jesus ill be home soon
yeah i went out for the papers
told her id be back by noon

chorus
yeah i left with nothin
but the thought youd be there too
lookin for you
yeah i left with nothin
nothin but the thought of you
i went wandering3embed"
