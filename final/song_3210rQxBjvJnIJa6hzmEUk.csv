cant let you go no matter all i try you stay on my mind
i can hold your hands and you can hold mine

now we can rock until the morning light
if i could i would change back the hands of time
that we can do everything so right

im just a thought away for you babe
i know we had our ups and downs
but we say it gets crazy
but trust me girl you can always count on me

cause my love my love your love your love
our love our love our love is magical
cause my love my love and your love your love
and our love our love our love is magical girl

here we go on a roller coaster to paradise
so let me know what its gonna take for me to free your mind
tell em whos your man 3 karats on your hand

introduce you to a brand new life
they dont understand how we can make it last
we dont care cause everythings fine
