dont get me started on what it means to be alive
youre lying to yourself but then still you act surprised
cause youre scared cant come to terms with what you are
the wolves in sheeps clothing will only lead you so far

prechorus
youll wait and theyll go
cause in the end we all end up alone
so just wait youll know

chorus
forget everything just for tonight
well sing like everyone when theyre alone
cause ive been waiting for the night to say whoa whoa

verse 2
i rely on myself just making sure that was clear
im not in need of your crutches i faced all my fears
and i won what i knew i could have
life is not a punch card make the best of what you have

prechorus
and dont wait just go
and when you find yourself please let me know
its not too late just let go
see a day to remember liveget tickets as low as 108you might also likechorus
forget everything just for tonight
well sing like everyone when theyre alone
cause ive been waiting for the night to say whoa whoa
lets believe that if we all stand together
were a force that can shake the whole world
for once were doing something right when we say whoa whoa

bridge
in the end its not about what you have
in the end its all about where you want to go
and the roads you take to help you get there
i hope you think thats fair
cause you only got one life to lead
so dont take for granted those little things
those little things are all that we have

chorus
forget everything just for tonight
well sing like everyone when theyre alone
cause ive been waiting for the night to say woah woah
lets believe that if we all stand together
were a force that can shake the whole world
for once were doing something right when we say woah woah
