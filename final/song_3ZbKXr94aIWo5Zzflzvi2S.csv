bet shes got them windows rolled down
tom pettys on shes singin along
bet shes all tanned up from that summer sun
and she might be dancin to a long haired cover band on the coast
but if i know her she aint dancin alone

chorus
shes probably in love by now
a girl like that dont stay lonely long
and i bet shes already found somebody else
and he aint doin her wrong
wouldnt do no good even if i could somehow track her down
shes probably in love by now

verse 2
bet shes prettyin up some old boys shotgun seat
toenails painted pink
bet those raybans are holdin that blonde hair back
i bet hes holdin her close at night and she aint losin any sleep
if i know her she sure aint thinkin bout me

chorus
shes probably in love by now
a girl like that dont stay lonely long
and i bet shes already found somebody else
and he aint doin her wrong
wouldnt do no good even if i could somehow track her down
shes probably in love by now
yeah shes probably in love
see riley green liveget tickets as low as 7you might also likebridge
wherever she is out there tonight
i bet her heart aint hurting like mine
shes probably in love by now
yeah shes probably in love by now

chorus
shes probably in love by now
a girl like that dont stay lonely long
and i bet shes already found somebody else
and he aint doin her wrong
wouldnt do no good even if i could somehow track her down
shes probably in love by now

outro
yeah shes probably in love
shes probably in love by nowembed"
