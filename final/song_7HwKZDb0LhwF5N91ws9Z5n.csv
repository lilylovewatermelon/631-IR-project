try not to think so much about
the truly staggering amount of oil that it takes to make a record
all the shipping the vinyl the cellophane lining the high gloss
the tape and the gear

verse 2
try not to become too consumed
with whats a criminal volume of oil that it takes to paint a portrait
the acrylic the varnish aluminum tubes filled with latex
the solvents and dye

chorus
lets just call this what it is
the gentler side of mankinds death wish
when its my time to go
gonna leave behind things that wont decompose

verse 3
try not to dwell so much upon
how it wont be so very long from now that they laugh at us for selling
a bunch of 15yearolds made from dinosaur bones singing oh yeah
again and again
right up to the end

chorus
lets just call this what it is
the gentler side of mankinds death wish
when its my time to go
gonna leave behind things that wont decompose
you might also likeoutro
ill just call this what it is
my vanity gone wild with my crisis
one day this all will repeat
i sure hope they make something useful out of me3embed"
