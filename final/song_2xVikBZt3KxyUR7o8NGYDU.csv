he held his breath to hold your hand
to walk the stair steps in pairs
climbing up a slippery slope
im in love love i hope

chorus
dont go home angelina
stay with me hanging around in the lost and found

verse 2
he kissed you quick feeling weird
lonely leered and disappeared
this is such a simple place
the passing time cant erase

chorus
dont go home angelina
paint tomorrow blue

bridge
day breaks but every morning when he wakes he thinks of you

verse 3
im alone but thats okay
i dont mind most of the time
i dont feel afraid to die
she was here passing by

dont go home angelina
stay with me hanging around in the lost and foundembed"
