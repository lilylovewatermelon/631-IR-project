i like when you whisper softly
things only i should hear
that lead me on
go on

verse 2
i like the way you smile at me
make me feel like nothin
can go wrong
go on

prechorus 1
tell me this will last forever
dont you ever leave

chorus
i dont wanna be without you
dream without you
walk without you
talk without you baby
i never take a chance without you
dance without you
nothing is the same without you baby
and i could never deal without you
heal without you
begin without you
end without you
baby im in need
i cant breathe
no i dont wanna be
without you
