verse 1
my youngin caught an l for some makin that knife work why
cause aint no guns in that bitch
i seen a nigga get an l before he got his life took an l
i know a nigga got a deal and then he got indicted
aint no point in even fightin yeah i did that judge
after what happened to doggy bitch i been back thuggin
i cant really talk on phones just send five of em for me
and i aint puttin paper on shit i go handle em for me
im from the east side look up the street signs we made it
when rеce died i seen the rеal niggas was fakin
and i keep five hundred in small bills for baby
never turn my back on my brother mama i love you
half a million on a house val took care of me
real niggas winnin bitch so i took care of the streets
last of a dyin breed i still be buyin lean
i stopped textin my bm just to let her find peace

chorus
