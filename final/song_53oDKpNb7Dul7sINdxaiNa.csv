oh and i know
i can tell im falling further again
but i wont turn away its far too late for me

chorus
cause i am broken into fractions
oh and i am driven to distraction

verse 2
and i swear she is not like any other no
something much more than i could ask for
its too late for me

chorus
cause i am broken into fractions
oh and i am driven to distraction
with each and every interaction
i am driven to distraction
its too late for me
its too late for me
its too late for me
its too late for me
its too late for me
its too late for me
its too late for me
its too late
see sleep token liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likeoutro
its too late for me
its too late for me
its too late for me
its too late for me
its too late for me
its too late for me
its too late for me
its too lateembed"
