i thought i knew it all
ive been through the highs said all my goodbyes
learned to run before i learned to crawl
its not worth fighting for if one of us is sure
and one of us is dying trying to find loves cure
i have waited all my life to paint these cities red
the thoughts ive always had here stuck inside my head
its not worth waiting for if one of us wants more
and one of us is dying trying to find loves door

chorus 1
when we learn how to fly
we forget to how to walk
when we learn how to sing
we dont want to hear each other talk

chorus 2
here we are at the finish line ah
here we are at the finish line

verse 2
and you you really thought you knew
everything to do
with holding onto me and holding on
this time is making me slip right through your hands
and now you dont understand
trying to find love all yourself

when we learn how to fly
we forget to how to walk
when we learn how to sing
we dont want to hear each other talk
when we know what we want
we forget what we need
when you find who you are
you forget about me

chorus 2
here we are at the finish line ah
here we are at the finish line ah
here we are at the finish line ah
