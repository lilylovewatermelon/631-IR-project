the sound of mass confusion
reverberated down the hall
into the ears of a stoic roommate
who put her headphones on
but in the space between the songs
thats where she paid the most attention
beneath the crack on the door
the candle flickered and got extinguished
the reassuring hum of the freeway
as she drifted off to sleep
and it was five oclock in the morning
you had no good reason to leave

chorus
ooh baby ill come when you call ill come when you call
ill come when you call ill come when you call
ill come when you call ill come when you call
ill come but thats all ill come when you call

verse 2
linda ronstadt on the stereo
she was singing warren zevon
hold me tighter carmelita
make the night not last so long
and if it seems so peaceful now
why dont you wait until the morning light
and catch the eye of the stoic roommate
as you leave without saying goodbye
and if youre ever left to wonder
why anything goes right
thank the god of bad decisions
the queen of lonely nights

ooh baby ill come when you call ill come when you call
ill come when you call ill come when you call
ill come when you call ill come when you call
ill come but thats all ill come when you call
