if you dont mean it
cause im tired of waistin my time on things set on leavin
dont kiss me
if it really hurts you
though i cant see how you could change after all that weve been through

i reckon its time for a good thing to wind on down
but it kills me to see
that you dont give a damn about me
oh id die for the chance we could be
like we were when the summer was right
but you cant bring back days
or nights that youve done danced away
i keep hopin that maybe youll stay
dont leave me here lonely tonight

in my dreams
were always laughin
but i wake up to find that that very rarely happens
so go on and leave me
if itd really please you
youll be hard pressed to find you a man that will treat you like i do

but i reckon its time for a good thing to wind on down
but it kills me to see
that you dont give a damn about me
oh id die for the chance we could be
like we were when the summer was right
but you cant bring back days
or nights that youve done danced away
i keep hopin that maybe youll stay
dont leave me here lonely tonightsee tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeembed"
