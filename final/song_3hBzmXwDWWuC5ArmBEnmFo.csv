you get up
you get coffee
you get paid
you get off
you get gas
you get beer
you get drunk
you get weird
you get drove home
you get up thrown
you get hungry
you get chicken
your guitar needs picking
you get tan
you get pale
you get sick
you get well
you get dressed up
you get messed up

chorus
everybody say god almighty its friday
everybody get sideways to have a little fun
everybodys living
everybodys trying
everybodys dying
to get some

you get the girl
you get the one
you get her home
you get her done
you get hitched
you get mad
she gets a lawyer
she gets half
you get banged up
you got to raise up
that red dixie cup
chorus
and everybody say god almighty its friday
everybody get sideways to have a little fun
everybodys living
everybodys trying
everybodys dying to get some
everybodys dying to get some
dying to get someembed"
