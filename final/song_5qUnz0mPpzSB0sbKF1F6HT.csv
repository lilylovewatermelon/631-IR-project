where the sinner can be washed in the blood of the lamb
theres a river by the trestle down by sinners grove
down where the willow and the dogwood grow

you can hear the whistle you can hear the bell
from the halls of heaven to the gates of hell
and theres room for the forsaken if youre there on time
youll be washed of all your sins and all of your crimes

if youre down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train goes slow

theres a golden moon that shines up through the mist
and i know that your name can be on that list
theres no eye for an eye theres no tooth for a tooth
i saw judas iscariot carrying john wilkes booth

he was down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
he was down there where the train goes slow
you might also likeif youve lost all your hope if youve lost all your faith
i know you can be cared for and i know you can be safe
and all the shamefuls and all of the whores
and even the soldier who pierced the side of the lord is down there by the train

down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train goes slow

well ive never asked forgiveness and ive never said a prayer
never given of myself never truly cared
ive left the ones who loved me and im still raising
cain ive taken the low road and if youve done the same
meet me down there by the train

down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train goes slow

meet me down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there by the train
down there where the train goes slowembed"
