i loved you you made me hate me you gave me
hate see it saved me and these tears are deadly
you feel that id rip back every time you tried to steal that
you feel bad you feel sad im sorry hell no fuck that
it was my heart it was my life it was my start it was your knife
this strife it dies this life and these lies
and these lungs have sung this song for too long
and its true i hurt to remember i loved you

chorus deuce
and ive lost it all fell today its all the same
im sorry oh im sorry no
and ive been abused i feel so used because of you
im sorry oh im sorry no no

verse 2 jdog
i wish i couldve quit you i wish i never missed you
and told you that i loved you every time i fucked you
the future that we both drew and all the shit weve been through
obsessed with the thought of you the pain just grew and grew
how could you do this to me look at what i made for you
it never was enough and the world is what i gave to you
i used to be lovestruck now im just fucked up
pull up my sleeve and see the pattern of my cuts

bridge deuce  charlie scene
seems like all we had is over now
you left to rest
and your tears are dried up now
you just lay without a sound
seems like all we had is over now
you left to rest
and my fears are over now
i can leave with my head down
