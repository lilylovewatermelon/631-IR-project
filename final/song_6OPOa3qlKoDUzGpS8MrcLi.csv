i personify the adolescent on a phone
speaking like im bigger than my body
i personify that lack of freedom in your life
and im sure shell be gone in a second

prechorus
let me tell you bout this girl
i thought shed rearrange my world
takes a particular type of girl
to put my heart under arrest
so whys this beating on my chest

chorus
this must be my dream
wide awake before i found you
this must be my dream
i cant wait for you boy
wake me from my dream
what does all our love amount to
this must be my dream
we cant make love when you fly around me baby

verse 2
pipe down youre no lover
its failing cause you want it to
well i thought it was love but i guess i must be dreaming
bout feeling something instead of you
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likeprechorus
what did i tell you bout this girl
the one to rearrange your world
you got excited and now you find out that your girl
wont even get you undressed or care about your beating chest

chorus
this must be my dream
wide awake before i found you
this must be my dream
i cant wait for you boy
wake me from my dream
what does all our love amount to
this must be my dream
we cant make love when you fly around me baby
this must be my dream
wide awake before i found you
this must be my dream
i cant wait for you boy
wake me from my dream
what does all our love amount to
this must be my dream
we cant make love when you fly around me baby
