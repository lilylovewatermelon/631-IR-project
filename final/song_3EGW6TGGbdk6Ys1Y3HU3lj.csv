ridin down ridin down
my hand on your seat
the whole way round
i carry bandaids on me now
for when your soft hands hit the jagged ground
wheels arent even touchin the ground
scared to take them off but theyre so worn down
promise i wont push you straight to the dirt
if you promise me youll take them off first

chorus
i love everything you do
when you call me fuckin dumb for the stupid shit i do
i wanna ride my bike with you
fully undressed no trainin wheels left for you
ill pull em off for you
i love everything you do
when you call me fuckin dumb for the stupid shit i do
i wanna ride my bike with you
fully undressed no trainin wheels left for you
ill pull em all off for you

verse 2
lettin go lettin go
tellin you things you already know
i explode i explode
askin you where you want us to go
youve been ridin twowheelers all your life
its not like im askin to be your wife
i wanna make you mine but thats hard to say
