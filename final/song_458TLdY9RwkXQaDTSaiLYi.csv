i want to come to this with a story that i feel symbolizes everybody in the building this happened to me two days ago i’m going to the gas station and this older guy—he looks like he’s about 70 me generalizing and stereotyping i asked him “yo excuse me sir how you doing what has changed for you in the last years from like when you was younger until now” and he was like “you really wanna know” and i was like “yes sir i really want to know” and he was like “you know what has changed” and he was like “your attitude” and that was deep bro that was deep i feel that represents us all of us today

i thank y’all for not judging me and being able to respect us being humans that’s what we should all be able to do i specialize in love a lot of people wonder the small majority who don’t understand wonder why lil b would be here but you know it’s good i love to spread love you know that’s what i’m here to do

this is the big thing i want to speak on to set the tone nobody in this building asked to be born you didn’t ask to be you bro i didn’t ask to be me i didn’t ask to have this skin i didn’t ask to be who i was bro nobody in here asked that the beautiful people your beautiful parents made you bro you didn’t ask for that you didn’t ask to live where you live or anything so when you see people forgive them and accept you feel me you gotta open your mind and say man nobody asked to be born life is hard kinda

ay bruh i love you positively i love all y’all with relationships and women and being together and everybody man it’s just like… it’s just real i’m just happy you guys are getting the real me no pen no pad i didn’t script a speech i come here and all i can do is be myself and spread love but with relationships and stuff man i’m just taking it slow taking it easy a lot of things are happening real fast and i’m just taking my time and respecting women respecting others i mean but that’s obvious though to respect women is obvious yo

and a big thing i’ve been thinking about is the tone with a lot of people i meet and the media i see it’s a lot of if you get hit you hit back why is that real recognize real bro you get blessed out of situations i did that situation because i wanted the world to see that you can have a million stones thrown at you and you can still be positive you know that was kind of embarrassing i had a lot of hood credibility makes quotation marks in the air i had a lot of imaginary hood respect but you know at the end of the day it’s no respect in being violent or a coward for no reason it’s no honor in picking on people it’s no honor in senseless violence it’s no honor in war

but at the end of the day i look at animals and insects you know i’m the first rapper to adopt a tabby cat you know i adopted straight from the aspca you feel me just breaking the boundaries man showing everybody it’s okay to be yourself embrace yourself embrace your health ayyy just continue to love yourself and accept

i can’t lie when i was younger i loved the media i believed the media i can say i was a product of my environment you know you grow up i remember when i was younger i didn’t know how to walk i was so young i was wondering how i was walking am i walking weird something’s in my butt you know what i mean but really so conscious though so hard on myself and i say through time and love it’s just easing up on yourself easing up on life

it’s a lot of words people have given so much power when i mean things to be specific it’s that tone of you hit me i hit you that’s not right the new generation as i see it how i hold my integrity why i conduct myself in the way i do—people see me and they say “he didn’t retaliate or taunt that man and he could have” there are people that love me people were upset but just because somebody wants to fight you for no reason or because somebody says something to you you can forgive that person i’d be that guy’s friend you’ve gotta move on and be positive we’re way past dwelling i spread that love keep it and don’t be hard on yourself with anything how you look to your weight to wanting to complete what your parents want you to be don’t stress so hard pat yourself on the back you’re at nyu congratulations what you guys are doing is very brave everybody that is going through school you’ve made a huge sacrifice all the staff all the beautiful students everybody that’s here to teach shouts out to everybody that’s here for learning and love and trying to find their way i mean shit i mean shoot we’re all trying to find our way i want to thank you for embracing and accepting me like really i love you

i want to show have friends of all creeds all colors all races stop saying black white this that—we’re all human now i don’t know everything this is my philosophy but i feel like things are just generalizations drop all that stop giving negative words so much power instead of saying “hey look at him he’s black” just say “hey where are you from what is your nationality” just take two seconds instead of generalizing because i promise you i looked up what black means online and black means something like coal you feel me

we all got problems too bro real talk we all can have something that we can relate to make sure you can relate and have a common and if you do feel too different make sure you respect the people give people a chance to come in your heart i know why a lot of people don’t trust people you know why there’s a lot of mean bad people out here a lot of people don’t have a value on their own life they don’t have a value on how blessed we are to be alive our generation right here we’re on a class of earth together this is our class all of us are going to be like “hey remember 20 years ago when we did that” don’t be hard on each other let your friends have fun work hard and do what you do because we’ve only got one life to live that is scary you know it’s scary and it’s really real it’s really true it just makes me appreciate people appreciate every single person look at them like a golden milliondollar baby ay bruh i’ma tell you the real secrets of life bruh ay bruh feel me bruh i got the real secrets for real bro for real real talk the secrets of life look at everybody like they’re a baby remember like man we’re young don’t be so hard on people we’re just little baby insects or mammals or whatever you feel me

i tell you bruh i was looking at insects i do my observations when i go out if i become a neurosurgeon or i’m about to come into some bugs i’m rocking with the bugs man you just be looking at them because i was having these big ant problems in my house it was crazy and these are people in their own way too as i was studying these ant colonies infesting my house daily i’m not kidding you i left food out and 20 minutes later rrrrr and i’m like man they already know they get it down pat and real talk like seeing these ants and studying them and respecting them it’s like man they’re in their own community too they’re trying to
survive they love they fight they telling themselves something we can’t understand but one day we will i’m trying hard to figure it out i’m there with them we’re very smart animals you know or whatever we are organisms what are we what do y’all think we are is there like a fact does anybody have any proof what we are live that life experience it travel and come up with your theories man read the books too but experience your own it’s crazy

some of the things i think about on the daily i just want my people to be safe audience member what you think about bro safety man and real talk everybody make sure you wear seat belts for real
man i’m procaring that’s a big thing we should bring back let’s bring back caring about each other honestly genuinely anybody can have their preconceived notion about me they can be like “i think he looks like this and i have my vision in my head” but after the day break that down look at me and i’m not what you think some people not even be thinking nothing about me they might have love they might look at me like a baby like a little alien cuddle hold me but man bruh all this is is a positive healing with this historical time together i want everybody in this building to know everybody is your friend here people that love lil b’s music and respect lil b from the core we’re about positivity and not judging letting people be theyselves be yourself one hundred and one thousand percent everybody man from the sides to the back to the middle to the sides you might not even know people but if you rock with lil b music and respect me from the core you should know that based means you have someone you can trust because we all have a common courtesy it’s about having empathy now what i mean is really caring and paying attention to somebody else’s feeling you gotta have empathy and know we all on this common vibe it’s all peace it’s saying hey you know what you can hit me and i’m not hitting you back and that takes a very big person to do that if someone attacks you or your family at the end of the day you do what you gotta do but i’m saying if you really want to be a bigger person

i go to sleep and i’m so happy you know why i know i’m living what i’m talking about i go to sleep and i’m like nyah on my bean bag like nyah i’m making history and i’m living it and i’m honest it feels so good to be honest honest as we can be nyah honesty integrity loyalty passion friendship for real man that’s real

i was a product of the media and my environment i seen the people i like with gold teeth and i was like man i want gold teeth he looked like me and i wanted gold teeth everybody can get a grill in here everybody should embrace that get gold teeth don’t be thinking so hard like “oh man i can’t get gold teeth” who is going to say what to you we got love in our heart we good people can’t nobody tell you nothing if you doing it from the love and you’re embracing people try to have fun and try to be as less ignorant as possible and meet people i’m trying to set a tone for the younger generations you can look how you want but now you will be judged from your soul and your heart why i work everyday and why i love you guys so much is i want people to no longer as hard as it is to not judge somebody for the look but from their heart and their actions and their positivity and how much they put out there even if you’re pissed off still stay positive if you got a friend doing bad be like “stay positive” that’s the only way positivity happiness forgiving forgiving forgiving

forgiveness forgiving i think that’s number one forgive and say “man we only human man nobody hates you” we might feel that people hate us and people do mean but i go to sleep every night and i feel good despite the hate every day and the threats you take a deep breath and you know what you’re doing it for we’re all searching life for how we can serve humanity what are we going to do that we can do for free for the rest of our lives and feel good about how are you going to serve the humans

you know how i serve humanity spreading true love putting myself out there to be vulnerable to be criticized to be one of the most critiqued artists ever they’re like brrrr lil b said this at this time lil b is talking here it’s beautiful and i want to give this scarf to somebody too and real talk i want to give some books to the beautiful students that made this happen i’ve got a few of my rare books it’s love bro shouts out to seb i see you this is the first book i ever wrote when i was 19 we got the positive dvd in there you already know me because you’re seeing me right now you guys see my true core it’s not sketchy it’s no fraud it’s no corporation backing me i really love people i’m really here for the people i don’t care it’s not gimmicks i pick and choose what i want to do i deny a lot of people and i love it i stay rare nobody will ever work with lil b and that’s how it goes

i’m ready to die for the humans i’m ready to die for positivity i’m ready to be the poster a lot of hiphop artists don’t understand the position they’re in they be like “bruh i’m not a role model” and me i feel totally different i feel like i am a role model and we all are we all role models without y’all it’d be no me as a role model with the power influence whether it’s twitter followers or friends you always want to use your influence for positive things put down the guns please stop the gun violence stop the knife violence the chemical warfare let’s stop that biological warfare let’s stop that who knows about hydraulic fracking let’s stop fracking hey bruh stop messing with the earth bruh real talk we hear about these deadly gases going on in the earth and i’m like whodie for real i’m like whodie whodie get that oil out the ocean whodie

i see what we’re living in we were all born into something you have to salute the humans before us right i have no problem and no animosity because we’re in a beautiful place imperfections duh nothing is perfect but this is beautiful right here this moment we gotta be happy about something everything is not going to be right but we gotta be happy about something right now it’s continuous life living continuous rotations of life living like i said stop messing with this earth i’m going to be going in and learning new ways to protect the earth trust me i don’t even litter i’m not a litterer you see me and i’m not throwing trash on the ground if i throw this trash right here this is just adding for someone to pick up this is just adding for some animal to get stuck in at the end of the day it all starts from you

i had to take steps myself for people to believe in me i had to be a walking light of spiritual positivity and a walking beam of love before anybody could respect that you feel me it’s a big thing like people call me the based god out of respect people aren’t stupid people here are a high class of honor and people from the highest class call me the based god the based god came from positivity and love and from watching out for people i take that with heed when people call me the based god i accept me but i’m not the based god the based god is better than me it’s crazy you know it’s crazy but we all got a hand in love one by one each and every one of us needs to keep living and embedding that positivity look at that person they didn’t ask to be born they didn’t ask to be who they are it’s like man embrace their style look at somebody and be like “man they’re unique but how are we similar what is our commons”

my grammar and spelling and how i say things might not be technically what we hear or textbook but as long as you understand me you have to work as a human with empathy and love in your heart staying positive and staying based and staying normal you have to make an effort to learn about people you have to make an effort at your job you have to make an effort to care when you care about everybody genuinely when you look at everybody like they’re a million dollars it takes a lot of energy out you you give everybody a chance this is the successful lifestyle of personal excellence success is what you see on the outside but i live a life of personal excellence people can look at a bentley as success or money as success but at the end of the day personal excellence is what you strive for everybody is successful we all made it y’all are in college but now it’s about going back

i have no pride i have no pride issues i have no pride i can’t be under as well as be on top and that’s for the people that’s why i never signed a deal i’m unsigned i have no record label behind me when you see everything i do this is me pushing my love it was a lot of managers and fake managers that wanted to claim me and you have to watch out for the industry predators and predators in business and sexual predators we’ve dealt with that it’s a very touchy subject and it’s very uncomfortable for all of us anybody who has went through hardships like that i love y’all and the best i can tell y’all is to forgive cleanse your soul and forgive yourself don’t be hard on yourself

i don’t write my speeches any time i speak it will be from the heart you can’t write down love if i was a phony man y’all could look me in my face man if i didn’t have love and if i didn’t really care about the community and wanting people to excel—i want all of us as a human race to excel and stop being so hard on each other stop using separation stop saying “why are you dressed like that” what are you talking about like stop if someone looks different from you admire them stop thinking so hard about things have a light heart get lighthearted i think that’s a big tone of what i pray for everybody in the building and in our anythingispossible generation just be you the anythingispossible generation what is based what does based mean shwoo shwoo shwoo
