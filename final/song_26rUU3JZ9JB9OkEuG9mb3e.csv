chorus
there once was a saying that i used to say
back in the day when i met dre
i used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend proof
that if i went gold id go right through the roof
hed say what if you went platinum id just laugh at him
thats not happening that i cant fathom
eightysome million records worldwide later
im living in a house with a fucking elevator

verse 1
haters getting mad they done had enough of shady
you slay me nothing you say matters enough to touché me
rappers try to play me they use hailie as a ukulele
whoopsathatafuckingdaisy
thats a nono even she knows dadas fucking crazy
fucking animal cuckoo bananas fuckinga b
maybe its because i never had a mother raise me
fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
you may think its cause of the way that i was brought up
but its all caught up to me now karmas in the waters
every line i ever said has got me in a corner
you might think it doesnt creep up on ya but it all does

now your brains all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
i never thought itd come to this i oughta just be honest but
