she comes from a small town
she wouldve stole her moms car
crazy baby
she says she gonna make it far uptown
she wanna be a superstar right now
she says she gonna throw a party wild
she wanna be on movie screens
pretty baby she made it on that magazine
tuck down she aint the only one
this happens all the time and it goes on and on and on

chorus nicole scherzinger  william
lets go far away from home
ride on a rocket
burn down the boulevard burning it up
lets go far away from home
ride on a rocket
burn down the boulevard burning it up
i wanna run away from home
i dont wanna think about it
run baby run i dont wanna think about it
run away from home
i dont wanna think about it
burn down the boulevard burning it up
