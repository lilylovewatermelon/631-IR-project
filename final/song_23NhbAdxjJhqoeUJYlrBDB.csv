seal the urge which ensues with brass wires
i never meant you any harm
but your tears feel warm as they fall on my forearm
but close my eyes for a while
force from the world a patient smile
how can you say that your truth is better than ours
shoulder to shoulder now brother we carry no arms
the blind man sleeps in the doorway his home
if only i had an enemy bigger than my apathy i could have won
but i gave you all
i gave you all
i gave you all

close my eyes for a while
force from the world a patient smile

but i gave you all
i gave you all
i gave you all

and you rip it from my hands
and you swear its all gone
and you rip out all i have
just to say that youve won
and you rip it from my hands
and you swear its all gone
and you rip out all i have
just to say that youve won
youve won

well now youve won

but i gave you all
i gave you all
i gave you all

well now youve won

but i gave you allyou might also like5embed"
