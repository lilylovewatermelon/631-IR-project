aruba jamaica ooh i wanna take ya
bermuda bahama come on pretty mama
key largo montego
baby why dont we go
jamaica

verse 1
off the florida keys
theres a place called kokomo
thats where you wanna go
to get away from it all
bodies in the sand
tropical drink melting in your hand
well be falling in love
to the rhythm of a steel drum band
down in kokomo

chorus
aruba jamaica ooh i wanna take you to
bermuda bahama come on pretty mama
key largo montego
baby why dont we go
ooh i wanna take you down to kokomo
well get there fast
and then well take it slow
thats where we wanna go
way down in kokomo

verse 2
well put out to sea
well perfect our chemistry
by and by well defy
a little bit of gravity
afternoon delight
cocktails and moonlit nights
that dreamy look in your eye
give me a tropical contact high
way down in kokomo

chorus
aruba jamaica ooh i wanna take you to
bermuda bahama come on pretty mama
key largo montego
baby why dont we go
ooh i wanna take you down to kokomo
well get there fast
and then well take it slow
thats where we wanna go
way down in kokomo
port au prince i want to catch a glimpse
verse 3
everybody knows
a little place like kokomo
now if you wanna go
to get away from it all
go down to kokomo

chorus
aruba jamaica ooh i wanna take you to
bermuda bahama come on pretty mama
key largo montego
baby why dont we go
ooh i wanna take you down to kokomo
well get there fast
and then well take it slow
thats where we wanna go
way down in kokomo
aruba jamaica ooh i wanna take you to
bermuda bahama come on pretty mama
