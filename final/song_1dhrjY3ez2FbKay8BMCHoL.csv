now your bowl is empty
and your feet are cold
and your body cannot stop rocking i know

verse 2
since the day we found you
you have been our friend
and your voice still echoes in the hallways of this house
but now its the end
you might also likebridge
we will be with you
when youre leaving
we will be with you
when you go
we will be with you
and hold you til youre quiet
it hurts to let you go

we will be with you ohooh
we will be with you no
you will stay with us10embed"
