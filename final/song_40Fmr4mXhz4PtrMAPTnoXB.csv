1 samuel 73
and samuel said to all the house of israel
if you arе returning to the lord with all your heart
thеn put away the foreign gods and the ashtaroth from among you
and direct your heart to the lord and serve him only
he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistines
so the people put away the baals and the ashtaroth
and they served the lord onlyembed"
