prechorus
decompressin tryna ease the tension but you
got me stressin feelin like i need to call when
you sneak up on me tell me that you miss me in your life

chorus
i cant read your mind
you say that you need to be alone
but night and day want me at your beck and call
you say you know that you might be crossin a line
wastin all our time
to think that we could be casual
youre not my friend and baby you never were
why the fuss if you say you just wanna be mine
