one two three four
ooh ooh

verse 1
every time you come around you know i cant say no
every time the sun goes down i let you take control
i can feel the paradise before my world implodes
and tonight had something wonderful

chorus
my bad habits lead to late nights endin alone
conversations with a stranger i barely know
swearin thisll be the last but it probably wont
i got nothin left to lose or use or do
my bad habits lead to wide eyes starin at space
and i know i lose control of the things that i say
yeah i was lookin for a way out now i cant escape
nothin happens after two its truе its true
my bad habits lead to you

every pure intention ends when the good times start
fallin over everything to reach the first times spark
it started under neon lights and then it all got dark
i only know how to go too far

chorus
my bad habits lead to late nights endin alone
conversations with a stranger i barely know
swearin thisll be the last but it probably wont
i got nothin left to lose or use or do
my bad habits lead to wide eyes starin at space
and i know i lose control of the things that i say
yeah i was lookin for a way out now i cant escape
nothin happens after two its true its true
my bad habits lead to you

we took the long way round
and burned till the fun ran out now
chorus
my bad habits lead to late nights endin alone
conversations with a stranger i barely know
swearin thisll be the last but it probably wont
i got nothin left to lose or use or do
my bad habits lead to wide eyes starin at space
and i know i lose control of the things that i say
yeah i was lookin for a way out now i cant escape
nothin happens after two its true its true
my bad habits lead to you
