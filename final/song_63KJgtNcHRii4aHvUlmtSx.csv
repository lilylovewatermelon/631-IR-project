somewhere life is good and things go as they should
its hard to find but thats alright yeah yeah
searching for the way push harder everyday
its deep inside that shining light yeah yeah
but im scarred by barriers placed in my path
im scathed

chorus
this ride that takes me through life
leads me into darkness but emerges into light
no one can ever slow me down
ill stay unbound

verse 2
sometimes when were young and always on the run
it gets so dark and i know that place yeah yeah
so dont be too concerned youve got a lot to learn
well so do i and weve got plenty of time yeah yeah
dont fall off the track yet with so many races to go
hold on

chorus
this ride that takes me through life
leads me into darkness but emerges into light
no one can ever slow me down
ill stay unbound

some live so wrong with what we do is each his own
but living in fear endless shame for countless years
i never lived in fear i knew id die another day
i never viewed my life as something slipping away
some live so wrong with what we do is each his own
but living in fear endless shame for countless years
i never lived in fear i knew id die another day
i never viewed my life as something slipping away
outro kids
theres nothing here to take for granted
with each breath that we take
the hands of time strip youth from our bodies
and we fade
memories remain
as time goes on
theres nothing here to take for granted
with each breath that we take
the hands of time strip youth from our bodies
and we fade
memories remain
as time goes on8embed"
