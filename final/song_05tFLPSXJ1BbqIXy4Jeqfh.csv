darker times
theyre telling boulderheavy lies
looks like all weve got is each other
the truth is obsolete
remember when all i had was my mother
she didnt compromise
she could recognize
voodoo
our daughters and our sons
are just candles in the sun
voodoo
dont let him see divide hmm
dont you let her see divide
voodoo

chorus
shes got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
hes got the whole wide world in his pants
he wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
then put the whole wide world on her hands
shes got the whole wide world in her hands
hes got the whole wide world in his hands in his hands

outro
theres somethin about you
i cant believe im even talking to you tellin you this right now
youre special
i wish you could see what i see
