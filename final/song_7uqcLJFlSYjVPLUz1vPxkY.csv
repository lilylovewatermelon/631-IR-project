verse xxxtentacion
listen close what is this
is it heartbreak
is it truly what it feels like
what it sound like
what is truly at the essence
sharp teeth in the chest
cancer all in the breast
of the beaten and bruised
feelin like a pawn to the greed of these fools
but i never been a piece of the evil
in the womb of these fake fuck niggas
with they masks up presume
ill be telling if i got a load i swear i resume
on my conquest
for the key to the chest where my mind slept
and the love in my heart is a cancer
and i spread it through the wall as an answer
to the cries of the dead and the vanquished
the depressed and the lost and the damned its
preservation of the peace an ideal world
never lonely when you flowin through my mind girl
i apologize cause i couldnt see the pain in your damn eyes
cause a nigga made you leave with your heart in between different pains
couldnt see ya when ya aint cry

i guess im at a loss for words
to feel so close to someone and for them to be gone the next day
i guess you never realize how permanently damaging that is179embed"
