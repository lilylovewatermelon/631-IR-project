you were too bad for a little square town
with your hiphop hat and your pants on the ground
heard you cussed out mamma pushed daddy around
before you took off in his car
here you are runnin these dirty old streets
tattoo on your neck fake gold on your teeth
got the hood here snowed but you cant fool me
we both know who you are

chorus
homeboy youre gonna wish one day you were sittin on the gate of a truck by the lake
with your high school flame on one side
ice cold beer on the other
aint no shame in a blue collar forty
little house little kids little small town story
if you dont ever do anything else for me
just do this for me brother
come on home boy

verse 2
i was haulin this hay to uncle joes farm
i thought of us bare foot kids in the yard
man it seems we were just catchin snakes in the barn
now youre caught up in this mess
i can use a little help unloadin these bales
i can keep ya pretty busy with a hammer and a nail
aint a glamorous life but itll keep you outta jail
and not worry us all to death
