verse 1
just this morning over coffee
i sat there crying cause youre gone long gone
i didnt know just how much i was gonna miss you
til i spent my first night alone

chorus
am i blue yes im blue
how could i have been such a fool
now look at all the misery im going through
am i blue am i blue

instrumental bridge

verse 2
tried to call and say im sorry
i couldnt get you on the line
youll never know just how much im wishing you would show up
and say youve changed your mind
