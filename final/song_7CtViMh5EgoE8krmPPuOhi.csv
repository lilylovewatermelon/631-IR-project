long before your smile
and the pages have always been blank
like the trees in the wild
but the wind yes the wind
keeps pushing you and me
and time in time
i know when its time to leave

and the memories we made
will never be lost no
and the look on your face
we both knew the cost

but the wind yes the wind keeps howling

i put in the pictures
you put in the time
you put all those memories so deep inside my mind
now the wind yes the wind keeps
pushing you and me
and time in time
i know when its time to leave

and the memories we made
will never be lost no
and the look on your face
we both knew the cost
see the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likebut the wind yes the wind keeps howling

even if it was a mistake
i cant forget your face
even if it was just a day
you wont forget the one
whos making you shake

even if it was a mistake
i cant forget your face
even if it was just a day
you wont forget the man
whos making you shake

whos making you shake
you shake
ahhhhh making you shake
you shake
ahhhhh making you shake5embed"
