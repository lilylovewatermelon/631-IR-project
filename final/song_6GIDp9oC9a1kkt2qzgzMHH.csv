can you see me now
can you see me now
can you see

verse 1
all this weeping in the air
who can tell where it will fall
through floating forests in the air
cross the rolling open sea
blow a kiss i run through air
leave the past find nowhere
floating forests in the air
clowns all around you

chorus
clowns that only let you know
where you let your senses go
clowns all around you
its a cross i need to bear
all this black and cruel despair
this is an emergency
dont you hide your eyes from me
open them and see me now

postchorus

verse 2
see me here in the air
not holding on to anywhere
but holding on so beware
i have secrets i wont share
see me here pushing you
if i then deny i do
contemplate or wish away
if i ask you not to stay

chorus
clowns that only let you know
where you let your senses go
clowns all around you
its a cross i need to bear
all this black and cruel despair
this is an emergency
dont you hide your eyes from me
open them and see me now
