trunk full of yola heres the situation
flash light in my eyes he want my registration
should i stay or should i run
got hard got soft got pills got guns
my driver license is revoked
just got done burning so i know he smell the smoke
but never let em see you sweat
cause if he search the trunk he might find the tec
or bag full of os wrapped in duct tape between some dirty ass clothes
but i talked to him the right way
he told me slow it down and have a nice day

hook
you can do your thing shawty its ok to floss
but there still one rule player dont get caught
for everything you gained and everything you lost
but there still one rule pimpin dont get caught
for every ho you hit dawg and every ho you tossed
cause there still one rule player dont get caught
and you can ride clean shawty you aint got to walk
but there still one rule player dont get caught

verse 2
some niggas rob some niggas slang
some niggas stack some niggas bang
but i congratulate not playa hate
you in the streets pimpin make your move get your cake
fuck what you heard through the grape vine
you out of line nigga imma straighten mine
and i dont believe in wasting time
well catch them hoes later stay on your grind
got a low tolerance for ignorance
you think its pleasure i think its business
the streets didnt raise no fool
when you live by the code nigga theres only one rule
you might also likehook

verse 3
got the phone call had a funny feeling
told him everything was cool that i was chilling
we used to chill out and smoke blunts
and i aint seen him in awhile maybe a couple months
he said he wondered why he seemed anxious
first thing on my mind is go and get the stainless
make his folks pay a ransom bout him
on that bullshit make a good example out of him
this nigga hot he on fire
i hope his ass aint wearing no wire
nah dog you bullshitting
said his partner set him up that nigga snitching
