one two three four five years go by
i dont really know why i dont really know why
six eight nine eleven years go by
i dont really know why i dont really know why
i still feel the same way i did when i was seventeen
i still look over my shoulder waitin for the world to change

chorus
but these are the good old days
these are the good old days
these are the good old days
and i think id like to stay
oh id like to stay
oh id like to stay

verse 2
one two three four five years ago
i didnt see a belly with a child on the inside
six seven eight ten years ago i thought i knew about love
i only knew about the fight
i look back and i realize all those times i was lonely
praying for someday to hurry up and come and save me

chorus
but these are the good old days
these are the good old days
these are the good old days
and i wish that i could stay
i wish that i could stay
i wish that i could stay

and the more that you let go
the faster the time goes
the darker the night is
the lighter the moon glows

these are the good old days
