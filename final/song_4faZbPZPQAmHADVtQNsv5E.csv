i was watching
with one eye on the other side
i had fifteen people telling me to move
i got moving on my mind
i found shelter
in some thoughts turning wheels around
i said 39 times that i love you
to the beauty i had found

chorus
well its 1 2 3 4
take the elevator
at the hotel yorba
ill be glad to see you later
all they got inside is vacancy

verse 2
i been thinking
of a little place down by the lake
they got a dirty old road leading up to the house
i wonder how long it will take til were alone
sitting on the front porch of that home
stomping our feet on the wooden boards
never gotta worry about locking the door

well its 1 2 3 4
take the elevator
at the hotel yorba
ill be glad to see you later
all they got inside is vacancy

verse 3
it might sound silly
for me to think childish thoughts like these
but im so tired of acting tough
and im gonna do what i please
lets get married
in a big cathedral by a priest
cause if im the man that you love the most
you could say i do at least

chorus
well its 1 2 3 4
take the elevator
at the hotel yorba
ill be glad to see you later
all they got inside is vacancy

and its 4 5 6 7
grab your umbrella
grab hold of me
cause im your favorite fella
all they got inside is vacancy1embed"
