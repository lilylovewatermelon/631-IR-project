one

verse 1
ive got some good friends with some loose ends that remind me of myself
they can drink as much as me and they can smoke me half to hell
and by the end of these songs when we bring our asses home
theyll all be thankin god that theyre not in this pain alone

verse 2
and this world has been so cruel to me and its been the same to them
but i dont mind sharin my sweet depression
with some boys who act just like me and a girl who does the same
i dont know how i got here but im glad as hell i came

chorus
come as you are however broken
and we will see if we can make you whole again
come as you are with your heart wide open
the bridges that youve burned they are still there just floatin

verse 3
remember us in our brighteyed days too young to go inside
sittin drunk on curbs tryna get us ourselves a rise
of the pretty girls who walk down there on elgin avenue
oklahoma sure is flat but it has itself a view
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeverse 4
and how am i supposed to know the good times that im in
if the good is only seen when im lookin back at them
the boys are gettin off work and theyre haulin on home
if i am meant for anything its to show you youre not alone

chorus
come as you are however broken
and we will see if we can make you whole again
come as you are with your heart wide open
bridges that youve burned they are still there just floatin

bridge
ive got some good friends with some loose ends that remind me of myself
they can drink as much as me and they can smoke me half to hell
and by the end of these songs when we bring our asses home
theyll all be thankin god were not in this pain alone

chorus
come as you are however broken
and we will see if we can make you whole again
come as you are with your heart wide open
bridges that youve burned they are still there just floatinembed"
