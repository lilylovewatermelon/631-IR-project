smoking weed and say your prayers
liquor stores are everywhere
wonder if they ever cared

verse 1
i live in the fast lane committed so i cut off the brake line
aint with the gossip fuck what you done heard from the grapevine
dreaming so i had the vision i had to get it
nights with the baddest women couple of bad decisions
feeling in the city nights turn to early mornings
mama prayin for us we ignored the early warnings
on the run from the war the prеacher called me up to pray
askеd me if ill ever change i told him not today
ive been living like this for too long
i dont know if ill ever move on
same old beat but its a new song
paranoid so i sleep with my shoes on

chorus
i just want my last joint tell me whats the point cause im still fucked up
ive been living in a codeine dream but this lean cant fill me up
no matter what its all the same
its not enough to kill my pain
i just want my last joint tell me whats the point cause im still fucked up
no matter what its all the same
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 2
fill the paper with reefer then go and hit the liquor store
that bottle and mary janes the only friend i know
i had people i love that i end up burying
howd they go from popping pills to shooting heroine
thinkin bout my partner im standing at his grave
im tryna tell his mama its gon be okay
what do you say when somebodys so heartbroke
their rents past due and theyre late on their car note
ive been through it
i keep looking for the light at the end of the tunnel
its my life and im the type that keeps fighting the struggle
since a youngin always found my way right to the trouble
i think the storms coming i feel lightning and thunder

chorus
i just want my last joint tell me whats the point cause im still fucked up
ive been living in a codeine dream but this lean cant fill me up
no matter what its all the same
its not enough to kill my pain
i just want my last joint tell me whats the point cause im still fucked up
ive been living in a codeine dream but this lean cant fill me up
no matter what its all the same
its not enough to kill my painembed"
