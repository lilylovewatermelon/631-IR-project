people keep talking
but i cant hear a word they say
life just keeps moving
the world gets stranger every day

prechorus
and yeah time is on your side
thats what people tell you
but i got to let you go

chorus
my head is saying that this is for the better
i just want you to know
i cant hold on forever
when all i wanna do is let go
all i wanna do is let go

verse 2
sirens are screaming
but i cant hear a single sound
and im feeling uneasy
and i wait and i wait for a change to come around

chorus
i get the feeling that this is for the better
and i just want you to know
i cant hold on forever
when all i wanna do is let go
all i wanna do is let go
