verse 1 wiz khalifa
put it in a joint not a blunt
dont disrespect mine player
this not the two this the one
dont even need a scale
back in high school i used to be the weedman
quarter ounces half ounces what you need man
11th grade made my way up to a p man
and sent it back if i ever seen a seed man
and you dont even gotta ask
you know it by the smell
i treat every day like its a payday
top down counting up the cake and
