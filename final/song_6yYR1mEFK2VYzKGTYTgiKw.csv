why do i just lie awake and think of you
i need some sleep
tomorrow i have things to do
every time i close my eyes i see your face
so i try to read but all i do is lose my place

chorus
am i obsessed with you
i do my best not to want you
but i do all the time
i do all the time

verse 2
i just had to call you up and say hello
i know its 3 am
and i saw you a while ago
but i still have this aching pain to hear your voice
to know youre there
i dont seem to have any choice

chorus
am i obsessed with you
i do my best not to want you
but i do all the time
i do all the time

im so sorry i just had to wake you up
i feel so lonely by myself
is this the way it feels when youre in love
or is this something else
yeah

chorus
am i obsessed with you
i do my best not to want you
but i do all the time
want you all the time
ooh yeah but i do all the time
i want you all the time
am i obsessed with you2embed"
