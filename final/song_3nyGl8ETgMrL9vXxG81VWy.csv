youre falling further down but ive got you by a thread
i wrap the cord around my arms until my hands start to turn red
but its not enough it wont be enough to save you
hmm

verse 2
shes so in love with all the things i hate most about myself
im so in love with all the sounds she makes when she smiles and well
its a little tough to put acorn shells on ice sheets
without breaking through and flooding the whole town

bridge
i hope youre alright
i didnt wanna wake up last night
cause i quite liked the dream i had of holding your hand
its funny how slowly time goes when my thoughts have been racin all this time

verse 3
its alright to feel a little bit of darkness now and then
i know ive said it once but i still tell myself again and again
youll never be enough but what is enough
youre selfless isnt that enough

verse 4
banana bread before i go to bed will put the bees to sleep
otherwise theyd buzz and sting my lungs all night inside of me
just wait a little while you dont cry too much
you know that when you smile the sun shines more gentlysee cavetown liveget tickets as low as 86you might also like5embed"
