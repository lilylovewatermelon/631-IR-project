verse 1 j cole
now i aint got no kids yet but this right heres for practice
i hate to get the seats in the benz wet but thats how good your ass is
make an old man get his glasses make wesley pay his taxes
then follow your moves all week on twitter probly make a gay nigga reconsider
youre now rockin with the best mane dress game down to the sex game
wont brag but the boy been blessed mane let you play with the stick ovechkin
she callin she textin shes fallin but let me explain
gotta tell your old boyfriend skate girl cause a nigga dont play them ex games
nope straight sexing no handcuff or arresting
