girl i know this might seem strange
but let me know if im out of order for stepping to you this way
see ive been watching you for a while
and i just gotta let you know that im really feeling your style
cause i have to know your name
and leave you with my number and i hope that you would call me someday
if you want you can give me yours too
and if you dont well i aint mad at you we can still be cool cause

im not trying to pressure you
just cant stop thinkin bout you
you aint even really gotta be my girlfriend
i just wanna know your name and maybe some time
we can hook up hang out just chill

verse 2
damn im surprised that you called
cause the way you walked away i thought i wasnt gon see you no more
since you didnt wanna give me your math
i thought that you were iggin me and wasnt diggin me
but anyway what you doing tonight
ill probably be with my peeps if its cool with you maybe well swing by
and you can just chill with us or you can just chill with me
long as youre comfortable and you feel secure when youre with me cause
