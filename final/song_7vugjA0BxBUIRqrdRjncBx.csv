a little trouble in the city
trouble in my home
she told me love dont live here anymore
i wanna run to the light
its too dark in this part of night
i need somebody who can make it right

and its on tonight
how about we go and save the night
i can see you want it and so do i
how about we go and save the night
lets save the night

verse 2

and if your gonna go out
