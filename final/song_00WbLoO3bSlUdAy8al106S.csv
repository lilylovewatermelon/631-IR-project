gently my mind escapes
into the relaxing world of pleasure
a pleasure thatll take my mind
off the reality of my life
my past life life as i know it now
and whatever may come it slowly disappears
to somewhere in the back of my mind
it will remain there
until i wish to retrieve it

verse 2 corey taylor
yes i will stay here for a while for i need the break
a break from the pressures of life
and everything that lays in the palm of lifes hands
