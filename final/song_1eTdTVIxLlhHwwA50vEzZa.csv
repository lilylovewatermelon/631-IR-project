i keep doing that thing where im thinking again
i got skeletons in my closet closet
i got nightmares sleeping again
i gave you my heart you lost it lost it
shes a girl from a small town but were in a big city
and shes in my passenger seat right now
cause we live in a small world
i told her its all yours
but i need to know if youre down
i cant help it i cant help it
yeah yeah yeah yeah

and she was the first face i was looking to call mine

and i got issues we can fight about all night
