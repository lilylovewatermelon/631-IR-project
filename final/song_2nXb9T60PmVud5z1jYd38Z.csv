i picked up the phone
she said hey its me
i know it feels like forever
since ive heard your voice
but i guess thats how it had to be
so we talked awhile
still she said i better go
but before we hung up she said
theres something you need to know

chorus
i found someone
it just happened outta the blue
even though im moving on
it dont mean that i dont still love you
youll always have
a place here in my heart
but somewhere in this new life ive begun
i found someone

verse 2
well i wasnt surprised
still it hit me kind of hard
its hard to believe a little space and time
could turn into miles and worlds apart
i said im happy for you
you deserve the very best
since youve been gone
ive done some praying
some searching for myself

and i found someone
it just happened outta the blue
and even though im moving on
it dont mean that i dont still love you
youll always have
a place here in my heart
but somewhere in this new life ive begun
i found someone

bridge
but it took tears and time down on my knees
and its not who youd ever guess
or who i dreamed itd be
but in the mirror one morning looking back at me

chorus
i found someone
just happened out of the blue
and it took everything i had
it took me losing you
but youll always have
a place here in my heart
but somewhere in this new life ive begun
looking for my place under the sun
i found someone2embed"
