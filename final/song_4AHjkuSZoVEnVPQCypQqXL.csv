hey hey hey

verse 1
the way that girl can break a heart
its like a work of art
and this is the worst part
she knows it
and shes so confident
that shes what everybody wants
but nobody wants
her to know that

prechorus
so fall back on all of your premonitions
and just learn to listen
to those that have more wisdom than you
and just stop putting so much stock
in all of this stuff
live your life for those that you love

chorus
and im still waiting for
you to be the one im waiting for

the way that girl can turn a head
well she is such a threat
but dont ever forget
she knows it
and shes got it all
all figured out
and she wont let you doubt
she knows it

chorus
im still waiting for
you to be the one im waiting for
im still waiting for
you to be the one im waiting for

prechorus
so fall back on all of your premonitions
and just learn to listen
to those that have more wisdom than you
and just stop putting so much stock
in all of this stuff
live your life for those that you love

chorus
im still waiting for
you to be the one im waiting for
im still waiting for
you to be the one im waiting for
something tells me that this is gonna make sense
something tells me its gonna take patience
im still waiting for
im still waiting for
something tells me that this will all work out in the end
you to be the one im waiting forembed"
