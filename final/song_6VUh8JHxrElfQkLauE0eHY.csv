old man shockin corn and coilin copper
hes about the only business in town
that aint been boughted up fore the bank shut down

at first glance you might think times are hard

there aint no coal comin out of that shaft
theres rust all over the railroad tracks
you cant see nothing but a big old black
cloud up in the sky
and if the good lord dont see fit
to send a little sun down on these pines
thats fine
old leonard gonna make us shine

way back and before these mines were tapped
he had a bigger dot there on the map
who knows it might get better again
and who cares that train aint rollin in

look beyond theyre comin round the mountain

there aint no coal comin out of that shaft
theres rust all over the railroad tracks
you cant see nothing but a big old black
cloud up in the sky
and if the good lord dont see fit
to send a little sun down on these pines
thats fine
old leonard gonna make us shine
hes gonna make us shine
see randy houser liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likethere aint no coal comin out of that shaft
theres rust all over the railroad tracks
you cant see nothing but a big old black
cloud up in the sky
and if the good lord dont see fit
to send a little sun down on these pines
thats fine
thatll be just fine
old leonard gonna make us shine

old leonard gonna make us shine
old leonards gonna make us shine
gonna make us shineembed"
