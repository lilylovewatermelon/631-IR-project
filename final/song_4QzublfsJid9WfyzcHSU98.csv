during the first half of those years berkshire’s net worth was roughly equal to the number that really counts the intrinsic value of the business the similarity of the two figures existed then because most of our resources were deployed in marketable securities that were regularly revalued to their quoted prices less the tax that would be incurred if they were to be sold in wall street parlance our balance sheet was then in very large part “marked to market”

by the early 1990s however our focus had changed to the outright ownership of businesses a shift that diminished the relevance of balancesheet figures that disconnect occurred because the accounting rules that apply to controlled companies are materially different from those used in valuing marketable securities the carrying value of the “losers” we own is written down but “winners” are never revalued upwards

we’ve had experience with both outcomes i’ve made some dumb purchases and the amount i paid for the economic goodwill of those companies was later written off a move that reduced berkshire’s book value we’ve also had some winners — a few of them very big — but have not written those up by a penny

over time this asymmetrical accounting treatment with which we agree necessarily widens the gap between intrinsic value and book value today the large — and growing — unrecorded gains at our “winners” make it clear that berkshire’s intrinsic value far exceeds its book value that’s why we would be delighted to repurchase our shares should they sell as low as 120 of book value at that level purchases would instantly and meaningfully increase pershare intrinsic value for berkshire’s continuing shareholders

the unrecorded increase in the value of our owned businesses explains why berkshire’s aggregate market value gain — tabulated on the facing page — materially exceeds our bookvalue gain the two indicators vary erratically over short periods last year for example bookvalue performance was superior over time however marketvalue gains should continue their historical tendency to exceed gains in book value

     all pershare figures used in this report apply to berkshire’s a shares figures for the b shares are 11500th of those shown for athe year at berkshirecharlie munger berkshire vice chairman and my partner and i expect berkshire’s normalized earning power to increase every year actual yeartoyear earnings of course will sometimes decline because of weakness in the us economy or possibly because of insurance megacatastrophes in some years the normalized gains will be small at other times they will be material last year was a good one here are the highlights             the most important development at berkshire during 2015 was not financial though it led to better earnings after a poor performance in 2014 our bnsf railroad dramatically improved its service to customers last year to attain that result we invested about 58 billion during the year in capital expenditures a sum far and away the record for any american railroad and nearly three times our annual depreciation charge it was money well spent

bnsf moves about 17 of america’s intercity freight measured by revenue tonmiles whether transported by rail truck air water or pipeline in that respect we are a strong number one among the seven large american railroads two of which are canadianbased carrying 45 more tonmiles of freight than our closest competitor consequently our maintaining firstclass service is not only vital to our shippers’ welfare but also important to the smooth functioning of the us economy

for most american railroads 2015 was a disappointing year aggregate tonmiles fell and earnings weakened as well bnsf however maintained volume and pretax income rose to a record 68 billion a gain of 606 million from 2014 matt rose and carl ice the managers of bnsf have my thanks and deserve yours

 throughout this letter all earnings are stated on a pretax basis unless otherwise designated                       bnsf is the largest of our “powerhouse five” a group that also includes berkshire hathaway energy marmon lubrizol and imc combined these companies — our five most profitable noninsurance businesses — earned 131 billion in 2015 an increase of 650 million over 2014

of the five only berkshire hathaway energy then earning 393 million was owned by us in 2003 subsequently we purchased three of the other four on an allcash basis in acquiring bnsf however we paid about 70 of the cost in cash and for the remainder issued berkshire shares that increased the number outstanding by 61 in other words the 127 billion gain in annual earnings delivered berkshire by the five companies over the twelveyear span has been accompanied by only minor dilution that satisfies our goal of not simply increasing earnings but making sure we also increase pershare results                       next year i will be discussing the “powerhouse six” the newcomer will be precision castparts corp “pcc” a business that we purchased a month ago for more than 32 billion of cash pcc fits perfectly into the berkshire model and will substantially increase our normalized pershare earning power

under ceo mark donegan pcc has become the world’s premier supplier of aerospace components most of them destined to be original equipment though spares are important to the company as well mark’s accomplishments remind me of the magic regularly performed by jacob harpaz at imc our remarkable israeli manufacturer of cutting tools the two men transform very ordinary raw materials into extraordinary products that are used by major manufacturers worldwide each is the da vinci of his craft

pcc’s products often delivered under multiyear contracts are key components in most large aircraft other industries are served as well by the company’s 30466 employees who work out of 162 plants in 13 countries in building his business mark has made many acquisitions and will make more we look forward to having him deploy berkshire’s capital
a personal thankyou the pcc acquisition would not have happened without the input and assistance of our own todd combs who brought the company to my attention a few years ago and went on to educate me about both the business and mark though todd and ted weschler are primarily investment managers — they each handle about 9 billion for us — both of them cheerfully and ably add major value to berkshire in other ways as well hiring these two was one of my best moves                       with the pcc acquisition berkshire will own 10 1⁄4 companies that would populate the fortune 500 if they were standalone businesses our 27 holding of kraft heinz is the 1⁄4 that leaves just under 98 of america’s business giants that have yet to call us operators are standing by                       our many dozens of smaller noninsurance businesses earned 57 billion last year up from 51 billion in 2014 within this group we have one company that last year earned more than 700 million two that earned between 400 million and 700 million seven that earned between 250 million and 400 million six that earned between 100 million and 250 million and eleven that earned between 50 million and 100 million we love them all this collection of businesses will expand both in number and earnings as the years go by                       when you hear talk about america’s crumbling infrastructure rest assured that they’re not talking about berkshire we invested 16 billion in property plant and equipment last year a full 86 of it deployed in the united states

i told you earlier about bnsf’s record capital expenditures in 2015 at the end of every year our railroad’s physical facilities will be improved from those existing twelve months earlier

berkshire hathaway energy “bhe” is a similar story that company has invested 16 billion in renewables and now owns 7 of the country’s wind generation and 6 of its solar generation indeed the 4423 megawatts of wind generation owned and operated by our regulated utilities is six times the generation of the runnerup utility

we’re not done last year bhe made major commitments to the future development of renewables in support of the paris climate change conference our fulfilling those promises will make great sense both for the environment and for berkshire’s economics                       berkshire’s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2015 — that makes 13 years in a row — and increased its float during those years our float — money that doesn’t belong to us but that we can invest for berkshire’s benefit — grew from 41 billion to 88 billion though neither that gain nor the size of our float is reflected in berkshire’s earnings float generates significant investment income because of the assets it allows us to hold

meanwhile our underwriting profit totaled 26 billion during the 13year period including 18 billion earned in 2015 without a doubt berkshire’s largest unrecorded wealth lies in its insurance business we’ve spent 48 years building this multifaceted operation and it can’t be replicated                       while charlie and i search for new businesses to buy our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolton acquisitions last year we contracted for 29 boltons scheduled to cost 634 million in aggregate the cost of these purchases ranged from 300000 to 143 million

charlie and i encourage boltons if they are sensiblypriced most deals offered us most definitely aren’t these purchases deploy capital in operations that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed by our corps of expert managers that means no additional work for us yet more earnings for berkshire a combination we find highly appealing we will make many dozens of bolton deals in future years                       our heinz partnership with jorge paulo lemann alex behring and bernardo hees more than doubled its size last year by merging with kraft before this transaction we owned about 53 of heinz at a cost of
425 billion now we own 3254 million shares of kraft heinz about 27 that cost us 98 billion the new company has annual sales of 27 billion and can supply you heinz ketchup or mustard to go with your oscar mayer hot dogs that come from the kraft side add a coke and you will be enjoying my favorite meal we will have the oscar mayer wienermobile at the annual meeting — bring your kids

though we sold no kraft heinz shares “gaap” generally accepted accounting principles required us to record a 68 billion writeup of our investment upon completion of the merger that leaves us with our kraft heinz holding carried on our balance sheet at a value many billions above our cost and many billions below its market value an outcome only an accountant could love

berkshire also owns kraft heinz preferred shares that pay us 720 million annually and are carried at 77 billion on our balance sheet that holding will almost certainly be redeemed for 832 billion in june the earliest date allowed under the preferred’s terms that will be good news for kraft heinz and bad news for berkshire

jorge paulo and his associates could not be better partners we share with them a passion to buy build and hold large businesses that satisfy basic needs and desires we follow different paths however in pursuing this goal

their method at which they have been extraordinarily successful is to buy companies that offer an opportunity for eliminating many unnecessary costs and then — very promptly — to make the moves that will get the job done their actions significantly boost productivity the allimportant factor in america’s economic growth over the past 240 years without more output of desired goods and services per working hour — that’s the measure of productivity gains — an economy inevitably stagnates at much of corporate america truly major gains in productivity are possible a fact offering opportunities to jorge paulo and his associates

at berkshire we too crave efficiency and detest bureaucracy to achieve our goals however we follow an approach emphasizing avoidance of bloat buying businesses such as pcc that have long been run by costconscious and efficient managers after the purchase our role is simply to create an environment in which these ceos — and their eventual successors who typically are likeminded — can maximize both their managerial effectiveness and the pleasure they derive from their jobs with this handsoff style i am heeding a wellknown mungerism “if you want to guarantee yourself a lifetime of misery be sure to marry someone with the intent of changing their behavior”

we will continue to operate with extreme — indeed almost unheard of — decentralization at berkshire but we will also look for opportunities to partner with jorge paulo either as a financing partner as was the case when his group purchased tim horton’s or as a combined equityandfinancing partner as at heinz we also may occasionally partner with others as we have successfully done at berkadia

berkshire however will join only with partners making friendly acquisitions to be sure certain hostile offers are justified some ceos forget that it is shareholders for whom they should be working while other managers are woefully inept in either case directors may be blind to the problem or simply reluctant to make the change required that’s when new faces are needed we though will leave these “opportunities” for others at berkshire we go only where we are welcome                       berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “big four” investments — american express cocacola ibm and wells fargo we purchased additional shares of ibm increasing our ownership to 84 versus 78 at yearend 2014 and wells fargo going to 98 from 94 at the other two companies cocacola and american express stock repurchases raised our percentage ownership our equity in cocacola grew from 92 to 93 and our interest in american express increased from 148 to 156 in case you think these seemingly small changes aren’t important consider this math for the four companies in aggregate each increase of one percentage point in our ownership raises berkshire’s portion of their annual earnings by about 500 million
these four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and shareholderoriented their returns on tangible equity range from excellent to staggering at berkshire we much prefer owning a noncontrolling but substantial portion of a wonderful company to owning 100 of a soso business it’s better to have a partial interest in the hope diamond than to own all of a rhinestone

if berkshire’s yearend holdings are used as the marker our portion of the “big four’s” 2015 earnings amounted to 47 billion in the earnings we report to you however we include only the dividends they pay us — about 18 billion last year but make no mistake the nearly 3 billion of these companies’ earnings we don’t report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion berkshire records

the earnings our investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock — a move that increases berkshire’s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime the retained earnings of these companies also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous all that leads us to expect that the pershare earnings of these four investees in aggregate will grow substantially over time if gains do indeed materialize dividends to berkshire will increase and so too will our unrealized capital gains

our flexibility in capital allocation — our willingness to invest large sums passively in noncontrolled businesses — gives us a significant edge over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they will operate woody allen once explained that the advantage of being bisexual is that it doubles your chance of finding a date on saturday night in like manner — well not exactly like manner — our appetite for either operating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of finding sensible uses for berkshire’s endless gusher of cash beyond that having a huge portfolio of marketable securities gives us a stockpile of funds that can be tapped when an elephantsized acquisition is offered to us                  

it’s an election year and candidates can’t stop speaking about our country’s problems which of course only they can solve as a result of this negative drumbeat many americans now believe that their children will not live as well as they themselves do

that view is dead wrong the babies being born in america today are the luckiest crop in history

american gdp per capita is now about 56000 as i mentioned last year that — in real terms — is a staggering six times the amount in 1930 the year i was born a leap far beyond the wildest dreams of my parents or their contemporaries us citizens are not intrinsically more intelligent today nor do they work harder than did americans in 1930 rather they work far more efficiently and thereby produce far more this allpowerful trend is certain to continue america’s economic magic remains alive and well

some commentators bemoan our current 2 per year growth in real gdp — and yes we would all like to see a higher rate but let’s do some simple math using the muchlamented 2 figure that rate we will see delivers astounding gains
america’s population is growing about 8 per year 5 from births minus deaths and 3 from net migration thus 2 of overall growth produces about 12 of per capita growth that may not sound impressive but in a single generation of say 25 years that rate of growth leads to a gain of 344 in real gdp per capita compounding’s effects produce the excess over the percentage that would result by simply multiplying 25 x 12 in turn that 344 gain will produce a staggering 19000 increase in real gdp per capita for the next generation were that to be distributed equally the gain would be 76000 annually for a family of four today’s politicians need not shed tears for tomorrow’s children

indeed most of today’s children are doing well all families in my upper middleclass neighborhood regularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by john d rockefeller sr at the time of my birth his unparalleled fortune couldn’t buy what we now take for granted whether the field is — to name just a few — transportation entertainment communication or medical services rockefeller certainly had power and fame he could not however live as well as my neighbors now do

though the pie to be shared by the next generation will be far larger than today’s how it will be divided will remain fiercely contentious just as is now the case there will be struggles for the increased output of goods and services between those people in their productive years and retirees between the healthy and the infirm between the inheritors and the horatio algers between investors and workers and in particular between those with talents that are valued highly by the marketplace and the equally decent hardworking americans who lack the skills the market prizes clashes of that sort have forever been with us — and will forever continue congress will be the battlefield money and votes will be the weapons lobbying will remain a growth industry

the good news however is that even members of the “losing” sides will almost certainly enjoy — as they should — far more goods and services in the future than they have in the past the quality of their increased bounty will also dramatically improve nothing rivals the market system in producing what people want — nor even more so in delivering what people don’t yet know they want my parents when young could not envision a television set nor did i in my 50s think i needed a personal computer both products once people saw what they could do quickly revolutionized their lives i now spend ten hours a week playing bridge online and as i write this letter “search” is invaluable to me i’m not ready for tinder however

for 240 years it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against america and now is no time to start america’s golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs america’s social security promises will be honored and perhaps made more generous and yes america’s kids will live far better than their parents did

           
considering this favorable tailwind berkshire and to be sure a great many other businesses will almost certainly prosper the managers who succeed charlie and me will build berkshire’s pershare intrinsic value by following our simple blueprint of 1 constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries 2 further increasing their earnings through bolton acquisitions 3 benefiting from the growth of our investees 4 repurchasing berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value and 5 making an occasional large acquisition management will also try to maximize results for you by rarely if ever issuing berkshire sharesintrinsic business valueas much as charlie and i talk about intrinsic business value we cannot tell you precisely what that number is for berkshire shares nor in fact for any other stock it is possible however to make a sensible estimate in our 2010 annual report we laid out the three elements — one of them qualitative — that we believe are the keys to an estimation of berkshire’s intrinsic value that discussion is reproduced in full on pages 113114

here is an update of the two quantitative factors in 2015 our pershare cash and investments increased 83 to 159794 with our kraft heinz shares stated at market value and earnings from our many businesses — including insurance underwriting income — increased 21 to 12304 per share we exclude in the second factor the dividends and interest from the investments we hold because including them would produce a doublecounting of value in arriving at our earnings figure we deduct all corporate overhead interest depreciation amortization and minority interests income taxes though are not deducted that is the earnings are pretax

i used the italics in the paragraph above because we are for the first time including insurance underwriting income in business earnings we did not do that when we initially introduced berkshire’s two quantitative pillars of valuation because our insurance results were then heavily influenced by catastrophe coverages if the wind didn’t blow and the earth didn’t shake we made large profits but a megacatastrophe would produce red ink in order to be conservative then in stating our business earnings we consistently assumed that underwriting would break even over time and ignored any of its gains or losses in our annual calculation of the second factor of value

today our insurance results are likely to be more stable than was the case a decade or two ago because we have deemphasized catastrophe coverages and greatly expanded our breadandbutter lines of business last year our underwriting income contributed 1118 per share to the 12304 per share of earnings referenced in the second paragraph of this section over the past decade annual underwriting income has averaged 1434 per share and we anticipate being profitable in most years you should recognize however that underwriting in any given year could well be unprofitable perhaps substantially so

since 1970 our pershare investments have increased at a rate of 189 compounded annually and our earnings including the underwriting results in both the initial and terminal year have grown at a 237 clip it is no coincidence that the price of berkshire stock over the ensuing 45 years has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value charlie and i like to see gains in both sectors but our main goal is to build operating earnings

           

now let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations each has vastly different balance sheet and income characteristics from the others so we’ll present them as four separate businesses which is how charlie and i view them though there are important and enduring economic advantages to having them all under one roof our intent is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed with you being the reporting manager and we the absentee shareholders don’t get excited this is not a switch we are consideringinsurancelet’s look first at insurance the propertycasualty “pc” branch of that industry has been the engine that has propelled our expansion since 1967 when we acquired national indemnity and its sister company national fire  marine for 86 million today national indemnity is the largest propertycasualty company in the world as measured by net worth moreover its intrinsic value is far in excess of the value at which it is carried on our books

one reason we were attracted to the pc business was its financial characteristics pc insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later in extreme cases such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents payments can stretch over many decades this collectnow paylater model leaves pc companies holding large sums — money we call “float” — that will eventually go to others meanwhile insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit though individual policies and claims come and go the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume consequently as our business grows so does our float and how we have grown as the following table shows

table

further gains in float will be tough to achieve on the plus side geico and several of our specialized operations are almost certain to grow at a good clip national indemnity’s reinsurance division however is party to a number of runoff contracts whose float drifts downward if we do in time experience a decline in float it will be very gradual — at the outside no more than 3 in any year the nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or nearterm demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources this structure is by design and is a key component in the strength of berkshire’s economic fortress it will never be compromised

if our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses we register an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income our float produces when such a profit is earned we enjoy the use of free money — and better yet get paid for holding it

unfortunately the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition so vigorous indeed that it sometimes causes the pc industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss this loss in effect is what the industry pays to hold its float competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry despite the float income all its companies enjoy will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other american businesses the prolonged period of low interest rates the world is now dealing with also virtually guarantees that earnings on float will steadily decrease for many years to come thereby exacerbating the profit problems of insurers it’s a good bet that industry results over the next ten years will fall short of those recorded in the past decade particularly for those companies that specialize in reinsurance

as noted early in this report berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 13 consecutive years our pretax gain for the period having totaled 262 billion that’s no accident disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of all of our insurance managers who know that while float is valuable its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results all insurers give that message lip service at berkshire it is a religion old testament style

so how does our float affect intrinsic value when berkshire’s book value is calculated the full amount of our float is deducted as a liability just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it but to think of float as strictly a liability is incorrect it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund daily we pay old claims and related expenses — a huge 245 billion to more than six million claimants in 2015 — and that reduces float just as surely we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims adding to float
if our revolving float is both costless and longenduring which i believe it will be the true value of this liability is dramatically less than the accounting liability owing 1 that in effect will never leave the premises — because new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute — is worlds different from owing 1 that will go out the door tomorrow and not be replaced the two types of liabilities however are treated as equals under gaap

a partial offset to this overstated liability is a 155 billion “goodwill” asset that we incurred in buying our insurance companies and that increases book value in very large part this goodwill represents the price we paid for the floatgenerating capabilities of our insurance operations the cost of the goodwill however has no bearing on its true value for example if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses any goodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless whatever its original cost

fortunately that does not describe berkshire charlie and i believe the true economic value of  our insurance goodwill — what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance operation possessing it — to be far in excess of its historic carrying value indeed almost the entire 155 billion we carry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000 yet we subsequently tripled our float its value today is one reason — a huge reason — why we believe berkshire’s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value

           

berkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running disciplined operations that possess hardtoreplicate business models let me tell you about the major units

first by float size is the berkshire hathaway reinsurance group managed by ajit jain ajit insures risks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on his operation combines capacity speed decisiveness and most important brains in a manner unique in the insurance business yet he never exposes berkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources

indeed berkshire is far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers for example if the insurance industry should experience a 250 billion loss from some megacatastrophe — a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced — berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings we would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities to write business in an insurance market that might well be in disarray meanwhile other major insurers and reinsurers would be swimming in red ink if not facing insolvency

when ajit entered berkshire’s office on a saturday in 1986 he did not have a day’s experience in the insurance business nevertheless mike goldberg then our manager of insurance handed him the keys to our reinsurance business with that move mike achieved sainthood since then ajit has created tens of billions of value for berkshire shareholders

           

we have another reinsurance powerhouse in general re managed by tad montross

at bottom a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines it must 1 understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses 2 conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does 3 set a premium that on average will deliver a profit after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered and 4 be willing to walk away if the appropriate premium can’t be obtained
many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth they simply can’t turn their back on business that is being eagerly written by their competitors that old line “the other guy is doing it so we must as well” spells trouble in any business but in none more so than insurance

tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments and it shows in his results general re’s huge float has been considerably better than costfree under his leadership and we expect that on average to continue we are particularly enthusiastic about general re’s international life reinsurance business which has grown consistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998

it can be remembered that soon after we purchased general re it was beset by problems that caused commentators — and me as well briefly — to believe i had made a huge mistake that day is long gone general re is now a gem

           

finally there is geico the insurer on which i cut my teeth 65 years ago geico is managed by tony nicely who joined the company at 18 and completed 54 years of service in 2015 tony became ceo in 1993 and since then the company has been flying there is no better manager than tony in the 40 years that i’ve known him his every action has made great sense

when i was first introduced to geico in january 1951 i was blown away by the huge cost advantage the company enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry it was clear to me that geico would succeed because it deserved to succeed

no one likes to buy auto insurance almost everyone though likes to drive the insurance consequently needed is a major expenditure for most families savings matter to them — and only a lowcost operation can deliver these indeed at least 40 of the people reading this letter can save money by insuring with geico so stop reading — right now — and go to geicocom or call 8003682734

geico’s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after year we ended 2015 with 114 of the market compared to 25 in 1995 when berkshire acquired control of geico the company’s low costs create a moat — an enduring one — that competitors are unable to cross

all the while our gecko never tires of telling americans how geico can save them important money i love hearing the little guy deliver his message “15 minutes could save you 15 or more on car insurance” of course there’s always a grouch in the crowd one of my friends says he is glad that only a few animals can talk since the ones that do speak seem unable to discuss any subject but insurance

           

in addition to our three major insurance operations we own a group of smaller companies that primarily write commercial coverages in aggregate these companies are a large growing and valuable operation that consistently delivers an underwriting profit usually much better than that reported by their competitors indeed over the past 13 years this group has earned 4 billion from underwriting — about 13 of its premium volume — while increasing its float from 943 million to 99 billion

less than three years ago we formed berkshire hathaway specialty insurance “bhsi” which we include in this group our first decision was to put peter eastwood in charge that move was a home run bhsi has already developed 1 billion of annual premium volume and under peter’s direction is destined to become one of the world’s leading pc insurers
here’s a recap of underwriting earnings and float by division

table

berkshire’s great managers premier financial strength and a variety of business models protected by wide moats amount to something unique in the insurance world this assemblage of strengths is a huge asset for berkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with timeregulated capitalintensive businesseswe have two major operations bnsf and bhe that share important characteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses consequently we assign them their own section in this letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our gaap balance sheet and income statement together they last year accounted for 37 of berkshire’s aftertax operating earnings

a key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very longlived regulated assets with these partially funded by large amounts of longterm debt that is not guaranteed by berkshire our credit is in fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions would far exceed its interest requirements last year for example in a disappointing year for railroads bnsf’s interest coverage was more than 81 our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest not ebitda interest a commonly used measure we view as seriously flawed

at bhe meanwhile two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all circumstances the first is common to all utilities recessionresistant earnings which result from these companies offering an essential service on an exclusive basis the second is enjoyed by few other utilities a great and everwidening diversity of earnings streams which shield bhe from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body these many sources of profit supplemented by the inherent advantage of being owned by a strong parent have allowed bhe and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt this economic fact benefits both us and our customers

all told bhe and bnsf invested 116 billion in plant and equipment last year a massive commitment to key components of america’s infrastructure we relish making such investments as long as they promise reasonable returns — and on that front we put a large amount of trust in future regulation

our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever need huge investments in both transportation and energy it is in the selfinterest of governments to treat capital providers in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects it is concomitantly in our selfinterest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent

low prices are a powerful way to keep these constituencies happy in iowa bhe’s average retail rate is 68¢ per kwh alliant the other major electric utility in the state averages 95¢ here are the comparable industry figures for adjacent states nebraska 90¢ missouri 93¢ illinois 93¢ minnesota 97¢ the national average is 104¢ our rockbottom prices add up to real money for paycheckstrapped customers
at bnsf price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because of significant differences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance it is carried to supply a very crude measure however our revenue per tonmile was just under 3¢ last year while shipping costs for customers of the other four major usbased railroads were at least 40 higher ranging from 42¢ to 53¢

both bhe and bnsf have been leaders in pursuing planetfriendly technology in wind generation no state comes close to iowa where last year megawatthours we generated from wind equaled 47 of all megawatthours sold to our retail customers additional wind projects to which we are committed will take that figure to 58 in 2017

bnsf like other class i railroads uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight almost 500 miles that makes the railroads four times as fuelefficient as trucks furthermore railroads alleviate highway congestion — and the taxpayerfunded maintenance expenditures that come with heavier traffic — in a major way

here are the key figures for bhe and bnsf

table

i currently expect increased aftertax earnings at bhe in 2016 but lower earnings at bnsfmanufacturing service and retailing operationsour activities in this part of berkshire cover the waterfront let’s look though at a summary balance sheet and earnings statement for the entire group

table

 earnings for 2013 have been restated to exclude marmon’s leasing operations which are now included in the finance and financial products results

our income and expense data conforming to gaap is on page 38 in contrast the operating expense figures above are nongaap because they exclude some purchaseaccounting items primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets we present the data in this manner because charlie and i believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do gaap figures

i won’t explain all of the adjustments — some are tiny and arcane — but serious investors should understand the disparate nature of intangible assets some truly deplete in value over time while others in no way lose value for software as a big example amortization charges are very real expenses conversely the concept of recording charges against other intangibles such as customer relationships arises from purchaseaccounting rules and clearly does not reflect economic reality gaap accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges both that is are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated — even though from an investor’s viewpoint they could not differ more
in the gaapcompliant figures we show on page 38 amortization charges of 11 billion have been deducted as expenses we would call about 20 of these “real” the rest not the “nonreal” charges once non existent at berkshire have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made nonreal amortization charges are likely to climb further as we acquire more companies

the table on page 55 gives you the current status of our intangible assets as calculated by gaap we now have 68 billion left of amortizable intangibles of which 41 billion will be expensed over the next five years eventually of course every dollar of these “assets” will be charged off when that happens reported earnings increase even if true earnings are flat my gift to my successor

i suggest that you ignore a portion of gaap amortization costs but it is with some trepidation that i do that knowing that it has become common for managers to tell their owners to ignore certain expense items that are all too real “stockbased compensation” is the most egregious example the very name says it all “compensation” if compensation isn’t an expense what is it and if real and recurring expenses don’t belong in the calculation of earnings where in the world do they belong

wall street analysts often play their part in this charade too parroting the phony compensationignoring “earnings” figures fed them by managements maybe the offending analysts don’t know any better or maybe they fear losing “access” to management or maybe they are cynical telling themselves that since everyone else is playing the game why shouldn’t they go along with it whatever their reasoning these analysts are guilty of propagating misleading numbers that can deceive investors

depreciation charges are a more complicated subject but are almost always true costs certainly they are at berkshire i wish we could keep our businesses competitive while spending less than our depreciation charge but in 51 years i’ve yet to figure out how to do so indeed the depreciation charge we record in our railroad business falls far short of the capital outlays needed to merely keep the railroad running properly a mismatch that leads to gaap earnings that are higher than true economic earnings this overstatement of earnings exists at all railroads when ceos or investment bankers tout predepreciation figures such as ebitda as a valuation guide watch their noses lengthen while they speak

our public reports of earnings will of course continue to conform to gaap to embrace reality however you should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report you should also subtract something to reflect bnsf’s inadequate depreciation charge

           

let’s get back to our many manufacturing service and retailing operations which sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes some of this sector’s businesses measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets enjoy terrific economics producing profits that run from 25 aftertax to far more than 100 others generate good returns in the area of 12 to 20

a few however — these are serious mistakes i made in my job of capital allocation — have very poor returns in most of these cases i was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or the industry in which it operates and we are now paying the price for my misjudgments at other times i stumbled in evaluating either the fidelity or the ability of incumbent managers or ones i later appointed i will commit more errors you can count on that if we luck out they will occur at our smaller operations

viewed as a single entity the companies in this group are an excellent business they employed an average of 256 billion of net tangible assets during 2015 and despite their holding large quantities of excess cash and using only token amounts of leverage earned 184 aftertax on that capital
of course a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought at too high a price we have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses a cost that is reflected in the large figure we show for goodwill and other intangibles overall however we are getting a decent return on the capital we have deployed in this sector earnings from the group should grow substantially in 2016 as duracell and precision castparts enter the fold

           

we have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually moreover their competitors — both current and potential — read this report in a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged if others knew our numbers in some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of berkshire therefore we only disclose what is required you can nevertheless find a good bit of detail about many of our operations on pages 8891finance and financial productsour three leasing and rental operations are conducted by cort furniture xtra semitrailers and marmon primarily tank cars but also freight cars intermodal tank containers and cranes these companies are industry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the american economy has gained strength at each of the three we have invested more money in new equipment than have many of our competitors and that’s paid off dealing from strength is one of berkshire’s enduring advantages

kevin clayton has again delivered an industryleading performance at clayton homes the secondlargest home builder in america last year the company sold 34397 homes about 45 of the manufactured homes bought by americans in contrast the company was number three in the field with a 14 share when berkshire purchased it in 2003

manufactured homes allow the american dream of home ownership to be achieved by lowerincome citizens around 70 of new homes costing 150000 or less come from our industry about 46 of clayton’s homes are sold through the 331 stores we ourselves own and operate most of clayton’s remaining sales are made to 1395 independent retailers

key to clayton’s operation is its 128 billion mortgage portfolio we originate about 35 of all mortgages on manufactured homes about 37 of our mortgage portfolio emanates from our retail operation with the balance primarily originated by independent retailers some of which sell our homes while others market only the homes of our competitors

lenders other than clayton have come and gone with berkshire’s backing however clayton steadfastly financed home buyers throughout the panic days of 20082009 indeed during that period clayton used precious capital to finance dealers who did not sell our homes the funds we supplied to goldman sachs and general electric at that time produced headlines the funds berkshire quietly delivered to clayton both made home ownership possible for thousands of families and kept many nonclayton dealers alive

our retail outlets employing simple language and large type consistently inform home buyers of alternative sources for financing — most of it coming from local banks — and always secure acknowledgments from customers that this information has been received and read the form we use is reproduced in its actual size on page 119
mortgageorigination practices are of great importance to both the borrower and to society there is no question that reckless practices in home lending played a major role in bringing on the financial panic of 2008 which in turn led to the great recession in the years preceding the meltdown a destructive and often corrupt pattern  of  mortgage  creation  flourished  whereby  1  an  originator  in  say  california  would  make  loans  and 2 promptly sell them to an investment or commercial bank in say new york which would package many mortgages to serve as collateral for a dizzyingly complicated array of mortgagebacked securities to be 3 sold to unwitting institutions around the world

as if these sins weren’t sufficient to create an unholy mess imaginative investment bankers sometimes concocted a second layer of slicedup financing whose value depended on the junkier portions of primary offerings when wall street gets “innovative” watch out while that was going on i described this “doublingup” practice as requiring an investor to read tens of thousands of pages of mindnumbing prose to evaluate a single security being offered

both the originator and the packager of these financings had no skin in the game and were driven by volume and markups many housing borrowers joined the party as well blatantly lying on their loan applications while mortgage originators looked the other way naturally the gamiest credits generated the most profits smooth wall street salesmen garnered millions annually by manufacturing products that their customers were unable to understand it’s also questionable as to whether the major rating agencies were capable of evaluating the more complex structures but rate them they did

barney frank perhaps the most financiallysavvy member of congress during the panic recently assessed the 2010 doddfrank act saying “the one major weakness that i’ve seen in the implementation was this decision by the regulators not to impose risk retention on all residential mortgages” today some legislators and commentators continue to advocate a 1to5 retention by the originator as a way to align its interests with that of the ultimate lender or mortgage guarantor

at clayton our risk retention was and is 100 when we originate a mortgage we keep it leaving aside the few that qualify for a government guarantee when we make mistakes in granting credit we therefore pay a price — a hefty price that dwarfs any profit we realized upon the original sale of the home last year we had to foreclose on 8444 manufacturedhousing mortgages at a cost to us of 157 million

the average loan we made in 2015 was only 59942 small potatoes for traditional mortgage lenders but a daunting commitment for our many lowerincome borrowers our buyer acquires a decent home — take a look at the home we will have on display at our annual meeting — requiring monthly principalandinterest payments that average 522

some borrowers of course will lose their jobs and there will be divorces and deaths others will get over extended on credit cards and mishandle their finances we will lose money then and our borrower will lose his down payment though his mortgage payments during his time of occupancy may have been well under rental rates for comparable quarters nevertheless despite the low fico scores and income of our borrowers their payment behavior during the great recession was far better than that prevailing in many mortgage pools populated by people earning multiples of our typical borrower’s income

the strong desire of our borrowers to have a home of their own is one reason we’ve done well with our mortgage portfolio equally important we have financed much of the portfolio with floatingrate debt or with short term fixedrate debt consequently the incredibly low shortterm rates of recent years have provided us a constantlywidening spread between our interest costs and the income we derive from our mortgage portfolio which bears fixed rates incidentally we would have enjoyed similar margins had we simply bought longterm bonds and financed the position in some shortterm manner
normally it is risky business to lend long at fixed rates and borrow short as we have been doing at clayton over the years some important financial institutions have gone broke doing that at berkshire however we possess a natural offset in that our businesses always maintain at least 20 billion in cashequivalents that earn shortterm rates more often our shortterm investments are in the 40 billion to 60 billion range if we have say 60 billion invested at ¼ or less a sharp move to higher shortterm rates would bring benefits to us far exceeding the higher financing costs we would incur in funding clayton’s 13 billion mortgage portfolio in banking terms berkshire is — and always will be — heavily assetsensitive and will consequently benefit from rising interest rates

let me talk about one subject of which i am particularly proud that having to do with regulation the great recession caused mortgage originators servicers and packagers to come under intense scrutiny and to be assessed many billions of dollars in fines and penalties

the scrutiny has certainly extended to clayton whose mortgage practices have been continuously reviewed and examined in respect to such items as originations servicing collections advertising compliance and internal controls at the federal level we answer to the federal trade commission the department of housing and urban development and the consumer financial protection bureau dozens of states regulate us as well during the past two years indeed various federal and state authorities from 25 states examined and reviewed clayton and its mortgages on 65 occasions the result our total fines during this period were 38200 and our refunds to customers 704678 furthermore though we had to foreclose on 264 of our manufacturedhome mortgages last year 954 of our borrowers were current on their payments at yearend as they moved toward owning a debtfree home

           

marmon’s rail fleet expanded to 133220 units by yearend a number significantly increased by the company’s purchase of 25085 cars from general electric on september 30 if our fleet was connected to form a single train the engine would be in omaha and the caboose in portland maine

at yearend 97 of our railcars were leased with about 1517 of the fleet coming up for renewal each year though “tank cars” sound like vessels carrying crude oil only about 7 of our fleet carries that product chemicals and refined petroleum products are the lead items we transport when trains roll by look for the utlx or procor markings that identify our tank cars when you spot the brand puff out your chest you own a portion of that car

here’s the earnings recap for this sector

table

 excludes capital gains or lossesinvestmentsbelow we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value we exclude our kraft heinz holding because we are part of a control group and account for it on the “equity” method

table this is our actual purchase price and also our tax basis gaap “cost” differs in a few cases because of write ups or writedowns that have been required under gaap rules excludes shares held by pension funds of berkshire subsidiaries held under contract of sale for this amount berkshire has one major equity position that is not included in the table we can buy 700 million shares of bank of america at any time prior to september 2021 for 5 billion at yearend these shares were worth 118 billion we are likely to purchase them just before expiration of our option and if we wish we can use our 5 billion of bank of america 6 preferred to fund the purchase in the meantime it is important for you to realize that bank of america is in effect our fourth largest equity investment — and one we value highlyproductivity and prosperityearlier i told you how our partners at kraft heinz root out inefficiencies thereby increasing output per hour of employment that kind of improvement has been the secret sauce of america’s remarkable gains in living standards since the nation’s founding in 1776 unfortunately the label of “secret” is appropriate too few americans fully grasp the linkage between productivity and prosperity to see that connection let’s look first at the country’s most dramatic example — farming — and later examine three berkshirespecific areas

in 1900 america’s civilian work force numbered 28 million of these 11 million a staggering 40 of the total worked in farming the leading crop then as now was corn about 90 million acres were devoted to its production and the yield per acre was 30 bushels for a total output of 27 billion bushels annually

then came the tractor and one innovation after another that revolutionized such keys to farm productivity as planting harvesting irrigation fertilization and seed quality today we devote about 85 million acres to corn productivity however has improved yields to more than 150 bushels per acre for an annual output of 1314 billion bushels farmers have made similar gains with other products

increased yields though are only half the story the huge increases in physical output have been accompanied by a dramatic reduction in the number of farm laborers “human input” today about three million people work on farms a tiny 2 of our 158millionperson work force thus improved farming methods have allowed tens of millions of presentday workers to utilize their time and talents in other endeavors a reallocation of human resources that enables americans of today to enjoy huge quantities of nonfarm goods and services they would otherwise lack

it’s easy to look back over the 115year span and realize how extraordinarily beneficial agricultural innovations have been — not just for farmers but more broadly for our entire society we would not have anything close to the america we now know had we stifled those improvements in productivity it was fortunate that horses couldn’t vote on a daytoday basis however talk of the “greater good” must have rung hollow to farm hands who lost their jobs to machines that performed routine tasks far more efficiently than humans ever could we will examine this flipside to productivity gains later in this section

for the moment however let’s move on to three stories of efficiencies that have had major consequences for berkshire subsidiaries similar transformations have been commonplace throughout american business       in  1947  shortly  after  the  end  of  world  war  ii  the  american  workforce  totaled  44  million  about

135 million workers were employed in the railroad industry the revenue tonmiles of freight moved by class i railroads that year totaled 655 billion

by 2014 class i railroads carried 185 trillion tonmiles an increase of 182 while employing only 187000 workers a reduction of 86 since 1947 some of this change involved passengerrelated employees but most of the workforce reduction came on the freight side as a result of this staggering improvement in productivity the inflationadjusted price for moving a tonmile of freight has fallen by 55 since 1947 a drop saving shippers about 90 billion annually in current dollars

another startling statistic if it took as many people now to move freight as it did in 1947 we would need well over three million railroad workers to handle present volumes of course that level of employment would raise freight charges by a lot consequently nothing close to today’s volume would actually move
our own bnsf was formed in 1995 by a merger between burlington northern and santa fe in 1996 the merged company’s first full year of operation 411 million tonmiles of freight were transported by 45000 employees last year the comparable figures were 702 million tonmiles plus 71 and 47000 employees plus only 4 that dramatic gain in productivity benefits both owners and shippers safety at bnsf has improved as well reportable injuries were 204 per 200000 manhours in 1996 and have since fallen more than 50 to 095             a bit more than a century ago the auto was invented and around it formed an industry that insures cars and their drivers initially this business was written through traditional insurance agencies — the kind dealing in fire insurance this agencycentric approach included high commissions and other underwriting expenses that consumed about 40¢ of the premium dollar strong local agencies were then in the driver’s seat because they represented multiple insurers and could play one company off against another when commissions were being negotiated cartellike pricing prevailed and all involved were doing fine — except for the consumer

and then some american ingenuity came into play g j mecherle a farmer from merna illinois came up with the idea of a captive sales force that would sell the insurance products of only a single company his baby was christened state farm mutual the company cut commissions and expenses — moves that permitted lower prices — and soon became a powerhouse for many decades state farm has been the runaway volume leader in both auto and homeowner’s insurance allstate which also operated with a direct distribution model was long the runnerup both state farm and allstate have had underwriting expenses of about 25

in the early 1930s another contender united services auto association “usaa” a mutuallike company was writing auto insurance for military officers on a directtothecustomer basis this marketing innovation rose from a need that military personnel had to buy insurance that would stay with them as they moved from base to base that was business of little interest to local insurance agencies which wanted the steady renewals that came from permanent residents

the direct distribution method of usaa as it happened incurred lower costs than those enjoyed by state farm and allstate and therefore delivered an even greater bargain to customers that made leo and lillian goodwin employees of usaa dream of broadening the target market for its direct distribution model beyond military officers in 1936 starting with 100000 of capital they incorporated government employees insurance co later compressing this mouthful to geico

their fledgling did 238000 of auto insurance business in 1937 its first full year last year geico did
226 billion more than double the volume of usaa though the early bird gets the worm the second mouse gets the cheese geico’s underwriting expenses in 2015 were 147 of premiums with usaa being the only large company to achieve a lower percentage geico is fully as efficient as usaa but spends considerably more on advertising aimed at promoting growth

with the price advantage geico’s low costs allow it’s not surprising that several years ago the company seized the number two spot in auto insurance from allstate geico is also gaining ground on state farm though it is still far ahead of us in volume on august 30 2030 — my 100th birthday — i plan to announce that geico has taken over the top spot mark your calendar

geico employs about 34000 people to serve its 14 million policyholders i can only guess at the workforce it would require to serve a similar number of policyholders under the agency system i believe however that the number would be at least 60000 a combination of what the insurer would need in direct employment and the personnel required at supporting agencies           in its electric utility business our berkshire hathaway energy “bhe” operates within a changing economic model historically the survival of a local electric company did not depend on its efficiency in fact a “sloppy” operation could do just fine financially

that’s because utilities were usually the sole supplier of a needed product and were allowed to price at a level that gave them a prescribed return upon the capital they employed the joke in the industry was that a utility was the only business that would automatically earn more money by redecorating the boss’s office and some ceos ran things accordingly

that’s all changing today society has decided that federallysubsidized wind and solar generation is in our country’s longterm interest federal tax credits are used to implement this policy support that makes renewables pricecompetitive in certain geographies those tax credits or other governmentmandated help for renewables may eventually erode the economics of the incumbent utility particularly if it is a highcost operator bhe’s longestablished emphasis on efficiency — even when the company didn’t need it to attain authorized earnings — leaves us particularly competitive in today’s market and more important in tomorrow’s as well

bhe acquired its iowa utility in 1999 in the year before that utility employed 3700 people and produced 19 million megawatthours of electricity now we employ 3500 people and produce 29 million megawatt hours that major increase in efficiency allowed us to operate without a rate increase for 16 years a period during which industry rates increased 44

the safety record of our iowa utility is also outstanding it had 79 injuries per 100 employees in 2015 compared to the rate of 70 experienced by the previous owner in the year before we bought the operation

in 2006 bhe purchased pacificorp which operated primarily in oregon and utah the year before our purchase pacificorp employed 6750 people and produced 526 million megawatthours last year the numbers were 5700 employees and 563 million megawatthours here too safety improved dramatically with the accidentrateper100employees falling from 34 in 2005 to 85 in 2015 in safety bhe now ranks in the industry’s top decile

those outstanding performances explain why bhe is welcomed by regulators when it proposes to buy a utility in their jurisdiction the regulators know the company will run an efficient safe and reliable operation and also arrive with unlimited capital to fund whatever projects make sense bhe has never paid a dividend to berkshire since we assumed ownership no investorowned utility in america comes close to matching bhe’s enthusiasm for reinvestment                

the productivity gains that i’ve just spelled out — and countless others that have been achieved in america have delivered awesome benefits to society that’s the reason our citizens as a whole have enjoyed — and will continue to enjoy — major gains in the goods and services they receive

to this thought there are offsets first the productivity gains achieved in recent years have largely benefitted the wealthy second productivity gains frequently cause upheaval both capital and labor can pay a terrible price when innovation or new efficiencies upend their worlds

we need shed no tears for the capitalists whether they be private owners or an army of public shareholders it’s their job to take care of themselves when large rewards can flow to investors from good decisions these parties should not be spared the losses produced by wrong choices moreover investors who diversify widely and simply sit tight with their holdings are certain to prosper in america gains from winning investments have always far more than offset the losses from clunkers during the 20th century the dow jones industrial average — an index fund of sorts — soared from 66 to 11497 with its component companies all the while paying everincreasing dividends
a longemployed worker faces a different equation when innovation and the market system interact to produce efficiencies many workers may be rendered unnecessary their talents obsolete some can find decent employment elsewhere for others that is not an option

when lowcost competition drove shoe production to asia our onceprosperous dexter operation folded putting 1600 employees in a small maine town out of work many were past the point in life at which they could learn another trade we lost our entire investment which we could afford but many workers lost a livelihood they could not replace the same scenario unfolded in slowmotion at our original new england textile operation which struggled for 20 years before expiring many older workers at our new bedford plant as a poignant example spoke portuguese and knew little if any english they had no plan b

the answer in such disruptions is not the restraining or outlawing of actions that increase productivity americans would not be living nearly as well as we do if we had mandated that 11 million people should forever be employed in farming

the solution rather is a variety of safety nets aimed at providing a decent life for those who are willing to work but find their specific talents judged of small value because of market forces i personally favor a reformed and expanded earned income tax credit that would try to make sure america works for those willing to work the price of achieving everincreasing prosperity for the great majority of americans should not be penury for the unfortunateimportant riskswe like all public companies are required by the sec to annually catalog “risk factors” in our 10k i can’t remember however an instance when reading a 10k’s “risk” section has helped me in evaluating a business that’s not because the identified risks aren’t real the truly important risks however are usually well known beyond that a 10k’s catalog of risks is seldom of aid in assessing 1 the probability of the threatening event actually occurring 2 the range of costs if it does occur and 3 the timing of the possible loss a threat that will only surface 50 years from now may be a problem for society but it is not a financial problem for today’s investor

berkshire operates in more industries than any company i know of each of our pursuits has its own array of possible problems and opportunities those are easy to list but hard to evaluate charlie i and our various ceos often differ in a very major way in our calculation of the likelihood the timing and the cost or benefit that may result from these possibilities

let me mention just a few examples to begin with an obvious threat bnsf along with other railroads is certain to lose significant coal volume over the next decade at some point in the future — though not in my view for a long time — geico’s premium volume may shrink because of driverless cars this development could hurt our auto dealerships as well circulation of our print newspapers will continue to fall a certainty we allowed for when purchasing them to date renewables have helped our utility operation but that could change particularly if storage capabilities for electricity materially improve online retailing threatens the business model of our retailers and certain of our consumer brands these potentialities are just a few of the negative possibilities facing us — but even the most casual follower of business news has long been aware of them

none of these problems however is crucial to berkshire’s longterm wellbeing when we took over the company in 1965 its risks could have been encapsulated in a single sentence “the northern textile business in which all of our capital resides is destined for recurring losses and will eventually disappear” that development however was no death knell we simply adapted and we will continue to do so
every day berkshire managers are thinking about how they can better compete in an alwayschanging world just as vigorously charlie and i focus on where a steady stream of funds should be deployed in that respect we possess a major advantage over oneindustry companies whose options are far more limited i firmly believe that berkshire has the money talent and culture to plow through the sort of adversities i’ve itemized above — and many more — and to emerge with evergreater earning power

there is however one clear present and enduring danger to berkshire against which charlie and i are powerless that threat to berkshire is also the major threat our citizenry faces a “successful” as defined by the aggressor cyber biological nuclear or chemical attack on the united states that is a risk berkshire shares with all of american business

the probability of such mass destruction in any given year is likely very small it’s been more than 70 years since i delivered a washington post newspaper headlining the fact that the united states had dropped the first atomic bomb subsequently we’ve had a few close calls but avoided catastrophic destruction we can thank our government — and luck — for this result

nevertheless what’s a small probability in a short period approaches certainty in the longer run if there is only one chance in thirty of an event occurring in a given year the likelihood of it occurring at least once in a century is 966 the added bad news is that there will forever be people and organizations and perhaps even nations that would like to inflict maximum damage on our country their means of doing so have increased exponentially during my lifetime “innovation” has its dark side

there is no way for american corporations or their investors to shed this risk if an event occurs in the us that leads to mass devastation the value of all equity investments will almost certainly be decimated

no one knows what “the day after” will look like i think however that einstein’s 1949 appraisal remains apt “i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones”

           

i am writing this section because we have a proxy proposal regarding climate change to consider at this year’s annual meeting the sponsor would like us to provide a report on the dangers that this change might present to our insurance operation and explain how we are responding to these threats

it seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet i say “highly likely” rather than “certain” because i have no scientific aptitude and remember well the dire predictions of most “experts” about y2k it would be foolish however for me or anyone to demand 100 proof of huge forthcoming damage to the world if that outcome seemed at all possible and if prompt action had even a small chance of thwarting the danger

this issue bears a similarity to pascal’s wager on the existence of god pascal it may be recalled argued that if there were only a tiny probability that god truly existed it made sense to behave as if he did because the rewards could be infinite whereas the lack of belief risked eternal misery likewise if there is only a 1 chance the planet is heading toward a truly major disaster and delay means passing a point of no return inaction now is foolhardy call this noah’s law if an ark may be essential for survival begin building it today no matter how cloudless the skies appear

it’s understandable that the sponsor of the proxy proposal believes berkshire is especially threatened by climate change because we are a huge insurer covering all sorts of risks the sponsor may worry that property losses will skyrocket because of weather changes and such worries might in fact be warranted if we wrote ten or twentyyear policies at fixed prices but insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repriced annually to reflect changing exposures increased possibilities of loss translate promptly into increased premiums
think back to 1951 when i first became enthused about geico the company’s average lossperpolicy was then about 30 annually imagine your reaction if i had predicted then that in 2015 the loss costs would increase to about 1000 per policy wouldn’t such skyrocketing losses prove disastrous you might ask well no

over the years inflation has caused a huge increase in the cost of repairing both the cars and the humans involved in accidents but these increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums so paradoxically the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable if costs had remained unchanged berkshire would now own an auto insurer doing 600 million of business annually rather than one doing 23 billion

up to now climate change has not produced more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather related events covered by insurance as a consequence us supercat rates have fallen steadily in recent years which is why we have backed away from that business if supercats become costlier and more frequent the likely — though far from certain — effect on berkshire’s insurance business would be to make it larger and more profitable

as a citizen you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights as a homeowner in a lowlying area you may wish to consider moving but when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer climate change should not be on your list of worriesthe annual meetingcharlie and i have finally decided to enter the 21st th the yahoo webcast will begin with a half hour of interviews with managers directors and shareholders then at 930 charlie and i will commence answering questions

this new arrangement will serve two purposes first it may level off or modestly decrease attendance at the meeting last year’s record of more than 40000 attendees strained our capacity in addition to quickly filling the centurylink center’s main arena we packed its overflow rooms and then spilled into two large meeting rooms at the adjoining omaha hilton all major hotels were sold out notwithstanding airbnb’s steppedup presence airbnb was especially helpful for those visitors on limited budgets

our second reason for initiating a webcast is more important charlie is 92 and i am 85 if we were partners with you in a small business and were charged with running the place you would want to look in occasionally to make sure we hadn’t drifted off into lala land shareholders in contrast should not need to come to omaha to monitor how we look and sound in making your evaluation be kind allow for the fact that we didn’t look that impressive when we were at our best

viewers can also observe our lifeprolonging diet during the meeting charlie and i will each consume enough coke see’s fudge and see’s peanut brittle to satisfy the weekly caloric needs of an nfl lineman long ago we discovered a fundamental truth there’s nothing like eating carrots and broccoli when you’re really hungry — and want to stay that way

shareholders planning to attend the meeting should come at 7 am when the doors open at centurylink center and start shopping carrie sova will again be in charge of the festivities she had her second child late last month but that did not slow her down carrie is unflappable ingenious and expert at bringing out the best in those who work with her she is aided by hundreds of berkshire employees from around the country and by our entire home office crew as well all of them pitching in to make the weekend fun and informative for our owners
last year we increased the number of hours available for shopping at the centurylink sales skyrocketed — so naturally we will stay with the new schedule on friday april 29th you can shop between noon and 5 pm and on saturday exhibits and stores will be open from 7 am until 430 pm

on saturday morning we will have our fifth international newspaper tossing challenge our target will again be a clayton home porch located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line when i was a teenager — in my one brief flirtation with honest labor — i delivered about 500000 papers so i think i’m pretty good at this game challenge me humiliate me knock me down a peg the papers will run 36 to 42 pages and you must fold them yourself no rubber bands allowed

the competition begins at 715 when contestants will make preliminary tosses the eight throws judged most accurate — four made by contestants 12 or under and four made by the older set — will compete against me at 745 the young challengers will each receive a prize but the older ones will have to beat me to take anything home

and be sure to check out the clayton home itself it can be purchased for 78900 fully installed on land you provide in past years we’ve made many sales on the meeting day kevin clayton will be on hand with his order book

at 830 am a new berkshire movie will be shown an hour later we will start the questionandanswer period which including a break for lunch at centurylink’s stands will last until 330 pm after a short recess charlie and i will convene the annual meeting at 345 pm this business session typically lasts only a half hour or so and can safely be skipped by those craving a little lastminute shopping

your venue for shopping will be the 194300squarefoot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which products from dozens of berkshire subsidiaries will be for sale say hello to the many berkshire managers who will be captaining their exhibits and be sure to view the terrific bnsf railroad layout that salutes all of our subsidiaries your children and you will be enchanted with it

we will have a new and very special exhibit in the hall this year a fullsize model of the world’s largest aircraft engine for which precision castparts makes many key components the real engines weigh about 20000 pounds and are ten feet in diameter and 22 feet in length the bisected model at the meeting will give you a good look at many pcc components that help power your flights

brooks our runningshoe company will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting after you purchase a pair wear them on sunday at our fourth annual “berkshire 5k” an 8 am race starting at the centurylink full details for participating will be included in the visitor’s guide that will be sent to you with your meeting credentials entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of berkshire’s managers directors and associates charlie and i however will sleep in the fudge and peanut brittle take their toll participation in the 5k grows every year help us set another record

a geico booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors from around the country stop by for a quote in most cases geico will be able to give you a shareholder discount usually 8 this special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate one supplemental point the discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount such as that available to certain groups bring the details of your existing insurance and check out our price we can save many of you real money spend the savings on our other products
be sure to visit the bookworm it will carry about 35 books and dvds among them a couple of new titles andy kilpatrick will introduce and be glad to sign the latest edition of his allencompassing coverage of berkshire it’s 1304 pages and weighs 98 pounds my blurb for the book “ridiculously skimpy” check out peter bevelin’s new book as well peter has long been a keen observer of berkshire

we will also have a new 20pagelonger edition of berkshire’s 50year commemorative book that at last year’s meeting sold 12000 copies since then carrie and i have uncovered additional material that we find fascinating such as some very personal letters sent by grover cleveland to edward butler his friend and the then publisher of the buffalo news nothing from the original edition has been changed or eliminated and the price remains 20 charlie and i will jointly sign 100 copies that will be randomly placed among the 5000 available for sale at the meeting

my friend phil beuth has written limping on water an autobiography that chronicles his life at capital cities communications and tells you a lot about its leaders tom murphy and dan burke these two were the best managerial duo — both in what they accomplished and how they did it — that charlie and i ever witnessed much of what you become in life depends on whom you choose to admire and copy start with tom murphy and you’ll never need a second exemplar

finally jeremy miller has written warren buffett’s ground rules a book that will debut at the annual meeting mr miller has done a superb job of researching and dissecting the operation of buffett partnership ltd and of explaining how berkshire’s culture has evolved from its bpl origin if you are fascinated by investment theory and practice you will enjoy this book

an attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the credential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events airlines have sometimes jacked up prices for the berkshire weekend if you are coming from far away compare the cost of flying to kansas city vs omaha the drive between the two cities is about 2 1⁄2 hours and it may be that kansas city can save you significant money particularly if you had planned to rent a car in omaha the savings for a couple could run to
1000 or more spend that money with us

at nebraska furniture mart located on a 77acre site on 72nd street between dodge and pacific we will again be having “berkshire weekend” discount pricing last year in the week encompassing the meeting the store did a record 44239493 of business if you repeat that figure to a retailer he is not going to believe you an average week for nfm’s omaha store — the highestvolume home furnishings store in the united states except for our new dallas store — is about 9 million

to obtain the berkshire discount at nfm you must make your purchases between tuesday april 26th and monday may 2nd inclusive and also present your meeting credential the period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which in the spirit of our shareholder weekend have made an exception for you we appreciate their cooperation during “berkshire weekend” nfm will be open from 10 am to 9 pm monday through friday 10 am to 930 pm on saturday and 10 am to 8 pm on sunday from 530 pm to 8 pm on saturday nfm is hosting a picnic to which you are all invited

at borsheims we will again have two shareholderonly events the first will be a cocktail reception from 6 pm to 9 pm on friday april 29th the second the main gala will be held on sunday may 1st from 9 am to 4 pm on saturday we will remain open until 6 pm during last year’s fridaysunday stretch the store wrote a sales ticket every 15 seconds that it was open

we will have huge crowds at borsheims throughout the weekend for your convenience therefore shareholder prices will be available from monday april 25th through saturday may 7th during that period please identify yourself as a shareholder either by presenting your meeting credential or a brokerage statement showing you own our stock

on sunday in the mall outside of borsheims norman beck a remarkable magician from dallas will bewilder onlookers on the upper level we will have bob hamman and sharon osberg two of the world’s top bridge experts available to play bridge with our shareholders on sunday afternoon i will join them and hope to have ajit and charlie there also

my friend ariel hsing will be in the mall as well on sunday taking on challengers at table tennis i met ariel when she was nine and even then i was unable to score a point against her now she’s a junior at princeton having already represented the united states in the 2012 olympics if you don’t mind embarrassing yourself test your skills against her beginning at 1 pm bill gates and i will lead off and try to soften her up

gorat’s will again be open exclusively for berkshire shareholders on sunday may 1st serving from 1 pm until 10 pm to make a reservation at gorat’s call 4025513733 on april 1st but not before as for my other favorite restaurant piccolo’s i’m sad to report it closed



from the questions submitted each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interesting and important the journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep it concise avoid sending it in at the last moment make it berkshirerelated and include no more than two questions in any email you send them in your email let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your question is asked

an accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow berkshire this year the insurance specialist will be cliff gallant of nomura securities questions that deal with our noninsurance operations will come from jonathan brandt of ruane cunniff  goldfarb and gregg warren of morningstar our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions that add to our owners’ understanding and knowledge of their investment

neither charlie nor i will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way some will be tough for sure and that’s the way we like it multipart questions aren’t allowed we want to give as many questioners as possible a shot at us

all told we expect at least 54 questions which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for 18 from the audience last year we had 64 in total the questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 815 am on the morning of the annual meeting each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room will host so to speak a drawing
while i’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge let me remind you that charlie and i believe all shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that berkshire releases and if possible should also have adequate time to digest and analyze it before any trading takes place that’s why we try to issue financial data late on fridays or early on saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a saturday we do not follow the common practice of talking oneonone with large institutional investors or analysts treating them instead as we do all other shareholders there is no one more important to us than the shareholder of limited means who trusts us with a substantial portion of his savings

           

for good reason i regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers they are truly allstars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families i also believe the mindset of our managers to be as shareholderoriented as can be found in the universe of large publiclyowned companies most of our managers have no financial need to work the joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as their paycheck

equally important however are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office this group efficiently deals with a multitude of sec and other regulatory requirements files a 30400page federal income tax return — that’s up 6000 pages from the prior year — oversees the filing of 3530 state tax returns responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries gets out the annual report prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting coordinates the board’s activities factchecks this letter — and the list goes on and on

they handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency making my life easy and pleasant their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to berkshire last year for example they dealt with the 40 universities selected from 200 applicants who sent students to omaha for a qa day with me they also handle all kinds of requests that i receive arrange my travel and even get me hamburgers and french fries smothered in heinz ketchup of course for lunch no ceo has it better i truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day in fact my job becomes more fun every year

in 2015 berkshire’s revenues increased by 16 billion look carefully however at the two pictures on the facing page the top one is from last year’s report and shows the entire berkshire homeoffice crew at our christmas lunch below that photo is this year’s christmas photo portraying the same 25 people identically positioned in 2015 no one joined us no one left and the odds are good that you will see a photo of the same 25 next year

can you imagine another very large company — we employ 361270 people worldwide — enjoying that kind of employment stability at headquarters at berkshire we have hired some wonderful people — and they have stayed with us moreover no one is hired unless he or she is truly needed that’s why you’ve never read about “restructuring” charges at berkshire

on april 30th come to omaha — the cradle of capitalism — and meet my gang they are the best
