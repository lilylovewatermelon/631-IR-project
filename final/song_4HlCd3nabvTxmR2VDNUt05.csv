im cracked from my head down to my spine
ready to selfdestruct at any time
and im trying to convince myself
that the way i feel is all i have
it could take a lifetime
to realize that youre alright
but she said

prechorus
id know when you would come back
its been a summer

chorus
its burning up in here
even though the bed is cold on your side
id rather die
than spend this night here without you

verse 2
i would try to fix these flaws of mine
if i could just see you for one more time
and im trying to convince myself
that the way i feel is all i have
i dont believe in sure things
theres pain in what the truth brings

chorus

verse 3
id be the first one to know
if its smart for me to just let it go
ill be the laughing stock of all time
person most likely to find
deciding if its fate that made you avoid me to this day
