i was on the outside looking in
now im on the inside
tryna stay out of my head
i need peace of mind

verse 1
grew up pretty fast good things never last
you gotta live before you learn
now im somewhere far away from where i started
with no point of return but im turning

chorus
i was on the outside looking in
now im on the inside
tryna stay out of my head
i need peace of mind

landed in the middle of somewhere with you
now youre stranded in the middle of somewhere oh yeah too

verse 2
always running away
looking for an escape
everyone is an alien
when youre trying to find your place
