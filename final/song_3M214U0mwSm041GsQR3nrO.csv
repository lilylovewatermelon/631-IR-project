all my friends are toxic all ambitionless
so rude and always negative
i need new friends but its not that quick and easy
oh im drowning let me breathe
chorus
im better off all by myself
though im feelin kinda empty without somebody else
oh i hear you cryin out for help
but you never showed for me when i was ringin your cell phone
oh you dont know how it feels to be alone
baby oh ill make you know ill make you know oh

bridge
oh im drowning let me breathe
im drowning let me breathe
oh im drowning let me breathe
im drowning let me breathe
