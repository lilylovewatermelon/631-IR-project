the love of your life
hes treating you wrong
you stand by his side
he lies all along

prechorus
its the fairytale you want
but the glimmer in your eyes have gone
and now youre alone ill lend you my shoulder to cry on

chorus
i wont let you down this time around
ill show you how oh no matter how far
i dont care where you are i wont let you down

verse 2
thanks for the tears the pain that you caused her
and now youre just a memory
an old familiar melody shes heard before

prechorus
its a fairytale you ended
done with your pretending youre the fool
oh youre the fool
and now shes alone ill give her my hand to hold on to

and ill show you how oh and no matter how far
