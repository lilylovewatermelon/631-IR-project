well the moon in new york tonight was beautiful
i wish you were around to see it too
im so happy i could cry whyd youd have to go and die like that
its a shame when people aint around to see
the smiles that they nurture the laughter they breed
these people dont know me and i dont plan on showing what ive seen
and i threw up on a corner in philadelphia
she said boy there aint no real point in helping ya
the only thing youve ever owned were high hopes and a pocket comb you fool
so dont act like you know who i am
cause the more ill explain the less youll understand
them assholes downtown are the only ones around that even try

chorus
so look up tonight
the moon shes shining
and well be alright
cause shes still smiling
the city lightsll blow mamas mind
the more i search the less i find
but im alright
cause shes here tonight
oh shes alright

verse 2
and i still recall the night you headed home
you were fighting so hard i knew you couldnt be alone
your hand in my hand i knew i had to be a man from that night on
and ill tell you all these stories one day
and well laugh like we used to and waste the night away
youll say boy how ive missed ya but son i was with you this whole time
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
so look up tonight
the moon shes shining
and well be alright
cause shes still smiling
the city lightsll blow mamas mind
the more i search the less i find
but im alright
cause shes here tonight
oh shes alright
shes alright
oh shes alright

outro
the moon in new york tonight was beautiful
i wish you were around to see it too
im so down that i could cry whyd my best friend up and die like that
hey baby um i just wanna see what youre doing
i love you byebyeembed"
