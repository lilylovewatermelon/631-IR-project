been sittin thinkin bout you and i
and wonderin why were not getting along
so frustrated cause what we had was a happy home
i dont know what the situation is but i can tell in the way we kiss
we dont talk no more it feels better when im alone

prechorus
sometimes i feel like theres no getting through to you
like you dont appreciate all that i do
you gotta show me that you want me to stay
dont turn and walk away

chorus
baby im slowly fallin out of love with you
i dont know what to do
how did we end up here this way
what are we gonna do
im slowly fallin out
baby were trippin on silly things
boy i need you to meet me halfway
if you want me to be with you

verse 2
