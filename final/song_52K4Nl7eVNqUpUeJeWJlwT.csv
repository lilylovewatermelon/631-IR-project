its been a while
i know i shouldnt have kept you waiting
but im here now

verse 1
i know its been a while but im glad you came
and ive been thinking bout how you say my name
you got my body spinning like a hurricane
and it feels like you got me going insane
and i cant get enough so let me get it up

prechorus
ooh looks like were alone now
you aint gotta be scared were grown now

we can turn the heat up if you wanna
turn the lights down low if you wanna
just wanna move you but you froze up

allow me to get you right
