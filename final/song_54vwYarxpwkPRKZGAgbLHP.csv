life is like a melody sang deep within my soul sang deep within to me
and all these chains that shackle me
they wont let me take control
they wanna take control of me
ive got to rise above my life
to find the reason im alive
ill save myself im all alone
ive opened my heart to see theres nobody home
its up to me im on my own
the message of life is turning facing the storm
facing the storm
life is filled with your memory
you were deep within my heart
you were deep with inside me
with all this pain that im wrapped around
if theres a heaven up above
i see the angels falling down
ive got to rise above my life
to find the reason im alive
ill save myself im all alone
ive opened my heart to see theres nobody home
its up to me im on own
the message of life is turning facing the storm
facing the storm
facing the storm
ill save myself im all alone
ive opened my heart to see theirs nobody home
its up to me im on my own
the messege of life its turning facing the storm
the messge of life is turning facing the storm the messege of life
is turning facing the storm
the messge of life is turning facing the storm the messege of life
is turning facing the stormyou might also likeembed"
