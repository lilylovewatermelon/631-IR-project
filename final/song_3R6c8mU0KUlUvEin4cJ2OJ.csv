they got my favorite lotion here
something in a hotel i admire
i got the pictures that you sent me
and how they fill me with desire
tonight weve all got our own rooms
i’m about to burn mine down
cause i miss you somethin fierce
in this quaint new england town
i read the texts you whispered plain
everything you aim to do
i sure do like the way you think
that’s the way im thinking too
i see it play out in my mind
you and i unite as one
the van dont leave til 10 am
and weve only just begun

chorus
this one here goes out to you
lord wherever you may be
when youre reaching for the fruit
i pray youll fondly think of me
it gets so hard out on the road
but im going alone ’cause i’m your man
i have got you on my mind
and my ever lovin hand
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likeverse 2
for a moment you were here
moment passed and you were gone
leavin’ me to clean the mess
that you clearly helped to cause
when the boys ask how i slept
ill just look em in the eye
tell them all youd come to visit
i didn’t get a wink of sleep last night

chorus
this one here goes out to you
lord wherever you may be
when youre reaching for the fruit
i pray youll fondly think of me
it gets so hard out on the road
but im going alone cause im your man
i have got you on my mind
and my ever lovin hand
it gets so hard out on the road
but im going alone cause im your man
i have got you on my mind
and my ever lovin handembed"
