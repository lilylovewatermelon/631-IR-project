im nervous couldn’t tell you why
touching me hands warm on my thighs
and i know i could turn a blind eye
afraid of what im gonna find
does it really have to be this way
oh and my body hasnt felt the same
since you left my apartment
think my pillows still have your scent

chorus
i just want to let you know
i’m seeing the sides that you dont show
and i know that weve got some potential
cause that look you gave me was so gentle

verse 2
do you think that you could stay
i need more time i need to get away from here
pour my love out
spill it all on the ground
is it all in my head what are you saying
usually id be fine but my head is spinning
i never let anybody in
somehow you got under my skin
you might also likechorus
never seen a face like yours
i got it together but my breath feels short
i dont wanna close the door
maybe i should just go up north

bridge
all im tryna say
is i miss you in every way
fingertips on my back
things i know that i cant have

chorus
never seen a face like yours
i got it together but my breath feels short
i don’t wanna close the door
maybe i should just go up north

outro
maybe i should just go up north
maybe i should just go up north10embed"
