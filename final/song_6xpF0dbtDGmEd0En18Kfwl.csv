gave you my older heart still and strong
but i wouldnt have a fire like i do today
oh it burns for you babe

oh you got nothing on my tendency to be led astray
oh it took a blindside hit to show me the right of way

when your footsteps conquer the street
from your eyes to the soles of your feet
may my body and heart remain wild
for im a wandering child

i could keep an arms length
so i dont fall
i never learned to punch with my back against the wall
oh no i gotta let it go

and i got a feeling
deep in my bones
i cant sit still when theres a space up in the road
theres a fire coming on you in your lane
and it burns for you babe

oh you got nothing on my tendency to be led astray
oh it took a blindside hit to show me the right of way
see wild rivers liveget tickets as low as 103you might also likewhen your footsteps conquer the street
from your eyes to the soles of your feet
may my body and heart remain wild
for im a wandering child

and i hope to god the time aint wrong
and i hope to god the time aint wrong
â€˜cause i cant be holding on like this for long x3embed"
