im in love alright
with my crazy beautiful life
with the parties the disasters
with my friends all pretty and plastered
every night were down to go out
wakin up on a different couch
til the next night on the next flight
yeah i guess were doin alright

prechorus
ohohoh
were fallin in love
ohohoh
til the suns comin up
ohohoh
just livin the life
ohohoh

chorus
every single night we fight
to get a little high on life
to get a little somethin right somethin real
at least we try
time after time
try dodgin all the douchebag guys
try tradin all the wasted times for somethin real
in this crazy life
