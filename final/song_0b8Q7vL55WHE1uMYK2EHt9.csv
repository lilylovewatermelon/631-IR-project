karl marx

        shortly after adumbrating the materialist conception of history in the 1844 manuscripts and formulating it comprehensively in part i of the german ideology marx turned to the economic studies that were going to preoccupy him in the ensuing years this did not signify any change of interests or outlook but was the logical outgrowth of the position taken in his earlier writings if the thesis on alienated labor was to be made scientifically cogent and if the expectation of coming proletarian revolution was to be based upon it he needed to show the capitallabor relationship which he took to be the core of the bourgeois socioeconomic system to be dialectically selfdestructive ie  transitory by virtue of its inner dynamics of development the first work in which he attempted this analysis was wage labour and capital

        having first presented it in lectures to a german workers society in brussels in december 1847 marx printed the work in april 1849 in the neue rheinische zeitung of which he was editorinchief several pamphlet editions appeared in later years in editing it for the german edition of 1891 the version that appears here engels made some changes in the text mainly centering in the substitution of the phrase labour power for the term labour in contexts in which marx had originally spoken of the workers sale of his labour to the capitalist this as engels explained in his preface to the 1891 edition brought the reasoning of the pamphlet into line with the analysis o f the capitallabor relationship as marx had refined it by 1859 when he published a contribution to the critique of political economy

        despite this it may be said that what marx produced in the lectures of late 1847 was the future argument of capital in embryo the work appears here in condensed form

i

        from various quarters we have been reproached with not having presented the economic relations which constitute the material foundation of the present class struggles and national struggles we have designedly touched upon these relations only where they directly forced themselves to the front in political conflicts

  

        now after our readers have seen the class struggle develop in colossal political forms in 1848 the time has come to deal more closely with the economic relations themselves on which the existence of the bourgeoisie and its class rule as well as the slavery of the workers are founded

  

        now therefore for the first question what are wages how are they determined

        if workers were asked how much are your wages one would reply i get a mark a day from my employer another i get two marks and so on according to the different trades to which they belong they would mention different sums of money which they receive from their respective employers for the performance of a particular piece of work for example weaving a yard of linen or typesetting a printed sheet in spite of the variety of their statements they would all agree on one point wages are the sum of money paid by the capitalist for a particular labour time or for a particular output of labour

        the capitalist it seems therefore buys their labour with money they sell him their labour for money but this is merely the appearance in reality what they sell to the capitalist for money is their labour power the capitalist buys this labour power for a day a week a month etc and after he has bought it he uses it by having the workers work for the stipulated time for the same sum with which the capitalist has bought their labour power for example two marks he could have bought two pounds of sugar or a definite amount of any other commodity the two marks with which he bought two pounds of sugar are the price of the two pounds of sugar the two marks with which he bought twelve hours use of labour power are the price of twelve hours labour labour power therefore is a commodity neither more nor less than sugar the former is measured by the clock the latter by the scales
  

        labour power is therefore a commodity which its possessor the wageworker sells to capital why does he sell it in order to live

        but the exercise of labour power labour is the workers own lifeactivity the manifestation of his own life and this lifeactivity he sells to another person in order to secure the necessary means of subsistence thus his lifeactivity is for him only a means to enable him to exist he works in order to live he does not even reckon labour as part of his life it is rather a sacrifice of his life it is a commodity which he has made over to another hence also the product of his activity is not the object of his activity what he produces for himself is not the silk that he weaves not the gold that he draws from the mine not the palace that he builds what he produces for himself is wages and silk gold palace resolve themselves for him into a definite quantity of the means of subsistence perhaps into a cotton jacket some copper coins and a lodging in a cellar and the worker who for twelve hours weaves spins drills turns builds shovels breaks stones carries loads etcdoes he consider this twelve hours weaving spinning drilling turning building shovelling stone breaking as a manifestation of his life as life on the contrary life begins for him where this activity ceases at table in the public house in bed the twelve hours labour on the other hand has no meaning for him as weaving spinning drilling etc but as earnings which bring him to the table to the public house into bed if the silk worm were to spin in order to continue its existence as a caterpillar it would be a complete wageworker labour power was not always a commodity labour was not always wage labour that is free labour the slave did not sell his labour power to the slave owner any more than the ox sells its services to the peasant the slave together with his labour power is sold once and for all to his owner he is a commodity which can pass from the hand of one owner to that of another he is himself a commodity but the labour power is not his commodity the serf sells only a part of his labour power he does not receive a wage from the owner of the land rather the owner of the land receives a tribute from him

        the serf belongs to the land and turns over to the owner of the land the fruits thereof the free labourer on the other hand sells himself and indeed sells himself piecemeal he sells at auction eight ten twelve fifteen hours of his life day after day to the highest bidder to the owner of the raw materials instruments of labour and means of subsistence that is to the capitalist the worker belongs neither to an owner nor to the land but eight ten twelve fifteen hours of his daily life belong to him who buys them the worker leaves the capitalist to whom he hires himself whenever he likes and the capitalist discharges him whenever he thinks fit as soon as he no longer gets any profit out of him or not the anticipated profit but the worker whose sale source of livelihood is the sale of his labour power cannot leave the whole class of purchasers that is the capitalist class without renouncing his existence he belongs not to this or that capitalist but to the capitalist class and moreover it is his business to dispose of himself that is to find a purchaser within this capitalist class

  

        wages will rise and fall according to the relation of supply and demand according to the turn taken by the competition between the buyers of labour power the capitalists and the sellers of labour power the workers the fluctuations in wages correspond in general to the fluctuations in prices of commodities within these fluctuations however the price of labour will be determined by the cost of production by the labour time necessary to produce this commoditylabour power

        what then is the cost of production of labour power

        it is the cost required for maintaining the worker as a worker and of developing him into a worker

        the less the period of training therefore that any work requires the smaller is the cost of production of the worker and the lower is the price of his labour his wages in those branches of industry in which hardly any period of apprenticeship is required and where the mere bodily existence of the worker suffices the cost necessary for his production is almost confined to the commodities necessary for keeping him alive and capable of working the price of his labour will therefore be determined by the price of the necessary means of subsistence

        another consideration however also comes in the manufacturer in calculating his cost of production and accordingly the price of the products takes into account the wear and tear of the instruments of labour if for example a machine costs him 1000 marks and wears out in ten years he adds 100 marks annually to the price of the commodities so as to be able to replace the wornout machine by a new one at the end of ten years in the same way in calculating the cost of production of simple labour power there must be included the cost of reproduction whereby the race of workers is enabled to multiply and to replace wornout workers by new ones thus the depreciation of the worker is taken into account in the same way as the depreciation of the machine

        the cost of production of simple labour power therefore amounts to the cost of existence and reproduction of the worker the price of this cost of existence and reproduction constitutes wages wages so determined are called the wage minimum this wage minimum like the determination of the price of commodities by the cost of production in general does not hold good for the single individual but for the species individual workers millions of workers do not get enough to be able to exist and reproduce themselves but the wages of the whole working class level down within their fluctuations to this minimum

        now that we have arrived at an understanding of the most general laws which regulate wages like the price of any other commodity we can go into our subject more specifically

iii
        capital consists of raw materials instruments of labour and means of subsistence of all kinds which are utilised in order to produce new raw materials new instruments of labour and new means of subsistence all these component parts of capital are creations of labour products of labour accumulated labour accumulated labour which serves as a means of new production is capital

        so say the economists

        what is a negro slave a man of the black race the one explanation is as good as the other

        a negro is a negro he only becomes a slave in certain relations a cottonspinning jenny is a machine for spinning cotton it becomes capital only in certain relations torn from these relationships it is no more capital than gold in itself is money or sugar the price of sugar

        in production men not only act on nature but also on one another they produce only by cooperating in a certain way and mutually exchanging their activities in order to produce they enter into definite connections and relations with one another and only within these social connections and relations does their action on nature does production take place

        these social relations into which the producers enter with one another the conditions under which they exchange their activities and participate in the whole act of production will naturally vary according to the character of the means of production with the invention of a new instrument of warfare firearms the whole internal organisation of the army necessarily changed the relationships within which individuals can constitute an army and act as an army were transformed and the relations of different armies to one another also changed

        thus the social relations within which individuals produce the social relations of production change are transformed with the change and development of the material means of production the productive forces the relations of production in their totality constitute what are called the social relations society and specifically a society at a definite stage of historical development a society with a peculiar distinctive character ancient society feudal society bourgeois society are such totalities of production relations each of which at the same time denotes a special stage of development in the history of mankind

        capital also is a social relation of production it is a bourgeois production relation a production relation of bourgeois society are not the means of subsistence the instruments of labour the raw materials of which capital consists produced and accumulated under given social conditions in definite social relations are they not utilised for new production under given social conditions in definite social relations and is it not just this definite social character which turns the products serving for new production into capital

        capital consists not only of means of subsistence instruments of labour and raw materials not only of material products it consists just as much of exchange values all the products of which it consists are commodities capital is therefore not only a sum of material products it is a sum of commodities of exchange values of social magnitudes

        capital remains the same whether we put cotton in place of wool rice in place of wheat or steamships in place of railways provided only that the cotton the rice the steamshipsthe body of capitalhave the same exchange value the same price as the wool the wheat the railways in which it was previously incorporated the body of capital can change continually without the capital suffering the slightest alteration

        but while all capital is a sum of commodities that is of exchange values not every sum of commodities of exchange values is capital

        every sum of exchange values is an exchange value every separate exchange value is a sum of exchange values for instance a house that is worth 1000 marks is an exchange value of 1000 marks a piece of paper worth a pfennig is a sum of exchange values of onehundred hundredths of a pfennig  products which are exchangeable for others are commodities the particular ratio in which they are exchangeable constitutes their exchange value or expressed in money their price the quantity of these products can change nothing in their quality of being commodities or representing an exchange value or having a definite price whether a tree is large or small it is a tree whether we exchange iron for other products in ounces or in hundredweights does this make any difference in its character as commodity as exchange value it is a commodity of greater or lesser value of higher or lower price depending upon the quantity

        how then does any amount of commodities of exchange value become capital
        by maintaining and multiplying itself as an independent social power that is as the power of a portion of society by means of its exchange for direct living labour power the existence of a class which possesses nothing but its capacity to labour is a necessary prerequisite of capital

        it is only the domination of accumulated past materialised labour over direct living labour that turns accumulated labour into capital

        capital does not consist in accumulated labour serving living labour as a means for new production it consists in living labour serving accumulated labour as a means of maintaining and multiplying the exchange value of the latter

        what takes place in the exchange between capitalist and wageworker

        the worker receives means of subsistence in exchange for his labour power but the capitalist receives in exchange for his means of subsistence labour the productive activity of the worker the creative power whereby the worker not only replaces what he consumes but gives to the accumulated labour a greater value than it previously possessed the worker receives a part of the available means of subsistence from the capitalist for what purpose do these means of subsistence serve him for immediate consumption as soon however as i consume the means of subsistence they are irretrievably lost to me unless i use the time during which i am kept alive by them in order to produce new means of subsistence in order during consumption to create by my labour new values in place of the values which perish in being consumed but it is just this noble reproductive power that the worker surrenders to the capitalist in exchange for means of subsistence received he has therefore lost it for himself

        let us take an example a tenant farmer gives his day labourer five silver groschen a day for these five silver groschen the labourer works all day on the farmers field and thus secures him a return of ten silver groschen the farmer not only gets the value replaced that he has to give the day labourer he doubles it he has therefore employed consumed the five silver groschen that he gave to the labourer in a fruitful productive manner he has bought with the five silver groschen just that labour and power of the labourer which produces agricultural products of double value and makes ten silver groschen out of five the day labourer on the other hand receives in place of his productive power the effect of which he has bargained away to the farmer five silver groschen which he exchanges for means of subsistence and these he consumes with greater or less rapidity the five silver groschen have therefore been consumed in a double way reproductively for capital for they have been exchanged for labour power which produced ten silver groschen unproductively for the worker for they have been exchanged for means of subsistence which have disappeared forever and the value of which he can only recover by repeating the same exchange with the farmer thus capital presupposes wage labour wage labour presupposes capital they reciprocally condition the existence of each other they reciprocally bring forth each other

        does a worker in a cotton factory produce merely cotton textiles no he produces capital he produces values which serve afresh to command his labour and by means of it to create new values

        capital can only increase by exchanging itself for labour power by calling wage labour to life the labour power of the wageworker can only be exchanged for capital by increasing capital by strengthening the power whose slave it is hence increase of capital is increase of the proletariat that is of the working class

        the interests of the capitalist and those of the worker are therefore one and the same assert the bourgeois and their economists indeed the worker perishes if capital does not employ him capital perishes if it does not exploit labour power and in order to exploit it it must buy it the faster capital intended far production productive capital increases the more therefore industry prospers the more the bourgeoisie enriches itself and the better business is the more workers does the capitalist need the more dearly does the worker sell himself

        the indispensable condition for a tolerable situation of the worker is therefore the fastest possible growth of productive capital

        but what is the growth of productive capital growth of the power of accumulated labour over living labour growth of the domination of the bourgeoisie over the working class if wage labour produces the wealth of others that rules over it the power that is hostile to it capital then the means of employment the means of subsistence flow back to it from this hostile power on condition that it makes itself afresh into a part of capital into the lever which hurls capital anew into an accelerated movement of growth

        to say that the interests of capital and those of the workers are one and the same is only to say that capital and wage labour are two sides of one and the same relation the one conditions the other just as usurer and squanderer condition each other

        as long as the wageworker is a wageworker his lot depends up on capital that is the muchvaunted community of interests between worker and capitalist

iv

        if capital grows the mass of wage labour grows the number of wageworkers grows in a ward the domination of capital extends over a greater number of individuals

  

        to say that the worker has an interest in the rapid growth of capital is only to say that the more rapidly the worker increases the wealth of others the richer will be the crumbs that fall to him the greater is the number of workers that can be employed and called into existence the more can the mass of slaves dependent on capital be increased

        we have thus seen that

        even the most favourable situation for the working class the most rapid possible growth of capital however much it may improve the material existence of the worker does not remove the antagonism between his interests and the interests of the bourgeoisie the interests of the capitalists profit and wages remain as before in inverse porportion

        if capital is growing rapidly wages may rise the profit of capital rises incomparably more rapidly the material position of the worker has improved but at the cost of his social position the social gulf that divides him from the capitalist has widened

        finally 

        to say that the most favourable condition for wage labour is the most rapid possible growth of productive capital is only to say that the more rapidly the working class increases and enlarges the power that is hostile to it the wealth that does not belong to it and that rules over it the more favourable will be the conditions under which it is allowed to labour anew at increasing bourgeois wealth at enlarging the power of capital content with forging for itself the golden chains by which the bourgeoisie drags it in its train

v

        are growth of productive capital and rise of wages really so inseparably connected as the bourgeois economists maintain we must not take their word for it we must not even believe them when they say that the fatter capital is the better will its slave be fed the bourgeoisie is too enlightened it calculates too well to share the prejudices of the feudal lord who makes a display by the brilliance of his retinue the conditions of existence of the bourgeoisie compel it to calculate

        we must therefore examine more closely

        how does the growth of productive capital affect wages

        if on the whole the productive capital of bourgeois society grows a more manifold accumulation of labour takes place the capitals increase in number and extent the numerical increase of the capitals increases the competition between the capitalists the increasing extent of the capitals provides the means for bringing more powerful labour armies with more gigantic instruments of war into the industrial battlefield

        one capitalist can drive another from the field and capture his capital only by selling more cheaply in order to be able to sell more cheaply without ruining himself he must produce more cheaply that is raise the productive power of labour as much as possible but the productive power of labour is raised above all by a greater division of labour by a more universal introduction and continual improvement of machinery the greater the labour army among whom labour is divided the more gigantic the scale on which machinery is introduced the more does the cost of production proportionately decrease the more fruitful is labour hence a general rivalry arises among the capitalists to increase the division of labour and machinery and to exploit them on the greatest possible scale

        if now by a greater division of labour by the utilisation of new machines and their improvement by more profitable and extensive exploitation of natural forces one capitalist has found the means of producing with the same amount of labour or of accumulated labour a greater amount of products of commodities than his competitors if he can for example produce a whole yard of linen in the same labour time in which his competitors weave half a yard how will this capitalist operate

        he could continue to sell half a yard of linen at the old market price this would however be no means of driving his opponents from the field and of enlarging his own sales but in the same measure in which his production has expanded his need to sell has also increased the more powerful and costly means of production that he has called into life enable him indeed to sell his commodities more cheaply they compel him however at the same time to sell more commodities to conquer a much larger market for his commodities consequently our capitalist will sell his half yard of linen more cheaply than his competitors

        the capitalist will not however sell a whole yard as cheaply as his competitors sell half a yard although the production of the whole yard does not cost him more than the half yard costs the others otherwise he would not gain anything extra but only get back the cost of production by the exchange his possibly greater income would be derived from the fact of having set a larger capital into motion but not from having made more of his capital than the others moreover he attains the object he wishes to attain if he puts the price of his goods only a small percentage lower than that of his competitors he drives them from the field he wrests from them at least a part of their sales by underselling them and finally it will be remembered that the current price always stands above or below the cost of production according to whether the sale of the commodity occurs in a favourable or unfavourable industrial season the percentage at which the capitalist who has employed new and more fruitful means of production sells above his real cost of production will vary depending upon whether the market price of a yard of linen stands below or above its hitherto customary cost of production

        however the privileged position of our capitalist is not of long duration other competing capitalists introduce the same machines the same division of labour introduce them on the same or on a larger scale and this introduction will become so general that the price of linen is reduced not only below its old but below its new cost of production

        the capitalists find themselves therefore in the same position relative to one another as before the introduction of the new means of production and if they are able to supply by these means double the production at the same price they are now forced to supply the double product below the old price on the basis of this new cost of production the same game begins again more division of labour more machinery enlarged scale of exploitation of machinery and division of labour and again competition brings the same counteraction against this result

        we see how in this way the mode of production and the means of production are continually transformed revolutionised how the division of labour is necessarily followed by greater division of labour the application of machinery by still greater application of machinery work on a large scale by work on a still larger scale

        that is the law which again and again throws bourgeois production out of its old course and which compels capital to intensify the productive forces of labour because it has intensified them it the law which gives capital no rest and continually whispers in its ear

        go on go on 

        this law is none other than that which within the fluctuations of trade periods necessarily levels out the price of a commodity to its cost of production

        however powerful the means of production which a capitalist brings into the field competition will make these means of production universal and from the moment when it has made them universal the only result of the greater fruitfulness of his capital is that he must now supply for the same price ten twenty a hundred times as much as before but as he must sell perhaps a thousand times as much as before in order to outweigh the lower selling price by the greater amount of the product sold because a more extensive sale is now necessary not only in order to make more profit but in order to replace the cost of productionthe instrument of production itself as we have seen becomes more and more expensiveand because this mass sale becomes a question of life and death not only for him but also for his rivals the old struggle begins again all the more violently the more fruitful the already discovered means of production are the division of labour and the application of machinery therefore will go on anew on an incomparably greater scale

        whatever the power of the means of production employed may be competition seeks to rob capital of the golden fruits of this power by bringing the price of the commodities back to the cost of production by thus making cheaper productionthe supply of ever greater amounts of products for the same total pricean imperative law to the same extent as production can be cheapened that is as more can be produced with the same amount of labour thus the capitalist would have won nothing by his own exertions but the obligation to supply more in the same labour time in a word more difficult conditions for the augmentation of the value of his capital while therefore competition continually pursues him with its law of the cost of production and every weapon that he forges against his rivals recoils against himself the capitalist continually tries to get the better of competition by incessantly introducing new machines more expensive it is true but producing more cheaply and new division of labour in place of the old and by not waiting until competition has rendered the new ones obsolete

        if now we picture to ourselves this feverish simultaneous agitation on the whole world market it will be comprehensible how the growth accumulation and concentration of capital results in an uninterrupted division of labour and in the application of new and the perfecting of old machinery precipitately and on an ever more gigantic scale

        but how do these circumstances which are inseparable from the growth of productive capital affect the determination of wages

        the greater division of labour enables one worker to do the work of five ten or twenty it therefore multiplies competition among the workers fivefold tenfold and twentyfold the workers do not only compete by one selling himself cheaper than another they compete by one doing the work of five ten twenty and the division of labour introduced by capital and continually increased compels the workers to compete among themselves in this way

        further as the division of labour increases labour is simplified the special skill of the worker becomes worthless he becomes transformed into a simple monotonous productive force that does not have to use intense bodily or intellectual faculties his labour becomes a labour that anyone can perform hence competitors crowd upon him on all sides and besides we remind the reader that the more simple and easily learned the labour is the lower the cost of production needed to master it the lower do wages sink for like the price of every other commodity they are determined by the cost of production

        therefore as labour becomes more unsatisfying more repulsive competition increases and wages decrease the worker tries to keep up the amount of his wages by working more whether by working longer hours or by producing more in one hour driven by want therefore he still further increases the evil effects of the division of labour the result is that the more he works the less wages he receives and for the simple reason that he competes to that extent with his fellow workers hence makes them into so many competitors who offer themselves on just the same bad terms as he does himself and that therefore in the last resort he competes with himself with himself as a member of the working class

        machinery brings about the same results on a much greater scale by replacing skilled workers by unskilled men by women adults by children it brings about the same results where it is newly introduced by throwing the hand workers on to the streets in masses and where it is developed improved and replaced by more productive machinery by discharging workers in smaller batches we have portrayed above in a hasty sketch the industrial war of the capitalists among themselves this war has the peculiarity that its battles are won less by recruiting than by discharging the army of labour the generals the capitalists compete with one another as to who can discharge most soldiers of industry

        the economists tell us it is true that the workers rendered superfluous by machinery find new branches of employment

        they dare not assert directly that the same workers who are discharged find places in the new branches of labour the facts cry out too loudly against this lie they really only assert that new means of employment will open up for other component sections of the working class for instance for the portion of the young generation of workers that was ready to enter the branch of industry which has gone under that is of course a great consolation for the disinherited workers the worshipful capitalists will never want for fresh exploitable flesh and blood and will let the dead bury their dead this is a consolation which the bourgeois give themselves rather than one which they give the workers if the whole class of wageworkers were to be abolished owing to machinery how dreadful that would be for capital which without wage labour ceases to be capital

        let us suppose however that those directly driven out of their jobs by machinery and the entire section of the new generation that was already on the watch for this employment find a new occupation does any one imagine that it will be as highly paid as that which has been lost that would contradict all the laws of economics we have seen how modern industry always brings with it the substitution of a more simple subordinate occupation for the more complex and higher one

        how then could a mass of workers who have been thrown out of one branch of industry owing to machinery find refuge in another unless the latter is lower worse paid

        the workers who work in the manufacture of machinery itself have been cited as an exception as soon as more machinery is demanded and used in industry it is said there must necessarily be an increase of machines consequently of the manufacture of machines and consequently of the employment of workers in the manufacture of machines and the workers engaged in this branch of industry are claimed to be skilled even educated workers

        since the year 1840 this assertion which even before was only half true has lost all semblance of truth because ever more versatile machines have been employed in the manufacture of machinery no more and no less than in the manufacture of cotton yarn and the workers employed in the machine factories confronted by highly elaborate machines can only play the part of highly unelaborate machines

        but in place of the man who has been discharged owing to the machine the factory employs maybe three children and one woman and did not the mans wages have to suffice for the three children and a woman did not the minimum of wages have to suffice to maintain and to propagate the race what then does this favourite bourgeois phrase prove nothing more than that now four times as many workers lives are used up in order to gain a livelihood for one workers family

        let us sum up the more productive capital grows the more the division of labour and the application of machinery expands the more the division of labour and the application of machinery expands the more competition among the workers expands and the more their wages contract

        in addition the working class gains recruits from the higher strata of society also a mass of petty industrialists and small rentiers are hurled down into its ranks and have nothing better to do than urgently stretch out their arms alongside those of the workers thus the forest of uplifted arms demanding work becomes ever thicker while the arms themselves become ever thinner

        that the small industrialist cannot survive in a contest one of the first conditions of which is to produce on an ever greater scale that is precisely to be a large and not a small industrialist is selfevident

        that the interest on capital decreases in the same measure as the mass and number of capitals increase as capital grows that therefore the small rentier can no longer live on his interest but must throw himself into industry and consequently help to swell the ranks of the small industrialists and thereby of candidates for the proletariatall this surely requires no further explanation

        finally as the capitalists are compelled by the movement described above to exploit the already existing gigantic means of production on a larger scale and to set in motion all the mainsprings of credit to this end there is a corresponding increase in industrial earthquakes in which the trading world can only maintain itself by sacrificing a part of wealth of products and even of productive forces to the gods of the nether worldin a word crises increase they become more frequent and more violent if only because as the mass of production and consequently the need for extended markets grows the world market becomes more and more contracted fewer and fewer new markets remain available for exploitation since every preceding crisis has subjected to world trade a market hitherto unconquered or only superficially exploited but capital does not live only on labour a lord at once aristocratic and barbarous it drags with it into the grave the corpses of its slaves whole hecatombs of workers who perish in the crises thus we see if capital grows rapidly competition among the workers grows incomparably more rapidly that is the means of employment the means of subsistence of the working class decrease proportionately so much the more and nevertheless the rapid growth of capital is the most favourable condition for wage labour


the coming upheaval

karl marx

        this concluding passage from marxs antiproudhon tract the poverty of philosophy 1847 closes a discussion which takes england as the representative case of a revolutionbent country it gives a vivid preview of the revolutionary upheaval towards which marx believed that the class struggle in all capitalist countries was irresistibly moving it was in a way capitals conclusion stated in advance note the hegelian terminology in marxs depiction of the proletariat becoming in and through the warfare of labor and capital a class not only in itself but also for itself ie collectively conscious of itself and its revolutionary aims as a class

  

        economic conditions first transformed the mass of the people of the country into workers the combination of capital has created for this mass a common situation common interests this mass is thus already a class as against capital but not yet for itself in the struggle of which we have noted only a few phases this mass becomes united and constitutes itself as a class for itself the interests it defends become class interests  but the struggle of class against class is a political struggle

        an oppressed class is the vital condition for every society founded on the antagonism of classes the emancipation of the oppressed class thus implies necessarily the creation of a new society for the oppressed class to be able to emancipate itself it is necessary that the productive powers already acquired and the existing social reiations should no longer be capable of existing side by side of all the instruments of production the greatest productive power is the revolutionary class itself the organization of revolutionary elements as a class supposes the existence of all the productive forces which could be engendered in the bosom of the old society

        does this mean that after the fall of the old society there will be a new class domination culminating in a new political power no

        the condition for the emancipation of the working class is the abolition of every class just as the condition for the liberation of the third estate of the bourgeois order was the abolition of all estates and all orders

        the working class in the course of its development will substitute for the old civil society an association which will exclude classes and their antagonism and there will be no more political power properly so called since political power is precisely the official expression of antagonism in civil society

        meanwhile the antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is a struggle of class against class a struggle which carried to its highest expression is a total revolution indeed is it at all surprising that a society founded on the opposition of classes should culminate in brutal contradiction the shock of body against body as its final dénouement

        do not say that social movement excludes political movement there is never a political movement which is not at the same time social

        it is only in an order of things in which there are no more classes and class antagonisms that social evolutions will cease to be political revolutions till then on the eve of every general reshuffling of society the last word of social science will always be combat or death  bloody struggle or extinction it is thus that the question is inexorably put1

        and now as to myself no credit is due to me for discovering the existence of classes in modern society or the struggle between them long before me bourgeois historians had described the historical development of this class struggle and bourgeois economists the economic anatomy of the classes what i did that was new was to prove 1 that the existence of classes is only bound up with particular historical phases in the development of production 2 that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat 3 that this dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society

the grundrisse

karl marx

        comprising seven notebooks written in 185758 this preparatory effort by marx to put together the results of his economic studies was first published by the institute of marxengelslenin in moscow in 193941 as foundations grundrisse of the critique of political economy in recent years it has attracted growing attention because of the intrinsic interest of various parts because it forms an important link between the early writings and capital and because the very rawness of much of the text enhances its value as a revelation of marxs creative mental process the great bulk of it consists of an introduction a chapter on money and a chapter on capital the introduction which appears here in full and several selections from the chapter on capital have been chosen partly for what they add to the study of capital the reader not yet familiar with the basic argument of capital may therefore prefer to turn first to that work below and then return to the grundrisse

        the introduction besides stating marxs view of the method of political economy develops his thesis on production as the basic category shows in the final paragraph of its third section that the work on which he was embarked and which later came to fruition in capital was no more than one part of a more ambitious total project and concludes with a discussion of the timeless character of great art section b defines society section c deals with capitalism as incessant drive for surplus value and alludes to future communism as a society in which labour appears no longer as labour but as the full development of activity itself      section d suplements capital on primitive accumulation section e deals with precapitalist economies and the birth of capitalism section f summarizes marxs views on population and malthus section g contains a nowfamous discussion of everincreasing automation under capitalism section h envisages capitalisms ultimate violent overthrow section i contrasts the alienation of labour under capitalism with the postulated ending of alienation in the future in these and other passages of the grundrisse marx here and there uses the alienation terminology which had been pervasive in the 1844 manuscripts but would grow inconspicuous in capital

        the translation and footnotes are by martin nicolaus the capitalized letters and section headings following the introduction have been added by the editor of this reader

this last point is made compellingly by martin nicolaus in his informative foreword to karl marx grundrisse foundations of the critique of political economy translated by martin nicolaus new york vintage 1973 p 7 the same point could be made with reference to the 1844 manuscripts

 some have interpreted these passages as heralding the end of manual labour under capitalism nicolaus foreword p 52 objects that neither here nor anywhere else in marxs work is there a prediction that manual industrial labour will be abolished in industrial society

eternalization of historic relations of production production and distribution in general property

        whenever we speak of production then what is meant is always production at a definite stage of social developmentproduction by social individuals it might seem therefore that in order to talk about production at all we must either pursue the process of historic development through its different phases or declare beforehand that we a re dealing with a specific historic epoch such as eg modern bourgeois production which is indeed our particular theme however all epochs of production have certain common traits common characteristics production in general is an abstraction but a rational abstraction in so far as it really brings out and fixes the common element and thus saves us repetition still this general category this common element sifted out by comparison is itself segmented many times over and splits into different determinations some determinations belong to all epochs others only to a few some determinations will be shared by the most modern epoch and the most ancient no production will be thinkable without them however even though the most developed languages have laws and characteristics in common with the least developed nevertheless just those things which determine their development ie the elements which are not general and common must be separated out from the determinations valid for production as such so that in their unitywhich a rises already from the identity of the subject humanity and of the object naturetheir essential difference is not forgotten the whole profundity of those modern economists who demonstrate the eternity and harmoniousness of the existing social relations lies in this forgetting for example no production possible without an instrument of production even if this instrument is only the hand no production without storedup past labour even if it is only the facility gathered together and concentrated in the hand of the savage by repeated practice capital is among other things also an instrument of production also objectified past labour therefore capital is a general eternal relation of nature that is if i leave out just the specific quality which alone makes  instrument of production and storedup labour into capital the entire history of production relations thus appears to carey for example as a malicious forgery perpetrated by governments

        if there is no production in general then there is also no general production production is always a particular branch of productioneg agriculture cattleraising manufactures etcor it is a totality butt political economy is not technology the relation of the general characteristics of production at a given stage of social development to the particular forms of production to be developed elsewhere later lastly production also is not only a particular production rather it is always a certain social body a social subject which is active in a greater or sparser totality of branches of production nor does the relationship between scientific presentation and the real movement belong here yet production in general particular branches of production totality of production

        it is the fashion to preface a work of economics with a general partand precisely this part figures under the title production  see for example j s mill 7 treating of the general preconditions of all production this general part consists or is alleged to consist of  1 the conditions without which production is not possible ie in fact to indicate nothing more than the essential moments of all production but as we will see this reduces itself in fact to a few very simple characteristics which are hammered out into flat tautologies  2  the conditions which promote production to a greater or lesser degree such as eg adam smith s progressive and stagnant state of society while this is of value in his work as an insight to elevate it to scientific significance would require investigations into the periodization of degrees of productivity in the development of individual peoplesan investigation which lies outside the proper boundaries of the theme but in so far as it does belong there must be brought in as part of the development of competition accumulation etc in the usual formulation the answer amounts to the general statement that an industrial people reaches the peak of its production at the moment when it arrives at its historical peak generally in fact the industrial peak of a people when its main concern is not yet gain but rather to gain thus the yankees over the english or also that eg certain races locations climates natural conditions such as harbours soil fertility etc are more advantageous to production than others this too amounts to the tautology that wealth is more easily created where its elements are subjectively and objectively present to a greater degree

        but none of all this is the economists real concern in this general part the aim is rather to present productionsee eg millas distinct from distribution etc as encased in eternal natural laws independent of history at which opportunity bourgeois relations are then quietly smuggled in as the inviolable natural laws on which society in the abstract is founded this is the more or less conscious purpose of the whole proceeding in distribution by contrast humanity has allegedly permitted itself to be considerably more arbitrary quite apart from this crude tearingapart of production and distribution and of their real relationship it must be apparent from the outset that no matter how differently distribution may have been arranged in different stages of social development it must be possible here also just as with production to single out common characteristics and just as possible to confound or to extinguish all historic differences under general human laws for example the slave the serf and the wage labourer all receive a quantity of food which makes it possible for them to exist as slaves as serfs as wage labourers  the conqueror who lives from tribute or the official who lives from taxes or the landed proprietor and his rent or the monk and his alms or the levite and his tithe all receive a quota of social production which is determined by other laws than that of the slaves etc the two main points which all economists cite under this rubric are 1 property 2 its protection by courts police etc to this a very short answer may be given

        to 1 all production is appropriation of nature on the part of an individual within and through a specific form of society in this sense it is a tautology to say that property appropriation is a precondition of production but it is altogether ridiculous to leap from that to a specific form of property eg private property which further and equally presupposes an antithetical form nonproperty history rather shows common property eg in india among the slavs the early celts etc to be the more original form a form which long continues to play a significant role in the shape of communal property the question whether wealth develops better in this or another form of property is still quite beside the point here but that there can be no production and hence no society where some form of property does not exist is a tautology an appropriation which does not make something into property is a contradictio in subjecto

        to 2 protection of acquisitions etc when these trivialities are reduced to their real content they tell more than their preachers know namely that every form of production creates its own legal relations form of government etc in bringing things which are organically related into an accidental relation into a merely reflective connection they display their crudity and lack of conceptual understanding all the bourgeois economists are aware of is that production can be carried on better under the modern police than eg on the principle of might makes right they forget only that this principle is also a legal relation and that the right of the stronger prevails in their constitutional republics as well only in another form

7 john stuart mill 180673 english political theorist and economist radical in politics confusedly and eclectically ricardian in economics his principles of political economy london 1948 begin in bk i ch 1 with the analysis of production

        when the social conditions corresponding to a specific stage of production are only just arising or when they are already dying out there are naturally disturbances in production although to different degrees and with different effects

        to summarize there are characteristics which all stages of production have in common and which are established as general ones by the mind but the socalled general preconditions of all production are nothing mote than these abstract moments with which no real historical stage of production can be grasped

2 the general relation of production to distribution exchange consumption

        before going further in the analysis of production it is necessary to focus on the various categories which the economists line up next to it

        the obvious trite notion in production the members of society appropriate create shape the products of nature in accord with human needs distribution determines the proportion in which the individual shares in the product exchange delivers the particular products into which the individual desires to convert the portion which distribution has assigned to him and finally in consumption the products become objects of gratification of individual appropriation production creates the objects which correspond to the given needs distribution divides them up according to social laws exchange further parcels out the already divided shares in accord with individual needs and finally in consumption the product steps outside this social movement and becomes a direct object and servant of individual need and satisfies it in being consumed thus production appears as the point of departure consumption as the conclusion distribution and exchange as the middle which is however itself twofold since distribution is determined by society and exchange by individuals the person objectifies himself in production the thing subjectifies itself in the person in distribution society mediates between production and consumption in the form of general dominant determinants in exchange the two are mediated by the chance characteristics of the individual

        distribution determines the relation in which products fall to individuals the amount exchange determines the production in which the individual demands the portion allotted to him by distribution

        thus production distribution exchange and consumption form a regular syllogism production is the generality distribution and exchange the particularity and consumption the singularity in which the whole is joined together this is admittedly a coherence but a shallow one production is determined by general natural laws distribution by social accident and the latter may therefore promote production to a greater or lesser extent exchange stands between the two as formal social movement and the concluding act consumption which is conceived not only as a terminal point but also as an endinitself actually belongs outside economics except in so far as it reacts in turn upon the point of departure and initiates the whole process anew

        the opponents of the political economistswhether inside or outside its realmwho accuse them of barbarically tearing apart things which belong together stand either on the same ground as they or beneath them nothing is more common than the reproach that the political economists view production too much as an end in itself that distribution is just as important this accusation is based precisely on the economic notion that the spheres of distribution and of production are independent autonomous neighbours or that these moments were not grasped in their unity as if this rupture had made its way not from reality into the textbooks but rather from the textbooks into reality and as if the task were the dialectic balancing of concepts and pot the grasping of real relations

consumption and production

        a1 production is also immediately consumption twofold consumption subjective and objective the individual not only develops his abilities in production but also expends them uses them up in the act of production just as natural procreation is a consumption of life forces secondly consumption of the means of production which become worn out through use and are partly eg in combustion dissolved into their elements again likewise consumption of the raw material which loses its natural form and composition by being used up the act of production is therefore in all its moments also an act of consumption but the economists admit this production as directly identical with consumption and consumption as directly coincident with production is termed by them productive consumption this identity of production and consumption amounts to spinozas thesis determinatio est negatio8
8 determination is negation ie given the undifferentiated selfidentity of the universal world substance to attempt to introduce particular determinations is to negate this selfidentity spinoza letters no 50 to j jelles 2 june 1674

        but this definition of productive consumption is advanced only for the purpose of separating consumption as identical with production from consumption proper which is conceived rather as the destructive antithesis to production let us therefore examine consumption proper

        consumption is also immediately production just as in nature the consumption of the elements and chemical substances is the production of the plant it is clear that in taking in food for example which is a form of consumption the human being produces his own body but this is also true of every kind of consumption which in one way or another produces human beings in some particular aspect consumptive production but says economics this production which is identical with consumption is secondary it is derived from the destruction of the prior product in the former the producer objectified himself in the latter the object he created personifies itself hence this consumptive productioneven though it is an immediate unity of production and consumptionis essentially different from production proper the immediate unity in which production coincides with consumption and consumption with production leaves their immediate duality intact

        production then is also immediately consumption consumption is also immediately production each is immediately its opposite but at the same time a mediating movement takes place between the two production mediates consumption it creates the latters material without it consumption would lack an object but consumption also mediates production in that it alone creates for the products the subject for whom they are products the product only obtains its last finish9 in consumption a railway on which no trains run hence which is not used up not consumed is a railway only insert text1 and not in reality without production no consumption but also without consumption no production since production would then be purposeless consumption produces production in a double way 1 because a product becomes a real product only by being consumed for example a garment becomes a real garment only in the act of being worn a house where no one lives is in fact not a real house thus the product unlike a mere natural object proves itself to be becomes a product only through consumption only by decomposing the product does consumption give the product the finishing touch for the product is production not as2 objectified activity but rather only as object for the active subject 2 because consumption creates the need for new production that is it creates the ideal  internally impelling cause for production which is its presupposition consumption creates the motive for production it also creates the object which is active in production as its determinant aim if it is clear that production offers consumption its external object it is therefore equally clear that consumption ideally posits the object of production as an internal image as a need as drive and as purpose it creates the objects of production in a still subjective form no production without a need but consumption reproduces the need

1 potentially cf aristotle metaphysics bk viii ch 6 p 2 

2 the manuscript has for the product is production not only as    

3 the manuscript has “for production”

        production for its part correspondingly 1 furnishes the material and the object for consumption3 consumption without an object is not consumption therefore in this respect production creates produces consumption 2 but the object is not the only thing which production creates for consumption  production also gives consumption its specificity its character its finish just as consumption gave the product its finish as product so does production give finish to consumption firstly the object is not an object in general but a specific object which must be consumed in a specific manner to be mediated in its turn by production itself hunger is hunger but the hunger gratified by cooked meat eaten with a knife and fork is a different hunger from that which bolts down raw meat with the aid of hand nail and tooth production thus produces not only the object but also the manner of consumption not only objectively but also subjectively production thus creates the consumer 3 production not only supplies a material for the need but it also supplies a need for the material as soon as consumption emerges from its initial state of natural crudity and immediacy and if it remained at that stage this would be because production itself had been arrested there it becomes itself mediated as a drive by the object the need which consumption feels for the object is created by the perception of it the object of artlike every other productcreates a public which is sensitive to art and enjoys beauty production thus not only creates an object for the subject but also a subject for the object thus production produces consumption 1 by creating the material for it 2 by determining the manner of consumption and 3 by creating the products initially posited by it as objects in the form of a need felt by the consumer it thus produces the object of consumption the manner of consumption and the motive of consumption consumption likewise produces the producers inclination by beckoning to him as an aimdetermining need

        the identities between consumption and production thus appear threefold

        1 immediate identity production is consumption consumption is production consumptive production productive consumption the political economists call both productive consumption but then make a further distinction the first figures as reproduction the second as productive consumption all investigations into the first concern productive or unproductive labour investigations into the second concern productive or nonproductive consumption

        2 in the sense that one appears as a means for the other is mediated by the other this is expressed as their mutual dependence a movement which relates them to one another makes them appear indispensable to one another but still leaves them external to each other production creates the material as external object for consumption consumption creates the need as internal object as aim for production without production no consumption with out consumption no production this identity figures ill economics in many different forms

        3 not only is production immediately consumption and consumption immediately production not only is production a means for consumption and consumption the aim of production i e each supplies the other with its object production supplying the external object of consumption consumption the conceived object of production but also each of them apart from being immediately the other and apart from mediating the other in addition to this creates the other in completing itself and creates itself as the other consumption accomplishes the act of production only in completing the product as product by dissolving it by consuming its independently material form by raising the inclination developed in the first act of production through the need for repetition to its finished form it is thus not only the concluding act in which the product becomes product but also that in which the producer becomes producer on the other side production produces consumption by creating the specific manner of consumption and further by creating the stimulus of consumption the ability to consume as a need this last identity as determined under 3 is frequently cited in economics in the relation of demand and supply of objects and needs of socially created and natural needs

        thereupon nothing simpler for a hegelian than to posit production and consumption as identical and this has been done not only by socialist belletrists but by prosaic economists themselves eg say4 in the form that when one looks at an entire people its production is its consumption or indeed at humanity in the abstract storch5 demonstrated says error namely that e g a people does not consume its entire product but also creates means of production etc  fixed capital etc to regard society as one single subject is in addition to look at it wrongly speculatively with a single subject production and consumption appear as moments of a single act the important thing to emphasize here is only that whether production and consumption are viewed as the activity of one or of many individuals they appear in any case as moments of one process in which production is the real point of departure and hence also the predominant moment consumption as urgency as need is itself an intrinsic moment of productive activity but the latter is the point of departure for realization and hence also its predominant moment it is the act through which the whole process again runs its course the individual produces an object and by consuming it returns to himself but returns as a productive and selfreproducing individual consumption thus appears as a moment of production

        in society however the producers relation to the product once the latter is finished is an external one and its return to the subject depends on his relations to other individuals he does not come into possession of it directly nor is its immediate appropriation his purpose when he produces in society distribution steps between the producers and the products hence between production and consumption to determine in accordance with social laws what the producers share will be in the world of products

        now does distribution stand at the side of and outside production as an autonomous sphere

distribution and production

        when one examines the usual works of economics it is immediately striking that everything in them is posited doubly for example ground rent wages interest and profit figure under distribution while land labour and capital figure under production as agents of production in the case of capital now it is evident from the outset that it is posited doubly 1 as agent of production 2 as source of income as a determinant of specific forms of distribution interest and profit thus also figure as such in production in so far as they are forms in which capital increases grows hence moments of its own production interest and profit as forms of distribution presuppose capital as agent of production they are modes of distribution whose presupposition is capital as agent of production they are likewise modes of reproduction of capital

        the category of wages similarly is the same as that which is examined under a different heading as wage labour the characteristic which labour here possesses as an agent of production appears as a characteristic of distribution if labour were not specified as wage labour then the manner in which it shares in the products would not appear as wages as for example under slavery finally to take at once the most developed form of distribution ground rent by means of which landed property shares in the product presupposes largescale landed property  actually largescale agriculture  as agent of production and not merely land as such just as wages do not merely presuppose labour as such the relations and modes of distribution thus appear merely as the obverse of the agents of production an individual who participates in production in the form of wage labour shares in the products in the results of production in the form of wages the structure gliederung of distribution is completely determined by the structure of production distribution is itself a product of production not only in its object in that only the results of production can be distributed but also in its form in that the specific kind of participation in production determines the specific forms of distribution ie the pattern of participation in distribution it is altogether an illusion to posit land in production ground rent in distribution etc

        thus economists such as ricardo who are the most frequently accused of focusing on production alone have defined distribution as the exclusive object of economics because they instinctively conceived the forms of distribution as the most specific expression into which the agents of production of a given society are cast to the single individual of course distribution appears as a social law which determines his position within the system of production within which he produces and which therefore precedes production the individual comes into the world possessing neither capital nor land social distribution assigns him at birth to wage labour but this situation of being assigned is itself a consequence of the existence of capital and landed property as independent agents of production

        as regards whole societies distribution seems to precede production and to determine it in yet another respect almost as if it were a preeconomic fact a conquering people divides the land among the conquerors thus imposes a certain distribution and form of property in land and thus determines production or it enslaves the conquered and so makes slave labour the foundation of production or a people rises in revolution and smashes the great landed estates into small parcels and hence by this new distribution gives production a new character or a system of laws assigns property in land to certain families in perpetuity or distributes labour as a hereditary privilege and thus confines it within certain castes in all these cases and they are all historical it seems that distribution is not structured and determined by production but rather the opposite production by distribution

        in the shallowest conception distribution appears as the distribution of products and hence as further removed from and quasiindependent of production but before distribution can be the distribution of products it is 1 the distribution of the instruments of production and 2 which is a further specification of the same relation the distribution of the members of the society among the different kinds of production subsumption of the individuals under specific relations of production the distribution of products is evidently only a result of this distribution which is comprised within the process o f production itself and determines the structure of production to examine production while disregarding this internal distribution within it is obviously an empty abstraction while conversely the distribution of products follows by itself from this distribution which forms an original moment of production ricardo whose concern was to grasp the specific social structure of modern production and who is the economist of production par excellence declares for precisely that reason that not production but distribution is the proper study of modern economics 6 this again shows the ineptitude of those economists who portray production as an eternal truth while banishing history to the realm of distribution

6 david ricardo on the principles of ed london 1821 preface p v political economy and taxation 3rd

        the question of the relation between this productiondetermining distribution and production belongs evidently within production itself if it is said that since production must begin with a certain distribution of the instruments of production it follows that distribution at least in this sense precedes and forms the presupposition of production then the reply must be that production does indeed have its determinants and preconditions which form its moments at the very beginning these may appear as spontaneous natural but by the process of production itself they are transformed from natural into historic determinants and if they appear to one epoch as natural presuppositions of production they were its historic product for another within production itself they are constantly being changed the application of machinery for example changed the distribution of instruments of production as well as of products modern largescale landed property is itself the product of modern commerce and of modern industry as well as of the application of the latter to agriculture

        the questions raised above all reduce themselves in the last instance to the role played by generalhistorical relations in production and their relation to the movement of history generally the question evidently belongs within the treatment and investigation of production itself

        still in the trivial form in which they are raised above they can be dealt with equally briefly in all cases of conquest three things are possible the conquering people subjugates the conquered under its own mode of production eg the english in ireland in this century and partly in india or it leaves the old mode intact and contents itself with a tribute eg turks and romans or a reciprocal interaction takes place whereby something new a synthesis arises the germanic conquests in part in all cases the mode of production whether that of the conquering people that of the conquered or that emerging from the fusion of both is decisive for the new distribution which arises although the latter appears as a presupposition of the new period of production it is thus itself in turn a product of production not only of historical production generally but of the specific historic mode of production

        the mongols with their devastations in russia eg were acting in accordance with their production cattleraising for which vast uninhabited spaces are a chief precondition the germanic barbarians who lived in isolation on the land and for whom agriculture with bondsmen was the traditional production could impose these conditions on the roman provinces all the more easily as the concentration of landed property which had taken place there had already entirely overthrown t h e earlier agricultural relations

        it is a received opinion that in certain periods people lived from pillage alone but for pillage to be possible there must be something to be pillaged hence production and the mode of pillage is itself in turn determined by the mode of production a stockjobbing nation for example cannot be pillaged in the same manner as a nation of cowherds

        to steal a slave is to steal the instrument of production directly but then the production of the country for which the slave is stolen must be structured to allow of slave labour or  as in south america etc a mode of production corresponding to the slave must be created

        laws may perpetuate an instrument of production eg land in certain families these iaws achieve economic significance only when largescale landed property is in harmony with the societys production as eg in england in france smallscale agriculture survived despite the great landed estates hence the latter were smashed by the revolution but can laws perpetuate the smallscale allotment despite these laws ownership is again becoming concentrated the influence of laws in stabilizing relations of distribution and hence their effect on production requires to be determined in each specific instance

exchange finally and circulation
exchange and production

        circulation itself is merely a specific moment of exchange or it is also exchange regarded in its totality

        in so far as exchange is merely a moment mediating between production with its productiondetermined distribution on one side and consumption on the other but in so far as the latter itself appears as a moment of production to that extent is exchange obviously also included as a moment within the latter

        it is clear firstly that the exchange of activities and abilities which takes place within production itself belongs directly to production and essentially constitutes it the same holds secondly for the exchange of products in so far as that exchange is the means of finishing the product and making it fit for direct consumption to that extent exchange is an act comprised within production itself thirdly the socalled exchange between dealers and dealers is by its very organization entirely determined by production as well as being itself a producing activity exchange appears as independent of and indifferent to production only in the final phase where the product is exchanged directly for consumption but 1 there is no exchange without division of labour whether the latter is spontaneous natural or already a product of historic development 2 private exchange presupposes private production 3 the intensity of exchange as well as its extension and its manner are determined by the development and structure of production for example exchange between town and country exchange in the country in the town etc exchange in all its moments thus appears as either directly comprised in production or determined by it

        the conclusion we reach is not that production distribution exchange and consumption are identical but that they all form the members of a totality distinctions within a unity production predominates not only over itself in the antithetical definition of production but over the other moments as well the process always returns to production to begin anew that exchange and consumption cannot be predominant is selfevident likewise distribution as distribution of products while as distribution of the agents of production it is itself a moment of production a definite production thus determines a definite consumption distribution and exchange as well as definite relations between these different moments admittedly however in its onesided form production is itself determined by the other moments for example if the market ie the sphere of exchange expands then production grows in quantity and the divisions between its different branches become deeper change in distribution changes production eg concentration of capital different distribution of the population between town and country etc finally the needs of consumption determine production mutual interaction takes place between the different moments this the case with every organic whole

3 the method of political economy

        when we consider a given country politicoeconomically we begin with its population its distribution among classes town country the coast the different branches of production export and import annual production and consumption commodity prices etc

        it seems to be correct to begin with the real and the concrete with the real precondition thus to begin in economics with eg the population which is the foundation and the subject of the entire social act of production however on closer examination this proves false the population is an abstraction if i leave out for example the classes of which it is composed these classes in turn are an empty phrase if i am not familiar with the elements on which they rest eg wage labour capital etc these latter in turn presuppose exchange division of labour prices etc for example capital is nothing without wage labour with out value money price etc thus if i were to begin with the population this would be a chaotic conception vorstellung of the whole and i would then by means of further determination move analytically towards ever more simple concepts begriff  from the imagined concrete towards ever thinner abstractions until i had arrived at the simplest determinations from there the journey would have to be retraced until i had finally arrived at the population again but this time not as the chaotic conception of a whole but as a rich totality of many determinations and relations the former is the path historically followed by economics at the time of its origins the economists of the seventeenth century eg always begin with the living whole with population nation state several states etc but they always conclude by discovering through analysis a small number of determinant abstract general relations such as division of labour money value etc as soon as these individual moments had been more or less firmly established and abstracted there began the economic systems which ascended from the simple relations such as labour division of labour need exchange value to the level of the state exchange between nations and the world market the latter is obviously the scientifically correct method the concrete is concrete because it is the concentration of many determinations hence unity of the diverse it appears in the process of thinking therefore as a process of concentration as a result not as a point of departure even though it is the point of departure in reality and hence also the point of departure for observation anschauung and conception along the first path the full conception was evaporated to yield an abstract determination along the second the abstract determinations lead towards a reproduction of the concrete by way of thought in this way hegel fell into the illusion of conceiving the real as the product of thought concentrating itself probing its own depths and unfolding itself out of itself by itself whereas the method of rising from the abstract to the concrete is only the way in which thought appropriates the concrete reproduces it as the concrete in the mind but this is by no means the process by which the concrete itself comes into being for example the simplest economic category say eg exchange value presupposes population moreover a population producing in specific relations as well as a certain kind of family or commune or state etc  it can never exist other than as an abstract onesided relation within an already given concrete living whole as a category by contrast exchange value leads an antediluvian existence therefore to the kind of consciousnessand this is characteristic of the philosophical consciousnessfor which conceptual thinking is the real human being and for which the conceptual world as such is thus the only reality the movement of the categories appears as the real act of production which only unfortunately receives a jolt from the outsidewhose product is the world andbut this is again a tautologythis is correct in so far as the concrete totality is a totality of thoughts concrete in thought in fact a product of thinking and comprehending but not in any way a product of the concept which thinks and generates itself outside or above observation and conception a product rather of the workingup of observation and conception into concepts the totality as it appears in the head as a totality of thoughts is a product of a thinking head which appropriates the world in the only way it can a way different from the artistic religious practical and mental appropriation of this world the real subject retains its autonomous existence outside the head just as before namely as long as the heads conduct is merely speculative merely theoretical hence in the theoretical method too the subject society must always be kept in mind as the presupposition

        but do not these simpler categories also have an independent historical or natural existence predating the more concrete ones that depends hegel for example correctly begins the philosophy of right with possession this being the subjects simplest juridical relation but thereis no possession preceding the family or masterservant relations which are far more concrete relations however it would be correct to say that there are families or clan groups which still merely possess but have no property the simple category therefore appears in relation to property as a relation of simple families or clan groups in the higher society it appears as the simpler relation of a developed organization but the concrete substratum of which possession is a relation is always presupposed one can imagine an individual savage as possessing something but in that case possession is not a juridical relation it is incorrect that possession develops historically into the family possession rather always presupposes this more concrete juridical category there would still always remain this much however namely that the simple categories are the expressions of relations within which the less developed concrete may have already realized itself before having posited the more manysided connection or relation which is mentally expressed in the more concrete category while the more developed concrete preserves the same category as a subordinate relation money may exist and did exist historically before capital existed before banks existed before wage labour existed etc thus in this respect it may be said that the simpler category can express the dominant relations of a less developed whole or else those subordinate relations of a more developed whole which already had a historic existence before this whole developed in the direction expressed by a more concrete category to that extent the path of abstract thought rising from the simple to the combined would correspond to the real historical process

        it may be said on the other hand that there are very developed but nevertheless historically less mature forms of society in which the highest forms of economy eg cooperation a developed division of labour etc are found even though there is no kind of money eg peru among the slav communities also money and the exchange which determines it play little or no role within the individual communities but only on their boundaries in traffic with others it is simply wrong to place exchange at the centre of communal society as the original constituent element it originally appears rather in the connection of the different communities with one another not in the relations between the different members of a single community further although money everywhere plays a role from very early on it is nevertheless a predominant element in antiquity only within the confines of certain onesidedly developed nations trading nations and even in the most advanced parts of the ancient world among the greeks and romans the full development of money which is presupposed in modern bourgeois society appears only in the period of their dissolution this very simple category then makes a historic appearance in its full intensity only in the most developed conditions of society by no means does it wade its way through all economic relations for example in the roman empire at its highest point of development the foundation remained taxes and payments in kind the money system actually completely developed there only in the army and it never took over the whole of labour thus although the simpler category may have existed historically before the more concrete it can achieve its full intensive and extensive development precisely in a combined form of society while the more concrete category was more fully developed in a less developed form of society

        labour seems a quite simple category the conception of labour in this general formas labour as suchis also immeasurably old nevertheless when it is economically conceived in this simplicity labour is as modern a category as are the relations which create this simple abstraction  the monetary system7 for example still locates wealth altogether objectively as an external thing in money compared with this standpoint the commercial or manufacture system took a great step forward by locating the source of wealth not in the object but in a subjective activityin commercial and manufacturing activityeven though it still always conceives this activity within narrow boundaries as moneymaking in contrast to this system that of the physiocrats posits a certain kind of labouragricultureas the creator of wealth and the object itself no longer appears in a monetary disguise but as the product in general as the general result of labour this product as befits the narrowness of the activity still always remains a naturally determined productthe product of agriculture the product of the earth par excellence

7 marx considered that the monetary system as defined here covered economists from the sixteenth century to the physiocrats however within the monetary system there arose what he calls here the commercial or manufacture system but elsewhere the mercantile system known to economics textbooks as mercantilism he distinguishes between the two systems later in this work but his normal practice is to link them together since the mercantile system is merely a variant of the monetary system a contribution to the critique of political economy london 1971  p  158 

        it was an immense step forward for adam smith to throw out every limiting specification of wealthcreating activitynot only manufacturing or commercial or agricultural labour but one as well as the others labour in general with the abstract universality of wealthcreating activity we now have the universality of the object defined as wealth the product as such or again labour as such but labour as past objectified labour how difficult and great was this transition may be seen from how adam smith himself from time to time still falls back into the physiocratic system now it might seem that all that had been achieved thereby was to discover the abstract expression for the simplest and most ancient relation in which human beingsin whatever form of societyplay the role of producers this is correct in one respect not in another indifference towards any specific kind of labour presupposes a very developed totality of real kinds of labour of which no single one is any longer predominant as a rule the most general abstractions a rise only in the midst of the richest possible concrete development where one thing appears as common to many to all then it ceases to be thinkable in a particular form alone on the other side this abstraction of labour as such is not merely the mental product of a concrete totality of labours indifference towards specific labours corresponds to a form of society in which individuals can with ease transfer from one labour to another and where the specific kind is a matter of chance for them hence of indifference  not only the category labour but labour in reality has here become the means of creating wealth in general and has ceased to be organically linked with particular individuals in any specific form such a state of affairs is at its most developed in the most modern form of existence of bourgeois societyin the united states here then for the first time the point of departure of modern economics namely the abstraction of the category labour labour as such labour pure and simple becomes true in practice the simplest abstraction then which modern economics places at the head of its discussions and which expresses an immeasurably ancient relation valid in all forms of society nevertheless achieves practical truth as an abstraction only as a category of the most modern society one could say that this indifference towards particular kinds of labour which is a historic product in the united states appears eg among the russians as a spontaneous inclination but there is a devil of a difference between barbarians who are fit by nature to be used for anything and civilized people who apply themselves to everything and then in practice the russian indifference to the specific character of labour corresponds to being embedded by tradition within a very specific kind of labour from which only external influences can jar them loose

        this example of labour shows strikingly how even the most abstract categories despite their validityprecisely because of their abstractnessfor all epochs are nevertheless in the specific character of this abstraction themselves likewise a product of historic relations and possess their full validity only for and within these relations

        bourgeois society is the most developed and the most complex historic organization of production the categories which express its relations the comprehension of its structure thereby also allows insights into the structure and the relations of production of all the vanished social formations out of whose ruins and elements it built itself up whose partly still unconquered remnants are carried along within it whose mere nuances have developed explicit significance within it etc  human anatomy contains a key to the anatomy of the ape the intimations of higher development among the subordinate animal species however can be understood only after the higher development is already known the bourgeois economy thus supplies the key to the ancient etc but not at all in the manner of those economists who smudge over all historical differences and see bourgeois relations in all forms of society one can understand tribute tithe etc if one is acquainted with ground rent but one must not identify them further since bourgeois society is itself only a contradictory form of development relations derived from earlier forms will often be found within it only in an entirely stunted form or even travestied for example communal property although it is true therefore that the categories of bourgeois economics possess a truth for all other forms of society this is to be taken only with a grain of salt they can contain them in a developed or stunted or caricatured form etc but always with an essential difference the socalled historical presentation of development is founded as a rule on the fact that the latest form regards the previous ones as steps leading up to itself and since it is only rarely and only under quite specific conditions able to criticize itselfleaving aside of course the historical periods which appear to themselves as times of decadenceit always conceives them onesidedly the christian religion was able to be of assistance in reaching an objective understanding of earlier mythologies only when its own selfcriticism had been accomplished to a certain degree so to speak insert text8 likewise bourgeois economics arrived at an understanding of feudal ancient oriental economics only after the selfcriticism of bourgeois society had begun in so far as the bourgeois economy did not mythologically identify itself altogether with the past its critique of the previous economics notably of feudalism with which it was still engaged in direct struggle resembled the critique which christianity levelled against paganism or also that of protestantism against catholicism

        in the succession of the economic categories as in any other historical social science it must not be forgotten that their subjecthere modern bourgeois societyis always what is given in the head as well as in reality and that these categories therefore express the forms of being the characteristics of existence and often only individual sides of this specific society this subject and that therefore this society by no means begins only at the point where one can speak of it as such this hold for science as well this is to be kept in mind because it will shortly be decisive for the order and sequence of the categories for example nothing seems more natural than to begin with ground rent with landed property since this is bound up with the earth the source of all production and of all being and with the first form of production of all more or less settled societiesagriculture but nothing would be more erroneous in all forms of society there is one specific kind of production which predominates over the rest whose relations thus assign rank and influence to the others it is a general illumination which bathes all the other colours and modifies their particularity it is a particular ether which determines the specific gravity of every being which has materialized within it for example with pastoral peoples mere hunting and fishing peoples lie outside the point where real development begins certain forms of tillage occur among them sporadic ones landed property is determined by this it is held in common and retains this form to a greater or lesser degree according to the greater or lesser degree of attachment displayed by these peoples to their tradition eg the communal property of the slavs among peoples with a settled agriculturethis settling already a great stepwhere this predominates as in antiquity and in the feudal order even industry together with its organization and the forms of property corresponding to it has a more or less landedproprietary character is either completely dependent on it as among the earlier romans or as in the middle ages imitates within the city and its relations the organization of the land in the middle ages capital itselfapart from pure moneycapitalin the form of the traditional artisans tools etc has this landedproprietary character in bourgeois society it is the opposite agriculture more and more becomes merely a branch of industry and is entirely dominated by capital ground rent likewise in all forms where landed property rules the natural relation still predominant in those where capital rules the social historically created element ground rent cannot be understood without capital but capital can certainly be understood without ground rent capital is the alldominating economic power of bourgeois society it must form the starting point as well as the finishingpoint and must be dealt with before landed property after both have been examined in particular their interrelation must be examined

        it would therefore be unfeasible and wrong to let the economic categories follow one another in the same sequence as that in which they were historically decisive their sequence is determined rather by their relation to one another in modern bourgeois society which is precisely the opposite of that which seems to be their natural order or which corresponds to historical development the point is not the historic position of the economic relations in the succession of different forms of society even less is it their sequence in the idea proudhon9 a muddy notion of historic movement rather their order within modern bourgeois society

        the purity abstract specificity in which the trading peoples phoenicians carthaginiansappear in the old world is determined precisely by the predominance of the agricultural peoples capital as trading capital or as money capital appears in this abstraction precisely where capital is not yet the predominant element of societies lombards jews take up the same position towards the agricultural societies of the middle ages

        as a further example of the divergent positions which the same category can occupy in different social stages one of the latest forms of bourgeois society jointstock companies these also appear however at its beginning in the great privileged monopoly trading companies

        the concept of national wealth creeps into the work of the economists of the seventeenth centurycontinuing partly with those of the eighteenthin the form of the notion that wealth is created only to enrich the state and that its power is proportionate to this wealth this was the still unconsciously hypocritical form in which wealth and the production of wealth proclaimed themselves as the purpose of modern states and regarded these states henceforth only as means for the production of wealth

        the order obviously has to be 1 the general abstract determinants which obtain in more or less all forms of society but in the aboveexplained sense 2 the categories which make up the inner structure of bourgeois society and on which the fundamental classes rest capital wage labour landed property their interrelation town and country the three great social classes exchange between them circulation credit system private 3 concentration of bourgeois society in the form of the state viewed in relation to itself the unprod uctive classes taxes state debt public credit the population the colonies emigration 4 the international relation of production international division of labour international exchange export and import rate of exchange 5 the world market and crises

4 production means of production and relations of production relations of production and relations of circulation forms of the state and forms of consciousness in relation to relations of production and circulation legal relations family relations

        notabene in regard to points to be mentioned here and not to be forgotten

        1 war developed earlier than peace the way in which certain economic relations such as wage labour machinery etc develop earlier owing to war and in the armies etc than in the interior of bourgeois society the relation of productive force and relations of exchange also especially vivid in the army

        2 relation of previous ideal historiography to the real namely of the socalled cultural histories which are only histories of religions and of state on that occasion something can also be said about the various kinds of previous historiography the socalled objective subjective moral among others the philosophical

        3 secondary and tertiary matters in general derivative inherited not original relations of production influence here of international relations

        4 accusations about the materialism of this conception relation to naturalistic materialism

        5 dialectic of the concepts productive force means of production and relation of production a dialectic whose boundaries are to be determined and which does not suspend the real difference

        6 the uneven development of material production relative to eg artistic development in general the concept of progress not to be conceived in the usual abstractness modern art etc this disproportion not as important or so difficult to grasp as within practicalsocial relations themselves eg the relation of education relation of the united states to europe but the really difficult point to discuss here is how relations of production develop unevenly as legal relations thus eg the relation of roman private law this less the case with criminal and public law to modern production

        7 this conception appears as necessary development but legitimation of chance how of freedom also among other things influence of means of communication world history has not always existed history as world history a result

        8 the point of departure obviously from the natural characteristic subjectively and objectively tribes races etc

        1 in the case of the arts it is well known that certain periods of their flowering are out of all proportion to the general development of society hence also to the material foundation the skeletal structure as it were of its organization for example the greeks compared to the moderns or also shakespeare it is even recognized that certain forms of art eg the epic can no longer be produced in their world epochmaking classical stature as soon as the production of art as such begins that is that certain significant forms within the realm of the arts are possible only at an undeveloped stage of artistic development if this is the case with the relation between different kinds of art within the realm of the arts it is already less puzzling that it is the case in the relation of the entire realm to the general development of society the difficulty consists only in the general formulation of these contradictions as soon as they have been specified they are already clarified

        let us take eg the relation of greek art and then of shakespeare to the present time it is well known that greek mythology is not only the arsenal of greek art but also its foundation is the view of nature and of social relations on which the greek imagination and hence greek mythology is based possible with selfacting mule spindles and railways and locomotives and electrical telegraphs what chance has vulcan against roberts  co jupiter against the lightningrod and hermes against the credit mobilier all mythology overcomes and dominates and shapes the forces of nature in the imagination and by the imagination it therefore vanishes with the advent of real mastery over them what becomes of fama alongside printing house square greek art presupposes greek mythology ie nature and the social forms already reworked in an unconsciously artistic way by the popular imagination this is its material not any mythology whatever ie not an arbitrarily chosen unconsciously artistic reworking of nature here meaning everything objective hence including society egyptian mythology could never have been the foundation or the womb of greek art but in any case a mythology hence in no way a social development which excludes all mythological all mythologizing relations to nature which therefore demands of the artist an imagination not dependent on mythology

        from a nother side is achilles possible with powder and lead or the iliad with the printing press not to mention the printing machine do not the song and the saga and the muse necessarily come to an end with the printers bar hence do not the necessary conditions of epic poetry vanish

        but the difficulty lies not in understanding that the greek arts and epic are bound up with certain forms of social development the difficulty is that they still afford us artistic pleasure and that in a certain respect they count as a norm and as an unattainable model

        a man cannot become a child again or he becomes childish but does he not find joy in the childs naivete and must he himself not strive to reproduce its truth at a higher stage does not the true character of each epoch come alive in the nature of its children why should not the historic child hood of humanity its most beautiful unfolding as a stage never to return exercise an eternal charm there are unruly children and precocious children many of the old peoples belong in this category the greeks were normal children the charm of their art for us is not in contradiction to the undeveloped stage of society on which it grew it is its result rather and is inextricably bound up rather with the fact that the unripe social conditions under which it arose and could alone arise can never return

b society and the individual
product and capital value and capital proudhon

        nothing is more erroneous than the manner in which economists as well as socialists regard society in relation to economic conditions proudhon for example replies to bastiat by saying xvi 29 for society the difference between capital and product does not exist this difference is entirely subjective and related to individuals1 thus he calls subjective precisely what is social and he calls society a subjective abstraction the difference between product and capital is exactly this that the product expresses as capital a particular relation belonging to a historic form of society this socalled contemplation from the standpoint of society means nothing more than the overlooking of the differences which express the social relation relation of bourgeois society  society does not consist of individuals but expresses the sum of interrelations the relations within which these individuals stand as if someone were to say seen from the perspective of society there are no slaves and no citizens both are human beings rather they are that outside society to be a slave to be a citizen are social characteristics relations between human beings a and b human being a as such is not a slave he is a slave in and through society what mr proudhon here says about capital and product means for him that from the viewpoint of society there is no difference between capitalists and workers a difference which exists precisely only from the standpoint of society

c the dynamics of capitalism
surplus value surplus labour timebastiat on wages value of labour how determined –selfrealization is self•preservation of capital capitalist may not live merely from his labour etc conditions for the selfrealization of capital surplus labour time etc –to the extent that capital is productive as creator of surplus labour etc this only historictransistory –the free blacks in jamaica –wealth which has gained autonomy requires slave labour or wage labour forced labour in both cases

  

        what the worker exchanges with capital is his labour itself the capacity o f disposing over it he divests himself of it entaussert sie what he obtains as price is the value of this divestiture entaussenmg he exchanges valuepositing activity for a predetermined value regardless of the result of his activity now how is its value determined by the objectified labour contained in his commodity this commodity exists in his vitality in order to maintain this from one day to the nextwe are not yet dealing with the working class ie the replacement for wear and tear so that it can maintain itself as a class since the worker here confronts capital as a worker ie as a presupposed perennial subject subjekt and not yet as a mortal individual of the working specieshe has to consume a certain quantity of food to replace his usedup blood etc he receives no more than an equivalent thus tomorrow after the completed exchangeand only after he has formally completed the exchange does he execute it in the process of productionhis labouring capacity exists in the same mode as before he has received an exact equivalent because the price which he has obtained leaves him in possession of the same exchange value he had before capital has paid him the amount of objectified labour contained in his vital forces capital has consumed it and because it did not exist as a thing but as the capacity of a living being the worker can owing to the specific nature of his commoditythe specific nature of the life processresume the exchange anew since we are dealing here not with any particularly qualified labour but with labour in general simple labour we are here not yet concerned with the fact that there is more labour objectified in his immediate existence than is contained in his mere vitalityie the labour time necessary to pay for the products necessary to maintain his vitalitynamely the values he has consumed in order to produce a specific labouring capacity a special skilland the value of these shows itself in the costs necessary to produce a similar labouring skill

        if one days work were necessary in order to keep one worker alive for one day then capital would not exist because the working day would then exchange for its own product so that capital could not realize itself and hence could not maintain itself as capital the selfpreservation of capital is its selfrealization if capital also had to work in order to live then it would not maintain itself as capital but as labour property in raw materials and instruments of labour would be merely nominal economically they would belong to the worker as much as to the capitalist since they would create value for the capitalist only in so far as he himself were a worker he would relate to them therefore not as capital but as simple material and means of labour like the worker himself does in the production process if however only half a working day is necessary in order to keep one worker alive one whole day then the surplus value of the product is selfevident because the capitalist h as paid the price of only half a working day but has obtained a whole day objectified in the product thus has exchanged nothing for the second half of the work day the only thing which can make him into a capitalist is not exchange but rather a process through which he obtains objectified labour time ie value without exchange half the working day costs capital nothing it thus obtains a value for which it has given no equivalent and the multiplication of values can take place only if a value in excess of the equivalent has been obtained hence created

        surplus value in general is value in excess of the equivalent the equivalent by definition is only the identity of value with itself hence surplus value can never sprout out of the equivalent nor can it do so originally out of circulation it has to arise from the production process of capital itself the matter can also be expressed in this way if the worker needs only half a working day in order to live a whole day then in order to keep alive as a worker he needs to work only half a day the second half of the labour day is forced labour surpluslabour what appears as surplus value on capitals side appears identically on the workers side as surplus labour in excess of his requirements as worker hence i n excess of his immediate requirements for keeping himself alive the great historic quality of capital is to create this surplus labour superfluous labour from the standpoint of mere use value mere subsistence and its historic destiny bestimmung is fulfilled as soon as on one side there has been such a development of needs that surplus labour above and beyond necessity has itself become a general need arising out of individual needs themselvesand on the other side when the severe discipline of capital acting on succeeding generations geschlechter has developed general industriousness as the general property of the new species geschlechtand finally when the development of the productive powers of labour which capital incessantly whips onward with its unlimited mania for wealth and of the sole conditions in which this mania can be realized have flourished to the stage where the possession and preservation of general wealth require a lesser labour time of society as a whole and where the labouring society relates scientifically to the process of its progressive reproduction its reproduction in a constantly greater abundance hence where labour in which a human being does what a thing could do has ceased accordingly capital and labour relate to each other here like money and commodity the former is the general form of wealth the other only the substance destined for immediate consumption capitals ceaseless striving towards the general form of wealth drives labour beyond the limits of its natural paltriness naturbediirftigkeit and thus creates the material elements for the development of the rich individuality which is as aiisided in its production as in its consumption and whose labour also therefore appears no longer as labour but as the full development of activity itself in which natural necessity in its direct form has disappeared because a historically created need has taken the place of the natural one this is why capital is productive ie an essential relation for the development of the social productive forces it ceases to exist as such only where the development of these productive forces themselves encounters its barrier in capital itself

        the times of november 1857 contains an utterly delightful cry of outrage on the part of a westindian plantation owner this advocate analyses with great moral indignationas a plea for the reintroduction of negro slaveryhow the quashees the free blacks of jamaica content themselves with producing only what is strictly necessary for their own consumption and alongside this use value regard loafing indulgence and idleness as the real luxury good how they do not care a damn for the sugar and the fixed capital in vested in the plantations but rather observe the planters impending bankruptcy with an ironic grin of malicious pleasure and even exploit their acquired christianity as an embellishment for this mood of malicious glee and indolence2 they have ceased to be slaves but not in order to become wage labourers but instead selfsustaining peasants working for their own consumption as far as they are concerned capital does not exist as capital because autonomous wealth as such can exist only either on the basis of direct forced labour slavery or indirect forced labour wage labour wealth confronts direct forced labour not as capital but rather as relation of domination herrschaftsverhältnis thus the relation of domination is the only thing which is reproduced on this basis for which wealth itself has value only as gratification not as wealth itself and which can therefore never create general industriousness we shall return to this relation of slavery and wage labour

d the development of exchange and of capital
original accumulation of capital the real accumulation once developed historically capital itself creates the conditions of its existence not as conditions for its arising but as results of its being performance of personal services as opposed to wage labour inversion of the law of appropriation real alien relation fremdheit of the worker to his product division of labour machinery etc

        once production founded on capital is presupposedmoney has become transformed into capital actually only at the end of the first production process which resulted in its reproduction and in the new production of surplus capital i surplus capital i however is itself posited realized as surplus capital only when it has produced surplus capital ii ie as soon as those presuppositions o f money while it is in the process of passing over into capital which still lie outside the movement of real capital have vanished and when capital has therefore itself posited and posited in accordance with its immanent essence the conditions which form its point of departure in production then the condition that the capitalist in order to posit himself as capital must bring values into circulation which he created with his own labour or by some other means excepting only already available previous wage labour belongs among the antediluvian conditions of capital belongs to its historic presuppositions which precisely as such historic presuppositions are past and gone and hence belong to the history of its formation but in no way to its contemporary history ie not to the real system of the mode of production ruled by it while eg the flight of serfs to the cities is one of the historic conditions and presuppositions of urbanism it is not a condition not a moment of the reality of developed cities but belongs rather to their past presuppositions to the presuppositions of their becoming which are suspended in their being the conditions and presuppositions of the becoming of the arising of capital presuppose precisely that it is not yet in being but merely in becoming they therefore disappear as real capital arises capital which itself on the basis of its own reality posits the conditions for its realization thus eg while the process in which money or value foritself originally becomes capital presupposes on the part of the capitalist an accumulationperhaps by means of savings garnered from products and values created by his own labour etc which he has undertaken as a notcapitalist ie while the presuppositions under which money becomes capital appear as given external presuppositions for the arising of capitalnevertheless as soon as capital has become capital as such  it creates its own presuppositions ie the possession of the real conditions of the creation of new values without exchangeby means of its own production process these presuppositions which originally appeared as conditions of its becomingand hence could not spring from its action as capitalnow appear as results of its own realization reality as posited by itnot as conditions of its arising but as results of its presence it no longer proceeds from presuppositions in order to become but rather it is itself presupposed and proceeds from itself to create the conditions of its maintenance and growth therefore the conditions which preceded the creation of surplus capital i or which express the becoming of capital do not fall into the sphere of that mode of production for which capital serves as the presupposition as the historic preludes of its becoming they lie behind it just as the processes by means of which the earth made the transition from a liquid sea of fire and vapour to its present form now lie beyond its life as finished earth that is individual capitals can continue to arise eg by means of hoarding but the hoard is transformed into capital only by means of the exploitation of labour the bourgeois economists who regard capital as an eternal and natural not historical form of production then attempt at the same time to legitimize it again by formulating the conditions of its becoming as the conditions of its contemporary realization ie presenting the moments in which the capitalist still appropriates as notcapitalistbecause he is still becomingas the very conditions in which he appropriates as capitalist these attempts at apologetics demonstrate a guilty conscience as well as the inability to bring the mode of appropriation of capital as capital into harmony with the general laws of property proclaimed by capitalist society itself on the other side much more important for us is that our method indicates the points where historical investigation must enter in or where bourgeois economy as a merely historical form of the production process points beyond itself to earlier historical modes of production in order to develop the laws of bourgeois economy therefore it is not necessary to write the real history of the relations of production but the correct observation and deduction of these laws as having themselves become3 in history always leads to primary equationslike the empirical numbers eg in natural science which point towards a past lying behind this system these indications andeutung together with a correct grasp of the present then also offer the key to the understanding of the pasta work in its own right which it is to be hoped we shall be able to undertake as well4 this correct view likewise leads to the same time to the points at which the suspension of the present form of production relations gives signs of its becomingforeshadowings of the future just as on one side the prebourgeois phases appear as merely historical ie suspended presuppositions so do the contemporary conditions of production likewise appear as engaged in suspending themselves and hence in positing the historic presuppositions for a new state of society

3 having themselves become  having themselves undergone the process of becoming as indicated above

        now if we initially examine the relation such as it has become value having become capital and living labour confronting it as mere use value so that living labour appears as a mere means to realize objectified dead labour to penetrate it with an animating soul while losing its own soul to itand having produced as the endproduct alien wealth on one side and  on the other the penury which is living labour capacitys sole possessionthen the matter is simply this that the process itself in and by itself posits the real objective conditions of living labour namely material in which to realize itself instrument with which to realize itself and necessaries with which to stoke the flame of living labour capacity to protect it from being extinguished to supply its vital processes with the necessary fuels and posits them as alien independent existencesor as the mode of existence of an alien person as selfsufficient values forthemselves and hence as values which form wealth alien to an isolated and subjective labour capacity wealth of and for the capitalist the objective conditions of living labour appear as separated independent verselbständigte values opposite living labour capacity as subjective being which therefore appears to them only as a value of another kind not as value but different from them as use value once this separation is given the production process can only produce it anew reproduce it and reproduce it on an expanded scale how it does this we have seen the objective conditions of living labour capacity are presupposed as having an existence independent of it as the objectivity of a subject distinct from living labour capacity and standing independently over against it the reproduction and realization verwertung ie the expansion of these objective conditions is therefore at the same time their own reproduction and new production as the wealth of an alien subject indifferently and independently standing over against labour capacity what is reproduced and produced anew neuproduziert is not only the presence of these objective conditions of living labour but also their presence as independent values ie values belonging to an alien subject confronting this living labour capacity the objective conditions of labour attain a subjective existence visàvis living labour capacitycapital turns into capitalist on the other side the merely subjective presence of the labour capacity confronted by its own conditions gives it a merely indifferent objective form as against themit is merely a value of a particular use value alongside the conditions of its own realization verwertung as valuesi of another use value instead of their being realized realisiert in the production process as the conditions of its realization verwirklichung what happens is quite the opposite it comes out of the process as mere condition for their realization verwertung and preservation as values for themselves opposite living labour capacity the material on which it works is alien material the instrument is likewise an alien instrument its labour appears as a mere accessory to their substance and hence objectifies itself in things not belonging to it indeed living labour itself appears as alien visàvis living labour capacity whose labour it is whose own lifes expression lebensäusserung it is for it has been surrendered to capital in exchange for objectified labour for the product of labour itself labour capacity relates to its labour as to an alien and if capital were willing to pay it without making it labour it would enter the bargain with pleasure thus labour capacitys own labour is as alien to itand it really is as regards its direction etcas are material and instrument which is why the product then appears to it as a combination of alien material alien instrument and alien labouras alien property and why after production it has become poorer by the life forces expended but otherwise begins the drudgery anew existing as a mere subjective labour capacity separated from the conditions of its life the recognition erkennung of the products as its own and the judgement that its separation from the conditions of its realization is improperforcibly imposedis an enormous advance in awareness bewusstsein itself the product of the mode of production resting on capital and as much the knell to its doom as with the slaves awareness that he cannot be the property of another with his consciousness of himself as a person the existence of slavery becomes a merely artificial vegetative existence and ceases to be able to prevail as the basis of production

        however if we consider the original relation before the entry of money into the selfrealization process then various conditions appear which have to have arisen or been given historically for money to become capital and labour to become capitalpositing capitalcreating labour wage labour wage labour here in the strict economic sense in which we use it here and no otherand we will later have to distinguish it from other forms of labour for daywages etcis capitalpositing capitalproducing labour ie living labour which produces both the objective conditions of its realization as an activity as well as the objective moments of its being as labour capacity and produces them as alien powers opposite itself as values forthemselves independent of it the essential conditions are themselves posited in the relation as it appears originally 1 on the one side the presence of living labour capacity as a merely subjective existence separated from the conditions of living labour as well as from the means of existence the necessary goods the means of selfpreservation of living labour capacity the living possibility of labour on the one side in this complete abstraction 2 the value or objectified labour found on the other side must be an accumulation of use values sufficiently large to furnish the objective conditions not only for the production of the products or values required to reproduce or maintain living labour capacity but also for the absorption of surplus labourto supply the objective material for the latter 3 a free exchange relationmoney circulationbetween both sides between the extremes a relation founded on exchange valuesnot on the masterservant relationie hence production which does not directly furnish the producer with his necessaries but which is mediated through exchange and which cannot therefore usurp alien labour directly but must buy it exchange it from the worker himself finally 4 one sidethe side representing the objective conditions of labour in the form of independent values forthemselvesmust present itself as value and must regard the positing of value selfrealization moneymaking as the ultimate purposenot direct consumption of the creation of use value

        so long as both sides exchange their laboour with one another in the form of objectified labour the relation is impossible it is likewise impossible if living labour capacity itself appears as the property of the other side hence as not engaged in exchange the fact that slavery is possible at individual points within the bourgeois system of production does not contradict this however slavery is then possible there only because it does not exist at other points and appears as an anomaly opposite the bourgeois system itself

        the conditions under which the relation appears at the origin or which appear as the historic presuppositions of its becoming reveal at first glance a twosided characteron one side dissolution of lower forms of living labour on the other dissolution of happier forms of the same

        the first presupposition to begin with is that the relation of slavery or serfdom has been suspended living labour capacity belongs to itself and has disposition over the expenditure of its forces through exchange both sides confront each other as persons formally their relation has the equality and freedom of exchange as such as far as concerns the legal relation the fact that this form is a mere semblance and a deceptive semblance appears as an external matter what the free worker sells is always nothing more than a specific particular measure of forceexpenditure kraftäusserung labour capacity as a totality is greater than every particular expenditure he sells the particular expenditure of force to a particular capitalist whom he confronts as an independent individual it is clear that this is not his relation to the existence of capital as capital ie to the capitalist class nevertheless in this way everything touching on the individual real person leaves him a wide field of choice of arbitrary will and hence of formal freedom in the slave relation he belongs to the individual particular owner and is his labouring machine as a totality of forceexpenditure as labour capacity he is a thing sache belonging to another and hence does not relate as subject to his particular expenditure of force nor to the act of living labour in the serf relation he appears as a moment of property in land itself is an appendage of the soil exactly like draughtcattle in the slave relation the worker is nothing but a living labourmachine which therefore has a value for others or rather is a value the totality of the free workers labour capacity appears to him as his property as one of his moments over which he as subject exercises domination and which he maintains by expending it this is to be developed later under wage labour

        the exchange of objectified labour for living labour does not yet constitute either capital on one side or wage labour on the other the entire class of socalled services from the bootblack up to the king falls into this category likewise the free daylabourer whom we encounter sporadically in all places where either the oriental community gemeinwesen or the western commune gemeinde consisting of free landowners dissolves into individual elementsas a consequence of increase of population release of prisoners of war accidents by which the individual is impoverished and loses the objective conditions of his selfsustaining labour owing to division of labour etc if a exchanges a value or money ie objectified labour in order to obtain a service from b ie living labour then this can belong

        1 within the relation of simple circulation both in fact exchange only use values with one another one exchanges necessaries the other labour a service which the other wants to consume either directlypersonal serviceor he furnishes him the material etc from which with his labour with the objectification of his labour he makes a use value a use value designed for as consumption for example when the peasant takes a wandering tailor of the kind that existed in times past into his house and gives him the material to make clothes with  or if i give money to a doctor to patch up my health  what is important in these cases is the service which both do for one another do ut facias here appears on quite the same level as facto ut des or do ut des5 the man who takes the cloth i supplied to him and makes me an article of clothing out of it gives me a use value but instead of giving it directly in objective form he gives it in the form of activity i give him a completed use value he completes another for me the difference between previous objectified labour and living present labour here appears as a merely formal difference between the different tenses of labour at one time in the perfect and at another in the present it appears in fact as a merely formal difference a difference mediated by division of labour and by exchange whether b himself produces the necessaries on which he has to subsist or whether he obtains them from
a and instead of producing the necessaries himself produces an article of clothing in exchange for which he obtains them from a in both cases he can take possession of the use value possessed by a only by giving him an equivalent for it which in the last analysis always resolves itself into his own living labour regardless of the objective form it may adopt whether before the exchange is concluded or as a consequence of it now the article of clothing not only contains a specific formgiving laboura specific form of usefulness imparted to the cloth by the movement of labourbut it contains also a certain quantity of labourhence not only use value but value generally value as such but this value does not exist for a since he consumes the article and is not a clothesdealer he has therefore bought the labour not as valuepositing labour but as an activity which creates utility use value in the case of personal services this use value is consumed as such without making the transition from the form of movement bewegung into the form of the object sache if as is frequently the case in simple relations the performer of the service does not obtain money but direct use values themselves then it no longer even seems as if value were being dealt in on one or the other side merely use values but even given that a pays money for the service this is not a transformation of his money into capital but rather the positing of his money as mere medium of circulation in order to obtain an object for consumption a specific use value this act is for that reason not an act which produces wealth but the opposite one which consumes wealth  the point for a is not the objectification in the cloth of labour as such of a certain amount of labour time hence value but rather the satisfaction of a certain need here a
sees his money not realized but devalued in its transposition from the form of value into that of use value labour is here exchanged not as use value for value but as itself a particular use value as value for use the more frequently a repeats the exchange the poorer does he become this exchange is not an act of wealthgetting for him not an act of value creation but of devaluation of the values he has in hand in his possession the money which a here exchanges for living labourservice in kind or service objectified in a thingis not capital but revenue money as a medium of circulation in order to obtain use value money in which the form of value is posited as merely vanishing not money which will preserve and realize itself as such through the acquisition of labour exchange of money as revenue as a mere medium of circulation for living labour can never posit money as capital nor therefore labour as wage labour in the economic sense a lengthy disquisition is not required to show that to consume spend money is not the same as to produce money in situations in which the greatest part of surplus labour appears as agricultural labour and where the owner of the land therefore appears as owner both of surplus labour and of the surplus product it is the revenue of the owner of the land which forms the labour fund for the free worker for the worker in manufactures here hand crafts as opposed to the agricultural labourers the exchange with them6 is a form of the consumption of the owner of the landhe divides another part of his revenue directlyfor personal services often only the illusion of services with a heap of retainers in asiatic societies where the monarch appears as the exclusive proprietor of the agricultural surplus product whole cities arise which are at bottom nothing more than wandering encampments from the exchange of his revenue with the
free hands as steuart calls them7 there is nothing of wage labour in this relation but it can stand in opposition to slavery and serfdom though need not do so for it always repeats itself under various forms of the overall organization of labour to the extent that money mediates this exchange the determination of prices will become important on both sides but it will do so for a only in so far as he does not want to pay too much for the use value of the labour not in so far as he is concerned with its value the essence of the relation remains unchanged even if this price which begins as conventional and  traditional is thereafter increasingly determined economically first by the relation of demand and supply finally by the production costs at which the vendors themselves of these living services can be produced nothing is essentially changed thereby because the determination of prices remains a merely formal moment for the exchange of mere use values as before this determination itself however is created by other relations by the general laws and the selfdetermination of the ruling mode of production acting as it were behind the back of this particular act of exchange one of the forms in which this kind of pay besoldung first appears in the old communities is where an army is maintained the pay sold of the common soldier is also reduced to a minimumdetermined purely by the production costs necessary to procure him but he exchanges the performance of his services not for capital but for the revenue of the state

        in the bourgeois society itself all exchange of personal services for revenueincluding labour for personal consumption cooking sewing etc garden work etc up to and including all of the unproductive classes civil servants physicians lawyers scholars etcbelongs under this rubric within this category all menial servants etc by means of their servicesoften coercedall these workers from the least to the highest obtain for themselves a share of the surplus product of the capitalists revenue but it does not occur to anyone to think that by means of the exchange of his revenue for such services ie through private consumption the capitalist posits himself as capitalist rather he thereby spends the fruits of his capital it does not change the nature of the relation that the proportions in which revenue is exchanged for this kind of living labour are themselves determined by the general laws of production

        as we have already mentioned in the section on money8 it is here rather the performer of the service who actually posits value who transposes a use valuea certain kind of labour service etc into value money hence in the middle ages those who are oriented towards the production and accumulation of money proceed partly not from the side of the consuming landed nobility but quite the opposite from the side of living labour they accumulate and thus become capitalists insert text for a later period the emancipated serf becomes in part the capitalist

8 marx did not in fact mention this in the chapter on money

        it thus does not depend on the general relation but rather on the natural particular quality of the service performed whether the recipient of payment receives it as daywages or as an honorarium or as a sinecureand whether he appears as superior or inferior in rank to the person paying for the service however with the presupposition of capital as the dominant power all these relations become more or less dishonoured but this does not belong here yetthis demystification entgotterung of personal services regardless of the lofty character with which tradition may have poetically endowed them

        it is not then simply the exchange of objectified labour for living labourwhich appear from this standpoint as two different aspects as use values in different forms the one objective the other subjectivewhich constitutes capital and hence wage labour but rather the exchange of objectified labour as value as selfsufficient value for living labour as its use value as use value not for a specific particular use or consumption but as use value for value

        in the exchange of money for labour or service with the aim of direct consumption a real exchange always takes place the fact that amounts of labour are exchanged on both sides is of merely formal interest for measuring the particular forms of the utility of labour by comparing them with each other this concerns only the form of the exchange but does not form its content in the exchange of capital for labour value is not a measure for the exchange of two use values but is rather the content of the exchange itself

        2 in periods of the dissolution of prebourgeois relations there sporadically occur free workers whose services are bought for purposes not of consumption but of production but firstly even if on a large scale for the production only of direct use values not of values and secondly if a nobleman eg brings the free worker together with his serfs even if he resells a part of the workers product and the free worker thus creates value for him then this exchange takes place only for the superfluous product and only for the sake of superfluity for luxury consumption is thus at bottom only a veiled purchase of alien labour for immediate consumption or as use value incidentally wherever these free workers increase in number and where this relation grows there the old mode of productioncommune patriarchal feudal etcis in the process of dissolution and the elements of real wage labour are in preparation but these free servants knechte can also emerge as eg in poland etc and vanish again without a change in the mode of production taking place

        in order to express the relations into which capital and wage labour enter as property relations or laws we need do no more than express the conduct of both sides in the realization process as an appropriation process for example the fact that surplus labour is posited as surplus value of capital means that the worker does not appropriate the product of his own labour that it appears to him as alien property inversely that alien labour appears as the property of capital this second law of bourgeois property the inversion of the firstwhich through laws of inheritance etc attains an existence independent of the accidental transitoriness of individual capitalistsbecomes just as established in law as the first the first is the identity of labour with property the second labour as negated property or property as negation of the alien quality of alien labour in fact in the production process of capital as will be seen more closely in its further development labour is a totalitya combination of labourswhose individual component parts are alien to one another so that the overall process as a totality is not the work of the individual worker and is furthermore the work of the different workers together only to the extent that they are forcibly combined and do not voluntarily enter into combination with one another the combination of this labour appears just as subservient to and led by an alien will and an alien intelligencehaving its animating unity elsewhereas its material unity appears subordinate to the objective unity of the machinery of fixed capital which as animated monster objectifies the scientific idea and is in fact the coordinator does not in any way relate to the individual worker as his instrument but rather he himself exists as an animated individual punctuation mark as its living isolated accessory thus combined labour is combination initself in a double way not combination as a mutual relation among the individuals working together nor as their predominance either over their particular or individual function or over the instrument of labour hence just as the worker relates to the product of his labour as an alien thing so does he relate to the combination of labour as an alien combination as well as to his own labour as an expression of his life which although it belongs to him is alien to him and coerced from him and which a smith etc therefore conceives as a burden sacrifice etc9 labour itself like its product is negated as the labour of the particular isolated worker this isolated labour negated is now indeed communal or combined labour posited the communal or combined labour posited in this wayas activity and in the passive objective formis however at the same time posited as an other towards the really existing individual labouras an alien objectivity alien property as well as an alien subjectivity of capital capital thus represents both labour and its product as negated individualized labour and hence as the negated property of the individualized worker capital therefore is the existence of social labourthe combination of labour as subject as well as objectbut this existence as itself existing independently opposite its real momentshence itself a particular existence apart from them for its part capital therefore appears as the predominant subject and owner of alien labour and its relation is itself as complete a contradiction as is that of wage labour

e precapitalist property and production

        the original unity between a particular form of community clan and the corresponding property in nature or relation to the objective conditions of production as a natural being as an objective being of the individual mediated by the communethis unity which appears in one respect as the particular form of propertyhas its living reality in a specific mode of production itself a mode which appears both as a relation between the individuals and as their specific active relation to inorganic nature a specific mode of working which is always family labour often communal labour the community itself appears as the first great force of production particular kinds of production conditions eg stockbreeding agriculture develop particular modes of production and particular forces of production subjective appearing as qualities of individuals as well as objective ones

        in the last anaysis their community as well as the property based on it resolves itself into a specific stage in the development of the productive forces of working subjectsto which correspond their specific relations amongst one another and towards nature until a certain point reproduction then turns into dissolution

        property then originally meansin its asiatic slavonic ancient classical germanic formthe relation of the working producing or selfreproducing subject to the conditions of his production or reproduction as his own it will therefore have different forms depending on the conditions of this production production itself aims at the reproduction of the producer within and together with these his objective conditions of existence this relation as proprietornot as a result but as a presupposition of labour ie of productionpresupposes the individual defined as a member of a clan or community whose property the individual himself is up to a certain point slavery bondage etc where the worker himself appears among the natural conditions of production for a third individual or community this is not the case eg with the general slavery of the orient only from the european point of view ie property no longer the relation of the working individual to the objective conditions of labouris always secondary derived never original although it is a necessary and logical result of property founded on the community and labour in the community it is of course very simple to imagine that some powerful physically dominant individual after first having caught the animal then catches humans in order to have them catch animals in a word uses human beings as another naturally occurring condition for his reproduction whereby his own labour reduces itself to ruling like any other natural creature but such a notion is stupidcorrect as it may be from the standpoint of some particular given clan or communebecause it proceeds from the development of isolated individuals but human beings become individuals only through the process of history he appears originally as a speciesbeing gattungswesen clan being herd animalalthough in no way whatever as a insert text1 in the political sense exchange itself is a chief means of this individuation vereinzelung it makes the herdlike existence superfluous and dissolves it soon the matter has turned in such a way that as an individual he relates himself only to himself while the means with which he posits himself as individuals have become the making of his generality and commonness in this community the objective being of the individual as proprietor say proprietor of land is presupposed and presupposed moreover under certain conditions which chain him to the community or rather form a link in his chain in bourgeois society the worker eg stands there  purely without objectivity subjectively but the thing which stands opposite him has now become the true community gemeinwesen which he tries to make a meal of and which makes a meal of him

        all forms more or less naturally arisen spontaneous all at the same time however results of a historic process in which the community presupposes its subjects in a specific objective unity with their conditions of production or in which a specific subjective mode of being presupposes the communities themselves as conditions of production necessarily correspond to a development of the forces of production which is only limited and indeed limited in principle the development of the forces of production dissolves these forms and their dissolution is itself a development of the human productive forces labour begins with a certain foundationnaturally arisen spontaneous at firstthen historic presupposition then however this foundation or presupposition is itself suspended or posited as a vanishing presupposition which has become too confining for the unfolding of the progressing human pack 

        in so far as classical landed property reappears in modern smallparcel land ownership it itself belongs to political economy and we shall come to it in the section on landed property

        all this is to be returned to at greater depth and length

        what we are here concerned with is this the relation of labour to capital or to the objective conditions of labour as capital presupposes a process of history which dissolves the various forms in which the worker is a proprietor or in which the proprietor works thus above all 1 dissolution of the relation to the earthland and soilas natural condition of productionto which he relates as to his own inorganic being the workshop of his forces and the domain of his will all forms in which this property appears presuppose a community whose members although there may be formal distinctions between them are as members of it proprietors the original form of this property is therefore itself direct common property oriental form modified in the slavonic developed to the point of antithesis but still as the secret if antithetical foundation in classical and germanic property 2 dissolution of the relations in which he appears as proprietor of the instrument just as the above form of landed property presupposes a real community so does this property of the worker in the instrument presuppose a particular form of the development of manufactures namely craft artisan work bound up with it the guild corporation system etc the manufacture system of the ancient orient can be examined under 1 already here labour itself still half artistic half end in itself etc mastery capitalist himself still masterjourneyman attainment of particular skill in the work also secures possession of instrument etc inheritability then to a certain extent of the mode of work together with the organization of work and the instrument of work medieval cities labour still as his own definite selfsufficient development of onesided abilities etc 3 included in both is the fact that he has the means of consumption in h is possession before production which a re necessary for him to live as producerie during production before its completion as proprietor of land he appears as directly provided with the necessary consumption fund as master in a craft he has inherited it earned it saved it up and as a young he is first an apprentice where he does not appear as an actual independent worker at all but shares the masters fare in a patriarchal way as journeyman a genuine one there is a certain communality in the consumption fund possessed by the master while it is not the journeymans property either still through the laws of the guild tradition etc at least copossession etc to be gone into further 4 dissolution likewise at the same time of the relations in which the workers themselves the living labour capacities themselves still belong directly among the objective conditions of production and are appropriated as suchie are slaves or serfs for capital the worker is not a condition of production only work is if it can make machines do it or even water air so much the better and it does not appropriate the worker but his labournot directly but mediated through exchange

        these are now on one side historic presuppositions needed before the worker can be found as a free worker as objectless purely subjective labour capacity confronting the objective conditions of production as his notproperty as alien property as value foritself as capital but the question arises on the other side which conditions are required so that he finds himself up against a capital

         the formula of capital where living labour relates to the raw material as well as to the instrument and to the means of subsistence required during labour as negatives as notproperty includes first of all notlandownership or the negation of the situation in which the working individual relates to land and soil to the earth as his own ie in which he works produces as proprietor of the land and soil in the best case he relates not only as worker to the land and soil but also as proprietor of the land and soil to himself as working subject ownership of land and soil potentially also includes ownership of the raw material as well as of the primordial instrument the earth itself and of its spontaneous fruits posited in the most original form it means relating to the earth as proprietor and finding raw material and instrument on hand as well as the necessaries of life created not by labour but by the earth itself once this relation is reproduced secondary instruments and fruits of the earth created through labour itself appear as included with landed property in its primitive forms this historic situation is thus first of all negated as a full property relation in the workers relation to the conditions of labour as capital this is historic state no i which is negated in this relation or presupposed as historically dissolved secondly however where there is ownership of the instrument on the part of the worker ie the worker relates to the instrument as his own where the worker works as owner of the instrument which at the same time presupposes the subsumption of the instrument under his individual work ie a particular limited developmental stage of the productive force of labour where this form of the worker as owner or of the working owner is already posited as an independent form beside and apart from landed propertythe artisanlike and urban development of labournot as in the first case as accidental to landed property and subsumed under ithence where the raw material and the necessaries of life are also mediated as the craftsmans property mediated through his craft work through his property in the instrumentthere a second historical stage is already presupposed beside and apart from the first which must itself already appear significantly modified through the achievement of independence by this second sort of property or by working owners since the instrument itself is already the product of labour thus the element which constitutes property already exists as posited by labour the community can no longer appear here in a naturally arisen spontaneous form as in the first casethe community on which this form of property foundedbut rather as itself already a produced made derived and secondary community produced by the worker himself it is clear that wherever ownership of the instrument is the relation to the conditions of production as property there in the real labour process the instrument appears only as a means of individual labour the art of really appropriating the instrument of handling it as an instrument of labour appears as the workers particular skill which posits him as the owner of the instrument in short the essential character of the guildcorporation system of craft work as its subject constituted by ownerscan be resolved into the relation to the instrument of productionthe instrument of labour as propertyas distinct from the relation to the earth to land and soil to the raw material as such as ones own that the relation to this one moment of the conditions of production constitutes the working subject as owner makes him into a working owner this is historic situation no ii which by its nature can exist only as antithesis to or if one will at the same time as complement of a modified form of the firstlikewise negated in the first formula of capital the third possible form in which the worker relates as owner only to the necessaries of life finding them on hand as the natural condition of the working subject without relating to the land and soil or to the instrument or even therefore to labour itself as his own is at bottom the formula of slavery and bondage which is likewise negated posited as a historically dissolved condition in the relation of the worker to the conditions of production as capital the original forms of property necessarily dissolve into the relation to the different objective moments which condition production as ones own they form the economic foundation of different forms of community just as they for their part have specific forms of the community as presupposition these forms are essentially modified by the inclusion of labour itself among the objective conditions of production serfdom and slavery through which the simply affirmative character of all forms of property included under no 1 is lost and modified they all contain within themselves slavery as possibility and hence as their own suspension as regards no ii where the particular kind of workmastery of it and consequent upon that an identity between property in the instrument and property in the conditions of productionwhile it excludes slavery and bondage can take on an analogous negative development in the form of the caste system working individual to the conditions of production and hence of existence it can therefore only be the relation of a member of the original community based on land ownership who has lost his landed property and not yet proceeded to variety no ii of property such as the
roman plebs at the time of the bread and circuses masterservant relation herrschaftsverhältnis as essential element of appropriation basically the appropriation of animals land etc cannot take place in a masterservant relation although the animal provides service the presupposition of the masterservant relation is the appropriation of an alien will whatever has no will eg the animal may well provide a service but does not thereby make its owner into a master this much can be seen here however that the masterservant relation likewise belongs in this formula of the appropriation of the instruments of production and it forms a necessary ferment for the
development and the decline and fall of all original relations of property and of production just as it also expresses their limited nature still it is reproducedin mediated formin capital and
thus likewise forms a ferment of its dissolution and is an emblem of its limitation 

  

        on one side historic processes are presupposed which place a mass of individuals in a nation etc in the position if not at first of real free workers nevertheless of such who are so insert text whose only property is their labour capacity and the possibility of exchanging it for values then present individuals who confront all objective conditions of production as alien property as their own notproperty but at the same time as values as exchangeable hence appropriable to a certain degree through living labour such historic processes of dissolution are also the dissolution of the bondage relations which fetter the worker to land and soil and to the lord of land and soil but which factually presuppose his ownership of the necessaries of lifethis is in truth the process of his release from the earth dissolution of the landed property relations which constituted him as a yeoman as a free working small landowner or tenant colonus a free peasant2 dissolution of the guild relations which presuppose his ownership of the instrument of labour and which presuppose labour itself as a craftsmanlike specific skill as property not merely as the source of property likewise dissolution of the client relations in the various forms in which notproprietors appear in the retinue of their lord as coconsumers of the surplus product and wear the livery of their master as an equivalent participate in his feuds perform personal services imaginery or real etc it will be seen on closer inspection that all these processes of dissolution mean the dissolution of relations of production in which use value predominates production for direct consumption in which exchange value and its production presupposes the predominance of the other form and hence that in all these relations payments in kind and services in kind predominate over payment in money and moneyservices but this only by the way it will likewise be found on closer observation that all the dissolved relations were possible only with a definite degree of development of the material and hence also the intellectual forces of production

2 the dissolution of the still earlier forms of communal property and real community goes without saying marx

        what concerns us here for the moment is this the process of dissolution which transforms a mass of individuals of a nation etc into free wage labourers insert textindividuals forced solely by their lack of property to labour and to sell their labourpresupposes on the other side not that these individuals previous sources of income and in part conditions of property have disappeared but the reverse that only their utilization has become different that their mode of existence has changed has gone over into other hands as a free fund or has even in part remained in the same hands but this much is clear the same process which divorced a mass of individuals from their previous relations to the objective conditions of labour relations which were in one way or another affirmative negated these relations and thereby transformed these individuals into free workers this same process freedinsert textthese objective conditions of labourland and soil raw material necessaries of life instruments of labour money or all of thesefrom their previous state of attachment to the individuals now separated from them they are still there on hand but in another form as a free fund in which all political etc relations are obliterated the objective conditions of labour now confront these unbound propertyless individuals only in the form of values selfsufficient values  the same process which placed the mass face to face with the objective conditions of labour as free workers also placed these conditions as capital face to face with the free workers the historic process was the divorce of elements which up until then were bound together its result is therefore not that one of the elements disappears but that each of them appears in a negative relation to the otherthe potentially free worker on the one side capital potentially on the other the separation of the objective conditions from the classes which have become transformed into free workers necessarily also appears at the same time as the achievement of independence by these same conditions at the opposite pole

        if the relation of capital and wage labour is regarded not as already commanding and predominant over the whole of production3 but as arising historicallyie if we regard the original transformation of money into capital the process of exchange between capital still only existing insert text on one side and the free workers existing insert text on the otherthen of course one cannot help making the simple observation out of which the economists make a great show that the side which appears as capital has to possess raw materials instruments of labour and necessaries of life so that the worker can live during production before production is completed this further takes the form that there must have taken place on the part of the capitalist an accumulationan accumulation prior to labour and not sprung out of itwhich enables him to put the worker to work and to maintain his effectiveness to maintain him as living labour capacity4 this act by capital which is independent of labour not posited by labour is then shifted from the prehistory of capital into the present into a moment of its reality and of its present activity of its selfformation from this is ultimately derived the eternal right of capital to the fruits of alien labour or rather its mode of appropriation is developed out of the simple and just laws of equivalent exchange

3 for in that case the capital presupposed as condition of wage labour is wage labours own product and is presupposed by it as its own presupposition created by it as its own presupposition marx

4 once capital and wage labour are posited as their own presupposition as the basis presupposed to production itself then what appears initially is that the capitalist possesses in addition to the fund of raw materials and necessaries required for the labourer to reproduce himself to create the required means of subsistence ie to realize necessary labour a fund of raw material and means of labour in which the worker realizes his surplus labour ie the capitalists profit on further analysis this takes the form that the worker constantly creates a double fund for the capitalist or in the form of capital one part of this fund constantly fulfils the conditions of his own existence and the other part fulfils the conditions for the existence of capital as we have seen in the case of the surplus capitaland surplus capital in relation to its antediluvian relation to labourall real present capital and each of its elements has equally been appropriated without exchange without an equivalent as objectified appropriated alien labour marx

        wealth present in the form of money can be exchanged for the objective conditions of labour only because and if these are separated from labour itself we saw that money can be piled up in part by way of the sheer exchange of equivalents but this forms so insignificant a source that it is not worth mentioning historicallyif it is presupposed that this money is gained through the exchange of ones own labour the monetary wealth which becomes transformed into capital in the proper sense into industrial capital is rather the mobile wealth piled up through usuryespecially that practised against landed propertyand through mercantile profits we shall have occasion below to speak further of both of these formsin so far as they appear not as themselves forms of capital but as earlier forms of wealth as presuppositions for capital

        it is inherent in the concept of capital as we have seenin its originthat it begins with money and hence with wealth existing in the form of money it is likewise inherent in it that it appears as coming out of circulation as the product of circulation the formation of capital thus does not emerge from landed property here at most from the tenant pächter in so far as he is a dealer in agricultural products or from the guild although there is a possibility at the last point but rather from merchants and usurers wealth but the latter encounter the conditions where free labour can be purchased only when this labour has been released from its objective conditions of existence through the process of history only then does it also encounter the possibility of buying these conditions themselves under guild conditions eg mere money if it is not itself guild money masters money cannot buy the looms to make people work with them how many an individual may operate etc is prescribed in short the instrument itself is still so intertwined with living labour whose domain it appears that it does not truly circulate what enables moneywealth to become capital is the
encounter on one side with free workers and on the other side with the necessaries and materials etc which previously were in one way or another the property of the masses who have now become objectless and are also free and purchasable the other condition of labour howevera certain level of skill instrument as means of labour etcis already available to it in this preliminary or first period of capital partly as a result of the urban guild system partly as a result of domestic industry or industry which is attached to agriculture as an accessory this historic process is not the product of capital but the presupposition for it and it is through this process that the capitalist inserts himself as historic middleman between landed property or property generally and labour history knows nothing of the congenial fantasies according to which the capitalist and the workers form an association etc nor is there a trace of them in the conceptual development of capital manufactures
may develop sporadically locally in a framework which still belongs to a quite different period as eg in the italian cities alongside the guilds but as the sole predominant forms of an epoch the conditions for capital have to be developed not only locally but on a grand scale nothwithstanding this individual guild masters may develop into capitalists with the dissolution of the guilds but the case is rare in the nature of the thing as well as a rule the whole guild system declines and falls both master and journeyman where the capitalist and the worker arise

        it goes without sayingand shows itself if we go more deeply into the historic epoch under discussion herethat in truth the period of the dissolution of their earlier modes of production and modes of the workers relation to the objective conditions of labour is at the same time a period in which monetary wealth on the one side has already developed to a certain extent and on the other side grows and expands rapidly through the same circumstances as accelerate the above dissolution it is itself one of the agencies of that dissolution while at the same time that dissolution is the condition of its transformation into capital but the mere presence of monetary wealth and even the achievement of a kind of supremacy on its part is in no way sufficient for this dissolution into capital to happen or else ancient rome byzantium etc would have ended their history with free labour and capital or rather begun a new history there too the dissolution of the old property relations was bound up with development of monetary wealthof trade etc but instead of leading to industry this dissolution led in fact to the supremacy of the countryside over the citythe original formation of capital does not happen as is sometimes imagined with capital heaping up necessaries of life and instruments of labour and raw materials in short the objective conditions of labour which have already been unbound from the soil and animated by human labour5 capital does not create the objective conditions of labour rather its original formation is that through the historic process of the dissolution of the old mode of production value existing as moneywealth is enabled on one side to buy the objective conditions of labour on the other side to exchange money for the living labour of the workers who have been set free all these moments are present their divorce is itself a historic process a process of dissolution and it is the latter which enables money to transform itself into capital money itself to the extent that it also plays an active role does so only in so far as it intervenes in this process as itself a highly energetic solvent and to that extent assists in the creation of the plucked objectless free workers but certainly not by creating the objective conditions of their existence rather by helping to speed up their separation from themtheir propertylessness when eg the great english landowners dismissed their retainers who had together with them consumed the surplus product of the land when further their tenants chased off the smaller cottagers etc then firstly a mass of living labour powers was thereby thrown onto the labour market a mass which was free in a double sense free from the old relations of clientship bondage and servitude and secondly free of all belongings and possessions and of every objective material form of being free of all property dependent on the sale of its labour capacity or on begging vagabondage and robbery as its only source of income it is a matter of historic record that they tried the latter first but were driven off this road by gallows stocks and whippings onto the narrow path to the labour market owing to this fact the governments eg of henry vii  viii etc appear as conditions of the historic dissolution process and as makers of the conditions for the existence of capital on the other side the necessaries of life etc which the landowners previously ate up together with their retainers now stood at the disposal of any money which might wish to buy them in order to buy labour through their instrumentality money neither created nor stockpiled these necessaries they were there and were consumed and reproduced before they were consumed and reproduced through its mediation what had changed was simply this that these necessaries were now thrown on to the exchange marketwere separated from their direct connection with the mouths of the retainers etc and transformed from use values into exchange values and thus fell into the domain and under the supremacy of money wealth likewise with the instruments of labour money wealth neither invented nor fabricated the
spinning wheel and the loom but once unbound from their land and soil spinner and weaver with their stools and wheels came under the command of money wealth capital proper does nothing but bring together the mass of hands and instruments which it finds on hand it agglomerates them under its command that is its real stockpiling the stockpiling of workers along with their instruments at particular points this will have to be dealt with more
closely in the socalled stockpiling of capital monetary wealthas merchant wealthhad admittedly helped to speed up and to dissolve the old relations of production and made it possible for the proprietor of land for example as a smith already nicely develops6 to exchange his grain and cattle etc for use values brought from afar instead of squandering the use values he himself produced along with his retainers and to locate his wealth in great part in the mass of his coconsuming retainers it gave the exchange value of his revenue a higher significance for him the same thing took place in regard to his tenants who were already semicapitalists but still very hemmedin ones the development of exchange valuefavoured by money existing in the form of the merchant estatedissolves production which is more oriented towards direct use value and its corresponding forms of propertythe relations of labour to its objective conditionsand thus pushes forward towards the
making of the labour market certainly to be distinguished from the slave market however even this action of money is only possible given the presupposition of an urban artisanate resting not on capital but on the organization of labour in guilds etc urban labour itself had created means of production for which the guilds became just as confining as were the old relations of landownership to an improved agriculture which was in part itself a consequence of the larger market for agricultural products in the cities etc the other circumstances which eg in the sixteenth century increased the mass of circulating commodities as well as that of money which created new needs and thereby raised the exchange value of indigenous products etc raised prices etc all of these promoted on one side the dissolution of the old relations of production sped up the separation of the worker or nonworker but ablebodied individual from the objective conditions of his reproduction and thus promoted the transformation of money into capital there can therefore be nothing more ridiculous than to conceive this original formation of capital as if capital had stockpiled and created the objective conditions of productionnecessaries raw materials instrumentand then offered them to the worker who was bare of these possessions rather monetary wealth in part helped to strip the labour powers of ablebodied individuals from these conditions and in part this process of divorce proceeded without it when the formation of capital had reached a certain level monetary wealth could place itself as mediator between the objective conditions of life thus liberated and the liberated but also homeless and emptyhanded labour powers and buy the latter with the former but now as far as the formation of moneywealth itself is concerned this belongs to the prehistory of the bourgeois economy usury trade urbanization and the treasury rising with it play the main roles here so too hoarding by tenants peasants etc although to a lesser degree this shows at the same time that the development of exchange and of exchange value which is everywhere mediated through trade or whose mediation may be termed trademoney achieves an independent existence in the merchant estate as does circulation in tradebrings with it both the dissolution of labours relations of property in its conditions of existence in one respect and at the same time the dissolution of labour which is itself classed as one of the objective conditions of production all these are relations which express a predominance of use value and of production directed towards use value as well as of a real community which is itself still directly present as a presupposition of production production based on exchange value and the community based on the exchange of these exchange valueseven though they seem as we saw in the previous chapter on money to posit property as the outcome of labour alone and to posit private property over the product of ones own labour as conditionand labour as general condition of wealth all presuppose and produce the separation of labour from its objective conditions this exchange of equivalents proceeds it is only the surface layer of a production which rests on the appropriation of alien labour without exchange but with the semblance of exchange this system of exchange rests on capital as its foundation and when it is regarded in isolation from capital as it appears on the surface as an independent system then it is a mere illusion but a necessary illusion thus there is no longer any ground for astonishment that the system of exchange valuesexchange of equivalents measured through labour turns into or rather reveals as its hidden background the appropriation of alien labour without exchange complete separation of labour and property for the domination of exchange value itself and of exchangevalueproducing production presupposes alien labour capacity itself as an exchange valueie the separation of living labour capacity from its objective conditions a relation to themor to its own objectivityas alien property a relation to them in a word as capital only in the period of the decline and fall o f the feudal system but where it still
struggles internallyas in england in the fourteenth and first half of the fifteenth centuriesis there a golden age for labour in the process of becoming emancipated in order for labour to relate to its objective conditions as its property again another system must take the place of the system of private exchange which as we saw posits the exchange of objectified labour for labour capacity and therefore the appropriation of living labour without exchangethe way in
which money transforms itself into capital often shows itself quite tangibly in history eg when the merchant induces a number of weavers and spinners who until then wove and spun as a rural secondary occupation to work for him making their secondary into their chief occupation but then has them in his power and has brought them under his command as wage labourers to draw them away from their home towns and to concentrate them in a place of work is a further step in this simple process it is clear that the capitalist has prepared neither the raw material nor the instrument nor the means of subsistence for the weaver and the spinner all that he has done is to restrict them little by little to one kind of work in which they become dependent on selling on the buyer the merchant and ultimately produce only for and through him he bought their labour originally only by buying their product as soon as they restrict themselves to the production of this exchange value and thus must directly produce exchange values must exchange their labour entirely for money in order to survive then they come under his command and at the end even the illusion that they sold him products disappears he buys their labour and takes their property first in the form of the product and soon after that the instrument as well or he leaves it to them as sham property in order to reduce his own production costs the original historic forms in which capital appears at first sporadically or locally alongside the old modes of production while exploding them little by little everywhere is on one side manufacture proper not yet the factory this springs up where mass quantities are produced for export for the external marketie on the basis of largescale overland and maritime commerce in its emporiums like the italian cities constantinople in the flemish dutch cities a few spanish ones such as barcelona etc manufacture seizes hold initially not of the socalled urban trades but of the rural secondary occupations spinning and weaving the two which least requires guildlevel skills technical training apart from these great emporiums where the external market is its basis where production is thus so to speak naturally oriented towards exchange valueie manufactures directly connected with shipping shipbuilding itself etcit takes up its first residence not in the cities but on the land in villages lacking guilds etc the rural subsidiary occupations have the broad basis characteristic of manufactures while the urban trades demand great progress in production before they can be conducted in factory style likewise certain branches of productionsuch as glassworks metal works sawmills etc which demand a higher concentration of labour powers from the outset apply more natural energy from the outset demand mass production likewise concentration of the means of labour etc likewise paper mills on the other side the rise of the tenant and the transformation of the agricultural population into free daylabourers although this transformation in the countryside is the last to push on towards its ultimate consequences and its purest form its beginnings there are among the earliest classical antiquity which could never get beyond the urban artisanate proper could therefore never get to large industry the first presupposition of the latter is to draw the land in all its expanse into the production not of use values but of exchange values class factories paper mills iron works etc cannot be operated on guild principles they demand mass production sales to a general market monetary wealth on the part of their entrepreneurnot that he creates the conditions neither the subjective nor the objective ones but under the old relations of property and of production these conditions cannot be brought together the dissolution of relations of serfdom like the rise of manufacture then little by little transforms all branches of work into branches operated by capital the cities themselves it is true also contain an element for the formation of wage labour proper in the nonguild daylabourers unskilled labourers etc

5 the first glance shows what a nonsensical circle it would be if on the one hand the workers whom capital has to put to work in order to posit itself as capital had first to be created to be brought to life through its stockpiling if they waited for its command let there be workers while at the same time it were itself incapable of stockpiling without alien labour could at most stockpile its own labour ie could itself exist in the form of notcapital and notmoney since labour before the existence of capital can only realize itself in forms such as craft labour petty agriculture etc in short all forms which can not stockpile or only sparingly in forms which allow of only a small surplus product and eat up most of it we shall have to examine this notion of stockpiling aufhäufung still more closely later on marx

        while as we have seen the transformation of money into capital presupposes a historic process which divorces the objective conditions of labour from toe worker and makes them independent of him it is at the same time the effect of capital and of its process once arisen to conquer all of production and to develop and complete the divorce between labour and property between labour and the objective conditions of labour everywhere it will be seen in the course of the further development how capital destroys craft and artisan labour working smalllandownership etc together with itself in forms in which it does not appear in opposition to labour in small capital and in the intermediate species the species between the old modes of production or their renewal on the foundation of capital and the classical adequate mode of production of capital itself

        the only stockpiling presupposed at the origin of capital is that of monetary wealth which regarded in and for itself is altogether unproductive as it only springs up out of circulation and belongs exclusively to it capital rapidly forms an internal market for itself by destroying all rural secondary occupations so that it spins weaves for everyone clothes everyone etc in short brings the commodities previously created as direct use values into the form of exchange values a process which comes about by itself through the separation of the workers from land and soil and from property even in the form of serf property in the conditions of production 

        with the urban crafts although they rest essentially on exchange and on the creation of exchange values the direct and chief aim of this production is subsistence as craftsmen as masterjourneymen hence use value not wealth not exchange value as exchange value production is therefore always subordinated to a given consumption supply to demand and expands only slowly

        the production of capitalists and wage labourers is thus a chief product of capitals realization process ordinary economics which looks only at the things produced forgets this completely when objectified labour is in this process at the same time posited as the workers nonobjectivity as the objectivity of a subjectivity antithetical to the worker as property of a will alien to him then capital is necessarily at the same time the capitalist and the idea held by some socialists that we need capital but not the capitalists is altogether wrong it is posited within the concept of capital that the objective conditions of labourand these are its own producttake on a personality towards it or what is the same that they are posited as the property of a personality alien to the worker the concept of capital contains the capitalist

  

f population overpopulation and malthus

  

        malthuss theory which incidentally was not his invention but whose fame he appropriated through the clerical fanaticism with which he propounded itactually only through the weight he placed on itis significant in two respects 1 because he gives brutal expression to the brutal viewpoint of capital 2 because he asserted the fact of overpopulation in all forms of society proved it he has not for there is nothing more uncritical than his motley compilations from historians and travellers descriptions his conception is altogether false and childish 1 because he regards overpopulation as being of the same kind in all the different historic phases of economic development does not understand their specific difference and hence stupidly reduces these very complicated and varying relations to a single relation two equations in which the natural reproduction of humanity appears on the one side and the natural reproduction of edible plants or means of subsistence on the other as two natural
series the former geometric and the latter arithmetic in progression in this way he transforms the historically distinct relations into an abstract numerical relation which he has fished purely out of thin air and which rests neither on natural nor on historical laws there is allegedly a natural difference between the reproduction of mankind and eg grain this baboon thereby implies that the increase of humanity is a purely natural process which requires external restraints checks to prevent it from proceeding in geometrical progression this geometrical reproduction is the natural reproduction process of mankind he would find in history that population proceeds in very different relations and that overpopulation is likewise a historically determined relation in no way determined by abstract numbers or by the absolute limit of the productivity of the necessaries of life but by limits posited rather by specific conditions of production as well as restricted numerically how small do the numbers which meant overpopulation for the athenians appear to us secondly restricted according to character an overpopulation of free athenians who become transformed into colonists is significantly different from an overpopulation of workers who become transformed into workhouse inmates similarly the begging overpopulation which consumes the surplus produce of a monastery is different from that which forms in a factory it is malthus who abstracts from these specific historic laws of the movement of population which are indeed the history of the nature of humanity the natural laws  but natural laws of humanity only at a specific historic development with a development of the forces of production determined by humanitys own process of history malthusian man abstracted from historically determined man exists only in his brain hence also the geometric method of reproduction corresponding to this natural malthusian man real history thus appears to him in such a way that the reproduction of his natural humanity is not an abstraction from the historic process of real reproduction but just the contrary that real reproduction is an application of the malthusian theory hence the inherent conditions of population as well as of overpopulation at every stage of history appear to him as a series of external checks which has prevented the population from developing in the malthusian form the conditions in which mankind historically produces and reproduces itself appear as barriers to the reproduction of the         malthusian natural man who is a malthusian creature on the other hand the production of the necessaries of lifeas it is checked determined by human actionappears as a check which it posits to itself the ferns would cover the entire earth their reproduction would stop only where space for them ceased they would obey no arithmetic proportion it is hard to say where malthus has discovered that the reproduction of voluntary natural products would stop for intrinsic reasons without external checks he transforms the immanent historically changing limits of the human reproduction process into outer barriers and the outer barriers to natural reproduction into immanent limits or natural laws of reproduction

        2 he stupidly relates a specific quantity of people to a specific quantity of necessaries7 ricardo immediately and correctly confronted him with the fact that the quantity of grain available is completely irrelevant to the worker if he has no employment that it is therefore the means of employment and not of subsistence which put him into the category of surplus population8 but this should be conceived more generally and relates to the social mediation as such through which the individual gains access to the means of his reproduction and creates them hence it relates to the conditions of production and his relation to them there was no barrier to the reproduction o f the athenian slave other than the producible necessaries and we never hear that there were surplus slaves in antiquity the call for them increased rather there was however a surplus population of nonworkers in the immediate sense who were not too many in relation to the necessaries available but who had lost the conditions under which they could appropriate them the invention of surplus labourers ie of propertyless people who work belongs to the period of capital the beggars who fastened themselves to the monasteries and helped them eat up their surplus product are in the same class as the feudal retainers and this shows that the surplus produce could not be eaten up by the small number of its owners it is only another form of the retainers of old or of the menial servants of today the overpopulation eg among hunting peoples which shows itself in the warfare between the tribes proves not that the earth could not support their small numbers but rather that the condition of their reproduction required a great amount of territory for few people never a relation to a nonexistent absolute mass of means of subsistence but rather relation to the conditions of reproduction of the production of these means including likewise the conditions of reproduction of human beings of the total population of relative surplus population this surplus purely relative in no way related to the means of subsistence as such but rather to the mode of producing them hence also only a surplus at this state of development

g capitalism machinery and automation
the labour process fixed capital means of labour machine fixed capital transposition of powers of labour into powers of capital both in fixed and in circulating capital to what extent fixed capital machine creates value lauderdale machine presupposes
a mass of workers

  

        as long as the means of labour remains a means of labour in the proper sense of the term such as it is directly historically adopted by capital and included in its realization process it undergoes a merely formal modification by appearing now as a means of labour not only in regard to its material side but also at the same time as a particular mode of the presence of capital determined by its total processas fixed capital but once adopted into the production process of capital the means of labour passes through different metamorphoses whose culmination is the machine or rather an automatic system of machinery system of machinery the automatic one is merely its most complete most adequate form and alone transforms machinery into a system set in motion by an automaton a moving power that moves itself this automaton consisting of numerous mechanical and intellectual organs so that the workers themselves are cast merely as its conscious linkages in the machine and even more in machinery as an automatic system the use value ie the material quality of the means of labour is transformed into an existence adequate to fixed capital and to capital as such and the form in which it was adopted into the production process of capital the direct means of labour is superseded by a form posited by capital itself and corresponding to it in no way does the machine appear as the individual workers means of labour its distinguishing characteristic is not in the least as with the means of labour to transmit the workers activity to the object this activity rather is posited in such a way that it merely transmits the machines work the machines action on to the raw materialsupervises it and guards against interruptions not as with the instrument which the worker animates and makes into his organ with his skill and strength and whose handling therefore depends on his virtuosity rather it is the machine which possesses skill and strength in place of the worker is itself the virtuoso with a soul of its own in the mechanical laws acting through it and it consumes coal oil etc matieres instrumentales just as the worker consumes food to keep up its perpetual motion the workers activity reduced to a mere abstraction of activity is determined and regulated on all sides by the movement of the machinery and not the opposite the science which compels the inanimate limbs of the machinery by their construction to act purposefully as an automaton does not exist in the workers consciousness but rather acts upon him through the machine as an alien power as the power of the machine itself the appropriation of living labour by objectified labourof the power or activity which creates value by value existing for itselfwhich lies in the concept of capital is posited in production resting on machinery as the character of the production process itself including its material elements and its material motion the production process has ceased to be a labour process in the sense of a process deminated by labour as its governing unity labour appears rather merely as a conscious organ scattered among the individual living workers at numerous points of the mechanical system subsumed under the total process of the machinery itself as itself only a link of the system whose unity exists not in the living workers but rather in the living active machinery which confronts his individual insignificant doings as a mighty organism in machinery objectified labour confronts living labour within the labour process itself as the power which rules it a power which as the appropriation of living labour is the form of capital the transformation of the means of labour into machinery and of living labour into a mere living accessory of this machinery as the means of its action also posits the absorption of the labour process in its material character as a mere moment of the realization process of capital the increase of the productive force of labour and the greatest possible negation of necessary labour is the necessary tendency of capital as we have seen the transformation of the means of labour into machinery is the realization of this tendency in machinery objectified labour materially confronts living labour as a ruling power and as an active subsumption of the latter under itself not only by appropriating it but in the real production process itself the relation of capital as value which appropriates valuecreating activity is in fixed capital existing as machinery posited at the same time as the relation of the use value of capital to the use value of labour capacity further the value objectified in machinery appears as a presupposition against which the valuecreating power of the individual labour capacity is an infinitesimal vanishing magnitude the production in enormous mass quantities which is posited with machinery destroys every connection of the product with the direct need of the producer and hence with direct use value it is already posited in the form of the products production and in the relations in which it is produced that it is produced only as a conveyor of value and its use value only as condition to that end in machinery objectified labour itself appears not only in the form of product or of the product employed as means of labour but in the form of the force of production itself the development of the means of labour into machinery is not an accidental moment of capital but is rather the historical reshaping of the traditional inherited means of labour into a form adequate to capital the accumulation of knowledge and of skill of the general productive forces of the social brain is thus absorbed into capital as opposed to labour and hence appears as an attribute of capital and more specifically of fixed capital in so far as it enters into the production process as a means of production proper machinery appears then as the most adequate form of fixed capital and fixed capital in so far as capitals relations with itself are concerned appears as the most adequate form of capital as such in another respect however in so far as fixed capital is condemned to an existence within the confines of a specific use value it does not correspond to the concept of capital which as value is indifferent to every specific form of use value and can adopt or shed any of them as equivalent incarnations in this respect as regards capitals external relations it is circulating capital which appears as the adequate form of capital and not fixed capital

        further in so far as machinery develops with the accumulation of societys science of productive force generally general social labour presents itself not in labour but in capital the productive force of society is measured in fixed capital exists there in its objective form and inversely the productive force of capital grows with this general progress which capital appropriates free of charge this is not the place to go into the development of machinery in detail rather only in its general aspect in so far as the means of labour as a physical thing loses its direct form becomes fixed capital and confronts the worker physically as capital in machinery knowledge appears as alien external to him and living labour as subsumed under selfactivating objectified labour the worker appears as superfluous to the extent that his action is not determined by capitals requirements

        the full development of capital therefore takes placeor capital has posited the mode of production corresponding to itonly when the means of labour has not only taken the economic form of fixed capital but has also been suspended in its immediate form and when fixed capital appears as a machine within the production process opposite labour and the entire production process appears as not subsumed under the direct skilfulness of the worker but rather as the technological application of science it is hence the tendency of capital to give production a scientific character direct labour is reduced to a mere moment of this process as with the transformation of value into capital so does it appear in the further development of capital that it presupposes a certain given historical development of the productive forces on one sidescience too is among these productive forcesand on the other drives and forces them further onwards 

        thus the quantitative extent and the effectiveness intensity to which capital is developed as fixed capital indicate the general degree to which capital is developed as capital as power over living labour and to which it has conquered the production process as such also in the sense that it expresses the accumulation of objectified productive forces and likewise of objectified labour however while capital gives itself its adequate form as use value within the production process only in the form of machinery and other material manifestations of fixed capital such as railways etc to which we shall return later this in no way means that this use valuemachinery  as suchis capital or that its existence as machinery is identical with its existence as capital any more than gold would cease to have use value as gold if it were no longer money machinery does not lose its use value as soon as it ceases to be capital while machinery is the most appropriate form of the use value of fixed capital it does not at all follow that therefore subsumption under the social relation of capital is the most appropriate and ultimate social relation of production for the application of machinery

        to the degree that labour timethe mere quantity of labouris posited by capital as the sole determinant element to that degree does direct labour and its quantity disappear as the determinant principle of productionof the creation of use valuesand is reduced both quantitatively to a smaller proportion and qualitatively as an of course indispensable but subordinate moment compared to general scientific labour technological application of natural sciences on one side and to the general productive force a rising from social combination gliederung in total production on the other sidea combination which appears as a natural fruit of social labour although it is a historic product capital thus works towards its own dissolution as the form dominating production

  

fixed capital and circulating capital as two particular kinds of capital fixed capital and continuity of the production process machinery and living labour business of inventing

        while up to now fixed capital and circulating capital appeared merely as different passing aspects of capital they have now hardened into two particular modes of its existence and fixed capital appears separately alongside circulating capital they are now two particular kinds of capital in so far as a capital is examined in a particular branch of production it appears as divided into these two portions or splits into these two kinds of capital in certain proportions

        the division within the production process originally between means of labour and material of labour and finally product of labour now appears as circulating capital the last two and fixed capital the first 9 the split within capital as regards its merely physical aspect has now entered into its form itself and appears as differentiating it

9 the manuscript has    now appears as circulating capital the first two and fixed capital

        from a viewpoint such as lauderdales etc who would like to have capital as such separately from labour create value and hence also surplus value or profit  fixed capitalnamely that whose physical presence or use value is machineryis the form which gives their superficial fallacies still the greatest semblance of validity the answer to them eg in labour defended is that the roadbuilder may share profits with the roaduser but the road itself cannot do so1

        circulating capitalpresupposing that it really passes through its different phasesbrings about the decrease or increase the brevity or length of circulation time the easier or more troublesome completion of the different stages of circulation a decrease of the surplus value which could be created in a given period of time without these interruptionseither because the number of reproductions grows smaller or because the quantity of capital continuously engaged in the production process is reduced in both cases this is not a reduction of the initial value but rather a reduction of the rate of growth from the moment however when fixed capital has developed to a certain extentand this extent as we indicated is the measure of the development of large industry generallyhence fixed capital increases in proportion to the development of large industrys productive forcesit is itself the objectification of these productive forces as presupposed productfrom this instant on every interruption of the production process acts as a direct reduction of capital itself of its initial value the value of fixed capital is reproduced only in so far as it is us ed up in the production process through disuse it loses its use value without its value passing on to the product hence the greater the scale on which fixed capital develops in the sense in which we regard it here the more does the
continuity of the production process or the constant flow of reproduction become an externally compelling condition for the mode of production founded on capital

        in machinery the appropriation of living labour by capital achieves a direct reality in this respect as well it is firstly the analysis and application of mechanical and chemical laws arising directly out of science which enables the machine to perform the same labour as that previously performed by the worker however the development of machinery along this path occurs only when large industry has already reached a higher stage and all the sciences have been pressed into the service of capital and when secondly the available machinery itself already provides great capabilities invention then becomes a business and the application of science to direct production itself becomes a prospect which determines and solicits it but this is not the road along which machinery by and large arose and even less the road on which it progresses in detail this road is rather dissection analyse through the division of labour which gradually transforms the workers operations into more and more mechanical ones so that at a certain point a mechanism can step into their places see under economy of power thus the specific mode of working here appears directly as becoming transferred from the worker to capital in the form of the machine and his own labour capacity devalued thereby hence the workers struggle against machinery what was the living workers activity becomes the activity of the machine thus the appropriation of labour by capital confronts the worker in a coarsely sensous form capital absorbs labour into itselfas though its body were by love possessed2

contradiction between the foundation of bourgeois production value as measure and its development machines etc

        the exchange of living labour for objectified labourie the positing of social labour in the form of the contradiction of capital and wage labouris the ultimate development of the valuerelation and of production resting on value its presupposition isand remains the mass of direct labour time the quantity of labour employed as the determinant factor in the production of wealth but to the degree that large industry develops the creation of real wealth comes to depend less on labour time and on the amount of labour employed than on the power of the agencies set in motion during labour time whose powerful effectiveness is itself in turn out of all proportion to the direct labour time spent on their production but depends rather on the general state of science and on the progress of technology or the application of this science to production the development of this science especially natural science and all others with the latter is itself in turn related to the development of material production agriculture eg becomes merely the application of the science of material metabolism its regulation for the greatest advantage of the entire body of society real wealth manifests itself ratherand large industry reveals thisin the monstrous disproportion between the labour time applied and its product as well as in the qualitative imbalance between labour reduced to a pure abstraction and the power of the production process it superintends labour no longer appears so much to be included within the production process rather the human being comes to relate more as watchman and regulator to the production process itself what holds for machinery holds likewise for the combination of human activities and the development of human intercourse no longer does the worker insert a modified natural thing naturgegenstand as middle link between the object objekt and himself rather he inserts the process of nature transformed into an industrial process as a means between himself and inorganic nature mastering it he steps to the side of the production process instead of being its chief actor in this transformation it is neither the direct human labour he himself performs nor the time during which he works but rather the appropriation of his own general productive power his understanding of nature and his mastery over it by virtue of his presence as a social bodyit is in a word the development of the social individual which appears as the great foundationstone of production and of wealth the theft of alien labour time on which the present wealth is based appears a miserable foundation in face of this new one created by largescale industry itself as soon as labour in the direct form has ceased to be the great wellspring of wealth labour time ceases and must cease to be its measure and hence exchange value must cease to be the measure of use value the surplus labour of the mass has ceased to be the condition for the development of general wealth just as the nonlabour of the few for the development of the general powers of human head with that production based on exchange value breaks down and the direct material production process is stripped of the form of penury and antithesis the free development of individualities and hence not the reduction of necessary labour time so as to posit surplus labour but rather the general reduction of the necessary labour of society to a minimum which then corresponds to the artistic scientific etc development of the individuals in the time set free and with the means created for all of them capital itself is the moving contradictionin that it presses to reduce labour time to a minimum while it posits labour time on the other side as sole measure and source of wealth hence it diminishes labour time in the necessary form so as to increase it in the superfluous form hence posits the superfluous in growing measure as a conditionquestion of life or deathfor the necessary on the one side then it calls to life all the powers of science and of nature as of social combination and of social intercourse in order to make the creation of wealth independent relatively of the labour time employed on it on the other side it wants to use labour time as the measuring rod for the giant social forces thereby created and to confine them within the limits required to maintain the already created value as value forces of production and social relationstwo different sides of the development of the social individualappear to capital as mere means and are merely means for it to produce on its limited foundation in fact however they are the material conditions to blow this foundation skyhigh truly wealthy a nation when the working day is 6 rather than 12 hours wealth is not command over surplus labour time real wealth but rather disposable time outside that needed in direct production for every individual and the whole society the source and remedy etc 1821 p 6

        nature builds no machines no locomotives railways electric telegraphs selfacting mules etc these are products of human industry natural material transformed into organs of the human will over nature or of human participation in nature they are organs of the human brain created by the human hand the power of knowledge objectified the development of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social knowledge has become a direct force of production and to what degree hence the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance with it to what degree the powers of social production have been produced not only in the form of knowledge but also as immediate organs of social practice of the real life process

        significance of the development of fixed capital for the development of capital generally relation between the creation of fixed capital and circulating capital disposable time to create it chief role of capital contradictory form of the same in capital productivity of labour and production of fixed capital the source and remedy use and consume economist durability of fixed capital

        the development of fixed capital indicates in still another respect the degree of development of wealth generally or of capital the aim of production oriented directly towards use value as well as of that directly oriented towards exchange value is the product itself destined for consumption the part of production which is oriented towards the production of fixed capital does not produce direct objects of individual gratification nor direct exchange values at least not directly realizable exchange values hence only when a certain degree of productivity has already been reachedso that a part of production time is sufficient for immediate productioncan an increasingly large part be applied to the production of the means of production this requires that society be able to wait that a large part of the wealth already created can be withdrawn both from immediate consumption and from production for immediate consumption in order to employ this part for labour which is not immediately productive within the material production process itself this requires a certain level of productivity and of relative overabundance and more specifically a level directly related to the transformation of circulating capital into fixed capital as the magnitude of relative surplus labour depends on the productivity of necessary labour so does the magnitude of labour timeliving as well as objectifiedemployed on the production of fixed capital depend on the productivity of the labour time spent in the direct production of products surplus population from this standpoint as well as surplus production is a condition for this that is the output of the time employed in direct production must be larger relatively than is directly required for the reproduction of the capital employed in these branches of industry the smaller the direct fruits borne by fixed capital the less it intervenes in the direct production process the greater must be this relative surplus population and surplus production thus more to build railways canals aqueducts telegraphs etc than to build the machinery directly active in the direct production process hencea subject to which we will return laterin the constant underand overproduction of modern industryconstant fluctuations and convulsions arise from the disproportion when sometimes too little then again too much circulating capital is transformed into fixed capital

         the creation of a large quantity of disposable time apart from necessary labour time for society generally and each of its members ie room for the development of the individuals full productive forces hence those of society also this creation of notlabour time appears in the stage of capital as of all earlier ones as notlabour time free time for a few what capital adds is that it increases the surplus labour time of the mass by all means of art and science because its wealth consists directly in the appropriation of surplus labour time since value directly its purpose not use value it is thus despite itself instrumental in creating the means of social disposable time in order to reduce labour time for the whole society to a diminishing minimum and thus to free everyones time for their own development but its tendency always on the one side to create disposable time on the other to convert it into surplus labour  if it succeeds too well at the first then it suffers from surplus production and then necessary labour is interrupted because no surplus labour can be realized by capital  the more this contradiction develops the more does it become evident that the growth of the forces of production can no longer be bound up with the appropriation of alien labour but that the mass of workers must themselves appropriate their own surplus labour once they have done soand disposable time thereby ceases to have an antithetical existencethen on one side necessary labour time will be measured by the needs of the social individual and on the other the development of the power of social production will grow so rapidly that even though production is now calculated for the wealth of all disposable time will grow for all for real wealth is the developed productive power of all individuals the measure of wealth is then not any longer in any way labour time but rather disposable time labour time as the measure of value posits wealth itself as founded on poverty and disposable time as existing in and because of the antithesis to surplus labour time or the positing of an individuals entire time as labour time and his degradation therefore to mere worker subsumption under labour the most developed machinery thus forces the worker to work longer than the savage does or than he himself did with the simplest crudest tools 

        if the entire labour of a country were sufficient only to raise the support of the whole population there would be no surplus labour consequently nothing that could be allowed to accumulate as capital if in one year the people raises enough for the support of two years one years consumption must perish or for one year men must cease from productive labour but the possessors of the surplus produce or capital   employ people upon something not directly and immediately productive eg in the erection of machinery so it goes on the source and remedy of the national difficulties p4

         as the basis on which large industry rests the appropriation of alien labour time ceases with its development to make up or to create wealth so does direct labour as such cease to be the basis of production since in one respect it is transformed more into a supervisory and regulatory activity but then also because the product ceases to be the product of isolated direct labour and the combination of social activity appears rather as the producer as soon as the division of labour is developed almost every piece of work done by a single individual is a part of a whole having no value or utility of itself there is nothing on which the labourer can seize this is my produce this i will keep to myself labour defended p 25 1  2 xi in direct exchange individual direct labour appears as realized in a particular product or part of the product and its communal social characterits character as objectification of general labour and satisfaction of the general needas posited through exchange alone in the production process of largescale industry by contrast just as the conquest of the forces of nature by the social intellect is the precondition of the productive power of the means of labour as developed into the automatic process on one side so on the other is the labour of the individual in its direct presence posited as suspended individual ie as social labour thus the other basis of this mode of production falls away 

        the labour time employed in the production of fixed capital relates to that employed in the production of circulating capital within the production process of capital itself as does surplus labour time to necessary labour time to the degree that production aimed at the satisfaction of immediate need becomes more productive a greater part of production can be directed towards the need of production itself or the production of means of production in so far as the production of fixed capital even in its physical aspect is directed immediately not towards the production of direct use values or towards the production of values required for the direct reproduction of capitalie those which themselves in turn represent use value in the valuecreation processbut rather towards the production of the means of value creation that is not towards value as an immediate object but rather towards value creation towards the means of realization as an immediate object of productionthe production of value posited physically in the object of production itself as the aim of production the objectification of productive force the value producing power of capitalto that extent it is in the production of fixed capital that capital posits itself as endinitself and appears active as capital to a higher power than it does in the production of circulating capital hence in this respect as well the dimension already possessed by fixed capital which its production occupies within total production is the measuring rod of the development of wealth founded on the mode of production of capital

        the number of workers depends as much on circulating capital as it depends on the quantity of products of coexisting labour which labourers are allowed to consume labour defended p 20

        in all the excerpts cited above from various economists fixed capital is regarded as the part of capital which is locked into the production process floating capital is consumed fixed capital is merely used in the great process of production economist vi 1 this wrong and holds only for the part of circulating capital which is itself consumed by the fixed capital the matieres instrumentales the only thing consumed in the great p rocess of production if this means the immediate production process is fixed capital consumption within the production process is however in fact use wearingout furthermore the greater durability of fixed capital must not be conceived as a purely physical quality the iron and the wood which make up the bed i sleep in or the stones making up the house i live in or the marble statue which decorates a palace are just as durable as iron and wood etc used for machinery but durability is a condition for the instrument the means of production not only on the technical ground that metals etc are the chief material of all machinery but rather because the instrument is destined to play the same role constantly in repeated processes of production its durability as means of production is a required quality of its use value the more often it must be replaced the costlier it is the larger the part of capital which would have to be spent on it uselessly its durability is its existence as means of production its duration is an increase of its productive force with circulating capital by contrast in so far as it is not transformed into fixed capital durability is in no way connected with the act of production itself and is therefore not a conceptually posited moment the fact that among the articles thrown into the consumption fund there are some which are i n turn characterized as fixed capital because they are consumed slowly and can be consumed by many individuals in series is connected with further determinations  renting rather than buying interest etc with which we are not yet here concerned

real savingeconomy  saving of labour time  development of productive force suspension of the contradiction between free time and labour time true conception of the process of social production

         real economysavingconsists of the saving of labour time minimum and minimization of production costs but this saving identical with development of the productive force hence in no way abstinence from consumption but rather the development of power of capabilities of production and hence both of the capabilities as well as the means of consumption the capability to consume is a condition of consumption hence its primary means and this capability is the development of an individual potential a force of production the saving of labour time is 1 equal to an increase of free time ie time for the full development of the individual which in turn reacts back upon the productive power of labour as
itself the greatest productive power from the standpoint of the direct production process it can be regarded as the production of fixed capital this fixed capital being man himself it goes without saying by the way that direct labour time itself cannot remain in the abstract antithesis to free time in which it appears from the perspective of bourgeois economy labour cannot become play as fourier would like3 although it remains his great contribution to have expressed the suspension not of distribution but of the mode of production itself in a higher form as the ultimate object free timewhich is both idle time and time for higher activityhas naturally transformed its possessor into a different subject and he then enters into the direct production process as this different subject this process is then both discipline as regards the human being in the process of becoming and at the same time practice ausübung experimental science materially creative and objectifying science as regards the human being who has become in whose head exists the accumulated knowledge of society for both in so far as labour requires practical use of the hands and free bodily movement as in agriculture at the same time exercise

as the system of bourgeois economy has developed for us only by degrees so too its negation which is its ultimate result we are still concerned now with the direct production process when we consider bourgeois society in the long view and as a whole then the final result of the process of social production always appears as the society itself ie the human being itself in its social relations everything that has a fixed form such as the product etc appears as merely a moment a vanishing moment in this movement the direct production process itself here appears only as a moment the conditions and objectifications of the process are themselves equally moments of it and its only subjects are the individuals but individuals in mutual relationships which they equally reproduce and produce anew the constant process of their own movement in which they renew themselves even as they renew the world of wealth they create 

h the end of capitalism

  

        beyond a certain point the development of the powers of production becomes a barrier for capital hence the capital relation a barrier for the development of the productive powers of labour when it has reached this point capital ie wage labour enters into the same relation towards the development of social wealth and of the forces of production as the guild system serfdom slavery and is necessarily stripped off as a fetter the last form of servitude assumed by human activity that of wage labour on one side capital on the other is thereby cast off like a skin and this castingoff itself is the result of the mode of production corresponding to capital the material and mental conditions of the negation of wage labour and of capital themselves already the negation of earlier forms of unfree social production are themselves results of its production process the growing incompatibility between the productive development of society and its hitherto existing relations of production expresses itself in bitter contradictions crises spasms the violent destruction of capital not by relations external to it but rather as a condition of its selfpreservation is the most striking form in which advice is given it to be gone and to give room to a higher state of social production it is not only the growth of scientific power but the measure in which it is already posited as fixed capital the scope and width in which it is realized and has conquered the totality of production it is likewise the development of the population etc in short of all moments of production in that the productive power of labour like the application of machinery is related to the population whose growth in and for itself already the presupposition as well as the result of the growth of the use values to be reproduced and hence also to be consumed since this decline of profit signifies the same as the decrease of immediate labour relative to the size of the objectified labour which it reproduces and newly posits capital will attempt every means of checking the smallness of the relation of living labour to the size of the capital generally hence also of the surplus value if expressed as profit relative to the presupposed capital by reducing the allotment made to necessary labour and by still more expanding the quantity of surplus labour with regard to the whole labour employed hence the highest development of productive power together with the greatest expansion of existing wealth will coincide with depreciation of capital degradation of the labourer and a most straitened exhaustion of his vital powers these contradictions lead to explosions cataclysms crises in which by momentaneous suspension of labour and annihilation of a great portion of capital the latter is violently reduced to the point where it can go on these contradictions of course lead to explosions crises in which momentary suspension of all labour and annihilation of a great part of the capital violently lead it back to the point where it is enabled to go on fully employing its productive powers without committing suicide4 yet these regularly recurring catastrophes lead to their repetition on a higher scale and finally to its violent overthrow

4 the sentence preceding this one was inserted by marx above the line in english thus the apparent virtual repetition the sentence following also appears in english in the original

  

i capitalism alienation and communism
alienation of the conditions of labour with the development of capital inversion the inversion is the foundation of the capitalist mode of production not only of its distribution

        the fact that in the development of the productive powers of labour the objective conditions of labour objectified labour must grow relative to living labourthis is actually a tautological statement for what else does growing productive power of labour mean than that less immediate labour is required to create a greater product and that therefore social wealth expresses itself more and more in the conditions of labour created by labour itselfthis fact appears from the standpoint of capital not in such a way that one of the moments of social activityobjective labourbecomes the ever more powerful body of the other moment of subjective living labour but ratherand this is important for wage labourthat the objective conditions of labour assume an ever more colossal independence represented by its very extent opposite living labour and that social wealth confront labour in more powerful portions as an alien and dominant power the emphasis comes to be placed not on the state of being objectified but on the state of being alienated dispossessed sold der ton wird gelegt nicht auf das vergegenständlichtsein sondern das entfremdet entässert veräussertsein on the condition that the monstrous objective power which social labour itself erected opposite itself as one of its moments belongs not to the worker but to the personified conditions of production ie to capital to the extent that from the standpoint of capital and wage labour the creation of the objective body of activity happens in antithesis to the immediate labour capacity that this process of objectification in fact appears as a process of dispossession from the standpoint of labour or as appropriation of alien labour from the standpoint of capitalto that extent this twisting and inversion verdrehung und verkehrung is a real phenomenon not a merely supposed one existing merely in the imagination of the workers and the capitalists but obviously this process of inversion is a merely historical necessity a necessity for the development of the forces of production solely from a specific historic point of departure or basis but in no way an absolute necessity of production rather a vanishing one and the result and the inherent purpose of this process is to suspend this basis itself together with this form of the process the bourgeois economists are so much cooped up within the notions belonging to a specific historic stage of social development that the necessity of the objectification of the powers of social labour appears to them as inseparable from the necessity of their alienation visavis living labour but with the suspension of the immediate character of living labour as merely individual or as general merely internally or merely externally with the positing of the activity of individuals as immediately general or social activity the objective moments of production are stripped of this form of alienation they are thereby posited as property as the organic social body within which the individuals reproduce themselves as individuals but as social individuals the conditions which allow them to exist in this way in the reproduction of their life in their productive lifes process have been posited only by the historic economic process itself both the objective and the subjective conditions which are only the two distinct forms of the same conditions

        the workers propertylessness and the ownership of living labour by objectified labour or the appropriation of alien labour by capital both merely expressions of the same relation from opposite poles are fundamental conditions of the bourgeois mode of production in no way accidents irrelevant to it these modes of distribution are the relations of production themselves but sub specie distributionis it is therefore highly absurd when eg j s mill says principles of political economy 2nd ed london 1849 vol i p 240 the laws and conditions of the production of wealth partake of the character of physical truths    it is not so with the distribution of wealth that is a matter of human institutions solely p 239 240 the laws and conditions  of the production of wealth and the laws of the distribution of wealth are the same laws under different forms  and both change undergo the same historic process are as such only moments of a historic process

        it requires no great penetration to grasp that where eg free labour or wage labour arising out of the dissolution of bondage is the point of departure there machines can only arise in antithesis to living labour as property alien to it and as power hostile to it ie that they must confront it as capital  but it is just as easy to perceive that machines will not cease to be agencies of social production when they become eg property of the associated workers in the first case however their distribution ie that they do not belong to the worker is just as much a condition of the mode of production founded on wage labour in the second case the changed distribution would start from a changed foundation of production a new foundation first created by the process of history

capital volume one
karl marx
capital das kapital was marxs magnum opus volume one published in 1867 is the book generally referred to simply as capital and is relatively complete in itself

        the following selections from it together with marxs preface to the first german edition afterword to the second and preface to the french edition are taken from the text of the english edition of 1 887 as translated from the third german edition by samuel moore and edward aveling and edited by engels an attempt has been made here to provide those sections of the book that collectively convey the basic argument and the most characteristic themes in some instances marxs footnotes have been deleted in the interest of saving space


preface to the first german edition

        the work the first volume of which i now submit to the public forms the continuation of my zur kritik der politischen oekonomie a contribution to the critique of political economy published in 1859 the long pa use between the first part and the continuation is due to an illness of many years duration that again and again interrupted my work

        the substance of that earlier work is summarized in the first three chapters of this volume this is done not merely for the sake of connation and completeness the presentation of the subjectmatter is improved as far as circumstances any way permit many points only hinted at in the earlier book are here worked out more fully whilst conversely points worked out fully there are only touched upon in this volume the sections on the history of the theories of value and o f money are now of course left out altogether the reader of the earlier work will find however in the notes to the first chapter additional sources of reference relative to the history of those theories

        that beginning is difficult holds in all sciences to understand the first chapter especially the section that contains the analysis of commodities will therefore present the greatest difficulty that which concerns more especially the analysis of the substance of value and the magnitude of value i have as much as it was possible popularized the valueform whose fully developed shape is the moneyform is very elementary and simple nevertheless the human mind has for more than 2000 years sought in vain to get to the bottom of it whilst on the other hand to the successful analysis of much more composite and complex forms there has been at least an approximation why because the body as an organic whole is easy of study than are the cells of that body in the analysis of economic forms moreover neither microscopes nor chemical reagents are of use the force of abstraction must replace both but in bourgeois society the commodityform of the product of labouror the valueform of the commodityis the economic cellform to the superficial observer the analysis of these forms seems to turn upon minute it does in fact deal with minute but they are of the same order as those dealt with in microscopic anatomy

        with the exception of the section on valueform therefore this volume cannot stand accused on the score of difficulty i presuppose of course a reader who is willing to learn something new and therefore to think for himself

        the physicist either observes physical phenomena where they occur in their most typical form and most free from disturbing influence or wherever possible he makes experiments under conditions that assure the occurrence of the phenomenon in its normality in this work i have to examine the capitalist mode of production and the conditions of production and exchange corresponding to that mode up to the present time their classic ground is england that is the reason why england is used as the chief illustration in the development of my theoretical ideas if however the german reader shrugs his shoulders at the condition of the english industrial and agricultural labourers or in optimist fashion comforts himself with the thought that in germany things are not nearly so bad i must plainly tell him

1 this is the more necessary as even the section of ferdinand lassalles work against schulze delitzsch in which he professes to give “the intellectual quintessence of my explanations on these subjects contains important mistakes if ferdinand lassalle has borrowed almost literally from my writings and without any acknowledgement all the general theoretical propositions in his economic works eg those on the historical character of capital on the connation between the conditions of production and the mode of production c c even to the terminology created by me this may perhaps be due to purposes of propaganda i am here of course not speaking of his detailed working o u t and application of these propositions with which i have nothing to do marx


de te fabula narratur

        intrinsically it is not a question of the higher o r lower degree of development of the social antagonisms that result from the natural law of capitalist production it is a question of these laws themselves of the tendencies working with iron necessity towards inevitable results the country that is more developed industrially only shows to the less developed the image of its own future

        but apart from this where capitalist production is fully naturalized among the germans for instance in the factories proper the condition of things is much worse than in england because the counterpoise of the factory acts is wanting in all other spheres we like all the rest of continental western europe suffer not only from the development of capitalist production but also from the incompleteness of that development alongside of modern evils a whole series of inherited evils oppress us arising from the passive survival of antiquated modes of production with their inevitable train of social and political anachronisms we suffer not only from the living but from the dead le mort saisit le vif

        the social statistics of germany and the rest of continental western europe are in comparison with those of england wretchedly compiled but they raise the veil just enough to let us catch a glimpse of the medusa head behind it we should be appalled at the state of things at home if as in england our governments and parliaments appointed periodically commissions of inquiry into economic conditions if these commissions were armed with the same plenary powers to get at the truth if it was possible to find for this purpose men as competent as free from partisanship and respect of persons as are the english factory inspectors her medical reporters on public health her commissioners of inquiry into the exploitation o f women and children in to housing and food pursues wore a magic cap that the monsters he hunted down might not see him we draw the magic cap down over eyes and ears as makebelieve that there are no monsters

        let us not deceive ourselves on this as in the 18th century the american war of independence sounded the tocsin for the european middleclass so in the 19th century the american civil war sounded it for the european workingclass in england the progress of social disintegration is palpable when it has reached a certain point it must react on the continent there it will take a form more brutal or more humane according to the degree of development of the workingclass itself apart from higher motives therefore their own most important interests dictate to the classes that are for the nonce the ruling ones the removal of all legally removable hindrances to the free development of the workingclass for this reason as well as others i have given so large a space in this volume to the history the details and the results of english factory legislation one nation can and should learn from others and even when a society has got upon the right track for the discovery of the natural laws of its movementand it is the ultimate aim of this work to lay bare the economic law of motion of modern societyit can neither clear by bold leaps nor remove by legal enactments the obstacles offered by the successive phases of its normal development but it can shorten and lessen the birthpangs

        to prevent possible misunderstanding a word i paint the capitalist and the landlord in no sense couleur de rose but here individuals are dealt with only in so far as they are the personifications of economic categories embodiments of particular classrelations and classinterests my standpoint from which the evolution of the economic formation of society is viewed as a process of natural history can less than any other make the individual responsible for relations whose creature he socially remains however much he may subjectively raise himself above them

        in the domain of political economy free scientific inquiry meets not merely the same enemies as in all other domains the peculiar nature of the material it deals with summons as foes into the field of battle the most violent mean and malignant passions of the human breast the furies of private interest the english established church eg will more readily pardon an attack on 38 of its 39 articles than o n 139 of its income nowadays atheism itself is culpa levis as compared with criticism of existing property relations nevertheless there is an unmistakable advance i refer eg to the blue book published within the last few weeks correspondence with her majestys missions abroad regarding industrial questions and trades unions the representatives of the english crown in foreign countries there declare in so many words that in germany in france to be brief in all the civilized states of the european continent a radical change in the existing relations between capital and labour is as evident and inevitable as in england at the same time on the other side of the atlantic ocean mr wade vicepresident of the united states declared in public meetings that after the abolition of salvery a radical change of the relations of capital and of property in land is next upon the order of the day these are signs of the times not to be hidden by purple mantles or black cassocks they do not signify that tomorrow a miracle will happen they show that within the rulingclasses themselves a foreboding is dawning that the present society is no solid crystal but an organism capable of change and is constantly changing

4 marx was inaccurate here although for an easily understandable reason the vice presidency became vacant when vice president andrew johnson succeeded to the presidency upon lincolns assassination in 1865 in 1867 senator benjamin f wade of ohio was elected president pro tem of the senate he thereby became first in line of succession to the presidency during the johnson administration and in this sense was the equivalent o f a vice president although he did not in fact occupy that office r t

        the second volume of this work will treat of the process of the circulation of capital book ii and of the varied forms assumed by capital in the course of its development book iii the third and last volume book iv the history of the theory

        every opinion based on scientific criticism i welcome as to the prejudices of socalled public opinion to which i have never made concessions now as aforetime the maxim of the great florentine is mine

        i applaud your idea of publishing the translation of das kapital as a serial in this form the book will be more accessible to the workingclass a consideration which to me outweighs everything else

        that is the good side of y our suggestion but here is the reverse of the medal the method of analysis which i have employed and which had not previously been applied to economic subjects makes the reading of the first chapters rather arduous and it is to be feared that the french public always impatient to come to a conclusion eager to know the connation between general principles and the immediate questions that have aroused their passions may be disheartened because they will be unable to move on at once

        that is a disadvantage i am powerless to overcome unless it be by forewarning and forearming those readers who zealously seek the truth there is no royal to science and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits

5 follow your own course no matter what people say


believe me
dear citizen
you’re devoted

from the afterword to the second german edition

        that the method employed in das kapital has been little understood is shown by the various conceptions contradictory one to another that have been formed of it

        thus the paris revue positiviste reproaches me in that on the one hand i treat economics metaphysically and on the other handimagineconfine myself to the mere critical analysis of actual facts instead of writing receipts comtist ones  for the cookshops of the future in answer to the reproach in re metaphysics professor sieber has it in so far as it deals with actual theory the method of marx is the deductive method of the whole english school a school whose failings and virtues are common to the best theoretic economists” m biock  les theoriciens du socialismeen allemagne extrait du journal des economistes juillet et aout 1872  makes the discovery that my method is analytic and says par cet ouvrage m marx se classe parmi les esprits analytiques lesplus eminents german reviews of course shriek out at hegelian sophistics the european messenger of st petersburg in an article dealing exclusively with the method of das kapital may number 1872 pp 427436 finds my method of inquiry severely realistic but my method of presentation unfortunately germandialectical it says at first sight if the judgment is based on the external form of the presentation of the subject marx is the most ideal of ideal philosophers always in the german ie the bad sense of the word but in point of fact he is infinitely more realistic than all his forerunners in the work of economic criticism he can in no sense be called an idealist i cannot answer the writer better than by aid of a few extracts from h is own criticism which may interest some of my readers to whom the russian original is inaccessible

6 with this work marx takes his place among the most eminent analytic minds

        after a quotation from the preface to my criticism of political economy berlin 1859 pp ivvi i where i discuss the materialistic basis of my method the writer goes on the one thing which is of moment to marx is to find the law of the phenomena with whose investigation he is concerned and not only is that law of moment to him which governs these phenomena in so far as they have a definite form and mutual connexions within a given historical period of still greater moment to him is the law of their variation of their development ie of their transition from one form into another from one series of connexions into a different one this law once discovered he investigates in detail the effects in which it manifests itself in social life consequently marx only troubles himself about one thing to show by rigid scientific investigation the necessity of successive determinate orders of social conditions and to establish as impartially as possible the facts that serve him for fundamental startingpoints for this it is quite enough if he proves at the same time both the necessity of the present order of things and the necessity of another order into which the first must inevitably pass over and this all the same whether men believe or do not believe it whether they are conscious or unconscious of it marx treats the social movement as a process of natural history governed by laws not only independent of human will consciousness and intelligence but rather on the contrary determining that will consciousness and intelligence     if in the history of civilization the conscious element plays a part so subordinate then it is selfevident that a critical inquiry whose subjectmatter is civilization can less than anything else has for its basis any form of or any result of consciousness that is to say that not the idea but the material phenomenon alone can serve as its startingpoint such an inquiry will confine itself to the confrontation and the comparison of a fact not with ideas but with another fact for this inquiry the one thing of moment is that both facts be investigated as accurately as possible and that they actually form each with respect to the other different moment of an evolution but most important of all is the rigid analysis of the series of success ions of the sequences and concatenations in which the different stages of such an evolution present themselves but it will be said the general laws of economic life are one and the same no matter whether they are applied to the present or the past this marx directly denies according to him such abstract laws do not exist on the contrary in his opinion every historical period has laws of its own     as soon as society has outlived a given period of development and is passing over from one given stage to another it begins to be subject also to other laws in a word economic life offers us a phenomenon analogous to the history of evolution in other branches of biology the old economists misunderstood the nature of economic laws when they likened them to the laws of physics and chemistry a more thorough analysis of phenomena shows that social organisms differ among themselves as fundamentally as plants or animals nay one and the same phenomenon falls under quite different laws in consequence of the different structure of those organisms as a whole of the variations of their individual organs of the different conditions in which those organs function c marx eg denies that the law of population is the same at all times and in all places he asserts on the contrary that every stage of development has its own law of population    with the varying degree of development of productive power social conditions and the laws governing them vary too whilst marx sets himself the task of following and explaining from this point of view the economic system established by the sway of capital he is only formulating in a strictly scientific manner the aim that every accurate investigation into economic life must have the scientific value of such an inquiry lies in the disclosing of the special laws that regulate the origin existence development death of a given social organism and its replacement by another and higher one and it is this value that in point of fact marxs book has

        whilst the writer pictures what he takes to be actually my method in this striking and as far as concerns my own application of it generous way what else is he picturing but the dialectic method

        of course the method of presentation must differ in form from that of inquiry the latter has to appropriate the material in detail to analyze its different forms of development to trace out their inner connexion only after this work is done can the actual movement be adequately described if this is done successfully if the life of the subjectmatter is ideally reflected as in a mirror then it may appear as if we had before us a mere a priori construction

        my dialectic method is not only different from the hegelian but is its direct opposite to hegel the lifeprocess of the human brain ie the process o f thinking which under the name of the idea he even transforms into an independent subject is the demiurges of the real world and the real world is only the external phenomenal form of the idea with me on the contrary the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human minds and translated into forms of thought

        the mystifying side of hegelian dialectic i criticised nearly thirty years ago at a time when it was still the fashion but just as i was working at the first volume of das kapital it was the good pleasure of the peevish arrogant mediocre epigones who now talk large in cultured germany to treat hegel in the same way as the brave moses mendelssohn in lessings time treated spinoza ie as a dead dog i therefore openly avowed myself the pupil of that mighty thinker a n d even here and there in the chapter on the theory of value coquetted with the modes of expression peculiar to him the mystification which dialectic suffers in hegels hands by no means prevents him from being the first to p resent its general form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner with him it is standing on its head it must be turned right side up again if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell

        in its mystified form dialectic became the fashion in germany because it seemed to transfigure and to glorify the existing state of things in its rational form it is a scandal and abomination to bourgeoisdom and its doctrinaire professors because it includes in its comprehension an affirmative recognition of the existing state of things at the same time also the recognition of the negation of that state of its inevitable breaking up because it regards every historically developed social form as in fluid movement and therefore takes into account its transient nature not less than its momentary existence because it lets nothing impose upon it and is in its essence critical and revolutionary

        the contradictions inherent in the movement of capitalist society impress themselves upon the practical bourgeois most strikingly in the changes of the periodic cycle through which modem industry runs and whose crowning point is the universal crisis that crisis is once again approaching although as yet but in its preliminary stage and by the universality of its theatre and the intensity of its action it will drum dialectics even into the heads of the mushroomupstarts of the new holy prussogerman empire

part i commodities and money
chapter i commodities


section 1 the two factors of a commodity usevalue and value the substance of value and the magnitude of value

        the wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails presents itself as an immense accumulation of commodities its unit being a single commodity our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity

        a commodity is in the first place an object outside us a thing that by its properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another the nature of such wants whether for instance they spring from the stomach or from fancy makes no difference neither are we here concerned to know how the object satisfies these wants whether directly as means of subsistence or indirectly as means of production

        every useful thing as iron paper c may be looked at from the two points of view of quality and quantity it is an assemblage of many properties and may therefore be of use in various ways to discover the various uses of things is the work of history so also is the establishment of socially recognized standards of measure for the quantities of these useful objects the diversity of these measures has its origin partly in the diverse nature of the objects to be measured partly in convention

        the utility of a thing makes it a usevalue but this utility is not a thing of air being limited by the physical properties of the commodity it has no existence apart from that commodity a commodity such as iron corn or a diamond is therefore so far as it is a material thing a us evalue something useful this property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities when treating of usevalue we always assume to be dealing with definite quantities such as dozens of watches yards of linen or tons of iron the usevalues of commodities furnish the material for a special study that of the commercial knowledge of commodities usevalues become a reality only by use or consumption they also constitute the substance of all wealth whatever may be the social form of that wealth in the form of society we are about to consider they are in addition the material depositories of exchange value

2 desire implies want it is the appetite of the mind and as natural as hunger to the body    the greatest numbers of things have their value from supplying the wants o f the mind nicholas barbon a discourse concerning coining the new money lighter in answer to mr lockes considerations c london 1696 pp 2 3 marx

3 things have an intrinsick vertue this is barbons special term for value in use which in all places have the same virtue as the loadstone to attract iron i c p 6 the property which the magnet possesses of attracting iron became of use only after by means of that property the polarity of the magnet had been discovered marx

4 the natural worth of anything consists in its fitness to supply the necessities or serve the conveniences of human life john locke some considerations on the consequences of the lowering of interest 1691 in works edit lond 1777 vol ii p 28 in english writers o f the 17th century we frequently find worth in the sense of value in use and value in the sense of exchangevalue this is quite in accordance with the spirit of a language that likes to use a teutonic word for the actual thing and a romance word for its reftexion marx

5 in bourgeois societies the economic fictio juris prevails that every one as a buyer possesses an encyclopaedic knowledge of commodities marx

        exchangevalue at first sight presents itself as a quantitative relation as the proportion in which values in use of one sort are exchanged for those of another sort a relation constantly changing with time and place hence exchangevalue appears to be something accidental and purely relative and consequently an intrinsic value ie an exchangevalue that is inseparably connected with inherent in commodities seems a contradiction in terms  let us consider the matter a little more closely

        a given commodity eg a quarter of wheat is exchanged for x blacking y silk or z gold cin short for other commodities in the most different proportions instead of one exchangevalue the wheat has therefore a great many but since x blacking y silk or z gold c each represent the exchangevalue of one quarter of wheat x blacking y silk z gold c must as exchangevalues be replaceable by each other or equal to each other therefore first the valid exchangevalues of a given commodity express something equal secondly exchangevalue generally is only the mode of expression the phenomenal form of something contained in it yet distinguishable from it

        let us take two commodities eg corn and iron the proportions in which they are exchangeable whatever those proportions may be can always b e represented by an equation in which a given quantity of corn is equated to some quantity of iron eg i quarter corn  x cwt iron what does this equation tell us it tells us that in two different thingsin i quarter of corn and x cwt of iron there exists in equal quantities something common to both the two things must therefore be equal to a third which in itself is neither the one nor the other each of them so far as it is exchange value must therefore be reducible to this third

        a simple geometrical illustration will make this clear in order to calculate and compare the areas of rectilinear figures we decompose them into triangles but the area of the triangle itself is expressed by something totally different from its visible figure namely by half the product of the base into the altitude in the same way the exchangevalues of commodities must be capable of being expressed in terms of something common to them all of which thing they represent a greater or less quantity

7 nothing can have an intrinsic value n barbon 1 c p 6 or as butler says
the value of a thing is just as much as it will bring marx

        this common something cannot be either a geometrical a chemical or any other natural property of commodities such properties claim our attention only in so far as they affect the utility of those commodities make them usevalues but the exchange of commodities is evidently an act characterised by a total abstraction from usevalue then one usevalue is just as good as another provided only it be present in sufficient quantity or as old barbon says one sort of wares is as good as another if the values be equal there is no difference or distinction in things of equal value    an hundred pounds worth of lead or iron is of as great value as one hundred pounds worth of silver or gold as usevalues commodities are above all of different qualities but as exchangevalues they are merely different quantities and consequently do not contain an atom of usevalue

        if then we leave out of consideration the usevalue of commodities they have only one common property left that of being products of labour but even the product of labour itself has undergone a change in our hands if we make abstraction from its usevalue we make abstraction at the same time from the material elements and shapes that make the product a usevalue we see in it no longer a table a house yarn or any other useful thing its existence as a material thing is put out of sight neither can it any longer be regarded as the product of the labour of the joiner the mason the spinner or of any other definite kind of productive labour along with the useful qualities of the products themselves we put out of sight both the useful character of the various kinds of labour embodied in them and the concrete forms of that labour there is nothing left but what is common to them all all are reduced to one and the same sort of labour human labour in the abstract

        let us now consider the residue of each of these products it consists of the same unsubstantial reality in each a mere congelation of homogeneous human labour of labourpower expended without regard to the mode of its expenditure all that these things now tell us is that human labourpower has been expended in their production that human labour is embodied in them when looked at as crystals of this social substance common to them all they arevalues

        we have seen that when commodities are exchanged their exchange value manifests itself as something totally independent of their usevalue but if we abstract from their usevalue there remains their value as defined above therefore the common substance that manifests itself in the exchangevalue of commodities whenever they are exchanged is their value the progress of our investigation will show that exchangevalue is the only form in which the value of commodities can manifest itself or be expressed for the present however we have to consider the nature of value independently of this its form

        a usevalue or useful article therefore has value only because human labour in the abstract has been embodied or materialised in it how then is the magnitude of this value to be measured painly by the quantity of the valuecreating substance the labour contained in the article the quantity of labour however is measured by its duration and labourtime in its turn finds its standard in weeks days and hours

        some people might think that if the value of a commodity is determined by the quantity of labour spent on it the more idle and unskillful the labourer the more valuable would his commodity be because more time would be required in its production the labour however that forms the substance of value is homogeneous human labour expenditure of one uniform labourpower the total labourpower of society which is embodied in the sum total of the values of all commodities produced by that society counts here as one homogeneous mass of human labourpower composed though it be of innumerable individual units each of these units is the same as any other so far as it has the character of the average labourpower of society and takes effect as such that is so far as it requires for producing a commodity no more time than is needed on an average no more than is socially necessary the labourtime socially necessary is that required to produce a n article under the normal condition s of production and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time the introduction of powerlooms into england probably reduced by onehalf the labour required to weave a given quantity of yarn into cloth the handloom weavers as a matter of fact continued to require the same time as before but for all that the product o f one hour of their labour represented after the change only half an hours social labour and consequently fell to oneh al f its former value

        we see then tha t that which determines the magnitude of the value of any article is the amount of labour socially necessary or the labourtime socially necessary for its production each individual commodity in this connexion is to be considered as an average sample of its class commodities therefore in which equal quantities of labour are embodied or which can be produced in the same time have the same value the value of one commodity is to the value of any other as the labourtime necessary for the production of the one is to that necessary for the production of the other

as values all commodities are only definite masses of congealed
labourtime

        the value of a commodity would therefore remain constant if the labourtime required for its production also remained constant but the latter changes with every variation in the productiveness of labour this productiveness is determined by various circumstances amongst others by the average amount of skill of the workmen the state of science and the degree of its practical application the social organisation of production the extent and capabilities of the means of production and by physical conditions for example the same amount of labour infavourable seasons is embodied in bushels of corn and in unfavourable only in four the same labour extracts from rich mines more metal than from poor mines diamonds are of very rare occurrence on the earths surface and hence their discovery costs on an average a great deal of labourtime consequently much labour is represented in a small compass jacob doubts whether gold has ever been paid for at its full value this applies still more to diamonds according to eschwege the total produce of the brazilian diamond mines for the eighty years ending in 1823 had not realised the price of oneandahalf years average produce of the sugar and coffee plantations of the same country although the diamonds cost much more labour and therefore represented more value with richer mines the same quantity of labour would embody itself in more diamonds and their value would fall if we could succeed at a small expenditure of labour in converting carbon into diamonds their value might fall below that of bricks in general the greater the productiveness of labour the less is the labourtime required for the production of an article the less is the amount of labour crystallised in that article and the less is its value and vice versa the less the productiveness of labour the greater is the labourtime required for the production of an article and the greater is its value the value of a commodity therefore varies directly as the quantity and inversely as the productiveness of the labour incorporated in it

        a thing ca n be a usevalue without having value this is the case whenever it’s utility to man is not due to labour such are air virgin soil natural meadows c a thing can be useful and the product of human labour without being a commodity whoever directly satisfies his wants with the produce of his own labour creates indeed usevalues but no commodities in order to produce the latter he must not only produce usevalues but usevalues for others social usevalues and not only for others without more the medireval had peasant produced quitrentcom for his feudal lord and tithecorn for his parson but neither the quitrentcorn nor the tithecorn became commodities by reason of the fact that they had been produced for others to become a commodity a product must be transferred to another whom it will serve as a usevalue by means of an exchange lastly nothing can have value without being an object of utility if the thing is useless so is the labour contained in it the labour does not count as labour and therefore creates no value


section 2 the twofold character of the labour embodied in commodities

        at first sight a commodity presented itself to us as a complex of two thingsusevalue and exchangevalue later on we saw also that labour too possesses the same twofold nature for so far as it finds expression in value it does not possess the same characteristics that belong to it as a creator of usevalues i was the first to point out and to examine critically this twofold nature of the labour contained in commodities as this point is the pivot on which a clear comprehension of political economy turns we must go more into detail

        let us take two commodities such as a coat and 10 yards of linen and let the former be double the value of the latter so that if 10 yards of linen  w the coat  2w

        the coat is a usevalue that satisfies a particular want its existence is the result of a special sort of productive activity the nature of which is determined by its aim mode of operation subject means and result the labour whose utility is thus represented by the value in use of its product or which manifests itself by making its product a usevalue we call useful labour in this connexion we consider only its useful effect

        as the coat and the linen are two qualitatively different usevalues so also are the two forms of labour that produce them tailoring and weaving were these two objects not qualitatively differrent not produced respectively by labour of different quality they could not stand to each other in the relation of commodities coats are not exchanged for coats one usevalue is not exchanged for another of the same kind

        to all the different varieties of values in use there correspond as many different kinds of useful labour classified according to the order genus species and variety to which they belong in the social division of labour this division of labour is a necessary condition for the production of commodities but it does not follow conversely that the production of commodities is a necessary condition for the division of labour in the primitive indian community there is social division of labour without production of commodities or to take an example nearer home in every factory the labour is divided according to a system but this division is not brought about by the operatives mutually exchanging their individual products only such products can become commodities with regard to each other as result from different kinds of labour each kind being carried on independently and for the account of private individuals

1 i am inserting the parenthesis because its omission has often given rise to the misunderstanding that every product that is consumed by some one other than its producer is considered in marx a commodity engels 4th german edition

        to resume then in the usevalue of each commodity there is contained useful labour ie productive activity of a definite kind and exercised with a definite aim usevalues cannot confront each other as commodities unless the useful labour embodied in them is qualitatively different in each of them in a community the produce of which in general takes the form of commodities ie in a community of commodity producers this qualitative difference between the useful forms of labour that are carried on independently by individual producers each on their own account develops into a complex system a social division of labour

        anyhow whether the coat be worn by the tailor or by his customer in either case it operates as a usevalue nor is the relation between the coat and the labour that produced it altered by the circumstance that tailoring may have become a special trade an independent branch of the social division of labour wherever the want of clothing forced them to it the human race made clothes for thousands of years without a single man becoming a tailor but coats and linen like every other element of material wealth that is not the spontaneous produce of nature must invariably owe their existence to a special productive activity exercised with a definite aim an activity that appropriates particular naturegiven materials to particular human wants so far therefore as labour is a creator of usevalue is useful labour it is a necessary condition independent of all forms of society for the existence of the human race it is an eternal natureimposed necessity without which there can be no material exchanges between man and nature and therefore no life

        the usevalues coat linen c ie the bodies of commodities are combinations of two elementsmatter and labour if we take away the useful labour expended upon them a material substratum is always left which is furnished by nature without the help of man the latter can work only as nature does that is by changing the form of matter nay more in this work of changing the form he is constantly helped by natural forces we see then that labour is not the only source of material wealth of usevalues produced by labour as william petty puts it labour is its father and the earth its mother

        let us now pass from the commodity considered as a usevalue to the value of commodities

        by our assumption the coat is worth twice as much as the linen but this is a mere quantitative difference which for the present does not concern us we bear in mind however that if the value of the coat is double that of 10 yds of linen 20 yds of linen must have the same value as one coat so far as they are values the coat and the linen are things of a like substance objective expressions of essentially identical labour but tailoring and weaving are qualitatively different kinds of labour there are however states of society in which one and the same man does tailoring and weaving alternately in which case these two forms of labour are mere modifications of the labour of the same individual and no special and fixed functions of different persons just as the coat which our tailor makes one day and the trousers which he makes another day imply only a variation in the labour of one and the same individual moreover we see at a glance that in our capitalist society a given portion of human labour is in accordance with the varying demand at one time supplied in the form of tailoring at another in the form of weaving this change may possibly not take place without friction but take place it must

        productive activity if we leave out of sight its special form viz the useful character of the labour is nothing but the expenditure of human labourpower tailoring and weaving though qualitatively different productive activities are each a productive expenditure of human brains nerves and muscles and in this sense are human labour they are but two different modes of expending human labourpower of course this labourpower which remains the same under all its modifications must have attained a certain pitch of development before it can be expended in a multiplicity of modes but the value of a commodity represents human labour in the abstract the expenditure of human labour in general and just as in society a general or a banker plays a great part but mere man on the other hand a very shabby part2 so here with human labour it is the expenditure of simple labourpower ie of the labourpower which on an average apart from any special development exists in the organism of every ordinary individual simple average labour it is true varies in character in different countries and at different times but in a particular society it is given skilled labour counts only as simple labour intensified or rather as multiplied simple labour a given quantity of skilled being considered equal to a greater quantity of simple labour experience shows that this reduction is constantly being made a commodity may be the product of the most skilled labour but its value by equating it to the product of simple unskilled labour represents a definite quantity of the latter labour alone the different proportions in which different sorts of labour are reduced to unskilled labour as their standard are established by a social process that goes on behind the backs of the producers and consequently appear to be fixed by custom for simplicitys sake we shall henceforth account every kind of labour to be unskilled simple labour by this we do no more than save ourselves the trouble of making the reduction

2 compo  hegel philosophie des rechts berlin 1 840 p 250 § 190 marx

        just as therefore in viewing the coat and linen as values we abstract from their different usevalues so it is with the labour represented by those values we disregard the difference between its useful forms weaving and tailoring as the usevalues coat and linen are combinations of special productive activities with cloth and yarn while the values coat and linen are on the other hand mere homogeneous congelations of undifferentiated labour so the labour embodied in these latter values does not count by virtue of its productive relation to cloth and yarn but only as being expenditure of human labourpower tailoring and weaving are necessary factors in the creation of the usevalues coat and linen precisely because these two kinds of labour are of different qualities but only in so far as abstraction is made from their special qualities only in so far as both possess the same quality of being human labour do tailoring and weaving form the substance of the values of the same article

        coats and linen however are not merely values but values of definite magnitude and according to our assumption the coat is worth twice as much as the ten yards of linen whence this difference in their values it is owing to the fact that the linen contains only half as much labour as the coat and consequently that in the production of the latter labourpower must have been expended during twice the time necessary for the production of the former

        while therefore with reference to usevalue the labour contained in a commodity counts only qualitatively with reference to value it counts only quantitatively and must first be reduced to human labour pure and simple in the former case it is a question of how and what in the latter of how much how long a time since the magnitude of the value of a commodity represents only the quantity of labour embodied in it it follows that all commodities when taken in certain proportions must be equal in value

        if the productive power of all the different sorts of useful labour required for the production of a coat remains unchanged the sumof the values of the coats produced increases with their number if one coat represents x days labour two coats represent 2 x days labour and so on but assume that the duration of the labour necessary for the production of a coat becomes doubled or halved in the first case one coat is worth as much as two coats were before in the second case two coats are only worth as much as one was before although in both cases one coat renders the same service as before and the useful labour embodied in it remains of the same quality but the quantity of labour spent on its production has altered

3 the reader must note that we are not speaking here of the wages or value that the labourer gets f or a given labourtime but of the value of the commodity in which that labourtime is materialised wages is a category that as yet has no existence at the present stage of our investigation marx

        an increase in the quantity of usevalues is an increase of material wealth with two coats two men can be clothed with one coat only one man nevertheless an increased quantity of material wealth may correspond to a simultaneous fall in the magnitude of its value this antagonistic movement has its origin in the twofold character of labour productive power has reference of course only to labour of some useful concrete form the efficacy of any special productive activity during a given time being dependent on its productiveness useful labour becomes therefore a more or less abundant source of products in proportion to the rise or fall o f its productiveness on the other hand no change in this productiveness affects the labour represented by value since productive power is an attribute of the concrete useful forms of labour of course it can no longer have any bearing on that labour as soon as we make abstraction from those concrete useful forms however then productive power may vary the same labour exercised during equal periods of time always yields equal amounts o f value but it will yield during equal periods of time different quantities of values in use more if the productive power rise fewer if it fall the same change in productive power which increases the fruitfulness of labour and in consequence the quantity of usevalues produced by that labour will diminish the total value of this increased quality of usevalues provided such change shorten the total labourtime necessary for their production and vice versa

        on the one hand all labour is speaking physioiogically an expenditure o f human labourpower and in its character of identical abstract human labour it creates and forms the value of commodities on the other hand all labour is the expenditure of human labourpower in a special form and with a definite aim and in this its character of concrete useful labour it produces use values


section 3 the form of value or exchangevalue

        commodities come into the world in the shape of usevalues articles or goods such as iron linen corn c this is their plain homely bodily form they are however commodities only because they are something twofold both objects of utility and at the same time depositories of value they manifest themselves therefore as commodities or have the form of commodities only in so far as they have two forms a physical or natural form and a value form

        the reality of the value of commodities differs in this respect from dame quickly that we dont know where to have it the value of commodities is the very opposite of the coarse materiality of their substance not an atom of matter enters into its composition turn and examine a single commodity by itself as we will vet in so far as it remains an object of value it seems impossible to grasp it if however we bear in mind that the value of commodities has a purely social reality and that they acquire this reality only in so far as they are expressions or embodiments of one identical social substance viz human labour it follows as a matter of course that value can only manifest itself in the social relation of commodity to commodity in fact we started from exchangevalue or the exchange relation of commodities in order to get at the value that lies hidden behind it we must now return to this –form under which value first appeared to us

        every one knows if he knows nothing else that commodities have a valueform common to them all and presenting a marked contrast with the varied bodily forms of their usevalues i mean their moneyform here however a task is set us the performance of which has never yet even been attempted by bourgeois economy the task of tracing the genesis of this moneyform of developing the expression of value implied in the valuerelation of commodities from its simplest almost imperceptible outline to the dazzling moneyform b y doing this we shall a t the same time solves the riddle presented by money

        the simplest valuerelation is evidently that of one commodity to some one other commodity of a different kind hence the relation between the values of two commodities supplies us with the simplest expression of the value of a single commodity


a elementary or accidental form of value

x commodity a  y commodity b or
x commodity a is worth y commodity b
20 yards o f linen  1 coat or
20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat


1 the two poles of the expression of value relative form and equivalent form

        the whole mystery of the form of value lies hidden in this elementary form its analysis therefore is our real difficulty

        here two different kinds of commodities in our example the linen and the coat evidently play two different parts the linen expresses its value in the coat the coat serves as the material in which that value is expressed the former plays an active the latter a passive part the value of the linen is represented as relative value or appears in relative form the coat officiates as equivalent or appears in equivalent form

        the relative form and the equivalent form are two intimately connected mutually dependent and inseparable elements of the expression of value but at the same time are mutually exclusive antagonistic extremesie poles of the same expression they are allotted respectively to the two different commodities brought into relation by that expression it is not possible to express the value of linen in linen 20 yards of linen  20 yards of linen is no expression of value on the contrary such an equation merely says that 20 yards of linen are nothing else than 20 yards of linen a definite quantity of the usevalue linen the value of the linen can therefore be expressed only relativelyie in some other commodity the relative form of the value of the linen presupposes therefore the presence of some other commodityhere the coatunder the form of an equivalent on the other hand the commodity that figures as the equivalent cannot at the same time assume the relative form that second commodity is not the one whose value is expressed its function is merely to serve as the material in which the value of the first commodity is expressed


        no doubt the expression 20 yards of linen  1 coat or 20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat implies the opposite relation 1 coat  20 yards of linen or 1 coat is worth 20 yards of linen but in that case i must reverse the equation in order to express the value of the coat relatively and so soon as i do that the linen becomes the equivalent instead of the coat a single commodity cannot therefore simultaneously assume in the same expression o f value both forms the very polarity of these forms makes them mutually exclusive

        whether then a commodity assumes the relative form or the opposite equivalent form depends entirely upon its accidental position in the expression of valuethat is upon whether it is the commodity whose value is being expressed or the commodity in which value is being expressed


2 the relative form of value

a the nature and import of this form

        in order to discover how the elementary expression of the value of a commodity lies hidden in the valuerelation of two commodities we must in the first place consider the latter entirely apart from its quantitative aspect the usual mode of procedure is generally the reverse and in the valuerelation nothing is seen but the proportion between definite quantities of two different sorts of commodities that are considered equal to each other it is apt to be forgotten that the magnitudes of different things can be compared quantitatively only when those magnitudes are expressed in terms of the same unit it is only as expressions of such a unit that they are of the same denomination and therefore commensurable

        whether 20 yards of linen  1 coat or  20 coats o r  x coatsthat is whether a given quantity of linen is worth few or in any coats every such statement implies that the linen and coats as magnitudes of value are expressions o f the same unit things of the same kind linen  coat is the basis of the equation

        but the two commodities whose identity of quality is thus assumed do not play the same part it is only the value of the linen that is expressed and how by its reference to the coat as its equivalent as something that can be exchanged for it in this relation the coat is the mode of existence of value is value embodied for only as such is it the same as the linen on the other hand the linens own value comes to the front receives independent expression for it is only as being value that it is comparable with the coat as a thing of equal value or exchangeable with the coat to borrow an illustration from chemistry butyric acid is a different substance from propyl formate yet both are made up of the same chemical substances carbon c hydrogen h and oxygen 0 and that too in like proportionsnamely c4h8o2 if now we equate butyric a cid to propyl formate then in the first place propyl formate would be in this relation merely a form of existence of c4h8o2 and in the second place we should be stating that butyric acid also consists of c4h8o2 therefore by thus equating the two substances expression would be given to their chemical composition while their different physical forms would be neglected

        if we say that as values commodities are mere congelations of human labour we reduce them by our analysis it is true to the abstraction value but we ascribe to this value no form apart from their bodily form it is otherwise in the valuerelation of one commodity to another here the one stands forth in its character of value by reason o f its relation to the other

        by making the coat the equivalent of the linen we equate the labour embodied in the former to that in the latter now it is hue that the tailoring which makes the coat is concrete labour of a different sort from the weaving which makes the linen but the act of equating it to the weaving reduces the tailoring to that which i s really equal in the two kinds of labour to their common character of human labour in this roundabout way then the fact is expressed that weaving also in so far as it weaves value has nothing to distinguish it from tailoring and consequently is abstract human labour it is the expression of equivalence between different sorts of commodities that alone brings into relief the specific character of valuecreating labour and this it does by actually reducing the different varieties of labour embodied in the different kinds of commodities to their common quality of human labour in the abstract

        there is however something else required beyond the expression of the specific character of the labour of which the value of the linen consists human labourpower in motion or human labour creates value but is not itself value it becomes value only in its congealed state when embodied in the form of some object in order to express the value of the linen as a congelation of human labour that value must be expressed as having objective existence as being a something materially different from the linen itself and yet a something common to the linen and all other commodities the problem is already solved

        when occupying the position of equivalent in the equation of value the coat ranks qualitatively as the equal of the linen as something of the same kind because it is value in this position it is a thing in which we see nothing but value or whose palpable bodily form represents value yet the coat itself the body of the commodity coat is a mere usevalue a coat as such no more tells us it is value than does the first piece of linen we take hold of this shows that when placed in valuerelation to the linen t h e coat signifies more than when out of that relation jus t as many a man strutting about in a gorgeous uniform counts for more than when in mufti

        in the production of the coat human labourpower in the shape of tailoring must have been actually expended human labour is therefore accumulated in it in this aspect the coat is a depository of value but though worn to a thread it does not let this fact show through and as equivalent of the linen in the value equation it exists under this aspect alone counts therefore as embodied value as a body that is value a for instance cannot be your majesty to b unless at the same time majesty in bs eyes assumes the bodily form of a and what is more with every new father of the people changes its features hair and many other things besides

4 the celebrated franklin one of the first economists after wm petty who saw through the nature of value says trade in general being nothing else but the exchange of labour for labour the value of all things is    most justly measured by labour the works of b franklin c edited by sparks boston 1836 vol ii p 267 franklin is unconscious that by estimating the value of everything in labour he makes abstraction from any difference in the sorts of labour exchanged and thus reduced them all too equal human labour but although ignorant of this yet he says it he speaks first of the one labour then of• the other labour and finally of labour without further qualification as the substance of the value of everything marx

        hence in the value equation in which the coat is the equivalent of the linen the coat officiates as the form of value the value of the commodity linen is expressed by the bodily form of the commodity coat the value of one by the usevalue of the other as a usevalue the linen is something palpably different from the coat as value it is the same as the coat and now has the appearance of a coat thus the linen acquires a valueform different from its physical form the fact that it is value is made manifest by its equality with the coat just as the sheeps nature of a christian is shown in his resemblance to the lamb of god

        we see then all that our analysis o f the value o f commodities has already told us is told us by the linen itself so soon as it comes into communication with another commodity the coat only it betrays its thoughts in that language with which alone it is familiar the language of commodities in order to tell us that its own value is created by labour in its abstract character of human labour it says that the coat in so far as it is worth as much as the linen and therefore is value consists of the same labour as the linen in order to inform us that its sublime reality as value is not the same as its buckram body it says that value has the appearance of a coat and consequently that so far as the linen is value it and the coat are as like as two peas we may here remark that the language of commodities has besides hebrew many other more or less correct dialects the german wertsein to be worth for instance expresses in a less striking manner than the romance verbs valere valer valoir that the equating of commodity b to commodity a is commodity as own mode of expressing its value paris vaut bien une messe

        by means therefore of the valuerelation expressed in our equation the bodily form of commodity b becomes the valueform of commodity a or the body of commodity b acts as a mirror to the value of commodity a by putting itself in relation with commodity b as value in propria persona as the matter of which human labour is made up the commodity a converts the value in use b into the substance in which to express its as own value the value of a thus expressed in the usevalue of b has taken the form of relative value


        5 in a sort of way it is with man as with commodities since he comes into the world neither with a looking glass in his hand nor as a fichtian philosopher to whom i am i” is sufficient man first sees and recognizes himself in other men peter only establishes his own identity as a man by first comparing himself with paul as being of like kind and thereby paul just as he stands in his pauline personality becomes to peter the type of the genus homo marx


b quantitative determination of relative value

        every commodity whose value it is intended to express is a useful object of given quantity as 15 bushels of corn or 100 lbs of coffee and a given quantity of any commodity contains a definite quantity of human labour the valueform must therefore not only express value generally but also value in definite quantity therefore in the valuerelation of commodity a to commodity b of the linen to the coat not only is the latter as value in general made the equal in quality of the linen but a definite quantity of coat 1 coat is made the equivalent of a definite quantity 20 yards of linen

        the equation 20 yards of linenl coat or 20 yards of linen are worth one coat implies that the same quantity of valuesubstance congealed labour is embodied in both that the two commodities have each cost the same a mount of labour of the same quantity of labourtime but the labourtime necessary for the production of 20 yards of linen or 1 coat varies with every change in the productiveness of weaving or tailoring we have now to consider the influence of such changes on the quantitative aspect of the relative expression of value

        i let the value of the linen vary that of the coat remaining constant if say in consequence of the exhaustion of flaxgrowing soil the labourtime necessary for the production of the linen be doubled the value of the linen will also be doubled instead of the equation 20 yards of linen 1 coat we should have 20 yards of linen2 coats since 1 coat would now contain only half the labourtime embodied in 20 yards of linen if on the other hand in consequence say of improved looms this labourtime be reduced by onehalf the value of the linen would fall by onehalf consequently we should have 20 yards of linenyz coat the relative value of commodity a ie its value expressed in commodity b rises and falls directly as the value of a the value of b being supposed constant

        ii let the value of the linen remain constant while the value of the coat varies if under these circumstances in consequence for instance of a poor crop of wool the labourtime necessary for the production of a coat becomes doubled we have instead of 20 yards of linen 1 coat 20 yards o f linen yz coat i f on the other hand the value o f the coat sinks by onehalf then 20 yards of linen2 coats hence if the value of commodity a remains constant its relative value expressed in commodity b rises and falls inversely as the value of b

6 value is here as occasionally in the preceding pages used in sense of value determined as to quantity or of value marx

        if we compare the different cases in i and ii we see that the same change of magnitude in relative value may arise from totally opposite causes thus the equation 20 yards of linenl coat becomes 20 yards of linen 2 coats either because the value of the linen has doubled or because the value of the coat has fallen by onehalf and it becomes 20 yards of lineny2 coat either because the value of the linen has fallen by onehalf or because the value of the coat has doubled

        iii let the quantities of labourtime respectively necessary for the production of the linen and the coat vary simultaneously in the same direction and in the same proportion in this case 20 yards of linen continue equal to 1 coat however much their values may have altered their change of value is seen as soon as they are compared with a third commodity whose value has remained constant if the values o f all commodities rose or fell simultaneously and in the same proportion their relative values would remain unaltered their real change of value would appear from the diminished or increased quantity of commodities produced in a given time

        iv the labourtime respectively necessary for the production of the linen and the coat and therefore the value o f these commodities may simultaneously vary in the same direction but a t unequal rates or in opposite directions or in other ways the effect of all these possible different variations on the relative value of a commodity may be deduced from the results of i ii and iii thus real changes in the magnitude of value are neither unequivocally nor exhaustively reflected in their relative expression that is in the equation expressing the magnitude o f relative value the relative value of a commodity may vary although its value remains constant its relative value may remain constant although its value varies and finally simultaneous variations in the magnitude of value and in that of its relative expression by no means necessarily correspond in amount   


section 4 the fetishism of commodities and
the secret thereof

        a commodity appears at first sight a very trivial thing and easily understood its analysis shows that it is in reality a very queer thing abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties so far as it is a value in use there is nothing mysterious about it whether we consider it from the point of view that by its properties it is capable of satisfying human wants or from the point that those properties are the product of human labour it is as clear as noonday that man by his industry changes the forms of the materials furnished by nature in such a way as to make them useful to him the form of wood for instance is altered by making a table out of it yet for all that the table continues to be that common everyday thing wood but as soon as it steps forth as a commodity it is changed into something transcendent it not only stands with its feet on the ground but in relation to all other commodities it stands on its head and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas far more wonderful than tableturning ever was

        the mystical character of commodities does not originate therefore in their usevalue just as little does it proceed from the nature of the determining factors of value for in the first place however varied the useful kinds of labour or productive activities may be it is a physiological fact that they are functions o f the human organism and that each such function whatever may be its nature or form is essentially the expenditure of human brain nerves muscles c secondly with regard to that which forms the groundwork for the quantitative determination of value namely the duration of that expenditure or the quantity of labour it is quite clear that there is a palpable difference between its quantity and quality in all states of society the labourtime that it costs to produce the means of subsistence must necessarily b e an object of interest to mankind though not of equal interest in different stages of development and lastly from the moment that men in any way work for one another their labour assumes a social form

        whence then arises the enigmatical character of the product of labour as soon as it assumes the form of commodities clearly from this form itself the equality of all sorts of human labour is expressed objectively by their products all being equally values the measure of the expenditure of labourpower by the duration o f that expenditure takes the form o f the quantity of value o f the products of labour and finally the mutual relations of the producers with in which the social character of their labour affirms itself take the form of a social relation between the products

        a commodity is therefore a mysterious thing simply because in it the social character of mens labour appears to t h e m as an objective character stamped upon the product of that labour because the relation of the producers to the sum total of their own labour is presented to them as a social relation existing not between themselves but between the products of their labour this is the reason why the products of labour become commodities social things whose qualities are at the same time perceptible and imperceptible by the senses in the same way the light from an object is perceived by us not as the subjective excitation of our optic nerve but as the objective form of something outside the eye itself but in the act of seeing there is at all events an actual passage of light from one thing to another from the external object to the eye there is a physical relation between physical things but it is different with commodities there the existence of the things qua commodities and the valuerelation between the products of labour which stamps them as commodities has absolutely no connexion with their physical properties and with the material relations arising therefore there it is a definite social relation between men that assumes in their eyes the fantastic form of a relation between things in order therefore to find an analogy we must have recourse to the mistenveloped regions of the religious world in that world the productions of the human brain appear as independent beings endowed with life and entering into relation both with one another and the human race so it is in the world of commodities with the products of mens hands this i call the fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labour as soon as they are produced as commodities and which is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities

        this fetishism of commodities has its origin as the foregoing analysis has already shown in the peculiar social character of the labour that produces them

        as a general rule articles of utility become commodities only because they are products of the labour of private individuals or groups of individuals who carry on their work independently of each other the sum total of the labour of all these private individuals forms the aggregate labour of society since the producers do not come into social contact with each other until they exchange their products the specific social character of each producers labour does not show itself except in the act of exchange i n other words the labour of the individual asserts itself as a part of the labour of society only by means of the relations which the act of exchange establishes directly between the products and indirectly through them between the producers to the latter therefore the relations connecting the labour of one individual with that of the rest appear not as direct social relations between individuals at work but as what they really are material relations between persons and social relations between things it is only by being exchanged that the products of labour acquire as values one uniform social status distinct from their varied forms of existence as objects of utility this division of a product into a useful thing and a value becomes practically important only when exchange has acquired such an extension that useful articles are produced for the purpose of being exchanged and their character as values has therefore to be taken into account before hand during production from this moment the labour of the individual producer acquires socially a twofold character on the one hand it must as a definite useful kind of labour satisfy a definite social want and thus hold its p lace as part and parcel of the collective labour of all as a branch of a social division of labour that has sprung up spontaneously on the other hand it can satisfy the manifold wants of the individual producer himself only in so far as the mutual exchangeability of all kinds of useful private labour is an established social fact and therefore the private useful labour of each producer ranks on equality with that of all others the equalisation of the most different kinds of labour can be the result only of an abstraction from their inequalities or of reducing them to their common denominator viz and expenditure of human labourpower or human labour in the abstract the twofold social character of the labour of the individual appears to him when reflected in his brain only under those forms which are impressed upon that labour in everyday practice by the exchange of products in this way the character that his own labour possesses of being socially useful takes the form of the condition that the product must be not only useful but useful for others and the social character that his particular labour has o f being the equal of an other particular kinds of labour takes the form that an the physically different articles that are the products of labour have one common quality viz that of having value

        hence when we bring the products of our labour into relation with each other as values it is not because we see in these articles the material receptacles of homogeneous human labour quite the contrary whenever by an exchange we equate as values our different products by that very act we also equate as human labour the different kinds of labour expended upon them we are not aware of this nevertheless we do it value therefore does not stalk about with a label describing what it is it is value rather that converts every product into a social hieroglyphic later on we try to decipher the hieroglyphic to get behind the secret of our own social products for to stamp an object of utility as a value is just as much a social product as language the recent scientific discovery that the products of labour so far as they are values are but material expressions of the human labour spent in their production marks indeed an epoch in the history o f the development of the human race but by no means dissipates the mist through which the social character of labour appears to us to be an objective character of the products themselves the fact that in the particular form of production with which we are dealing viz the production of commodities the specific social character of private labour carried on independently consists in the equality of every kind of that labour by virtue of its being human labour which character therefore assumes in the product the form of valuethis fact appears to the producers notwithstanding the discovery above referred to to be just as real and final as the fact that after the discovery by science of the component gases of air the atmosphere itself remainerl unaltered

        what first of all practically concerns producers when they make an exchange is the question how much of some other product they get for their own in what proportions the products are exchangeable when these proportions have b y custom attained a certain stability they appear to result from the nature of the products so that for instance one ton of iron and two ounces of gold appear as naturally to be of equal value as a pound of gold and a pound of iron in spite of their different physical and chemical qualities appear to be of equal weight the character of having value when once impressed upon products obtains fixity only by reason of their acting and reacting upon each other as quantities of value these quantities vary continually independently of the will foresight and action of the producers to them their own social action takes the form of the action of objects which rule the producers instead of being ruled by the it requires a fully developed production of commodities before from accumulated experience alone the scientific conviction springs up that all the different kinds of private labour which are carried on independently of each other and yet as spontaneously developed branches of the social division of labour are continually being reduced to the quantitative proportions in which society requires them and why because in the midst of all the accidental and ever fluctuating exchangerelations between the products the labourtime socially necessary for their production forcibly asserts itself like an overriding law of nature the law of gravity thus asserts itself when a house falls about our ears the determination of the magnitude of value by labourtime is therefore a secret hidden under the apparent fluctuations in the relative values of commodities its discovery while removing all appearance of mere accidentality from the determination of the magnitude of the values of products yet in no way alters the mode in which that determination takes place mans reflections on the forms of social life and consequently also his scientific analysis of those forms take a course directly opposite to that of their actual historical development he begins post festum with the results of the process of development ready to hand before him  the characters that stamp products as commodities and whose establishment is a necessary preliminary to the circulation of commodities have already acquired the stability of natural selfunderstood forms of social life before man seeks to decipher not their historical character for in his eyes they are immutable but their meaning consequently it was the analysis of the prices of commodities that alone led to the determination of the magnitude of value and it was the common expression of all commodities in money that alone led to the establishment of their characters as values it is however just this ultimate moneyform of the world of commodities that actually conceals instead of disclosing the social character of private labour and the social relations between the individual producers when i state that coats or boots stand in a relation to linen because it is the universal incarnation of abstract human labour the absurdity of the statement is selfevident nevertheless when the producers of coats and boots compare those articles with linen or what is the same thing with gold or silver as the universal equivalent they express the relation between their own private labour and the collective labour of society in the same absurd form

8 what are we to think of a law that asserts itself only by periodical revolutions it is just nothing but a law of nature founded on the want of knowledge of those whose action is the subject of it friedrich engels umrisse zu einer kritik de nationalokonomie in the deutschfranziisische jahrbiicher edited by arnold ruge and karl marx paris 1844 matx

        the categories of bourgeois economy consist of such like forms they are forms o f thought expressing with social validity the conditions and relations of a definite historically determined mode of production viz the production of commodities the whole mystery of commodities all the magic and necromancy that surrounds the products of labour as long as they take the form of commodities vanishes therefore as soon as we come to other forms of production

        since robinson crusoes experiences are a favorite theme with political economists let us take a look at him on his island moderate though he be yet some few wants he h a s to satisfy and must therefore do a little useful work of various sorts such as making tools and furniture taming goats fishing and hunting  of his prayers and the like we take no account since they are a source of pleasure to him and he looks upon them as so much recreation in spite of the variety of his work he knows that his labour whatever its form is but the activity of one and the same robinson and consequently that it consists of nothing but different modes of human labour necessity itself compels him to apportion his time accurately between his different kinds of work whether one kind occupies a greater space in his general activity than another depends on the difficulties greater or less as the case may be to be overcome in attaining the useful effect aimed at this our friend robinson soon learns b y experience and having rescued a watch ledger and pen and ink from the wreck commences like a trueborn briton to keep a set of books his stockbook contains a list of the objects of utility that belong to him of the operations necessary for their production and lastly of the labourtime that definite quantities of those objects have on an average cost him all the relations between robinson and the objects that form this wealth of his own creation are here so simple and clear as to be intelligible without exertion even to mr sedley taylor and yet those relations contain that is essential to the determination of value

        let us now transport ourselves from robinsons island bathed in light to the european middle ages shrouded in darkness here instead of the independent man we find everyone dependent serfs and lords vassals and suzerains laymen and clergy personal dependence here characterises the social relations of production just as much as it does the other spheres of life organised on the basis of that production but for the very reason that personal dependence forms the groundwork of society there i s n o necessity for labour and its products to assume a fantastic form different from their reality they take the shape in the transactions of society of services in kind and payments in kind here the particular and natural form of labour and not as in a society based on production of commodities its general abstract form is the immediate social form of labour compulsory labour is just as properly measured by time as commodityproducing labour but every serf knows that what he expends in the service of his lord is a definite quantity of his own personal labourpower the tithe to be rendered to the priest is more matter of fact than his blessing no matter then what we may think of the parts played by the different classes of people themselves in this society the social relations between individuals in the performance of their labour appear at all events as their own mutual personal relations and are not disguised under the shape of social relations between the products of labour

        for an example of labour in common or directly associated labour we have no occasion to go back to that spontaneously developed form which we find on the threshold of the history of all civilized races we have one close at hand in the patriarchal industries of a peasant family that produces corn cattle yarn linen and clothing for home use these different articles are as regards the family so many products of its labour but as between themselves they are not commodities the different kinds of labour such as tillage cattle tending spinning weaving and making clothes which result in the various products are in themselves and such as they are direct social functions because functions of the family which just as much a s a society based on the production of commodities possesses a spontaneously developed system of division of labour the distribution of the work within the family and the regulation of the labourtime of the several members depend as well upon differences of age and sex as upon natural conditions varying with the seasons the labourpower of each individual by its very nature operates in this case merely as a definite portion of the whole labourpower of the family and therefore the measure of the expenditure of individual labourpower by its duration appears here by its very nature as a social character of their labour

        let us now picture to ourselves by way of change a community of free individuals carrying on their work with the means of production in common in which the labourpower of all the different individuals is consciously applied as the combined labourpower of the community all the characteristics of robinsons labour are here repeated but with this difference that they are social instead of individual everything produced by him was exclusively the result of his own personal labour and therefore simply an object of use for himself the total product of our community is a social product one portion serves as fresh means of production and remains social but another portion is consumed by the members as means of subsistence a distribution of this portion amongst them is consequently necessary the mode of this distribution will vary with the productive organisation of the community and the degree of historical development attained by the producers we will assume but merely for the sake of a parallel with the production of commodities that the share of each individual producer in the means of subsistence is determined by his labourtime labourtime would in that case play a double part its apportionment in accordance with a definite social plan maintains the proper proportion between the different kinds of work to be done and the various wants of the community on the other hand it also serves as a measure of the portion of the common labour borne by each individual and of his share in the part of the total product destined for individual consumption the social relations of the individual producers with regard both to their labour and to its products are in this case perfectly simple and intelligible and that with regard not only to production but also to distribution

        the religious world is but the reflex of the real world and for a society based upon the production of commodities in which the producers in general enter into social relations with one another by treating their products as commodities and values whereby they reduce their individual private labour to the standard of homogeneous human labourfor such a society christianity with its cultus of abstract man more especially in its bourgeois developments protestantism deism c is the most fitting form of religion in the ancient asiatic and other ancient modes of production we find that the conversion of products into commodities and therefore the conversion of men into producers of commodities holds a subordinate place which however increases in importance as the primitive communities approach nearer and nearer to their dissolution trading nations properly so called exist in the • ancient world only in its interstices like the gods of epicurus in the intermundia or like jews in the pores of polish society those ancient social organisms of production are as compared with bourgeois society extremely simple and transparent but they are founded either on the immature development of man individually who has not yet severed the umbilical cord that unites him with his fellowmen in a primitive tribal community or upon direct relations of subjection they can arise and exist only when the development of the productive power of labour has not risen beyond a low stage and then therefore the social relations within the sphere of material life between man and man and between man and nature are correspondingly narrow this narrowness is reflected in the ancient worship of nature and in the other elements of the popular religions the religious reflex of the real world can in any case only then finally vanish when the practical relations of everyday life offer to man none but perfectly intelligible and reasonable relations with regard to his fellowmen and to nature

        the lifeprocess of society which is based on the process of material production does not strip off its mystical veil until it is treated as production by freely associated men and is consciously regulated by them in accordance with a settled plan  this however demands for society a certain material groundwork or set of conditions of existence which in their turn are the spontaneous product of a long and painful process of development

        political economy has indeed analysed however incompletely value and its magnitude and has discovered what lies beneath these forms but it has never once asked the question why labour is represented by the value of its product and labourtime by the magnitude of that value these formulae which bear it stamped upon them in unmistakable letters that they belong to a state of society in which the process of production has the mastery over man instead of being controlled by him such formulae appear to the bourgeois intellect to be as much a selfevident necessity imposed by nature as productive labour itself hence forms of social production that preceded the bourgeois form are treated by the bourgeoisie in much the same way as the fathers of the church treated prechristian religions

        to what extent some economists are misled by the fetishism inherent in commodities or by the objective appearance of the social characteristics of labour are shown amongst other ways by the dull and tedious quarrel over the part played by nature in the formation of exchangevalue since exchangevalue is a definite social manner of expressing the amount of labour bestowed upon object nature has no more to do with it than it has in fixing the course of exchange

        the mode of production in which the product takes the form of a commodity or is produced directly for exchange is the most general and most embryonic form of bourgeois product ion it therefore makes its appearance at an early date in history though not in the same predominating and characteristic manner as nowadays hence its fetish character is comparatively easy to be seen through but when we come to more concrete forms even this appearance o f simplicity vanishes whence arose the illusions of the monetary system to it gold and silver when serving as money did not represent a social relation between producers but were natural objects with strange social properties and modern economy which looks down with such disdain on the monetary system does not its superstition come out as clear as noonday whenever it treats of capital how long is it since economy discarded the physiocratic illusion that rents grow out of the soil and not out of society

        but not to anticipate we will content ourselves with yet another example relating to the commodityform could commodities themselves speak they would say our usevalue may be a thing that interests men it is no part of us as objects what however does belong to us as objects is our value our natural intercourse as commodities proves it in the eyes of each other we are nothing but exchangevalues now listen how those commodities speak through the mouth of the economist value i e exchangevalue is a property of things riches ie usevalue   of man  value in this sense necessarily implies exchanges riches do not  riches  usevalue  are the attribute of men value is the attribute of commodities a man or a community is rich a pearl or a diamond is valuable     a pearl or a diamond is valuable as a pearl or diamond so far no chemist has ever discovered exchangevalue either in a pearl or a diamond the economic discoverers of this chemical element who bytheby lay special claim to critical acumen find however that the usevalue o f objects belongs to them independently of their material properties while their value on the other hand forms a part of them as objects what confirms them in this view is the peculiar circumstance that the usevalue of objects is realised without exchange by means of a direct relation between the objects and man while on the other hand their value is realized only by exchange that is by means of a social process who fails here to call to mind our good friend dogberry who informs neighbour seacoal that to be a wellfavoured man is the gift of fortune but reading and writing comes by nature


part ii the transformation of money into capital
chapter iv the general formula for capital

        the circulation of commodities is the startingpoint of capital the production of commodities their circulation and that more developed form of their circulation called commerce these form the historical groundwork from which it rises the modern history of capital dates from the creation in the 16th century of a world embracing commerce and a worldembracing market

        if we abstract from the material substance of the circulation of commodities that is from the exchange of the various usevalues and consider only the economic forms produced by this process of circulation we find its final result to be money this final product of the circulation of commodities is the first form in which capital appears

        as a matter of history capital as opposed to landed property invariably takes the form at first of money it appears as moneyed wealth as the capital of the merchant and of the usurer but we have no need to refer to the origin of capital in order to discover that the first form of appearance of capital is money we can see it daily under our very eyes all new capital to commence with comes on the stage that is on the market whether of commodities labour or money even in our days in the shape of money that by a definite process has to be transformed into capital

        the first distinction we notice between money that is money only and money that is capital is nothing more than a difference in their form of circulation

        the simplest form of the circulation of commodities is cmc the transformation of commodities into money and the change of the money back again into commodities or selling in order to buy but alongside of this form we find another specifically different form mcm the transformation of money into commodities and the change of commodities back again into money or buying in order to sell money that circulates in the latter manner is thereby transformed into becomes capital and is already potentially capital

        now let us examine the circuit mcm a little closer it consists like the other of two antithetical phases in the first phase mc or the purchase the money is changed into a commodity in the second phase cm o r the sale the commodity is changed back again into money the combination of these two phases constitutes the single movement whereby money is exchanged for a commodity and the same commodity is again exchanged for money whereby a commodity is bought in order to be sold or neglecting the distinction in form between buying and selling whereby a commodity is bought with a commodity the result in which the phases of the process vanish is the exchange of money for money mm if i purchase 2000 lbs of cotton for £ 100 and resell the 2000 lbs of cotton for £ 110 i have in fact exchanged £ 100 for £ 110 money for money

        now it is evident that the circuit mcm would be absurd and without meaning if the intention were to  exchange by this means two equal sums of money £ 100 for £ 100 the misers plan would be far simpler and surer he sticks to his £ 100 instead of exposing it to the dangers of circulation and yet whether the merchant who has paid £ 100 for his cotton sells it for £ 110 or lets it go for £ 100 or even £50 his money has at all events gone through a characteristic and original movement quite different in kind from that which it goes through in the hands of the peasant who sells corn and with the money thus set free buys clothes we have therefore to examine first the distinguishing characteristics o f t h e forms of the circuits mcm and cmc and in doing this the real difference that underlies the mere difference of form will reveal itself

        let us see in the first place what the two forms have in common

        both circuits are resolvable into the same two antithetical phases cm a sale and mc a purchase in each of these phases the same material elementsa commodity and money and the same economic dramatis personal a buyer and a sellerconfront one another each circuit is the unity of the same two antithetical phases and in each case this unity is brought about by the intervention of three contracting parties of whom one only sells another only buys while the third both buys and sells

        what however first and foremost distinguishes the circuit cmc from the circuit mcm is the inverted order of succession of the two phases the simple circulation of commodities begins with a sale and ends with a purchase while the circulation of money as capital begins with a purchase and ends with a sale in the one case both the startingpoint and the goal are commodities in the other they are money in the first form the movement is brought about by the intervention of money in the second by that of a commodity

        in the circulation cmc the money is in the end converted into a commodity that serves as a usevalue it is spent once for all in the inverted form mcm on the contrary the buyer lays out money in order that as a seller he may recover money by the purchase of his commodity he throws money into circulation in order to withdraw it again by the sale of the same commodity he lets the money go but only with the sly intention of getting it back again the money therefore is not s pent it is merely advanced

        in the circuit cmc the same piece of money changes its place twice the seller gets it from the buyer and pays it away to another seller the complete circulation which begins with the receipt concludes with the payment of money for commodities it is the very contrary in the circuit mcm here it is not the piece of money that changes its place twice but the commodity the buyer takes it from the hands of the seller and passes it into the hands of another buyer just as in the simple circulation of commodities the double change of place of the same piece of money effects its passage from one hand into another so here the double change of place of the same commodity brings about the reflux of the money to its point of departure

        such reflux is not dependent on the commodity being sold for more than was paid for it this circumstance influences only the amount of the money that comes back the reflux itself takes place so soon as the purchased commodity is resold in other words so soon as the circuit mcm is completed we have here therefore a palpable difference between the circulation of money as capital and its circulation as mere money

        the circuit cmc comes completely to an end as soon as the money brought in by the sale of one commodity is abstracted again by the purchase of another

        if nevertheless there follows a reflux of money to its starting point this can only happen through a renewal or repetition of the operation if i sell a quarter of corn of £3 and with this £3 buy clothes the money so far as i am concerned is spent and done with it belongs to the clothes merchant if i now sell a second quarter of corn money indeed flows back to me not however as a sequel to the first transaction but in consequence o f its repetition the money again leaves me as soon as i complete this second transaction by a fresh purchase therefore in the circuit cmc the expenditure of money h a s nothing to do with its reflux on the other hand in mcm the reflux of the money is conditioned by the very mode of its expenditure without this reflux the operation fails or the process is interrupted and incomplete owing to the absence of its complementary and final phase the sale

        the circuit cmc starts with one commodity and finishes with another which falls out of circulation and into consumption consumption this satisfaction of wants in one word usevalue is its end and aim the circuit mcm on the contrary commences with money and ends with money its leading motive and the goal that attracts it is therefore mere exchangevalue

        in the simple circulation of commodities the two extremes of the cirruit have the same economic form they are both commodities and commodities of equal value but they are also usevalues differing in their qualities as for example corn and clothes the exchange of products of the different materials in which the labour of society is embodied forms here the basis of the movement it is otherwise in the circulation mc m which at first sight appears purposeless because tautological both extremes have the same economic form they are both money and therefore are not qualitatively different usevalues for money is but the converted form of commodities in which their particular usevalues vanish to exchange £ 100 for cotton and then this same cotton again for £ 110 is merely a roundabout way of exchanging money for money the same for the same and appears to be an operation just as purposeless as it is absurd one sum of money is distinguishable from another only by its amount the character and tendency of the process mcm is therefore not due to any qualitative difference between its extremes both being money but solely to their quantitative difference more money is withdrawn from circulation at the finish than was thrown into it at the start the cotton that was bought for £ 100 is perhaps resold for £ 100  £ 10 or £ 110 the exact form of this process is therefore mcm where m  m  6m  the original sum advanced plus an increment this increment or excess over the original value i call surplusvalue the value originally advanced therefore not only remains intact while in circulation but adds to itself a surplusvalue or expands itself it is this movement that converts it into capital

        of course it is also possible that in cmc the two extremes cc say corn and clothes may represent different quantities of value the farmer may sell his corn above its value or may buy the clothes at less than their value he may on the other hand be done by the clothes merchant yet in the form of circulation now under consideration such differences in value are purely accidental the fact that the corn and the clothes are equivalents does not deprive the process of all meaning as it does in mcm the equivalence of their values is rather a necessary condition to its normal course

        the repetition or renewal of the act of selling in order to buy is kept within bounds by the very object it aims at namely consumption o r the satisfaction of definite wants an aim that lays altogether outside the sphere of circulation but when we buy in order to sell we on the contrary begin and end with the same thing money and exchangevalue and thereby the movement becomes interminable no doubt m becomes m ∆m £ 100 become £ 110 but when viewed in their qualitative aspect alone £ 110 are the same as £ 100 namely money and considered quantitatively £ 110 is like £ 100 a sum of definite and limited value if now the £ 110 be spent as money they cease to play their part they are no longer capital withdrawn from circulation they become petrified into a  hoard and though they remained in that state till doomsday not a single farthing would accrue to them if then the expansion of value is once aimed at there is just the same inducement to augment the value of the £ 110 as that of the £ 1 00 for both are but limited expressions for exchangevalue and therefore both have the same vocation to approach by quantitative •increase as near as possible to absolute wealth  momentarily indeed the value originally advanced the £ 100 is distinguishable from the surplusvalue of £ 10 that is annexed to it during circulation but the distinction vanishes immediately at the end of the process we do not receive with one hand the original £ 100 and with the other the surplusvalue of £ 10 we simply get a value of £ 110 which is in exactly the same condition and fitness for commencing the expanding process as the original £ 1 00 was money ends the movement only to begin it again therefore the final result of every separate circuit in which a purchase and consequent sale are completed forms of itself the startingpoint of a new circuit the simple circulation of commodities selling in order to buyis a means of carrying out a purpose unconnected with circulation namely the appropriation of use values the satisfaction of wants  the circulation of money as capital is on the contrary an end in itself for the expansion of value takes place only within this constantly renewed movement the circulation of capital has therefore no limits

1 aristotle opposes oeconomic to chrematistic he starts from the former so far as it is the art of gaining a livelihood it is limited to procuring those articles that are necessary to existence and useful either to a household or the state true wealth consists of such values in use for the quantity of possessions of this kind capable of making life pleasant is not unlimited there is however a second mode of acquiring things to which we may by preference and with correctness give the name of chrematistic and in this case there appear to be n o limits to riches and possessions trade literally retail trade and aristotle takes this kind because in it values in use predominate does not in its nature belong to chrematistic for here the exchange has reference only t o what i s necessary to themselves the buyer or seller therefore as he goes on to show the original form of trade was barter but with the extension of the latter there arose the necessity for money on the discovery of money barter of necessity developed into trading in commodities and this again in opposition to its original tendency grew into chrematistic into the art of making money now chrematistic is distinguishable from oeconomic in this way that in the case of chrematistic circulation is the source of riches and it appears to revolve about money for money is the beginning and end of this kind of exchange therefore also riches such as chrematistic strives for are unlimited just as every art that is not a means to an end but an end in itself has no limit to its aims because it seeks constantly to approach nearer and nearer to that end while those arts that


        as the conscious representative of this movement the possessor of money becomes a capitalist his person or rather his pocket is the point from which the money starts and to which it returns the expansion of value which is the objective basis or mainspring of the circulation mcm becomes his subjective aim and it is only in so far as the appropriation of ever more and more wealth in the abstract becomes the sole motive of his operations that he functions as a capitalist that is as capital personified and endowed with consciousness and a will usevalues must therefore never be looked upon as the real aim of the capitalist neither must the profit on any single transaction the restless neverending process of profitmaking alone is what he aims at this boundless greed after riches this passionate chase after exchangevalue is common to the capitalist and the miser but while the miser is merely a capitalist gone mad the capitalist is a rational miser the neverending augmentation of exchangevalue which the miser strives after by seeking to save his money from circulation is attained by the more acute capitalist by constantly throwing it afresh into circulation

        the independent form ie the moneyform which the value of commodities assumes in the case of simple circulation serves only one purpose namely their exchange and vanishes in the final result of the movement on the other hand in the circulation mcm both the money and the commodity represent only different modes of existence of value itself the money its general mode and the commodity it’s particular or so to say disguised mode it is constantly changing from one form to the other without thereby becoming lost and thus assumes an automatically active character if now we take in turn each of the two different forms which selfexpanding value successively assumes in the course of its life we then arrive a t these two propositions capital is money capital is commodities in truth however value is here the active factor in a process in which while constantly assuming the form in turn of money and commodities it at the same time changes in magnitude differentiates itself by throwing off surplusvalue from itself the original value in other words expands spontaneously for the movement in the course of which it adds surplusvalue is its own movement its expansion therefore is automatic expansion because it is value it has acquired the occult quality of being able to add value to it it brings forth living offspring or at the least lays golden eggs


pursue means to an end are not boundless since the goal itself imposes a limit upon them so with chrematistic there are no bounds to its aims these aims being absolute wealth oeconomic not chrematistic has a limit    the object of the former is something different from money of the latter the augmentation of money    by confounding these two forms which overlap each other some people have been led to look upon the preservation and increase of money ad infinitum as the end and aim of oecono mic aristoteles derep edit bekker lib ic 8 9 passim marx


        value therefore being the active factor in such a process and assuming at one time the form o f money at another that of commodities but through all these changes preserving itself and expanding it requires some independent form by means of which its identity may at any time be established and this form it possesses only in the shape of money it is under the form of money that value begins and ends and begins again every act of its own spontaneous generation it began by being £ 100 it is now £ 110 and so on but the money itself is only one of the two forms of value unless it takes the form of some commodity it does not become capital there is here no antagonism as in the case of hoarding between the money and commodities the capitalist knows that all commodities however scurvy they may look or however badly they may smell are in faith and in truth money inwardly circumcised jews and what is more a wonderful means whereby out o f money to make more money

        in simple circulation cmc the value of commodities attained at the most a form independent of their usevalues ie the form of money but that same value now in the circulation mcm or the circulation of capital suddenly presents itself as an independent substance endowed with a motion of its own passing through a lifeprocess of its own in which money and commodities are mere forms which it assumes and casts off in turn nay more instead of simply representing the relations of commodities it enters now so to say into private relations with itself it differentiates itself as original value from itself as surplusvalue as the father differentiates himself from himself qua the son yet both are one and of one age for only by the surplusvalue of £ 10 does the £ 100 originally advanced become capital and so soon as this takes place so soon as the son and by the son the father is begotten so soon does their difference vanish and they again become one £ 110

        value therefore now becomes value in process money in process and as such capital it comes out of circulation enters into it again preserves and multiplies itself within its circuit comes back out of it with expanded bulk and begins the same round ever afresh  mm money which begets money such is the description of capital from the mouths of its first interpreters the mercantilists

        buying in order to sell or more accurately buying in order to sell dearer mcm appears certainly to be a form peculiar to one kind of capital alone namely merchants capital but industrial capital too is money that is changed into commodities and by the sale of these commodities is reconverted into more money

        the events that take place outside the sphere of circulation in the interval between the buying and selling do not affect the form of this movement lastly in the case of interestbearing capital the circulation mcm appears abridged we have its result without the intermediate stage in the form mm en style lapidaire so to say money that is worth more money value that is greater than itself

        mcm is therefore in reality the general formula of capital as it appears prima facie within the sphere of circulation   


chapter vi the buying and selling
of labourpower

        the change of value that occurs in the case of money intended to be converted into capital cannot take place in the money itself since in its function of means of purchase and of payment it does no more than realize the price of the commodity it buys or pays for and as hard cash it is value petrified never varying just as little can it originate in the second act of circulation the resale of the commodity which does no more than transform the article from its bodily form back again into its moneyform  the change must therefore take p lace in the commodity bought by the first act mc but not in its value for equivalents are exchanged and the commodity is p aid for at its full value we are therefore forced to the conclusion that the change originates in the usevalue as such of the commodity ie in its consumption in order to be able to extract value from the consumption of a commodity our friend moneybags must be so lucky as to find within the sphere of circulation in the market a commodity whose usevalue possesses the peculiar property of being a source of value whose actual consumption therefore is itself an embodiment of labour and consequently a creation of value the possessor of money does find on the market such a special commodity in capacity for labour or labourpower

        by labourpower or capacity for labour is to be understood the aggregate of those mental and physical capabilities existing in a human being which he exercises whenever he produces a usevalue of any description

        but in order that our owner of money may be able to find labourpower offered for sale as a commodity various conditions must first be fulfilled the exchange of commodities of itself implies no other relations of dependence than those which result from its own nature on this assumption labourpower can appear upon the market as a commodity only if and so far as its possessor the individual whose labourpower it is offers it for sale or sells it as a commodity in order that he may be able to do this he must have it at his disposal must be the untrammeled owner of his capacity for labour ie of his person he and the owner of money meet in the market and deal with each other as on the basis of equal rights with this difference alone that one is buyer the other seller both therefore equal in the eyes of the law the continuance of this relation demands that the owner of the labourpower should sell it only for a definite period for it he were to sell it rump and stump once for all he would be selling himself converting himself from a free man into a slave from an owner of a commodity into a commodity he must constantly look upon his labourpower as his own property his own commodity and this he can only do by placing it at the disposal of the buyer temporarily for a definite period of time by this means alone can he avoid renouncing his rights of ownership over it

        the second essential condition to the owner of money finding labourpower in the market as a commodity is thisthat the labourer instead of being in the position to sell commodities in which his labour is incorporated must be obliged to offer for sale as a commodity that very labourpower which exists only in h is living self

        in order that a man may be able to sell commodities other than labourpower he must of course have the means of production as raw material implements c no boots can be made without leather he requires also the means of subsistence nobodynot even a musician of the future can live upon future products or upon usevalues in an unfinished state and ever since the first moment of his appearance on the worlds stage man always has been and must still be a consumer both before and while he is producing in a society where all products assume the form of commodities these commodities must be sold after they have been produced it is only after their sale that they can serve in satisfying the requirements of their producer the time necessary for their sale is superadded to that necessary for their production

2 in encyclopaedias of classical antiquities we find such nonsense as this that in the ancient world capital was fully developed except that the free labourer and a system of credit were wanting mommsen also in his history of rome commits in this respect one blunder after another matx
3 hence legislation in various countries fixes a maximum for labourcontracts wherever free labour is the rule the laws regulate the mode of terminating this contract in some states particularly in mexico before the american civil war also in the territories taken from mexico and also as a matter of fact in the danubian provinces till the revolution effected by kusa slavery is hidden under the form of peonage by means of advances repayable in labour which are handed down from generation to generation not only the individual labourer but his family become de jacto the property of other persons and their families juarez abolished peonage the socalled emperor maximilian reestablished it by a decree which in the house of representatives at washington was aptly denounced as a decree for the reintroduction of slavery into mexico i may make over to another the use for a limited time of my particular bodily and mental aptitudes and capabilities because in consequence of this restriction they are impressed with a character of alienation with regard to me as a whole but by the alienation of all my labourtime and the whole of my work i should be converting the substance itself in other words my general activity and reality my person into the property of another hegel philosophie des
rechts berlin 1840 p 104 § 67 marx

        for the conversion of his money into capital therefore the owner of money must meet in the market with the free labourer free in the double sense that as a free man he can dispose of his labourpower as his own commodity and that on the other hand he has no other commodity for sale is short of everything necessary for the realisation of his labourpower

        the question why this free labourer confronts him in the market has no interest for the owner of money who regards the labourmarket as a branch of the general market for commodities and for the present it interests us just as little we cling to the fact theoretically as he does practically one thing however is clearnature does not produce on the one side owners of money or commodities and on the other men possessing nothing but their own labourpower this relation has no natural basis neither is its social basis one that is common to all historical periods it is clearly the result of a past historical development the product of many economic revolutions of the extinction of a whole series of older forms of social production

        so too the economic categories already discussed by us bear the stamp of history definite historical conditions are necessary that a product may become a commodity it must not be produced as the immediate means of subsistence of the producer himself had we gone further and inquired under what circumstances all or even the majority of products take the form of commodities we should have found that this can only happen with production of a very specific kind capitalist production such an inquiry however would have been foreign to the analysis of commodities production and circulation of commodities can take place although the great mass of the objects produced are intended for the immediate requirements of their producers a re not turned into commodities and consequently social production is not yet by a long way dominated in its length and breadth by exchangevalue the appearance of products as commodities presupposes such a development of the social division of labour that the separation of usevalue from exchange value a separation which first begins with barter must already have been completed but such a degree of development is common to many forms of society which in other respects p resent the most varying historical features on the other hand if we consider money its existence implies a definite stage in the exchange of commodities the particular functions of money which it performs either as the mere equivalent of commodities or as means of circulation  or means of payment as hoard or as universal money point according to the extent and relative preponderance of the one function or the other to very different stages in the process of social production  yet we know by experience that a circulation of commodities relatively primitive suffices for the production of all these forms otherwise with capital the historical conditions of its existence are by no means given with the mere circulation of money and commodities it can spring into life only when the owner of the means of production and subsistence meets in the market with the free labourer selling h is labourpower and this one historical condition comprises a worlds history capital therefore announces from its first appearance a new epoch in the process of social production

        we must now examine more closely this peculiar commodity labourpower like all others it has a value how is that value determined

        the value of labourpower is determined as in the case of every other commodity by the labourtime necessary for the production and consequently also the reproduction of this special article so far as it has value it represents no more than a definite quantity of the average labour of society incorporated in it labourpower exists only as a capacity or power of the living individual its production consequently presupposes his existence given the individual the production of labourpower consists in his reproduction of himself or his maintenance for his maintenance h e requires a given quantity of the means of subsistence therefore the labourtime requisite for the production of labourpower reduces itself to that necessary for the production of those means of subsistence in other words the value of labourpower is the value of the means of subsistence necessary for the maintenance of the labourer labour power however becomes a reality only by its exercise it sets itself in action only by working but thereby a definite quantity of human muscle nerve brain c is wasted and these require to be restored this increased expenditure demands a larger income if the owner of labourpower works today tomorrow he must again be able to repeat the same process in the same conditions as regards health and strength  his means of subsistence must therefore be sufficient to maintain him in his normal state as a labouring individual his natural wants such as food clothing fuel and housing vary according to the climatic and other physical conditions of his country on the other hand the number and extent of his socalled necessary wants as also the modes of satisfying them are themselves the product of historical development and depend therefore to a great extent on the degree of civilization of a country more particularly on the conditions under which and consequently on the habits and degree of comfort in which the class of free labourers has been formed in contradistinction therefore to the case of other commodities there enters into the determination of the value of labourpower a historical and moral element nevertheless in a given country at a given period the average quantity of the means of subsistence necessary for the labourer is practically known

4 the capitalist epoch is therefore characterised by this that labour power takes in the eyes o f the labourer himself the form of a commodity which is his property his labour consequently becomes wagelabour on the other hand it is only from this moment that the produce of labour universally becomes a commodity marx

        the owner of labourpower is mortal if then his appearance in the market is to be continuous and the continuous conversion of money into capital assumes this the seller of labourpower must pepetuate himself in the way that every living individual perpetuates himself by procreation the labourpower withdrawn from the market by wear and tear and death must be continually replaced by at the very least an equal amount of fresh labourpower hence the sum of the means of subsistence necessary for the production of labourpower must include the means necessary for the labourers substitutes i e his children in order that this race of peculiar commodityowners may perpetuate its appearance in the market

        in order to modify the human organism so that it may acquire skill and handiness in a given branch of industry and become labourpower of a special kind a special education or training is requisite and this on its part costs an equivalent in commodities of a greater or less amount this amount varies according to the more or less complicated character of the labourpower the expenses of this education excessively small in the case of ordinary labourpower enter pro tanto into the total value spent in its production

        the value of labourpower resolves itself into the value of a definite quantity of the means of subsistence it therefore varies with the value of these means or with the quantity of labour requisite for their production

        some of the means of subsistence such as food and fuel are consumed daily and a fresh supply must be provided daily other such as clothes and furniture last for longer periods and require to be replaced only at longer intervals one article must be bought or paid for daily another weekly another quarterly and so on but in whatever w a y the sum total of these outlays may be spread over the year they must be covered by the average income taking one day with another if the total of the commodities required daily for the production of labourpowera and those required weeklyb and those required quarterlyc and so on the daily average of these commodities  suppose that m this mass of commodities requisite for the average day there are embodied six hours of social labour then there is incorporated daily in labourpower half a days average social labour in other words half a days labour is requisite for the daily production of labourpower this quantity of labour forms the value of a days labourpower or the value of the labourpower daily reproduced if half a days average social labour is incorporated in three shillings then three shillings is the price corresponding to the value of a days labourpower if its owner therefore offers it for sale at three shillings a day its selling price is equal to its value and according to our supposition our friend moneybags who is intent upon converting his three shillings into capital pays this value

        the minimum limit of the value of labourpower is determined by the value of the commodities without the daily supply of which the labourer cannot renew his vital energy consequently by the value of those means of subsistence that are physically indispensable if the price of labourpower falls to this minimum it falls below its value since under such circumstances it can be maintained and developed only in a crippled state but the value of every commodity is determined by the labourtime requisite to turn it out so as to be normal quality

        it is a very cheap sort of sentimentality which declares this method of determining the value of labourpower a method prescribed by the very nature of the case to be a brutal method and which wails with rossi that to comprehend capacity for labour puissance de travail at the same time that we make abstraction from the means of subsistence of the labourers during the process of production is to comprehend a phantom etre de raison when we speak of labour or capacity for labour we speak at the same time of the labourer and his means of subsistence of labourer and wages when we speak of capacity for labour we do not speak of labour any more than when we speak of capacity for digestion we speak of digestion the latter process requires something more than a good stomach when we speak of capacity for labour we do not abstract from the necessary means of subsistence on the contrary their value is expressed in its value if his capacity for labour remains unsold the labourer derives no benefit from it but rather he will feel it to be a cruel natureimposed necessity that this capacity has cost for its production a definite amount of the means of subsistence and that it will continue to do so for its reproduction he will then agree with sismondi that capacity for labour    is nothing unless it is sold

        one consequence of the peculiar nature of labourpower as a commodity is that its usevalue does not on the conclusion of the contract between the buyer and seller immediately pass into the hands of the former its value like that of every other commodity is already fixed before it goes into circulation since a definite quantity of social labour has been spent upon it but its usevalue consists in the subsequent exercise of its force the alienation of labourpower and its actual appropriation by the buyer its employment as a usevalue are separated by an interval of time but in those cases in which the formal alienation by sale of the usevalue of a commodity is not simultaneous with its actual delivery to the buyer the money of the latter usually functions as means of payment in every country in which the capitalist mode of production reigns it is the custom not to pay for labourpower before it has been exercised for the period fixed by the contract as for example the end of each week in all cases therefore the usevalue of the labourpower is advanced to the capitalist the labourer allows the buyer to consume it before he receives payment of the price he everywhere gives credit to the capitalist that this credit is no mere fiction is shown not only by the occasional loss of wages on the bankruptcy of the capitalist but also by a series of more enduring consequences nevertheless whether money serves as means of purchase or as a means of payment this makes no alteration in the nature of the exchange of commodities the price of the labourpower is fixed by the contract although it is not realised till later like the rent of a house he labourpower is sold although it is only paid for at a later period it will therefore be useful for a clear comprehension of the relation of the parties to assume provisionally that the possessor of labourpower on the occasion of each sale immediately receives the price stipulated to be paid for it

        we now know how the value paid by the purchaser to the possessor of the peculiar commodity labourpower is determined the usevalue which the former gets in exchange manifests itself only in the actual usufruct in the consumption of the labourpower the moneyowner buys everything necessary for this purpose such as raw material in the market and pays for i t at its full value the consumption of labourpower is at one and the same time the production of commodities and of surplusvalue the consumption of labourpower is completed as in the case of every other commodity outside the limits of the market or of the sphere of circulation accompanied by mr moneybags and by the possessor of labourpower we therefore take leave for a time of this noisy sphere where everything takes place on the surface and in view of all men and follow them both into the hidden abode of production on whose threshold there stares us in the face no admittance except on business here we shall see not only how capital produces but how capital is produced we shall at last force the secret of profit making

        this sphere that we are deserting within whose boundaries the sale and purchase of labourpower goes on is in fact a very eden of the innate rights of man there alone rule freedom equality property and bentham freedom because both buyer and seller of a commodity say of labourpower are constrained only by their own free will they contract as free agents and the agreement they come to is but the form in which they give legal expression to their common will equality because each enters into relation with the other as with a simple owner of commodities and they exchange equivalent for equivalent property because each disposes only of what is his own and bentham because each looks only to himself the only force that brings them together and puts them in relation with each other is the selfishness the gain and the private interests of each each looks to himself only and no one troubles himself about the rest and just because they do so do they all in accordance with the preestablished harmony of things or under the auspices of an allshrewd providence work together to their mutual advantage for the common weal and in the interest of all

        on leaving this sphere of simple circulation or of exchange of commodities which furnishes the freetrader vulgaris with his views and ideas and with the standard by which he judges a society based on capital and wages we think we can perceive a change in the physiognomy of our dramatis personal he who before was the moneyowner now strides in front as capitalist the possessor of labourpower follows as his labourer the one with an air of importance smirking intent on business the other timid and holding back like one who is bringing his own hide to market and has nothing to expect buta hiding

section 1 the labourprocess or the production of usevalues


        the capitalist buys labourpower in order to use it and labourpower in use is labour itself the purchaser of labourpower consumes it by setting the seller of it to work by working the latter becomes actually what before he only was potentially labourpower in action a labourer in order that his labour may reappear in a commodity he must before all things expend it on something useful on something capable of satisfying a want of some sort hence what the capitalist sets the labourer to produce is a particular usevalue a specified article the fact that the production of usevalues or goods is carried on under the control o f a capitalist and on his behalf does not alter the general character of that production we shall therefore in the first place have to consider the labourprocess independently of the particular form it assumes under given social conditions

        labour is in the first place a process in which both man and nature participate and in which man of his own accord starts regulates and controls the material reactions between himself and nature he opposes himself to nature as one of her own forces setting in motion arms and legs head and hands the natural forces of his body in order to appropriate natures productions in a form adapted to his own wants by thus acting on the external world and changing it he at the same time changes his own nature he develops his slumbering powers and compels them to act in obedience to his sway we are not now dealing with those primitive instinctive forms of labour that remind us of the mere animal an immeasurable interval of time separates the state of things in which a man brings his labourpower to market for sale as a commodity from that state in which human labour was still in its first instinctive stage we presuppose labour in a form that stamps it as exclusively human a spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells but what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality at the end of every labour process we get it result that already existed in the imagination of the labourer at its commencement he not only effects a change of form in the material on which he works but he also realises a purpose of his own that gives the law to his modus operandi and to which he must subordinate his will  and this subordination is no mere momentary act besides the exertion of the bodily organs the process demands that during the whole operation the workmans will be steadily in consonance with his purpose this means close attention the less he is attracted by the nature of the work and the mode in which •it is carried on and the less therefore he enjoys it as something which gives play to his bodily and mental powers the more close his attention is forced to be

        the elementary factors of the labourprocess are  1   the personal activity of man ie work itself  2   the subject of that work and  3   its instruments

        the soil  and this economically speaking includes water in the virgin state in which it supplies man with necessaries or the means of subsistence ready to hand exists independently of him and is the universal subject of human labour all those things which labour merely separates from immediate connexion with their environment are subjects of labour spontaneously provided by nature such are fish which we catch and take from their element water timber which we fell in the virgin forest and ores which we extract from their veins i f on the other hand the subject of labour has so to say been filtered through previous labour we call it raw material such is ore already extracted and ready for washing all raw materials are the subject of labour but not every subject of labour is raw material it can only become so after it has undergone some alteration by means of labour

3 reason is just as cunning as she is powerful her cunning consists principally in her mediating activity which by causing objects to act and react on each other in accordance with their own nature i n this way without any direct interference in the process carries out reasons intentions hegel enzyklopadie erster theil die logik berlin 1840 p 3 82 mar

        an instrument of labour is a thing or a complex of things which the labourer interposes between himself and the subject of his labour and which serves as the conductor of his activity he makes use of the mechanical physical and chemical properties of some substances in order to make other substances subservient to his aims leaving out of consideration such readymade means of subsistence a s fruits in gathering which a mans own limbs serve as the instruments of his labour the first thing of which the labourer possesses himself is not the subject of labour but its instrument thus nature becomes one of the organs of his activity one that he annexes to his own bodily organs adding stature to himself in spit of the bible as the earth is his original larder so too it is his original tool house it supplies him for instance with stones for throwing grinding pressing cutting c the earth itself is an instrument of labour but when used as such in agriculture implies a whole series of other instruments and a comparatively high development of labour no sooner does labour undergo the least development than it requires specially prepared instruments thus in the oldest caves we find stone implements and weapons in the earliest period of human history domesticated animals ie animals which have been bred for the purpose and have undergone modifications by means of labour play the chief part as instruments of labour along with specially prepared stones wood bones and shells the use and fabrication of instruments of labour although existing in the germ among certain species of animals is specifically characteristic of the human labourprocess and franklin therefore defines man as a toolmaking animal relics of bygone instruments of labour possess the same importance for the investigation of extinct economic forms of society as do fossil bones for the determination of extinct species of animal s it is not the articles made but how they are made and by what instruments that enables us to distinguish different economic epochs instruments of labour not only supply a standard of the degree of development to which human labour has attained but they are also indicators of the social conditions under which that labour is carried on  among the instruments of labour those of a mechanical nature which taken as a whole we may call the bone and muscles of production offer much more decided characteristics of a given epoch of production than those which like pipes tubs baskets jars c serve only to hold the materials for labour which latter class we may in a general way call the vascular system of production the latter first begins to play an important part in the chemical industries

        in a wider sense we m a y include among the instruments of labour in addition to those things that are used for directly transferring labour to its subject and which therefore in one way or another serve as conductors of activity all such objects as are necessary for carrying on the labourprocess these do not enter directly into the process but without them it is either impossible for it to take place at all or possible only to a partial extent once more we find the earth to be a universal instrument of this sort for it furnishes a locus stand to the labourer and a field of employment for his activity among instruments that are the result of previous labour and also belong to this class we find workshops canals roads and so forth

        in the labourprocess therefore mans activity with the help of the instruments of labour effects an alteration designed from the commencement in the material worked upon the process disappears in the product the latter is a usevalue natures material adapted by a change of form to the wants of man labour has incorporated itself with its subject the former is materialised the latter transformed that which in the labourer appeared as movement now appears in the product as a fixed quality without motion the blacksmith forges and the product is a forging

        if we examine the whole process from the point of view o f its result the product it is plain that both the instruments and the subject of labour are means of production and that the labour itself is productive labour

        though a usevalue in the form of a product issues from the labourprocess yet other usevalues products of previous labour enter into it as means of production the same usevalue is both the product of a previous process and a means of production in a later process products are therefore not only results but also essential conditions of labour

        with the exception of the extractive industries in which the material for labour is provided immediately by nature such as mining hunting fishing and agriculture so far as the latter is con  fined to breaking up virgin soil all branches of industry manipulate raw material objects already filtered through labour already products of labour such is seed in agriculture animals and plants which we are accustomed to consider as products of nature are in their present form not only products of say last years labour but the result of a gradual transformation continued through many generations under mans superintendence and by means of his labour but in the great majority of cases instruments of labour show even to the most superficial observer traces of the labour of past ages

        raw material may either form the principal substance of a product or it may enter into its formation only as an accessory an accessory may be consumed by the instruments of labour as coal under a boiler oil by a wheel hay by drafthorses or it may be mixed with the raw material in order to produce some modification thereof as chlorine into unbleached linen coal with iron dyestuff with wool or again it may help to carry on the work itself as in the case of the materials used for heating and lighting workshops the distinction between principal substance and accessory vanishes in the true chemical industries because there none of the r a w material reappears in its original composition in the substance of the product

        every object possesses various properties and is thus capable of being applied to different uses one and the same product may therefore serve as raw material in very different processes corn for example is a raw material for millers starchmanufacturers distillers and cattlebreeders it also enters as raw material into its own production in the shape of seed coal too is at the same time the product of and a means of production in coalmining

        again a particular product may be used in one and the same process both as an instrument of labour and as raw material take for instance the fattening of cattle where the animal is the raw material and a t the same time an instrument for the production of manure

        a product though ready for immediate consumption may yet serve as raw material for a further product as grapes when they become the raw material for wine on the other hand labour may give us its product in such a form that we can use it only as raw material as is the case with cotton thread and yarn  such a raw material though itself a product may have to go through a whole series of different processes in each of these in turn it serves with constantly varying form as raw material until the last process of the series leaves it a perfect product ready for individual consumption or for use as an instrument of labour

        hence we see that whether a usevalue is to be regarded as raw material as instrument of labour or as product this is determined entirely by its function in the labourprocess by the position it there occupies as this varies so does its character

        whenever therefore a product enters as a means o f production into a new labourprocess it thereby loses its character of product and becomes a mere factor in the process a spinner treats spindles only as implements for spinning and flax only as the material that he spins of course it is impossible to spin without material and spindles and therefore the existence of these things as products at the commencement of the spinning operation must be presumed but in the process itself the fact that they are products of previous labour is a matter of utter indifference just as in the digestive process it is of n o importance whatever that bread is the produce of the previous labour of the farmer the miller and the baker on the contrary it is generally by their imperfections as products that the means of production in any process assert themselves in their character of products a blunt knife or weak thread forcibly reminds us of mr a the cutler or mr b the spinner in the finished product the labour by means o f which it has acquired its useful qualities is not palpable has apparently vanished

        a machine which does not serve the purposes of labour is useless in addition it falls a prey to the distractive influence of natural forces iron rusts and wood rots yarn with which we neither weave nor knit is cotton wasted living labour must seize upon these things and rouse them from their deathsleep change them from mere possible usevalues into real and effective ones bathed in the fire of labour appropriated as part and parcel of labours organism and as it were made alive for the performance of their functions in the process they are in truth consumed but consumed with a purpose as elementary constituents of new usevalues of new products ever ready as means of subsistence for individual consumption or as means of production for some new labourprocess

        if then on the one hand finished products are not only results but also necessary conditions of the labourprocess on the other hand their assumption into that process their contact with living labour is the sale means by which they can be made to retain their character of usevalues and be utilized

        labour uses up its material factors its subject and its instruments consumes them and is therefore a process of consumption such productive consumption is distinguished from individual consumption by this that the latter uses up products as means of subsistence for the living individual the former as means whereby alone labour the labourpower of the living individual is enabled to act the product therefore of individual consumption is the consumer himself the result of productive consumption is a product distinct from the consumer


        in so far then as its instruments and subjects are themselves products labour consumes products in order to create products or in other words consumes one set of products by turning them into means of production for another set but just as in the beginning the only participators in the labourprocess were man and the earth which latter exists independently of man so even now we still employ in the process many means of production provided directly by nature that do not represent any combination of natural substances with human labour

        the labourprocess resolved as above into its simple elementary factors is human action with a view to the production of usevalues appropriation of natural substances to human requirements it is the necessary condition for effecting exchange of matter between man and nature it is the everlasting natureimposed condition of human existence and therefore is independent of every social phase of that existence or rather is common to every such phase it was therefore not necessary to represent our labourer in connexion with other labourers man and his labour on one side nature and its materials on the other sufficed  as the taste of the porridge does not tell you who grew the oats no m ore does this simple process tell you of itself what are the social conditions under which it is taking place whether under the slaveowners brutal lash or the anxious eye of the capitalist whether cincinnatus carries it on in tilling his modest farm or a savage in killing wild animals with stones

        let us now return to our wouldbe capitalist we left him just after he had purchased in the open market all the necessary factors of the labourprocess its objective factor the means of production as well as its subjective factor labourpower with the keen eye of an expert he has selected the means of production and the kind of labourpower best adapted to his particular trade be it spinning bootmaking or any other kind he then proceeds to consume the commodity the labourpower that he has just bought by causing the labourer the impersonation of that labourpower to consume the means of production by his labour the general character of the labourprocess is evidently not changed by the fact that the labourer works for the capitalist instead of for himself moreover the particular methods and operations employed in boot making or spinning are not immediately changed by the intervention of the capitalist he must begin by taking the labourpower as he finds it in the market and consequently be satisfied with labour of such a kind as would be found in the period immediately preceding the rise of capitalists changes in the methods of production by the subordination of labour to capital can take place only at a later period and therefore will have to be treated of in a later chapter

        the labourprocess turned into the process by which the capitalist consumes labo urpower exhibits two characteristic phenomena first the labourer works under the control of the capitalist to whom his labour belongs the capitalist taking good care that the work is done in a proper manner and that the means of production a re used with intelligence so that there is no unnecessary waste of raw material and no wear and tear of the implements beyond what is necessarily caused by the work

        secondly the product is the property of the capitalist and not that of the labourer its immediate producer suppose that a capitalist pays for a days labourpower at its value then the right to use that power for a day belongs to him just as much a s the right to use any other commodity such as a horse that he has hired for the day to the purchaser of a commodity belongs its use and the seller of labourpower by giving his labour does no more in reality than part with the usevalue that he has sold from the instant he steps into the workshop the usevalue of his labourpower and therefore also its use which is labour belongs to the capitalist by the purchase of labourpower the capitalist incorporates labour as a living ferment with t h e lifeless constituents of the product from his point of view the labourprocess is nothing more than the consumption of the commodity purchased i e of lab ourpower but this consumption cannot be effected except by supplying the labourpower with the means of production the labourprocess is a process between things that the capitalist has purchased things that have become his property the product of this process belongs therefore to him just as much as does the wine which is the product of a process of fermentation completed in his cellar


section 2 the production of surplusvalue

        the product appropriated by the capitalist is a usevalue as yarn for example or boots but although boots are in one sense the basis of all social progress and our capitalist is a decided progressist yet he does not manufacture boots for their own sake use value is by no means the thing quon aime pour luimeme in the production of commodities usevalues are only produced by capitalists because and in so far as they are the material substratum the depositories of exchangevalue our capitalist has two objects in view in the first place he wants to produce a usevalue that has a value in exchange that is to say an article destined to be sold a commodity and secondly he desires to produce a commodity whose value shall be greater than the sum of the values of the commodities used in its production that is of the means of production and the labourpower that he purchased with his good money in the open market his aim is to produce not only a usevalue but a commodity also not only usevalue but value not only value but a t the same time surplusvalue

        it must be borne in mind that we are now dealing with the production of commodities and that up to this point we have only considered one aspect of the process just as commodities are at the same time usevalues and values so the process of producing them must be a labour process and at the same time a process of creating value

        let us now examine production as a creation of value we know that the value of each commodity is determined by the quantity of labour expended on and materialised in it by the workingtime necessary under given social conditions for its production this rule also holds good in the case o f the product that accrued to our capitalist as the result of the labourprocess carried on for him assuming this product to be 10 lbs of yarn our first step is to calculate the quantity of labour realised in it

        for spinning the yarn raw material is required suppose in this case 10 lbs of cotton we have no need at present to investigate the value of this cotton for our capitalist has we will assume bought it at its full value say of ten shillings in this price the labour required for the production of the cotton is already expressed in terms of the average labour of society we will further assume that the wear and tear of the spindle which for our present purpose may represent all other instruments of labour employed amounts to the value of 2 s if then twentyfour hours labour or two workingdays are required to produce the quantity of gold represented by twelve shillings we have here to begin with two days labour already incorporated in the yarn 

        we must not let ourselves be misled by the circumstance that the cotton has taken a new shape while the substance of the spindle has to a certain extent been used up b y the general law of value if the value of 40 lbs of yarn  the value of 40 lbs of cotton  the value of a whole spindle i e if the same workingtime is required to produce the commodities on either side of this equation then 10 lbs of yarn a re a n equivalent for 10 lbs of cotton together with onefourth of a spindle in the case we are considering the same workingtime is materialised in the 10 lbs of yarn on the one hand and in the 10 lbs of cotton and the fraction of a spindle on the other therefore whether value appears in cotton in a spindle or in yarn makes no difference in the amount of that value the spindle and cotton instead of resting quietly side by side join together in the process their forms are altered and they are turned into yarn but their value is no more affected by this fact than it would be if they had been simply exchanged for their equivalent in yarn

        the labour required for the production of the cotton the raw material of the yarn is part of the labour necessary to produce the yarn and is therefore contained in the yarn the same applies to the labour embodied in the spindle without whose wear and tear the cotton could not be spun

        hence in determining the value of the yarn or the labourtime required for its production all the special processes carried on at various times and in different places which were necessary first to produce the cotton and the wasted portion of the spindle and then with the cotton and spindle to spin the yarn may together be looked on as different and successive phases of one and the same process the whole of the labour in the yarn is past labour and it is a matter of no importance that the operations necessary for the production of its constituent elements were carried on at times which referred to the present are more remote than the final operation of spinning if a definite quantity of labour say thirty days is requisite to build a house the total amount of labour incorporated in it is not altered by the fact that the work of the last day is done twentynine days later than that of the first therefore the labour contained in the raw material and the instruments of labour can be treated just as if it were labour expended in an earlier stage of the spinning process before the labour of actual spinning commenced

        the values of the means of production i e the cotton and the spindle which values are expressed in the price of twelve shillings are therefore constituent parts of the value of the yarn or in other words of the value o f the product

        two conditions must nevertheless be fulfilled first the cotton and spindle must concur in the production of a usevalue they must in the present case become yarn value is independent of the particular usevalue by which it is borne but it must be embodied in a usevalue of some kind secondly the time occupied in the labour of production must not exceed the time really necessary under the given social conditions of the case therefore if no more than 1 lb of cotton be requisite to spin i lb of yarn care must be taken that no more than this weight of cotton is consumed in the production of i lb of yarn and similarly with regard to the spindle though the capitalist have a hobby and use a gold instead of a steel spindle yet the only labour that counts for anything in the value of the yarn is that which would be required to produce a steel spindle because no more is necessary under the given social conditions

        we now know what portion of the value of the yarn is owing to the cotton and the spindle it amounts to twelve shillings or the value of two days work the next point for our consideration is what portion of the value of the yarn is added to the cotton by the labour of the spinner

        we have now to consider this labour under a very different aspect from that which it had during the labourprocess there we viewed it solely as that particular kind of human activity which changes cotton into yarn there the more the labour was suited to the work the better the yarn other circumstances remaining the same the labour of the spinner was then viewed as specifically different from other kinds of productive labour different on the one hand in its special aim viz spinning different on the other hand in the special character of its operations in the special nature of its means of production and in the special usevalue of its product for the operation of spinning cotton and spindles are a necessity but for making rifled cannon they would be of no use whatever here on the contrary where we consider the labour of the spinner only so far as it is valuecreating ie a source of value his labour differs in no respect from the labour of the man who bores cannon or  what here more nearly concerns us   from the labour of the cottonplanter and spindlemaker incorporated in the means of production it is solely by reason of this identity that cotton planting spindle making and spinning are capable of forming the component parts differing only quantitatively from each other of one whole namely the value of the yarn here we have nothing more to do with the quality the nature and the specific character of the labour but merely with its quantity and this simply requires to be calculated we proceed upon the assumption that spinning is simple unskilled labour the average labour of a given state of society hereafter we shall see that the contrary assumption would make no difference

        while the labourer is at work his labour constantly undergoes a transformation from being motion it becomes an object without motion from being the labourer working it becomes the thing produced at the end of one hours spinning that act is represented by a definite quantity of yarn in other words a definite quantity of labour namely that of one hour has become embodied in the cotton we say labour ie the expenditure of his vital force by the spinner and not spinning labour because the special work of spinning counts here only so far as it is the expenditure of labourpower in general and not in so far as it is the specific work of the spinner

        in the process we are now considering it is of extreme importance that no more time be consumed in the work of transforming the cotton into yarn than is necessary under the given social conditions if under normal ie average social conditions of production a pounds of cotton ought to be m a de into b pounds of yarn by one hours labour then a days labour does not count as 12 hours labour unless 12 a pounds of cotton have been made into 12b pounds of yam  for in the creation of value the time that is socially necessary alone counts

        not only the labour but also the raw material and the product now appear in quite a new light very different from that in which we viewed them in the labourprocess pure and simple the raw material serves now merely as an absorbent of a definite quantity of labour by this absorption it is in fact changed into yarn because it is spun because labourpower in the form of spinning is added to it but the product the yarn is now nothing more than a measure of the labour absorbed by the cotton if in one hour 1 23 lbs of cotton can be spun into 1 23 lbs of yarn then 10 lbs of yarn indicate the absorption of 6 hours labour definite quantities of product these quantities being determined by experience now represent nothing but definite quantities of labour definite masses of crystallised labourtime they are nothing more than the materialization of so many hours or so many days of social labour

        we are here no more concerned about the facts that the labour is the specific work of spinning that it s subject is cotton and its product yarn than we are about the fact that the subject itself is already a product and therefore raw material if the spinner instead of spinning were working in a coal mine the subject of his labour the coal would be supplied by nature nevertheless a definite quantity of extracted coal a hundredweight for example would represent a definite quantity of absorbed labour

        we assumed on the occasion of its sale that the value of a days labourpower is three shillings and that six hours labour is incorporated in that sum and consequently that this amount of labour is requisite to produce the necessaries of life daily required on an average by the labourer if now our spinner by working for one hour can convert 1 23 lbs of cotton into 1 23 lbs of yarn it follows that in six hours he will convert 10 lbs of cotton into 10 lbs of yarn hence during the spinning process the cotton absorbs six hours labour the same quantity of labour is also embodied in a piece of gold of the value of three shillings consequently by the mere labour of spinning a value of three shillings is added to the cotton

        let us now consider the total value of the product the 10 lbs of yarn two and a half days labour has been embodied in it of which two days were contained in the cotton and in the substance of the spindle worn away and half a day was absorbed during the process of spinning this two and a half days labour is also represented by a piece of gold of the value of fifteen shillings hence fifteen shillings is an adequate price for the 10 lbs of yarn or the price of one pound is eighteen pence

        our capitalist stares ill astonishment the value of the product is exactly equal to the value of the capital advanced the value so advanced has not expanded no surplusvalue has been created and consequently money has not been converted into capital the price of the yarn is fifteen shillings and fifteen shil1ings were spent in the open market upon the constituent elements of the product or what amounts to the same thing upon the factors of the labour process ten shillings were paid for the cotton two shillings for the substance of the spindle worn away and three shillings for the labourpower the swollen value of the yarn is of no avail for it is merely the sum of the values formerly existing in the cotton the spindle and the labourpower out of such a simple addition of existing values no surplusvalue can possibly arise these separate values are now all concentrated in one thing but so they were also in the sum of fifteen shillings before it was split up into three parts by the purchase of the commodities there is in reality nothing very strange in this result the value of one pound of yarn being eighteen pence if our capitalist buys 10 lbs of yarn in the market h e must pay fifteen shillings for them it is clear that whether a man buys his house ready built or gets it built for him in neither case will the mode of acquisition increase the amount of money laid out on the house

        our capitalist who is at home in his vulgar economy exclaims oh but i advanced my money for the express purpose of making more money the way to hell is paved with good intentions and he might just as easily have intended to make money without producing at all he threatens all sorts of things he wont be caught napping again in future he will buy the commodities in the market instead of manufacturing them himself but if all his brother capitalists were to do the same where would he find his commodities in the market and his money he cannot eat he tries persuasion consider my abstinence i might have played ducks and drakes with the 15 shillings but instead of that i consumed it productively and made yarn with it very well and by way of reward he is now in possession of good yarn instead of a bad conscience and as for playing the part of the miser it would never do for him to relapse into such bad ways as that we have seen before to what results such asceticism lead besides where nothing is the king has lost his rights whatever may be the merit of his abstinence there is nothing wherewith specially to remunerate it because the value of the product is merely the sum of the values of the commodities that were thrown into the process of production let him therefore console himself with the reflection that virtue is its own reward but no he becomes importunate he says the yarn is of no use to me i produced it for sale in that case let him sell it or still better let him for the future produce only things for satisfying his personal wants a remedy that his physician macculloch has already prescribed as infallible against an epidemic of overproduction he now gets obstinate can the labourer he asks merely with his arms and legs produce commodities out of nothing did i not supply him with the materials by means of which and in which alone his labour could be embodied and as the greater part of society consists of such neverdowells have i not rendered society incalculable service by my instruments of production my cotton and my spindle and not only society but the labourer also whom in addition i have provided with the necessaries of life and am i to be allowed nothing in return for all this service well but has not the labourer rendered him the equivalent service of changing his cotton and spindle into yarn moreover there is here no question of service a service is nothing more than the useful effect of a usevalue be it of a commodity or be it of labour but here we are dealing with exchangevalue the capitalist paid to the labourer a value of 3 shillings and the labourer gave him back an exact equivalent in the value of 3 shillings added by him to the cotton  he gave him value for value our friend up to this time so purseproud suddenly assumes the modest demean our of his own workman and exclaims have i myself not worked have i not performed the labour of superintendence and of overlooking the spinner and does not this labour too create value his over looker and his manager try to hide their smiles meanwhile after a hearty laugh he reassumes his usual mien though h e chanted to us the whole creed of the economists in reality he says he would not give a brass farthing for it he leaves this and all such like subterfuges and juggling tricks to the professors of political economy who are paid for it he himself is a practical man and though he does not always consider what he says outside his business yet in his business he knows what he is about

        let us examine the matter more closely the value of a days labourpower amounts to 3 shillings because on our assumption half a days labour is embodied in that quantity of labourpower ie because the means of subsistence that are daily required for the production of labourpower cost half a days labour but the past labour that is embodied in the labourpower and the living labour that it can call into action the daily cost of maintaining it and its daily expenditure in work are two totally different things the former determines the exchangevalue of the labourpower the latter is its usevalue the fact that half a days labour is necessary to keep the labourer alive during 24 hours does not in any way prevent him from working a whole day therefore the value of labourpower and the value which that labourpower creates in the labourprocess are two entirely different magnitudes and this difference of the two values was what the capitalist had in view when he was purchasing the labourpower the useful qualities that labourpower possesses and by virtue of which it makes yam or boots were to him nothing more than a conditio sine qua non for in order to create value labour must be expended in a useful manner what really influenced him was the specific usevalue which this commodity possesses of being a source not only of value but of more value than it has itself this is the special service that the capitalist expects from labourpower and in this transaction he acts in accordance with the eternal laws of the exchange of commodities the seller of labourpower like the seller of any other commodity realises its exchangevalue and parts with its usevalue he cannot take the one without giving the other the usevalue of labourpower or in other words labour belongs just as little to its seller as the usevalue of oil after it has been sold belongs to the dealer who has sold it the owner of the money has paid the value of a days labourpower his therefore is the use of it for a day a days labour belongs to him the circumstance that on the one hand the daily sustenance of labourpower costs only half a days labour while on the other hand the very same labourpower can work during a whole day that consequently the value which its use during one day creates is double what he pays for that use this circumstance is without doubt a piece of good luck for the buyer but by no means an injury to the seller

        our capitalist foresaw this state of things and that was the cause of his laughter the labourer therefore finds in the workshop the means of production necessary for working not only during six but during twelve hours just as during the six hours process our  10 lbs of cotton absorbed six hours labour and became 10 lbs of yarn so now 20 lbs of cotton will absorb 12 hours labour and be changed into 20 lbs of yarn let us now examine the product of this prolonged process there is now materialised in this 20 lbs of yarn the labour of five days of which four days are due to the cotton and the lost steel of the spindle the remaining day having been absorbed by the cotton during the spinning process expressed in gold the labour of five days is thirty shillings this is therefore the price of the 20 lbs of yarn giving as before eighteen pence as the price of a pound but the sum of the values of the commodities that entered into the process amounts to 27 shillings the value of the yarn is 30 shillings therefore the value of the product is 19 greater than the value advanced for its production 27 shillings have been transformed into 30 shillings a surplusvalue of 3 shillings has been created the trick has at last succeeded money has been converted into capital

        every condition of the problem i s satisfied while the laws that regulate the exchange of commodities have been in no way violated equivalent has been exchanged for equivalent for the capitalist as buyer paid for each commodity for the cotton the spindle and the labourpower its full value he then did what is done by every purchaser of commodities he consumed their usevalue the consumption of the labourpower which was also the process of producing commodities resulted in 20 lbs of yarn having a value of 30 shillings the capitalist formerly a buyer now returns to market as a seller of commodities he sells his yarn at eighteen pence a pound which is its exact value yet for all that he withdraws 3 shillings more from circulation than he originally threw into it this metamorphosis this conversion of money into capital takes place both within the sphere of circulation and also outside it within the circulation because conditioned by the purchase of the labour power in the market outside the circulation because what is done within it is only a steppingstone to the production of surplusvalue a process which is entirely confined to the sphere of production thus tout est pour ie mieux dans ie meilleur des mondes possibles

        by turning his money into commodities that serve as the ma terial elements of a new product and as factors in the labourprocess by incorporating living labour with their dead substance the capitalist at the same time converts value ie past materialised and dead labour into capital into value big with value a live monster that is fruitful and multiplies

        if we now compare the two processes of producing value and of creating surplusvalue we see that the latter is nothing but the continuation of the former beyond a definite point if on the one hand t he process be not carried beyond the point where the value paid by the capitalist for the labourpower is replaced by an exact equivalent it is simply a process of producing value if on the other hand it be continued beyond that point it becomes a process of creating surplusvalue

        if we proceed further and compare the process of producing value with the labourprocess pure and simple we find that the latter consists of the useful labour the work that produces use values here we contemplate the labour as producing a particular article we view it under its qualitative aspect alone with regard to its end and aim but viewed as a valuecreating process the same labourprocess presents itself under its quantitative aspect alone here it is a question merely of the time occupied b y the labourer in doing the work of the period during which the labourpower is usefully expended here the commodities that take part in the process do not count any longer as necessary adjuncts of labourpower in the production of a definite useful object they count merely as depositories of so much absorbed or materialised labour that labour whether previously embodied in the means of production or incorporated in them for the first time during the process of the action of labourpower counts in either case only according to its duration it amounts to so many hours or days as the case may be

        moreover only so much of the time spent in the production of any article is counted as under the given social conditions is necessary the consequences of this are various in the first place it becomes necessary that the labour should be carried on under normal conditions if a selfacting mule is the implement in general use for spinning it would be absurd to supply the spinner with a distaff and spinning wheel the cotton too must not be such rubbish as to cause extra waste in being worked but must be of suitable quality otherwise the spinner would be found to spend more time in producing a pound of yarn than is socially necessary in which case the excess of time would create neither value nor money but whether the material factors of the process are of normal quality or not depends not upon the labourer but entirely upon the capitalist then again the labourpower itself must be of average efficacy i n the trade in which it is being employed it must possess the average skill handiness and quickness prevalent in that trade and our capitalist took good care to buy labourpower of such normal goodness this power must be applied with the average amount of exertion and with the usual degree of intensity and the capitalist is as careful to see that this is done as that his workmen are not idle for a single moment he has bought the use of the labourpower for a definite period and he insists upon his rights he has no intention of being robbed lastly and for this purpose our friend has a penal code of his own a wasteful consumption of raw material or instruments of labour is strictly forbidden because what is so wasted represents labour superfluously expended labour that does not count in the product or enter into its value

        we now see that the difference between labour considered on the one hand as producing utilities and on the other hand as creating value a difference which we discovered by our analysis of a commodity resolves itself into a distinction between two aspects of the process of production

        the process of production considered on the one hand as the unity of the labourprocess and the process of creating value is production of commodities considered on the other hand as the unity of the labourprocess and the process of producing surplus value it is the capitalist process o f production or capitalist production of commodities

        we stated on a previous page that in the creation of surplus value it does not in the least matter whether the labour appropriated by the capitalist be simple unskilled labour of average quality or more complicated unskilled labour all labour of a higher or m ore complicated character than average labour is expenditure of labourpower of a more costly kind labourpower whose production has cost more time and labour and which therefore has a higher value than unskilled or simple labourpower this power being of higher value its consumption is labour of a higher class labour that creates in equal time’s proportionally higher values than unskilled labour does whatever difference in skill there may be between the labour of a spinner and that of a jeweller the portion of his labour by which the jeweller merely replaces the value of his own labourpower does not in any way differ in quality from the additional portion by which he creates surplusvalue in the making of jewellery just as in spinning the surplusvalue results only from a quantitative excess of labour from a lengtheningout of one and the same labourprocess in the one case of the process of making jewels in the other of the process of making yarn 

        but on the other hand in every process of creating value the reduction of skilled labour to average social labour eg one day of skilled to six days of unskilled labour is unavoidable we therefore save ourselves a superfluous operation and simplify our analysis by the assumption that the labour of the workman employed by the capitalist is unskilled average labour   



chapter x the workingday
section 1 the limits of the workingday

        we started with the supposition that labourpower is bought and sold at its value its value like that of all other commodities is determined by the workingtime necessary to its production if the production of the average daily means of subsistence of the labourer takes up 6 hours he must work on the average 6 hours every day to produce his daily labourpower or to reproduce the value received as the result of its sale the necessary part of his workingday amounts to 6 hours and is therefore caeteris paribus a given quantity but with this the extent of the workingday itself is not yet given

        let us assume that the line a b represents the length of the necessary workingtime say 6 hours if the l abour be prolonged 1 3 or 6 hours beyond a b we have 3 other lines working day i a  b  c working day ii ab – c working day iii a b –c representing 3 different workingdays of 7 9 and 1 2 hours the extension b c of the line a b represents the length of the surpluslabour as the workingday is a b  b or a c it varies with the variable quantity b c since a b is constant the ratio of b c to a b can always b e calculated in workingday i it is 16 in workingday ii 36 in workingday iii 66 o f a b since further the ratio   determines the rate of the surplusvalue the latter is given by the ratio of b c to a b it amounts in the 3 different workingdays respectively to 16 23 50 and 100 per cent on the other hand the rate of surplusvalue alone would not give us the extent of the workingday if this rate eg were 100 per cent the workingday might be of 8 10 12 or more hours it would indicate that the 2 constituent parts of the workingday necessarylabour and surpluslabour time were equal in extent but not how long each of these two constituent parts was

        the workingday is thus not a constant but a variable quantity one of its parts certainly is determined by the workingtime required for the reproduction of the labourpower of the labourer himself but its total amount varies with the duration of the surpluslabour the workingday is therefore determinable but is per se indeterminate

        although the workingday is not a fixed but a fluent quantity it can on the other hand only vary within certain limits the minimum limit is however not determinable of course if we make the extension line b c or the surpluslabour a we have a minimum limit ie the part of the day which the labourer must necessarily work for his own maintenance on the basis of capitalist production however this necessary labour can form a part only of the workingday the workingday itself can never be reduced to this minimum on the other h and the workingday has a maximum limit it cannot be prolonged beyond a certain point this maximum limit is conditioned by two things first by the physical bounds of labourpower within the 24 hours of the natural day a man can expend only a definite quantity of his vital force a horse in like manner can only work from day to day 8 hours during part of the day this force must rest sleep during another part the man has to satisfy other physical needs to feed wash and clothe himself besides these purely physical limitations the extension of the workingday encounters moral ones the labourer needs time for satisfying his intellectual and social wants the extent and number of which are conditioned by the general state of social advancement the variation of the workingday fluctuates therefore within physical and social bounds but both these limiting conditions are of a very elastic nature and allow the greatest latitude so we find workingdays of 8 10 12 14 16 18 hours ie of the most different lengths

        the capitalist has bought the labourpower at its dayrate to him it s usevalue belongs during one workingday he has thus acquired the right to make the labourer work for him during one day but what is a workingday

        at all events less than a natural day by how much the capitalist has his own views of this ultima thule the necessary limit of the workingday as capitalist he is only capital personified his soul is the soul of capital but capital has one single life impulse the tendency to create value and surplusvalue to make its constant factor the means of production absorb the greatest possible amount of surpluslabour

        capital is dead labour that vampirelike only lives by sucking living labour and lives the more the more labour it sucks the time during which the labourer works is the time during which the capitalist consu mes the labourpower he has purchased of him

        if the labourer consumes his disposable time for himself he robs the capitalist

        the capitalist then takes his stand on the law of the exchange of commodities he like all other buyers seeks to get the greatest possible benefit out of the usevalue of his commodity suddenly the voice of the labourer which had been stifled in the storm and stress of the process of production rises

        the commodity that i have sold to you differs from the crowd of other commodities in that its use creates value and a value greater than its own that is why you bought it that which on your side appears a spontaneous expansion of capital is on mine extra expenditure of labourpower you and i know on the market only one law that of the exchange of commodities and the consumption of the commodity belongs not to the seller who parts with it but to the buyer who acquires it to you therefore belongs the use of my daily labourpower but by means of the price that you pay for it each day i must be able to reproduce it daily and to sell it again apart from natural exhaustion through age c i must be able on the morrow to work with the same normal amount of force health and freshness as today you preach to me constantly the gospel of saving and abstinence good i will like a sensible saving owner husband my sale wealth labourpower and abstain from all foolish waste of it i will each day spend set in motion put into action only as much of it as is compatible with its normal duration and healthy development by an unlimited extension of the workingday you may in one day use up a quantity of labourpower greater than i can restore in three what you gain in labour i lose in substance the use of my labourpower and the spoliation of it are quite different things if the average time that doing a reasonable amount of work an average labourer can live is 30 years the value of my labourpower which you pay me from day to day is  or  of its total value but if you consume it in 10 years you pay me daily  instead of  of its total value ie only 13 of its daily value and you rob me therefore every day of 23 of the value of my commodity you pay me for one days labourpower whilst you use that of 3 days that is against our contract and the law of exchanges i demand therefore a working day of normal length and i demand it without any appeal to your heart for in money matters sentiment is out of place you may be a model citizen perhaps a member of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and in the odour of sanctity to boot but the thing that you represent face to face with me has no heart in its breast that which seems to throb there is my own heartbeating i demand the normal workingday because i like every other seller demand the value of my commodity

        we see then that apart from extremely elastic bounds the nature of the exchange of commodities itself imposes no limit to the workingday no limit to surpluslabour the capitalist maintains his rights as a purchaser when he tries to make the working day as long as possible and to make whenever possible two workingdays out of one on the other hand the peculiar nature of the commodity sold implies a limit to its consumption by the purchaser and the labourer maintains his right as seller when he wishes to reduce the workingday to one of definite normal duration there is here therefore an antinomy right against right both equally bearing the seal of the law of exchanges between equal rights force decides hence is it that in the history of capitalist production the determination of what is a workingday presents itself as the result of a struggle a struggle between collective capital ie the class of capitalists and collective labour ie the working class


section 2 the greed for surpluslabour manufacturer and
boyard

        capital has not invented surpluslabour wherever a part of society possesses the monopoly of the means of production the labourer free or not free must add to the workingtime necessary for his own maintenance an extra workingtime in order to produce the means of subsistence for the owners of the means of production whether this proprietor be the athenian nobleman etruscan theocrat civis roman us norman baron american slaveowner wallachian boyard modern landlord or capitalist it is however clear that in any given economic formation of society where not the exchangevalue but the usevalue of the product predominates surpluslabour will be limited by a given set of wants which may be greater or less and that here no boundless thirst for surpluslabour arises from the nature of the production itself hence in antiquity overwork becomes horrible only when the object is to obtain exchangevalue in its specific independent moneyform in the production of gold and silver compulsory working to death is here the recognised form of overwork only read diodorus siculus still these are exceptions in antiquity but as soon as people whose production still moves within the lower forms of slavelabour corveelabour c are drawn into the whirlpool of an international market dominated by the capitalistic mode of production the s ale of their products for export becoming their principal interest the civilised horrors of overwork are grafted on the barbaric horrors of slavery serfdom c hence the negro labour in the southern states of the american union preserved something of a patriarchal character so long as production was chiefly directed to immediate local consumption but in proportion as the export of cotton became of vital interest to these states the overworking of the negro and sometimes the using up of his life in 7 years of labour became a factor in a calculated and calculating system it was no longer a question of obtaining from him a certain quantity of useful products it was now a question of production of surpluslabour itself so was it also with the corvee eg in the danubian principalities now roumania

        the comparison of the greed for surpluslabour in the danubian principalities with the same greed in english factories has a special interest because surpluslabour in the corvee has an independent and palpable form

        suppose the workingday consists of 6 hours of necessary labour and 6 hours of surpluslabour then the free labourer gives the capitalist every week 6 x 6 or 36 hours of surpluslabour it is the same as if he worked 3 days in the week for himself and 3 days in the week gratis for the capitalist but this is not evident on the surface surpluslabour and necessary labour glide one into the other i can therefore express the same relationship by saying eg that the labourer in every minute works 30 seconds for himself and 30 for the capitalist etc it is otherwise with the corvee the necessary labour which the wallachian peasant does for his own maintenance is distinctly marked off from his surpluslabour on behalf of the boyard the one he does on his own field the other on the seignorial estate both parts of the labourtime exist therefore independently side by side one with the other in the corvee the surpluslabour is accurately marked off from the necessary labour this however can make no difference with regard to the quantitative relation of surpluslabour to necessary labour three days surpluslabour in the week remains three days that yield no equivalent to the labourer himself whether it is called corvee or wagelabour but in the capitalist the greed for surpluslabour appears in the straining after an unlimited extension of the workingday in the boyard more simply in a direct hunting after days of corvee   

        the factory act of 1850 now in force 1867 allows for the average workingday 10 hours ie for the first 5 days 12 hours from 6 am to 6 pm including 12 an hour for breakfast and an h our for dinner and thus leaving 10 12 workinghours and 8 hours for saturday from 6 am to 2 pm of which 12 an hour is subtracted for breakfast 60 workinghours are left 10 12 for each of the first 5 days 7 12 for the last certain guardians of these laws are appointed factory inspectors directly under the home secretary whose reports are published halfyearly by order of parliament they give regular and official statistics of the capitalistic greed for surpluslabour

        let us listen for a moment to the factory inspectors the fraudulent millowner begins work a quarter of an hour sometimes more sometimes less before 6 am and leaves off a quarter of an hour sometimes more sometimes less after 6 pm he takes 5 minutes from the beginning and from the end of the half hour nominally allowed for breakfast and 10 minutes a t the beginning and end o f the hour nominally allowed for dinner he works for a quarter of an hour sometimes more sometimes less after 2 pm on saturday thus his gain is

before 6 am                                15 minutes
after 6 pm                                 15 minutes
at breakfast time                             10 minutes
at dinner time                                10 minutes

five days300 minutes                       60 minutes

on saturday before 6 am                      15 minutes
a t breakfast time                              10 minutes
after 2 pm                                  15 minutes 

40 minutes

total weekly                                  340 minutes 

or 5 hours and 40 minutes weekly which multiplied by 50 working weeks in the year allowing two for holidays and occasional stoppages is equal to 27 workingdays

five minutes a days increased work multiplied b y weeks are equal to two and a half days of produce i n the year

an additional hour a day gained by small installments before 6 am after 6 pm and at the beginning and end of the times nominally fixed for meals is nearly equivalent to working 13 months in the year   
        these  small thefts of capital from the labourers meal and recreation time the factory inspectors also designate as petty pilfering of minutes snatching a few minutes or as the labourers technically called them nibbling and cribbling at mealtimes

        it is evident that in this atmosphere the formation of surplusvalue by surpluslabour is no secret if you allow me said a highly respectable master to me to work only ten minutes in the day overtime you put one thousand a year in my pocket moments are the elements of profit

        nothing is from this point of view more characteristic than the designation of the workers who work full time as fulltimers and the children under 13 who are only allowed to work 6 hours as halftimers   the worker is here nothing more than personified labourtime all individual distinctions are merged in those of fulltimers and halftimers


section 3 branches of english industry without legal limits to
exploitation

        we have hitherto considered the tendency to the extension of the workingday the werewoifs hunger for surpluslabour in a department where the monstrous exactions not surpassed says an english bourgeois economist by the cruelties of the spaniards to the american red skins caused capital at last to be bound by the chains of legal regulations now let us cast a glance at certain branches of production in which the exploitation of labour is either free from fetters to this day or was so yesterday

        mr broughton charlton county magistrate declared as chairman of a meeting held at the assembly rooms nottingham on the 14th of january 1860 that there was an amount of privation and suffering among that portion of the population connected with the lace trade unknown in other parts of the kingdom indeed in the civilised world     children of nine or ten years are dragged from their squalid beds at two three or four o clock in the morning and compelled to work for a bare subsistence until ten eleven or twelve at night their limbs wearing away their frames dwindling their faces whitening and their humanity absolutely sinking into a stonelike torpor utterly horrible to contemplate     we are not surprised that mr mallett or any other manufacturer should stand forward and protest against discussion     the system as the rev montagu valpy describes it is one of unmitigated slavery socially physically morally and spiritually     what can be thought of a town which holds a public meeting to petition that the period of labour for men shall be diminished to eighteen hours a day    we declaim against the virginian and carolinian cotton planters is their blackmarket their lash and their barter of human flesh more detestable than this slow sacrifice of humanity which takes place in order that veils and collars may be fabricated for the benefit of capitalists   

        the manufacture of lucifer matches dates from 1833 from the discovery of the method of applying phosphorus to the match itself since 184 5 this manufacture has rapidly developed in england and has extended especially amongst the thickly populated parts o f london as well as in manchester birmingham liverpool bristol norwich newcastle and glasgow with it has spread the form of lockjaw which a vienna physician in 1845 discovered to be a disease peculiar to lucifermatchmakers half the workers are children under thirteen and young persons under eighteen the manufacture is on account of its unhealthiness and unpleasantness in such bad odour that only the most miserable part of the laboring class halfstarved widows and so forth deliver up their children to it the ragged halfstarved untaught children

        of the witnesses that commissioner white examined 1863 270 were under 18 50 under 10 10 only 8 and 5 only 6 years old a range of the workingday from 12 to 14 or 15 hours nightlabour irregular mealtimes meals for the most part taken in the very workrooms those are pestilent with phosphorus dante would have found the worst horrors of his inferno surpassed in this manufacture   

        no branch of industry in england we do not take into account the making of bread by machinery recently introduced has preserved up to the present day a method o f production so archaic soas we see from the poets of the roman empireprechristian as baking but capital as was said earlier is at first indifferent as to the technical character of the labourprocess it begins by taking it just as it finds it

        the incredible adulteration of bread especially in london was first revealed by the house of commons committee on the adulteration of articles of food 1855 56 and dr hassalls work adulterations detected the consequence of these revelations was the act of august 6th 1860 for preventing the adulteration of articles of food and drink an inoperative law as it naturally shows the tenderest consideration for every freetrader who determines by the buying or selling of adulterated commodities  to turn an honest penny  the committee itself formulated more or less naively its conviction that freetrade meant essentially trade with adulterated or as the english ingeniously put it sophisticated goods in fact this kind of sophistry knows better than protagoras how to make white black and black white and better than the eleatics how to demonstrate ad oculos that everything is only appearance

        at all events the committee had directed the attention of the public to its daily bread and therefore to the baking trade at the same time in public meetings and in petitions to parliament rose the cry o f the london journeymen bakers against their overwork c the cry was so urgent that mr h s tremenheere also a member of the commission of 1863 several times mentioned was appointed royal commissioner of inquiry his report together with the evidence given roused not the heart of the public but its stomach englishmen always well up in the bible knew well enough that man unless by elective grace a capitalist or landlord or sinecurist is commanded to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow but they did not know that he had to eat daily in his bread a certain quantity of human perspiration mixed with the discharge of abscesses cobwebs dead blackbeetles and putrid german yeast without counting alum sand and other agreeable mineral ingredients without any regard to his holiness freetrade the free baking trade was therefore placed under the supervision of the state inspectors close of the parliamentary session of 1863 and by the same act of parliament work from 9 in the evening to 5 in the morning was forbidden for journeymen bakers under 18 the last clause speaks volumes as to the overwork in this oldfashioned homely line of business

        the work of a london journeyman baker begins as a rule at about eleven at night at that hour he makes the dough a laborious process which lasts from half an hour to three quarters of an hour according to the size of the batch or the labour bestowed upon it he then lies down upon the kneadingboard which is also the covering of the trough in which the dough is made and with a sack under him and another rolled up as a pillow he sleeps for about a couple of hours he is then engaged in a rapid and continuous labour for about five hoursthrowing out the dough scaling if off moulding it putting it into the oven preparing and baking rolls and fancy bread taking the batch bread out of the oven and up into the shop c c the temperature of a bakehouse ranges from about 75 to upwards of 90 degrees and in the smaller bakehouses approximates usually to the higher rather than to the lower degree of heat when the business of making the bread rolls c is over that of its distribution begins and a considerable proportion of the journeymen in the trade after working hard in the manner described during the night are upon their legs for many hours during the day carrying baskets or wheeling handcarts and sometimes again in the bakehouse leaving off work at various hours between 1 and 6 pm according to the season of the year or the amount and nature of their masters business while others are again engaged in the bakehouse in bringing out more batches until late in the afternoon     during what is called  the london season the operatives belonging to the  fullpriced bakers at the west end of the town generally begin work at 11 pm and are engaged in making the bread with one or two short  sometimes very short  intervals of rest up to 8 oclock the next morning they are then engaged all day long up to 4 5 6 and as late as 7 oclock in the evening carrying out bread or sometimes in the afternoon in the bakehouse again assisting in the biscuitbaking they may have after they have done their work sometimes five or six sometimes only four or five hours sleep before they begin again on fridays they always begin sooner some about ten oclock and continue in some cases at work either in making or delivering the bread up to 8 pm on saturday night but more generally up to 4 or 5 oclock sunday morning on sundays the men must attend twice or three times during the day for an hour or two to make preparations for the next days bread     the men employed by the underselling masters  who sell their bread under the full price and who as already pointed out comprise threefourths of the london bakers  have not only to work on the average longer hours but their work is almost entirely confined to the bakehouse the underselling masters generally sell their bread     in the shop if they send it out which is not common except as supplying  chandlers shops they usually employ other hands for that purpose it is not their practice to deliver bread from house to house towards the end of the week    the men begin on thursday night at 10 o clock and continue on with only slight intermission until late on saturday evening

        even the bourgeois intellect understands the position of the underselling masters the unpaid labour of the men was made the source whereby the competition was carried on and the fullpriced baker denounces his underselling competitors to the commission of inquiry as thieves of foreign labour and adulterators they only exist now by first defrauding the public and next getting 18 hours work out of their men for 12 hours’ wages

        the adulteration of bread and the formation of a class of bakers that sells the bread below the full price date from the beginning of the 18th century from the time when the corporate character of the trade was lost and the capitalist in the form of the miller or flourfactor rises behind the nominal master baker thus was laid the foundation of capitalistic production in this trade of the unlimited extension of the workingday and of nightlabour although the latter only since 1824 gained a serious footing even in london

        after what has just been said it will be understood that the report of the commission classes journeymen bakers among the shortlived labourers who having by good luck escaped the normal decimation of the children of the workingclass rarely reach the age of 42 nevertheless the baking trade is always overwhelmed with applicants the sources of the supply of these labourpowers to london are scotland the western agricultural districts of england and germany

        in the last week of june 1863 all the london daily papers published a paragraph with the sensational heading death from simple overwork it dealt with the death of the milliner mary anne walkley 20 years of age employed in a highly respectable dressmaking establishment exploited by a lady with the pleasant name of elise the old oftentold story was once more recounted this girl worked on an average 16 12 hours during the season often 30 hours without a break whilst her failing labourpower was revived by occasional supplies of sherry port or coffee it was just now the height of the season it was necessary to conjure up in the twinkling of an eye the gorgeous dresses for the noble ladies bidden to the ball in honour of the newlyimported princess of wales mary anne walkley had worked without intermission for 26 12 hours with 60 other girls 30 in one room that only afforded 13 of the cubic feet of air required for them at night they slept in pairs in one o f the stifling holes into which the bedroom was divided by partitions of board and this was one of the best millinery establishments in london mary anne walkley fell ill on the friday died on sunday without to the astonishment 6f madame elise having previously completed the work in hand the doctor mr keys called too late to the deathbed duly bore witness before the coroners jury that mary anne walkley had died from long hours of work in an overcrowded workroom and a too small and badlyventilated bedroom in order to give the doctor a lesson in good manners the coroners jury thereupon brought in a verdict that the deceased had died of apoplexy but there was reason to fear that her death had been accelerated by overwork in an overcrowded workroom c our white slaves cried the morning star the organ of the freetraders cobden and bright our white slaves who are toiled into the grave for the• most part silently pine and die

        it is not in dressmakers rooms that working to death is the order of the day but in a thousand other places in every place i had almost said where a thriving business has to be done we will take the blacksmith as a type if the poets were true there is no man so hearty so merry as the blacksmith he rises early and strikes his sparks before the sun he eats and drinks and sleeps as no other man working in moderation he is in fact in one of the best of human positions physically speaking but we follow him into the city or town and we see the stress of work on that strong man and what then is his position in the deathrate of his country in marylebone blacksmiths die at the rate of 31 per thousand per annum or 11 above the mean of the male adults of the country in its entirety the occupation instinctive almost as a portion of human art unobjectionable as a branch of human industry is made by mere excess o f work the destroyer of the man he can strike so many blows per day walk so many steps breathe so many breaths produce so much work and live an average say of fifty years he is made to strike so many more blows to walk so many more steps to breathe so many more breaths per day and to increase altogether a fourth of his life he meets the effort the result is that producing for a limited time a fourth more work he dies at 37 for 50


section 4 day and night work the relay system

        constant capital the means of production considered from the standpoint of the creation of surplusvalue only exist to absorb labour and with every drop of labour a proportional quantity of surpluslabour while they fail to do this their mere existence causes a relative loss to the capitalist for they represent during the time they lie fallow a useless advance of capital and this loss becomes positive and absolute as soon as the intermission of their employment necessitates additional outlay at the recommencement of work the prolongation of the workingday beyond the limits of the natural day into the night only acts as a palliative it quenches only in a slight degree the vampire thirst for the living blood of labour to appropriate labour during all the 24 hours of the day is therefore the inherent tendency of capitalist production but as it is physically impossible to exploit the same individual labourpower constantly during the night as well as the day to overcome this physical hindrance an alternation becomes necessary between the workpeople whose powers are exhausted by day and those who are used up by night this alternation may be effected in various ways eg it may be so arranged that part of the workers are one week employed on daywork the next week on nightwork it is well known that this relay system this alternation of two sets of workers held full sway in the fullblooded youthtime of the english cotton manufacture and that at the present time it still flourishes among others in the cotton spinning of the moscow district this 24 hours process of production exists today as a system in many of the branches of industry of great britain that are still free in the blastfurnaces forges platerolling mills and other metallurgical establishments in england wales and scotland the workingtime here includes besides the 24 hours of the 6 workingdays a great part also of the 24 hours of sunday the workers consist of men and women adults and children of both sexes the ages of the children and young persons run through all intermediate grades from 8 in some cases from 6 to 18 in some branches a f indus try the girls and women work through the night together with the males   


section 5 the struggle for a normal workingday compulsory laws for the extension of the
workingday from the middle of the 14th to the end of the 17th century

        what is a workingday what is the length of time during which capital may consume the labourpower whose daily value it buys how far may the workingday be extended beyond the workingtime necessary for the reproduction of labourpower itself it has been seen that to these questions capital replies the workingday contains the full 24 hours with the deduction of the few hours of repose without which labourpower absolutely refuses its services again hence it is selfevident that the labourer is nothing else his whole life through than labourpower that therefore all his disposable time is by nature and law labourtime to be devoted to the selfexpansion of capital time for education for intellectual development for the fulfilling of social functions and for social intercourse for the freeplay of his bodily and mental activity even the rest time of sunday and that in a country of sabbatarians moonshine but in its blind unrestrainable passion its werewolf hunger for surpluslabour capital oversteps not only the moral but even the merely physical maximum bounds of the workingday it usurps the time for growth development and healthy maintenance o f the body it steals the time required for the consumption of fresh air and sunlight it higgles over a mealtime incorporating it where possible with the process of production itself so that food is given to the labourer as to a mere means of production as coal is supplied to the boiler grease and oil to the machinery it reduces the sound sleep needed for the restoration reparation refreshment of the bodily powers to just so many hours of torpor as the revival of an organism absolutely exhausted renders essential it is not the normal maintenance of the labourpower which is to determine the limits of the workingday it is the greatest possible daily expenditure of labourpower no matter how diseased compulsory and painful it may be which is to determine the limits of the labourers period of repose capital cares nothing for the length of life of labourpower all that concerns it is simply and solely the maximum of labourpower that can be rendered fluent in a workingday it attains this end by shortening the extent of the labourers life as a greedy farmer snatches increased produce from the soil by robbing it of its fertility

        the capitalistic mode of production essentially the production of surplusvalue the absorption of surpluslabour produces thus with the extension of the workingday not only the deterioration of human labourpower by robbing it of its normal moral and physical conditions of development and function it produces also the premature exhaustion and death of this lab ourpower itself it extends the labourers time of production during a given period by shortening his actual lifetime

        but the value of the labourpower includes the value of the commodities necessary for the reproduction of the worker or for the keeping up of the workingclass if then the unnatural extension of the workingday that capital necessarily strives after in its unmeasured passion for selfexpansion shortens the length of life of the individual labourer and therefore the duration of his labourpower the forces used up have to be replaced at a more rapid rate and the sum of the expenses for the reproduction of labourpower will be greater just as in a machine the part of its value to be reproduced every day is greater the more rapidly the machine is worn out it would seem therefore that the interest of capital itself points in the direction of a normal workingday

        the slaveowner buys his labourer as he buys his horse if heloses his slave he loses capital that can only be restored by new outlay in the slavemart but the ricegrounds of georgia or the swamps of the mississippi may be fatally injurious to the human constitution but the waste of human life which the cultivation of these districts necessitates is not so great that it cannot be repaired from the teeming preserves of virginia and kentucky considerations of economy moreover which under a natural system afford some security for human treatment by identifying the masters interest with the slaves preservation when once trading in slaves is practised become reasons for racking to the uttermost the toil of the slave for when his place can at once be supplied from foreign preserves the duration of his life becomes a matter of less moment than its productiveness while it lasts it is accordingly a maxim of slave management in slaveimporting countries that the most effective economy is that which takes out of the human chattel in the shortest space of time the utmost amount of exertion it is capable of putting forth it is in tropical culture where annual profits often equal the whole capital of plantations that negro life is most recklessly sacrificed it is the agriculture of the west indies which has been for centuries prolific of fabulous wealth that has engulfed millions of the african race it is in cuba at this day whose revenues are reckoned by millions and whose planters are princes that we see in the servile class the coarsest fare the most exhausting and unremitting toil and even the absolute destruction of a portion of its numbers every year

        mutato nomine de te fabula narrator  for slavetrade read labourmarket for kentucky and virginia ireland and the agricultural districts of england scotland and wales for africa germany we heard how overwork thinned the ranks of the bakers in london nevertheless the london labourmarket is always overstocked with german and other candidates for death in the bakeries pottery as we saw is one of the shortestlived industries is there any want therefore of potters josiah wedgwood the inventor of modern pottery himself originally a common workman said in 1785 before the house of commons that the whole trade employed from 15000 to 20000 people in the year 1861 the population alone of the town centres of this industry in great britain numbered 101 302 the cotton trade has existed for ninety years     i t has existed for three generations of the english race and i believe i may safely say that during that period it has destroyed nine generations o f factory operatives   

        what experience shows to the capitalist generally is a constant excess of population ie an excess in relation to the momentary requirements of surpluslab ourabsorbing capital although this excess is made up o f generations of human beings stunted shortlived swiftly replacing each other plucked so to say before maturity and indeed experience shows to the intelligent observer with what swiftness and grip the capitalist m ode of production dating historically speaking only from yesterday has seized the vital power of the people by the very rootshows how the degeneration of the industrial population is only retarded by the constant absorption of primitive and physically uncorrupted elements from the country shows how even the country labourers in spite of fresh air and the principle of natural selection that works so powerfully amongst them and only permits the survival of the strongest are already beginning to die off capital that has such good reasons for denying the sufferings of the legions of workers that surround it is in practice moved as much and as little by the sight of the coming degradation and final depopulation of the human race as by the probable fall of the earth into the sun in every stockjobbing swindle every one knows that some time or other the crash must come but every one hope that it may fall on the head of his neighbour after he himself has caught the shower of gold and placed it in safety apres moi ie deluge is the watchword of every capitalist and of every capitalist nation hence capital is reckless o f the health or length of life of the labourer unless under compulsion from society

        to the out cry as to the physical and mental degradation the premature death the torture of overwork it answers ought these to trouble us since they increase our profits but looking at things as a whole all this does not indeed depend on the good or ill will of the individual capitalist free competition brings out the inherent laws of capitalist production in the shape of external coercive laws having power over every individual capitalist the establishment of a normal workingday is the result of centuries of struggle between capitalist and labourer the history of this struggle shows two opposed tendencies compare eg the english factory legislation of our time with the english labour statutes from the 14th century to when into the middle of the 18thwhilst the modern factory acts compulsorily shortened the workingday the earlier statutes tried to lengthen it by compulsion of course the pretensions of capital in embryowhen beginning to grow it secures the right of absorbing a quantum sufficit of surpluslabour not merely by the force of economic relations but by the help of the stateappear very modest when put face to face with the concessions that growling and struggling it has to make in its adult condition it takes centuries ere the free labourer thanks to the development of capitalistic production agrees ie is compelled by social conditions to sell the whole of his active life his very capacity for work for the price of the necessaries of life his birthright for a mess of pottage hence it is natural that the lengthening of the workday which capital from the middle of the 14th to the end of the 17th century tries to impose by state measures on adult labourers approximately coincides with the shortening of the workingday which in the second half of the19th century has here and there been effected by the state to prevent the coining of childrens blood into capital that which today eg in the state of massachusetts until recently the freest state of the northamerican republic has been proclaimed a s the statutory limit of the labour of children under 12 was in england even in the middle of the 17th century the normal workingday of ablebodiedartisans robust labourers athletic blacksmiths   



part iv production of relative surplusvalue
chapter xii the concept of relative surplusvalue

        that portion of the workingday which merely produces an equivalent for the value paid by the capitalist for h is labourpower has up to this point been treated by us as a constant magnitude and such in fact it is under given conditions of production and at a given stage in the economic development of society beyond this his necessary labourtime the labourer we saw could continue to work for 2 3 4 6 c hours the rate of surplusvalue and the length of the workingday depended on the magnitude of this prolongation though the necessary labourtime was constant we saw on the other hand that the total workingday was variable now suppose we have a workingday whose length and whose apportionment between necessary labour and surpluslabour are given let the whole line a c abc represent for example a workingday of 12 hours the portion of a b 10 hours of necessary labour and the portion b c 2 hours of surpluslabour how now can the production of surplusvalue be increased ie how can the surplus labour be prolonged without or independently of any prolongation of a c

        although the length of a c is given b c appears to be capable of prolongation if not by extension beyond its end c which is also the end of the workingday a c yet at all events by pushing back its startingpoint b in the direction of a assume that bb in the line a b b c is equal to half of b c
a                              b’         b               c
or to one hours labourtime if now in a c the workingday of 12hours we move the point b to b b c becomes b c the surpluslabour increases b y one half from 2 hours to 3 hours although the workingday remains as before at 12 hours this extension of the surplus labourtime from b c to b c from 2 hours to 3 h ours is however evidently impossible without a simultaneous contraction of the necessary labourtime from a b into a b from 10 hours to 9 hours the prolongation of the surpluslabour would correspond to a shortening of the necessary labour or a portion of the labourtime previously consumed in reality for the labourers own benefit would be converted into labourtime for the benefit of the capitalist there would be an alteration not in the length of the workingday but in its division into necessary labourtime and surplus labourtime

        on the other hand it is evident that the duration of the surplus labour is given when the length of the workingday and the value of labourpower are given the value of labourpower ie the labourtime requisite to produce labourpower determines the labourtime necessary for the reproduction o f that value if one workinghour be embodied in sixpence and the value of a days labourpower be five shillings the labourer must work 10 hours a day in order to replace the value paid by capital for his labourpower or to produce an equivalent for the value of his daily necessary means of subsistence given the value of these means of subsistence the value of his labourpower is given and given the value of his labourpower the duration of his necessary labourtime is given the duration of the surpluslabour however is arrived at by subtracting the necessary labourtime from the total workingday ten hours subtracted from twelve leave two and it is not easy to see how under the given conditions the surpluslabour can possibly be prolonged beyond two hours no doubt the capitalist can instead of five shillings pay the labourer four shillings and sixpence or even less for the reproduction of this value of four shillings and sixpence nine hours labourtime would suffice and consequently three hours of surpluslabour instead of two would accrue to the capitalist and the surplusvalue would rise from one shilling to eighteen pence this result however would be obtained only by lowering the wages of the labourer below the value of his labourpower with the four shillings and sixpence which he produces in nine hours he commands onetenth less of the necessaries of life than before and consequently the proper reproduction of his labourpower is crippled the surpluslabour would in this case be prolonged only by an overstepping of its normal limits its domain would be extended only by a usurpation of part of the domain of necessary labourtime despite the important part which this method plays in actual practice we are excluded from considering it in this place by our assumption that all commodities including labourpower are bought and sold at their full value granted this it follows that the labourtime necessary for the production of labourpower or for the reproduction of its value cannot be lessened by a fall in the labourers wages below the value of his labourpower but only by a fall in this value itself given the length of the workingday the prolongation of the surpluslabour must of necessity originate in the curtailment of the necessary labourtime the latter cannot arise from the former in the example we have taken it is necessary that the value of labourpower should actually fall by onetenth in order that the necessary labourtime may be diminished by onetenth ie from ten h ours to nine and in order that the surpluslabour may consequently be prolonged from two hours to three

        such a fall in the value of labourpower implies however that the same necessaries of life which w ere formerly produced in ten hours can now be produced in nine hours but this is impossible without an increase in the productiveness of labour for example suppose a shoemaker with given tools makes in one workingday of twelve hours one pair of boots if he must make two pairs in the same time the productiveness of his labour must be doubled and this can not be done except by an alteration in his tools or in his mode of working or in both hence the conditions of production ie his mode of production and the labourprocess itself must be revolutionised by increase in the productiveness of labour we mean generally an alteration in the labourprocess of such a kind as to shorten the labourtime socially necessary for the production of a commodity and to endow a given quantity of labour with the power of producing a greater quantity of usevalue hitherto in treating of surplusvalue arising from a simple prolongation of the workingday we have assumed the mode of production to be given and invariable but when surplusvalue has to be produced by the conversion of necessary labour into surpluslabour it by no means suffices for capital to take over the labourprocess in the form under which it has been historically handed down and then simply to prolong the duration of that process the technical and social conditions of the process and consequently the very mode of production must be revolutionised before the productiveness of labour can be increased by that means alone can the value of labourpower be made to sink and the portion of the workingday necessary for the reproduction of that value be shortened

        the surplusvalue produced by prolongation of the workingday i call absolute surplusvalue on the other hand the surplusvalue arising from the curtailment of the necessary labourtime and from the corresponding alteration in the respective lengths of the two components of the workingday i call relative surplusvalue

        in order to effect a fall in the value of labourpower the increase in the productiveness of labour must seize upon those branches of industry whose products determine the value of labourpower and consequently either belong to the class of customary means of subsistence or are capable of supplying the place of those means but the value of a commodity is determined not only by the quantity of labour which the labourer directly bestows upon that commodity but also by the labour contained in the means of production for instance the value of a p air of boots depends not only on the cobblers labour but also on the value of the leather wax thread c hence a fall in the value of labourpower is also brought about by an increase in the productiveness of labour and by a corresponding cheapening of commodities in those industries which supply the instruments of labour and the raw material that form the material elements of the constant capital required for producing the necessaries of life but an increase in the productiveness of labour in those branches of industry which supply neither the necessaries of life nor the means of production for such necessaries leaves the value of labourpower undisturbed

        the cheapened commodity of course causes only a pro tanto fall in the value of labourpower a fall proportional to the extent of that commodity employment in the reproduction of labourpower shirts for instance are a necessary means of subsistence but are only one out of many the totality of the necessaries of life consists however of various commodities each the product of a distinct industry and the value of each of those commodities enter as a component part into the value of labourpower this latter value decreases with the decrease of the labourtime necessary for its reproduction the total decrease being the sum of all the different curtailments of labourtime effected in those various and distinct industries this general result is treated here as if it were the immediate result directly aimed at in each individual case whenever an individual capitalist cheapens shirts for instance by increasing the productiveness of labour he by no means necessarily aims at reducing the value of labourpower and shortening pro tanto the necessary labourtime but it is only in so far as he ultimately contribtites to this result that he assists in raising the general rate of surplusvalue the general and necessary tendencies of capital must be distinguished from their forms of manifestation

        it is not our intention to consider here the way in which the laws immanent in capitalist production manifest themselves in the movements of individual masses of capital where they assert themselves as coercive laws of competition and are brought home to the mind and consciousness of the individual capitalist as the directing motives of his operations but this much is clear a scientific analysis of competition is not possible before we have a conception of the inner nature of capital just as the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies are not intelligible to any but him who is acquainted with their real motions motions which are not directly perceptible by the senses nevertheless for the better comprehension of the production of relative surplusvalue we may add the following remarks in which we assume nothing more than the results we have already obtained

        if one hours labour is embodied in sixpence a value of six shillings will be produced in a workingday of 12 hours suppose that with the prevailing productiveness of labour 12 articles are produced in these 12 hours let the value of the means of production used up in each article be sixpence under these circumstances each article costs one shilling sixpence for the value of the means of production and sixpence for the value newly added in working with those means now let some one capitalist contrive to double the productiveness of labour and to produce in the workingday of 12 hours 24 instead of 12 such articles the value of the means of production remaining the same the value of each article will fall to nine pence made up of sixpence for the value of the means of production and three pence for the value newly added by the labour despite the doubled productiveness of labour the days labour creates as before a new value of six shillings and no more which however is now spread over twice as many articles of this value each article now has embodied in it 124th instead of 112th threepence instead of sixpence or what amounts to the same thing only half an hours instead of a whole hours labourtime is now added to the means of production while they are being transformed into each article the individual value of these articles is now below their social value in other words they have cost less labourtime than the great bulk of the same article produced under the average social conditions each article costs on an average one shilling and represents 2 hours of social labour but under the altered mode of production it costs only nine pence or contains only 1 12 hours labour the real value of a commodity is however not its individual value but its social value that is to say the real value is not measured by the labourtime that the article in each individual case costs the producer but by the labourtime socially required for its production if therefore the capitalist who applies the new method sells his commodity at its social value of one shilling he sells it for three pence above its individual value and thus realises an extra surplusvalue of three pence on the other hand the workingday of 12 hours is as regards him now represented by 24 articles instead of 12 hence in order to get rid of the product of one workingday the demand must be double what it was ie the market must become twice as extensive other things being equal his commodities can command a more extended market only by a diminution of their prices he will therefore sell them above their individual but under their social value say at ten pence each by this means he still squeezes an extra surplusvalue of one penny out of each this augmentation of surplusvalue is pocketed by him whether his commodities belong or not to the class of necessary means of subsistence that participate in determining the general value of labourpower hence independently of this latter circumstance there is a motive for each individual capitalist to cheapen his commodities by increasing the productiveness of labour

        nevertheless even in this case the increased production of surplus value arises from the curtailment of the necessary labourtime and from the corresponding prolongation of the surpluslabour let the necessary labourtime a mount to 10 hours the value of a days labourpower to five shillings the surplus labourtime to 2 hours and the daily surplusvalue to one shilling but the capitalist now produces 24 articles which he sells at ten pence apiece making twenty shillings in all since the value of the means of production is twelve shillings 14 25 of these articles merely rep lace the constant capital advanced the labour of the 12 hours workingday is represented by the remaining 9 35 articles since the price of the labourpower is five shillings 6 articles represent the necessary labourtime and 3 35 articles the surpluslabour the ratio of the necessary labour to the surpluslabour which under average social conditions was 51 is now only 53 the same result may be arrived at in the following way the value of the product of the workingday of 12 hours is twenty shillings of this sum twelve shillings belong to the value of the means of production a value that merely reappears there remain eight shillings which are the expression in money of the value newly created during the working day this sum is greater than the sum in which average social labour of the same kind is expressed twelve hours of the latter labour are expressed by six shillings only the exceptionally productive labour operates as intensified labour it creates in equal periods of time greater values than average social labour of the same kind but our capitalist still continues to pay as before only five shillings as the value of a days labourpower hence instead of 10 hours the labourer need now work only 7 45 hours in order to reproduce this value his surpluslabour is therefore increased by 2 45 hours and the surplusvalue he produces grows from one into three shillings hence the capitalist who applies the improved method of production appropriates to surpluslabour a greater portion of the workingday than the other capitalists in the same trade he does individually what the whole body of capitalists engaged in producing relative surplusvalue do collectively on the other hand however this extra surplusvalue vanishes as soon as the new method of production has become general and has consequently caused the difference between the individual value of the cheapened commodity and its social value to vanish the law of the determination of value by labourtime a law which brings under its sway the individual capitalist who applies the new method of production by compelling him to sell his goods under their social value this same law acting as a coercive law of competition forces his competitors to adopt the new method the general rate of surplusvalue is therefore ultimately affected by the whole process only when the increase in the productiveness of labour has seized upon those branches of production that are connected with and has cheapened those commodities that form part of the necessary means of subsistence and are therefore elements of the value of labourpower

        the value of commodities is in inverse ratio to the productiveness of labour and so too is the value of labourpower because it depends on the values of commodities relative surplusvalue is on the contrary directly proportional to that productiveness it rises with rising and falls with falling productiveness the value of money being assumed to be constant an average social workingday of 12 hours always produces the same new value six shillings no matter how this sum may be apportioned between surplusvalue and wages but if in consequence of increased productiveness the value of the necessaries of life fall and the value of a days labourpower be thereby reduced from five shillings to three the surplusvalue increases from one shilling to three ten hours were necessary for the reproduction of the value of the labourpower now only six are required four hours have been set free and can be annexed to the domain of surpluslabour hence there is immanent in capital an inclination and constant tendency to heighten the productiveness of labour in order to cheapen commodities and by such cheapening to cheapen the labourer himself

        the value of a commodity is in itself of no interest to the capitalist what alone interests him is the surplusvalue that dwells in it and is realisable by sale realisation of the surplusvalue necessarily carries with it the refunding of the value that was advanced now since relative surplusvalue increases in direct proportion to the development o f the productiveness of labour while on the other hand the value of commodities diminishes in the same proportion since one and the same process cheapens commodities and augments the surplusvalue contained in them we have here the solution of the riddle why does the capitalist whose sole concern is the production of exchangevalue continually strive to depress the exchangevalue of commodities a riddle with which quesnay one of the founders of political economy tormented his opponents and to which they could give him no answer you acknowledge he says that the more expenses and the cost of labour can in the manufacture of industrial products be reduced without injury to production the more advantageous is such reduction because it diminishes the price of the finished article and yet you believe that the production of wealth which arises from the labour of the workpeople consists in the augmentation of the exchange value of their products

        the shortening of the workingday is therefore by no means what is aimed at in capitalist production when labour is economized by increasing its productiveness it is only the shortening of the labourtime necessary for the production of a definite quantity of commodities that is aimed at the fact that the workman when the productiveness of his labour has been increased produces say 10 times as many commodities as before and thus spends one tenth as much labourtime on each by no means prevents him from continuing to work 12 hours as before nor from producing in those 12 hours 1200 articles instead of 120 nay more his working day may be prolonged at the same time so as to make him produce say 1400 articles in 14 hours in the treatises therefore of economists of the stamp of macculloch ure senior and tutti quanti we may read upon one page that the labourer owes a debt of gratitude to capital for developing his productiveness because the necessary labourtime is thereby shortened and on the next page that h e must prove his gratitude by working in future for 15 hours instead o f 10 the object of all development of the productiveness of labour within the limits of capitalist production is to shorten that part of the workingday during which the workman must labour for his own benefit and by that very shortening to lengthen the other part of the day during which he is at liberty to work gratis for the capitalist how far this result is also attainable without cheapening commodities will appear from an examination of the particular modes of producing relative surplusvalue to which examination we now proceed


chapter xiii cooperation

        capitalist production only then really begins as we have already seen when each individual capital employs simultaneously a comparatively large number of labourers when consequently the labourprocess is carried on on an extensive scale and yields relatively large quantities of products a greater number of labourers working together at the same time in one place or if you will in the same field of labour in order to produce the same sort of commodity under the mastership of one capitalist constitutes both historically and logically the startingpoint of capitalist production with regard to the mode of production itself manufacture in its strict meaning is hardly to be distinguished in its earliest stages from the handicraft trades of the guilds otherwise than by the greater number of workmen simultaneously employed by one and the same individual capital the workshop of the medireval master handicraftsman is simply enlarged   

        we saw in a former chapter that a certain minimum amount of capital was necessary in order that the number of labourers simultaneously employed and consequently the amount of surplusvalue produced might suffice to liberate the employer himself from manual labour to convert him from a small master into a capitalist and thus formally to establish capitalist production we now see that a certain minimum amount is a necessary condition for the conversion of numerous isolated and independent processes into one combined social process

        we also saw that at first the subjection of labour to capital was only a formal result of the fact that the labourer instead of working for himself works for and consequently under the capitalist by the cooperation of numerous wagelabourers the sway of capital develops into a requisite for carrying on the labourprocess itself into a real requisite of production that a capitalist should command on the field of production is now as indispensable as that a general should command on the field of battle

        all combined labour on a large scale requires more or less a directing authority in order to secure the harmonious working of the individual activities and to perform the general functions that have their origin in the action of the combined organism as distinguished from the action of its separate organs a single violin player is his own conductor an orchestra requires a separate ones the work of directing superintending and adjusting becomes one of the functions of capital from the moment that the labour under the control of capital becomes cooperative once a function of capital it acquires special characteristics

        the directing motive the end and aim of capitalist production is to extract the greatest possible amount of surplusvalue and consequently to exploit labourpower to the greatest possible extent as the number of the cooperating labourers increases so too does their resistance to the domination of capital and with it the necessity for capital to overcome this resistance by counterpressure the control exercised by the capitalist is not only a special function due to the nature of the social labourprocess and peculiar to that process but it is at the same time a function of the exploitation of a social labourprocess and is consequently rooted in the unavoidable antagonism between the exploiter and the living and labouring raw material he exploits

        again in proportion to the increasing mass o f the means of production now no longer the property of the labourer but of the capitalist the necessity increases for some effective control over the proper application of those means moreover the cooperation of wagelabourers is entirely brought about by the capital that employs them their union into one single productive body and the establishment of a connexion between their individual functions are matters foreign and external to them are not their own act but the act of the capital that brings and keeps them together hence the connexion existing between their various labours appears to them ideally in the shape of a preconceived plan of the capitalist and practically in the shape of the authority of the same capitalist in the shape of the powerful will of another who subjects their activity to his aims if then the control of the capitalist is in substance twofold by reason of the twofold nature of the process of production itselfwhich on the one hand is a social process for producing usevalues on the other a process for creating surplus valuein form that control is despotic as cooperation extends its scale this despotism takes forms peculiar to itself just as at first the capitalist is relieved from actual labour so 500n as his capital has reached that minimum amount with which capitalist production as such begins so now he hands over the work of direct and constant supervision of the individual workmen and groups of workmen to a special kind of wagelabourer an industrial army of workmen under the command of a capitalist requires like a real army officers managers and sergeants foremen over lookers who while the work is being done command in the name of the capitalist the work of supervision becomes their established and exclusive function when comparing the mode of production of isolated peasants and artisans with production by slavelabour the political economist counts this labour of superintendence among the faux frais of production but when considering the capitalist mode of production he on the contrary treats the work of control made necessary by the cooperative character of the labourprocess as identical with the different work of control necessitated by the capitalist character of that process and the antagonism of interests between capitalist and labourer it is not because he is a leader of industry that a man is a capitalist on the contrary he is a leader of industry because he is a capitalist the leadership of industry is an attribute of capital just as in feudal times the functions of general and judge were attributes of landed property

        the labourer is the owner of his labourpower until he has done bargaining for its sale with the capitalist and he can sell no more than what he hasie his individual isolated labourpower this state of things is in no way altered by the fact that the capitalist instead of buying the labourpower of one man buys that of 100 and enters into separate contracts with 100 unconnected men instead of with one he is at liberty to set the 100 men to work without letting them cooperate he pays them the value of 100 independent labourpowers but he does not pay for the combined labourpower of the hundred being independent of each other the labourers are isolated persons who enter into relations with the capitalist but not with one another this cooperation begins only with the labourprocess but they have then ceased to belong to themselves on entering that process they become incorporated with capital as cooperators as members of a working organism they are but special modes of existence of capital hence the productive power developed by the labourer when working in cooperation is the productive power of capital this power is developed gratuitously whenever the workmen are placed under given conditions and it is capital that places them under such conditions because this power costs capital nothing and because on the other hand the labourer himself does not develop it before his labour belongs to capital it appears as a power with which capital is endowed by naturea productive power that is immanent in capital

        the colossal effects of simple cooperation are to be seen in the gigantic structures of the ancient asiatics egyptians etruscans c it has happened in times past that these oriental states after supplying the expenses of their civil and military establishments have found themselves in possession of a surplus which they could apply to works of magnificence or utility and in the construction of these their command over the hands and arms of almost the entire nonagricultural population has produced stupendous monuments which still indicate their power the teeming valley of the nile produced food for a swarming nonagricultural population and this food belonging to the monarch and the priesthood afforded the means of erecting the mighty monuments which filled the land     in moving the colossal statues and vast masses of which the transport creates wonder human labour almost alone was prodigally used     the number of the labourers and the concentration of their efforts sufficed we see mighty coral reefs rising from the depths of the ocean into islands and firm land yet each individual depositor is puny weak and contemptible the nonagricultural labourers of an asiatic monarchy have little but their individual bodily exertions to bring to the task but their number is their strength and the power of directing these masses gave rise to the palaces and temples the pyramids and the armies of gigantic statues of which the remains astonish and perplex us it is that confinement of the revenues which feed them to one or a few hands which makes such undertakings possible this power of asiatic and egyptian kings etruscan theocrats c has in modern society been transferred to the capitalist whether he be an isolated or as in jointstock companies a collective capitalist

        cooperation such as we find it at the dawn of human development among races who live by the chase or say in the agriculture of indian communities is based on the one hand on ownership in common of the means of production and on the other hand on the fact that in those cases each individual has no more torn himself off from the navelstring of his tribe or community than each bee has freed itself from connexion with the hive such cooperation is distinguished from capitalistic cooperation b y both of the above characteristics the sporadic application of cooperation on a large scale in ancient times in the middle ages and in modern colonies reposes on relations of dominion and servitude principally on slavery the capitalistic form on the contrary presupposes from first to last the free wagelabourer who sells his labour power to capital historically however this form is developed in opposition to peasant agriculture and to the carrying on of independent handicrafts whether in guilds or not from the standpoint of these capitalistic cooperation does not manifest itself as a particular historical form of cooperation but cooperation itself appears to be a historical form peculiar to and specifically distinguishing the capitalist process of production

        just as the social productive power of labour that is developed by cooperation appears to be the productive power of capital so cooperation itself contrasted with the process of production carried on by isolated independent labourers or even by small employers appears to be a specific form of the capitalist process of production it is the first change experienced by the actual labourprocess when subjected to capital this change takes place spontaneously the simultaneous employment of a large number of wagelabourers in one and the same process which is a necessary condition of this change also forms the startingpoint of capitalist production this point coincides with the birth of capital itself if then on the one hand the capitalist mode of production presents itself to us historically as a necessary condition to the transformation of the labourprocess into a social process so on the other hand this social form of the labourprocess presents itself as a method employed by capital for the more profitable exploitation of labour by increasing that labours productiveness

        in the elementary form under which we have hitherto viewed it cooperation is a necessary concomitant of all production on a large scale but it does not in itself represent a fixed form characteristic of a particular epoch in the development of the capitalist mode of production at the most it appears to do so and that only approximately in the handicraftlike beginnings of manufacture and in that kind of agriculture on a large scale which corresponds to the epoch of manufacture and is distinguished from peasant agriculture mainly by the number of the labourers simultaneously employed and by the mass of the means of production concentrated for their use simple cooperation is always the prevailing form in those branches of production in which capital operates on a large scale and division of labour and machinery play but a subordinate part

        cooperation ever constitutes the fundamental form of the capitalist mode of production nevertheless the elementary form of cooperation continues to subsist as a particular form of capitalist production side by side with the more developed forms of that mode of production


chapter xiv division of labour and manufacture
section 1 twofold origin of manufacture

        that cooperation which is based on division of labour assumes its typical form in manufacture and is the prevalent characteristic form of the capitalist process of production throughout the manufacturing period properly so called that period roughly speaking extends from the middle of the 16th to the last third of the 18th century

manufacture takes its rise in two ways

         1 by the assemblage in one workshop under the control of a single capitalist of labourers belonging to various independent handicrafts but through whose hands a given article must pass on its way to completion a carriage for example was formerly the product of the labour of a great number of independent artificers such as wheelwrights harnessmakers tailors locksmiths upholsterers turners fringemakers glaziers painters polishers gilders c in the manufacture of carriages however all these different artificers are assembled in one building where they work into one anothers hands   

         2 manufacture also arises in a way exactly the reverse of thisnamely by one capitalist employing simultaneously in one workshop a number of artificers who all do the same or the same kind of work such as making paper type or needles this is cooperation in its most elementary form each of these artificers with the help perhaps of one or two apprentices makes the entire commodity and he consequently performs in succession all the operations necessary for its production he still works in his old handicraftlike way but very soon external circumstances cause a different use to be made of the concentration of the workmen on one spot and of the simultaneousness of their work an increased quantity o f the article has perhaps to be delivered within a given time the work is therefore redistributed instead of each man being allowed to perform all the various operations in succession these operations are changed into disconnected isolated ones carried on side by side each is assigned to a different artificer and the whole of them together are performed simultaneously by the cooperating workmen   

        the mode in which manufacture arises its growth out of handicrafts is therefore twofold on the one hand it arises from the union of various independent handicrafts which become stripped of their independence and specialised to such an extent as to be reduced to mere supplementary partial processes in the production of one particular commodity on the other hand it arises from the cooperation of artificers of one handicraft it splits up that particular handicraft into its various detail operations isolating and making these operations independent of one another up to the point where each becomes the exclusive function of a particular labourer on the one hand therefore manufacture either introduces division of labour into a process of production or further develops that division on the other hand it unites together handicrafts that were formerly separate but whatever may have been its particular startingpoint its final form is invariably the samea productive mechanism whose parts are human beings   


section 2 the detail labourer and his implements

        if we now go more into detail it is in the first place clear that a labourer who all his life performs one and the same simple operation converts his whole body into the automatic specialised implement of that operation consequently he takes less time in doing it than the artificer who performs a whole series of operations in succession but the collective labourer who constitutes the living mechanism of manufacture is made up solely of such specialized detail labourers hence in comparison with the independent handicraft more is produced in a given time or the productive power of labour is increased moreover when once this fractional work is established as the exclusive function of one person the methods it employs become perfected the workmans continued repetition of the same simple act and the concentration of his attention on it teach him by experience how to attain the desired effects with the minimum of exertion but since there are always several generations of labourers living at one time and working together at the manufacture of a given article the technical skill the tricks of the trade thus acquired become established and are accumulated and handed down manufacture in fact produces the skill of the detail labourer by reproducing and systematically driving to an extreme within the workshop the naturally developed differentiation of trades which it found ready to hand in society at large on the other hand the conversion of fractional work into the lifecalling of one man corresponds to the tendency shown by earlier societies to make trades hereditary either to petrify them into castes or whenever definite historical conditions beget in the individual a tendency to vary in a manner incompatible with the nature of castes  to ossify them into guilds   

        an artificer who performs one after another the various fractional operations in the production of a finished article must at one time change his place at another his tools the transition from one operation to another interrupts the flow of his labour and creates so to say gaps in his workingday these gaps close up as soon as he is tied to one and the same operation all day long they vanish in proportion as the changes in his work diminish the resulting increased productive power is owing either to an increased expenditure of labourpower in a given timeie to increased intensity of labouror to a decrease in the amount of labourpower unproductively consumed the extra expenditure of power demanded by every transition from rest to motion is made up for by prolonging the duration of the normal velocity when once acquired on the other hand constant labour of one uniform kind disturbs the intensity and flow of a mans animal spirits which find recreation and delight in mere change of activity   

        early in the manufacturing period the principle of lessening the necessary labourtime in the production of commodities was accepted and formulated and the use of machines especially for certain simple first processes that have to be conducted on a very large scale and with the application of great force sprang up here and there thus at an early period in paper manufacture the tearing up of the rags was done by papermills and in metal works the pounding of the ores was effected by stamping mills the roman empire had handed down the elementary form of all machinery in the waterwheel


        the handicraft period bequeathed to us the great inventions of the compass of gunpowder of typeprinting and of the automatic clock but on the whole machinery played that subordinate part which adam smith assigns to it in comparison with division of labour the sporadic use of machinery in the 17th century was of the greatest importance because it supplied the great mathematicians of that time with a practical basis and stimulant to the creation of the science of mechanics

        the collective labourer formed by the combination of a number of detail labourers is the machinery specially characteristic of the manufacturing period the various operations that are performed in turns by the producer of a commodity and coalesce one with another during the progress of production lay claim to him in various ways in one operation he must exert more strength in another more skill in another more attention and the same individual does not possess all these qualities in an equal degree after manufacture has once separated made independent and isolated the various operations the labourers are divided classified arid grouped according to their predominating qualities if their natural endowments are on the one hand the foundation on which the division of labour is built up on the other hand manufacture once introduced develops in them new powers that are by nature fitted only for limited and special functions the collective labourer now possesses in an equal degree of excellence all the qualities requisite for production and expends them in the most economical manner by exclusively employing all his organs consisting of particular labourers or groups of labourers in performing their special functions the onesidedness and the deficiencies of the detail labourer become perfections when he is a part of the collective labourer the habit of doing only one thing converts him into a never failing instrument while his connexian with the whale mechanism campels him to work with the regularity of the parts of a machine

        since the collective labourer has functions bath simple and compiex bath high and law his members the individual labour powers require different degrees of training and must therefore have different values manufacture therefore develops a hierarchy of labourpowers to which there corresponds a scale of wages if the one hand the individual labourers are appropriated and annexed far life by a limited function and the other hand the various operations of the hierarchy are parceled out among the labourers according to bath their natural and their acquired capabilities every process of production however requires certain simple manipulations which every man is capable of doing they too are now severed from their connexian with the mare pregnant moments of activity and ossified into exclusive functions of specially appointed labourers hence manufacture begets in every handicraft that it seizes upon a class of socalled unskilled labaurers a class which handicraft industry strictly excluded   


section 4 division of labour in manufacture and division of labour in society

        we first considered the origin of manufacture then its simple elements then the detail labourer and his implements and finally the totality of the mechanism we shall now lightly touch upon the relation between the division of labour in manufacture and the social division of labour which farms the foundation of all production of commodities

        if we keep labour alone in view we may designate the separation of social production into its main divisions or generaviz agriculture industries c as division of labour in general and the splitting up of these families into species and subspecies as division of labour in particular and the division of labour within the workshop as division of labour in singular or in detail

        division of labour in a society and the corresponding tying dawn of individuals to a particular calling develops itself just as does the division of labour in manufacture from apposite startingpaints within a family and after further development with a tribe there springs up naturally a division of labour caused by differences of sex and age a division that is consequently based an a purely physiological foundation which division enlarges its materials by the expansion of the community by the increase of population and mare especially by the conflicts between different tribes and the subjugation of one tribe by another on the other hand as i have before remarked the exchange of products springs up at the points where different families tribes communities come in contact for in the beginning of civilisation it is not private individuals but families tribes c  that meet on an independent footing different communities find different means of production and different means of subsistence in their natural environment hence their modes of production and of living and their products are different it is this spontaneously developed difference which when different communities come in contact calls forth the mutual exchange of products and the consequent gradual conversion of those products into commodities   

        the foundation of every division of labour that is well developed and brought about by the exchange of commodities is the separation between town and country it may be said that the whole economic history of society is summed up in the movement of this antithesis we pass it over however for the present

        just as a certain number of simultaneously employed labourers are the material prerequisites for division of labour in manufacture so are the number and density of the populations which here correspond to the agglomeration in one workshop a necessary condition for the division of labour in society nevertheless this density is more or less relative a relatively thinly populated country with welldeveloped means of communication has a denser population than a more numerously populated country with badlydeveloped means of communication and in this sense the northern states of the american union for instance are more thickly populated than india

        since the production and the circulation of commodities are the general prerequisites of the capitalist mode of production division of labour in manufacture demands that division of labour in society at large should previously have attained a certain degree of development inversely the former division reacts upon and develops and multiplies the latter simultaneously with the differentiation of the instruments of labour the industries that produce these instruments become more and more differentiated if the manufacturing system seize upon an industry which previously was carried on in connexion with others either as a chief or as a subordinate industry and by one producer these industries immediately separate their connexion and become independent if it seizes upon a particular stage in the p roduction of a commodity the other stages of its production become converted into so many independent industries it has al ready been stated that where the finished article consists merely of a n umber of parts fitted together the detail operations may reestablish themselves as genuine and separate handicrafts in order to carry out more perfectly the division of labour in manufacture a single branch of production is according to the varieties of its raw material or the various forms that one and the same raw material may assume split up into numerous and to some extent entirely new manufactures accordingly in france alone in the first half of the 18th century over 100 different kinds of silk stuffs were woven and in avignon it was law that every apprentice should devote himself to only one sort of fabrication and should not learn the preparation of several kinds of stuff at once the territorial division of labour which confines special b ranches of production to special districts of a country acquires fresh stimulus from the manufacturing system which exploits every special advantage the colonial system and the opening out of the markets of the world both of which are included in the general conditions of existence of the manufacturing period furnish rich material for developing the division of labour in society it is not the place here to go on to show how division of labour seizes upon not only the economic but every other sphere of society and everywhere lays the foundation of that all engrossing system of specialising and sorting men that development in a man of one single faculty at the expense of all other faculties which caused a ferguson the master of adam smith to exclaim we make a nation of helots and have no free citizens

        but in spite of the numerous analogies and links connecting them division of labour in the interior of a society and that in the interior of a workshop differ not only in degree but also in kind the analogy appears most indisputable where there is an invisible bond uniting the various branches of trade for instance the cattlebreeder produces hides the tanner makes the hides into leather and the shoemaker the leather into boots here the thing produced by each of them is but a step towards the final form which is the product of all their labours combined there are besides all the various industries that supply the cattlebreeder the tanner and the shoemaker with the means of production now it is quite possible t o imagine with adam smith that the difference between the above social division of labour and the division in manufacture is merely subjective exists merely for the observer who in a manufacture can see with one glance all the numerous operations being performed on one spot while in the instance given above the spreading out of the work over great areas and the great number of people employed in each branch of labour obscure the connexion but what is it that forms the bond between the independent labours of the cattlebreeder the tanner and the shoemaker it is the fact that their respective products are commodities what on the other hand characterises division of labour in manufactures the fact that the detail labourer produces no commodities it is only the common product of all the detail labourers that becomes a commodity division of labour in society is brought about by the purchase and sale of the products of different branches of industry while the connexion between the detail operations in a workshop is due to the sale of the labourpower of several workmen to one capitalist who applies it as combined labourpower the division of labour in the workshop implies concentration of the means of production in the hands of one capitalist the division of labour in society implies their dispersion among many independent producers of commodities while within the workshop the iron law of proportionality subjects’ definite numbers of workmen to definite functions in the society outside the workshop chance and caprice have full play in distributing the producers and their means of production among the various branches of industry the different spheres of production it is true constantly tend to an equilibrium for on the one hand while each producer of a commodity is bound to produce a usevalue to satisfy a particular social want and while the extent of these wants differs quantitatively still there exists an inner relation which settles their proportions into a regular system and that system one of spontaneous growth and on the other hand the law of the value of commodities ultimately determines how much of its disposable workingtime society can expend on each particular class of commodities but this constant tendency to equilibrium of the various spheres of production is exercised only in the shape of a reaction against the constant upsetting of this equilibrium the a priori system on which the division of labour within the workshop is regularly carried out becomes in the division of labour within the society an a posteriori natureimposed necessity controlling the lawless caprice of the producers and perceptible in the barometrical fluctuations of the marketprices division of labour within the workshop implies the undisputed authority of the capitalist over men that are but parts of a mechanism that belongs to him the division of labour within the society brings into contact independent commodity producers who acknowledge no other authority but that of competition of the coercion exerted by the pressure of their mutual interests just as in the animal kingdom the bellum omnium contra omnes more or less preserves the conditions of existence of every species the same bourgeois mind which praises division of labour in the workshop lifelong annexation of the labourer to a partial operation and his complete subjection to capital as being an organization of labour that increases its productivenessthat same bourgeois mind denounces with equal vigour every conscious attempt to socially control and regulate the process of production as an inroad upon such sacred things as the rights of property freedom and unrestricted play for the bent of the individual capitalist it is very characteristic that the enthusiastic apologists of the factory system have nothing more damning to urge against a general organisation of the labour of society than that it would turn all society into one immense factory

        if in a society with capitalist production anarchy in the social division of labour and despotism in that of the workshop are mutual conditions the one of the other we find on the contrary in those earlier forms of society in which the separation of trades has been spontaneously developed then crystallised and finally made permanent by law on the one hand a specimen of the organization of the labour of society in accordance with an approved and authoritative plan and on the other the entire exclusion of division of labour in the workshop or at all events a mere dwarflike or sporadic and accidental development of the same

        those small and extremely ancient indian communities some of which have continued down to this day are based on possession in common of the land on the blending of agriculture and handicrafts and on an unalterable division of labour which serves whenever a new community is started as a plan and scheme ready cut and dried    the law that regulates the division of labour in the community acts with the irresistible authority of a law of nature at the same time that each individual artificer the smith the carpenter and so on conducts in his workshop all the operations of his handicraft in the traditional way but independently and without recognising any authority over him the simplicity of the organisation for production in these selfsufficing communities that constantly reproduce themselves in the same form and when accidentally destroyed spring up again on the spot and with the same namethis simplicity supplies the key to the secret of the unchangeableness of asiatic societies an unchangeableness in such striking contrast with the constant dissolution and refounding of asiatic states and the neverceasing changes of dynasty the structure of the economic elements of society remains untouched by the stormclouds of the political sky

        the rules of the guilds as i have said before by limiting most strictly the number of apprentices and journeymen that a single master could employ prevented him from becoming a capitalist moreover he could not employ his journeymen in many other handicrafts than the one in which he was a master the guilds zealously repelled every encroachment by the capital of merchants the only form of free capital with which they came in contact a merchant could buy every kind of commodity but labour as a commodity he could not buy he existed only on sufferance as a dealer in the products of the handicrafts if circumstances called for a further division of labour the existing guilds split themselves up into varieties or founded new guilds by the side of the old ones all this however without concentrating various handicrafts in a single workshop hence the guild organisation however much it may have contributed by separating isolating and perfecting the handicrafts to create the material conditions for the existence of manufacture excluded division of labour in the workshop on the whole the labourer and his means of production remained closely united like the snail with its shell and thus there wanted the principal basis of manufacture the separation of the labourer from his means of production and the conversion of these means into capital

        while division of labour in society at large whether such division be brought about or not by exchange of commodities is common to economic formations of society the most diverse division of labour in the workshop as practised by manufacture is a special creation of the capitalist mode of production alone


section 5 the capitalistic character of manufacture

         an increased number of labourers under the control of one capitalist is the natural startingpoint as well of cooperation generally as of manufacture in particular but the division of labour in manufacture makes this increase in the number of workmen a technical necessity the minimum number that any given capitalist is bound to employ is here prescribed by the previously established division of labour on the other hand the advantages of further division are obtainable only by adding to the number of workmen and this can be done only by adding multiples of the various detail groups but an increase in the variable component of the capital employed necessitates an increase in its constant component too in the workshops implements c and in particular in the raw material the call for which grows quicker than the number of workmen the quantity of it consumed in a given time by a given amount of labour increases in the same ratio as does the productive power of that labour in consequence of its division hence it is a law based on the very nature of manufacture that the minimum amount of capital which is bound to be in the hands of each capitalist must keep increasing in other words that the transformation into capital of the social means of production and subsistence must keep extending

        in manufacture as well as in simple cooperation the collective working organism is a form of existence of capital the mechanism that is made up of numerous individual detail labourers belongs to the capitalist hence the productive power resulting from a combination of labours appears to be the productive power of capital manufacture proper not only subjects the previously independent workman to the discipline and command of capital but in addition creates a hierarchic gradation of the workmen themselves while simple cooperation leaves the mode of working by the individual for the most part unchanged manufacture thoroughly revolutionizes it and seizes labourpower by its very roots it converts the labourer into a crippled monstrosity by forcing his detail dexterity at the expense of a world of productive capabilities and instincts just as in the states of la plata they butcher a whole beast for the sake of his hide or his tallow not only is the detail work distributed to the different individuals but the individual himself is made the automatic motor of a fractional operation and the absurd fable of menenius agrippa which makes man a mere fragment of his own body becomes realised if at first the workman sells his labourpower to capital because the material means of producing a commodity fail him now his very labourpower refuses its services unless it has been sold to capital its functions can be exercised only in an environment that exists in the workshop of the capitalist after the sale by nature unfitted to make anything independently the manufacturing labourer develops productive activity as it mere appendage of the capitalists workshop as the chosen people bore in their features the sign manual of jehovah so division of labour brands the manufacturing workman as the property of capital

        the knowledge the judgment and the will which though in ever so small a degree are practised by the independent peasant or handicraftsman  in the same way as the savage makes the whole art of war consist in the exercise of his personal cunningthese faculties are now required only for the workshop as a whole intelligence in production expands in one direction because it vanishes in many others that is lost by the detail labourers is concentrated in the capital that employs them it is a result of the division of labour in manufactures that the labourer is brought face to face with the intellectual potencies of the material process of production as the property of another and as a ruling power this separation begins in simple cooperation where the capitalist represents to the single workman the oneness and the will of the associated labour it is developed in manufacture which cuts down the labourer into a detail labourer it is completed in modern industry which makes science a productive force distinct from labour and presses it into the service of capital

        in manufacture in order to make the collective labourer and through him capital rich in social productive power each labourer must be made poor in individual productive powers ignorance is the mother of industry as well as of superstition reflection and fancy are subject to err but a habit of moving the hand or the foot is independent of either manufactures accordingly prosper most where the mind is least consulted and where the workshop may    be considered as an engine the parts of which are men  as a matter of fact some few manufacturers in the middle of the 18th century preferred for certain operations that were trade secrets to employ halfidiotic persons

        the understandings of the greater part of men says adam smith are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments the man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations    has no occasion to exert his understanding     he generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become after describing the stupidity of the detail labourer he goes on the uniformity of his stationary life naturally corrupts the courage of his mind    it corrupts even the activity of his body and renders him incapable of exerting his strength with vigour and perseverance in any other employments than that to which he has been bred his dexterity at his own particular trade seems in this manner to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual social and martial virtues but in every improved and civilised society this is the state into which the labouring poor that is the great body of the people must necessarily fall for preventing the complete deterioration of the great mass of the people by division of labour a smith recommends education of the people by the state but prudently and in homeopathic doses g garnier his french translator and commentator who under the first french empire quite naturally developed into a senator quite as naturally opposes him on this point education of the masses he urges violates the first law of the division of labour and with it our whole social system would be proscribed like all other divisions of labour he says that between hand labour and head labour is more pronounced and decided in proportion as society  he rightly uses this word for capital landed property and their state  becomes richer this division of labour like every other is an effect of past and a cause of future progress    ough the government then to work in opposition to this division of labour and to hinder its natural course ought it to expend a part of the public money in the attempt to confound and blend together two classes of labour which are striving after division and separation”

        some crippling of body and mind is inseparable even from division of labour in society as a whole since however manufacture carries this social separation of branches of labour much further and also by its peculiar division attacks the individual at the very roots of his life it is the first to afford the materials for and to give a start to industrial pathology

        to subdivide a man is to execute him if he deserves the sentence to assassinate him if he does not    the subdivision of labour is the assassination of a people

        cooperation based on division of labour in other words manufacture commences as a spontaneous formation as soon as it attains some consistence and extension it becomes the recognized methodical and systematic form of capitalist production history shows how the division of labour peculiar to manufacture strictly so called acquires the best adapted form at first by experience as it were behind the backs of the actors and then like the guild handicrafts strives to hold fast that form when once found and here and there succeeds in keeping it for centuries any alteration in this form except in trivial matters is solely owing to a revolution in the instruments of labour modern manufacture wherever it arisesi do not here allude to modern industry based on machinery—either finds the disjecta membra poetre ready to hand and only waiting to be collected together as is the case in the manufacture of clothes in large towns or it can easily apply the principle of division simply by exclusively assigning the various operations of a handicraft such as bookbinding to particular men in such cases a weeks experience is enough to determine the proportion between the numbers of the hands necessary for the various functions by decomposition of handicrafts by specialisation of the instruments of labour by the formation of detail labourers and by grouping and combining the latter into a single mechanism division of labour in manufacture creates a qualitative gradation and a quantitative proportion in the social process of production it consequently creates a definite organisation of the labour of society and thereby develops at the same time new productive forces in the society in its specific capitalist formand under the given conditions it could take no other form than a capitalistic one manufacture is but a particular method of begetting relative surplusvalue or of augmenting at the expense o f the labourer the selfexpansion of capitalusually called social wealth wealth of nations c it increases the social productive power of labour not only for the benefit of the capitalist instead of for that of the labourer but it does this by crippling the individual labourers it creates new conditions for the lordship of capital over labour if therefore on the one hand it presents itself historically as a progress and as a necessary phase in the economic development of society on the other hand it is a refined and civilised method of exploitation

7 the simple belief in the inventive genius exercised a priori by the individual capitalist in division of labour exists nowadays only among german professors of the stamp of herr roscher who to recompense the capitalist from whose jovian head division of labour sprang ready formed dedicates to him various wages diverse arbeitshihne  the more or less extensive application of division of labour depends on length of purse not on greatness of genius marx

        political economy which as an independent science first sprang into being during the period of manufacture views the social division of labour only from the standpoint of manufacture and sees in it only the means of producing more commodities with a given quantity of labour and consequently of cheapening commodities and hurrying on the accumulation of capital in most striking contrast with this accentuation of quantity and exchangevalue is the attitude of the writers of classical antiquity who hold exclusively by quality and usevalue in consequence of the separation of the social branches of production commodities are better made the various bents and talents of men select a suitable field and without some restraint no important results can be obtained anywhere  hence both product and producer are improved by division of labour if the growth of the quantity produced is occasionally mentioned this is only done with reference to the greater abundance of use values there is not a word alluding to exchangevalue or to the cheapening of commodities this aspect from the standpoint of usevalue alone is taken as well by plato who treats division of labour as the foundation on which the division of society into classes is based as by xenophon who with characteristic bourgeois instinct approaches more nearly to division of labour within the workshop platos republic in so far as division of labour is treated in it as the formative principle of the state is merely the athenian idealization of the egyptian system of castes egypt having served as the model of an industrial country to many of his contemporaries also amongst others to isocrates and it continued to have this importance to the greeks of the roman empire

8 with plato division o f labour within the community is a development from the multifarious requirements and the limited capacities o f individuals the main point with him is that the labourer must adapt himself to the work not the work to the labourer which latter is unavoidable if h e carries on several trades at once thus making one or the other of them subordinate so in thucydides seafaring is an art like any other and cannot as circumstances require b e carried on as a subsidiary occupation nay other subsidiary occupations cannot b e carried on alongside of this one if the work says plato has t o wait for the labourer the critical point in the process is missed and the article spoiled the same platonic idea is found recurring in the protest o f the english bleachers against the clause in the factory act that provides fixed mealtimes for all operatives their business can not wait the convenience of the work men for  in the various operations of singeing washing bleaching mangling calendering and dyeing none o f them can be stopped at a given moment without risk of damage    to enforce the same dinner hour for all the work people might occasionally subject valuable goods to the risk of danger by incomplete operation s  le platonisme ou vatii se nicher marx

        during the manufacturing period proper ie the period during which manufacture is the predominant form taken by capitalist production many obstacles are opposed to the full development of the peculiar tendencies of manufacture although manufacture creates as we have already seen a simple separation of the labourers into skilled and unskilled simultaneously with their hierarchic arrangement in classes yet the number of the unskilled labourers owing to the preponderating influence of the skilled remains very limited although it adapts the detail operations to the various degrees of maturity strength and development of the living instruments of labour thus conducing to exploitation of women and children yet this tendency as a whole is wrecked on the habits and the resistance of the male labourers although the splitting up of handicrafts lowers the cost of forming the workman and thereby lowers his value yet for the more difficult detail work a longer apprenticeship is necessary and even where it would be superfluous is jealously insisted upon by the workmen in england for instance we find the laws of apprenticeship with their seven years probation in full force down to the end of the manufacturing period and they are not thrown on one side till the advent of modern industry since handicraft skill is the foundation of manufacture and since the mechanism of manufacture as a whole possesses no framework apart from the labourers themselves capital is constantly compelled to wrestle with the insubordination of the workmen by the infirmity of human nature says friend ure it happens that the more skilful the workman the more selfwilled and intractable he is apt to become and of course the less fit a component of a mechanical system in which    he may do great damage to the whole hence throughout the whole manufacturing period there runs the complaint of want of discipline among the workmen and had we not the testimony of contemporary writers the simple facts that during the period between the 1 6th century and the epoch of modern industry capital failed to become the master of the whole disposable workingtime of the manufacturing labourers that manufacturers are shortlived and change their locality from one country to another with the emigrating or immigrating workmen these facts would speak volumes order must in one way or another be established exclaims in 1770 the oftcited author of the essay on trade and commerce order reechoes dr andrew ure 66 years later order was wanting in manufacture based on the scholastic dogma of division of labour and arkwright created order

        at the same time manufacture was unable either to seize upon the production of society to its full extent or to revolutionise that production to its very core it towered up as an economic work of art on the broad foundation of the town handicrafts and of the rural domestic industries at a given stage in its development the  narrow technical basis on which manufacture rested came into conflict with requirements of production that were created by manufacture itself

        one of its most finished creations was the workshop for the production of the instruments of labour themselves including especially the complicated mechanical apparatus then already employed a machinefactory says ure displayed t h e division of labour in manifold gradationsthe file the drill the lathe having e a c h its different workman in the order of skill p 21 this workshop the product of the division of labour in manufacture produced in its turnmachines it is they that swept away the handicraftsmans work as the regulating principle of social production thus on the one hand the technical reason for the lifelong annexation of the workman to a detail function is removed on the other hand the fetters that this same principle laid on the dominion of capital fall away


part iv continued  production o f relative surplusvalue
chapter xv machinery and modern industry
section 1 the development of machinery

        john stuart mill says in his principles of political economy  i t is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the days toil of any human being that is however by no means the aim of the capitalistic application of machinery like every other increase in the productiveness of labour machinery is intended to cheapen commodities and by shortening that portion of the workingday in which the labourer works for himself to lengthen the other portion that he gives without an equivalent to the capitalist in short it is a means for producing surplusvalue

        in manufacture the revolution in the mode of production begins with the labourpower in modern industry it begins with the instruments of labour our first inquiry then is how the instruments of labour are converted from tools into machines or what is the difference between a machine and the implements of handicraft we are only concerned here with striking and general characteristics for epochs in the history of society are no more separated from each other by hard and fast lines of demarcation than are geological epochs   


section 3 the proximate effects of machinery on the
workman

        the startingpoint of modern industry is as we have shown the revolution in the instruments of labour and this revolution attains its most highly developed form in the organised system of machinery in a factory before we inquire how human material is incorporated with this objective organism let us consider some general effects of this revolution on the labourer himself

9 mill should have said of any has of human being not fed by other peoples labour for without doubt machinery has greatly increased the number wellto do idlers marx


a appropriation of supplementary labourpower by
capital the employment of women and children

        in so far as machinery dispenses with muscular power it becomes a means of employing labourers of slight muscular strength and those whose bodily development is incomplete but whose limbs are all the more supple the labour of women and children was therefore the first thing sought for by capitalists who used machinery that mighty substitute for labour and labourers was forthwith changed into a means for increasing the number of wagelabourers by enrolling under the direct sway of capital every member of the workmans family without distinction of age or sex compulsory work for the capitalist usurped the place not only of the childrens play but also of free labour at home within moderate limits for the support of the family

        the value o f labourpower was determined not only by the labourtime necessary to maintain the individual adult labourer but also by that necessary to maintain h is family machinery by throwing every member of that family on to the labourmarket spreads the value of the mans labourpower over his whole family it thus depreciates his labourpower to purchase the labourpower of a family of four workers may perhaps cost more than it formerly did to purchase the labourpower of the head of the family but in return four days labour takes the place of one and their price falls in proportion to the excess of the surpluslabour of four over the surpluslabour of one in order that the family may live four people must now not only labour but expend surpluslabour for the capitalist thus we see that machinery while augmenting the human material that forms the principal object of capitals exploiting power at the same time raises the degree 0£ exploitation    


b prolongation of the workingday

        if machinery be the most powerful means for increasing the productiveness of labour ie for shortening the workingtime required in the production of a commodity it becomes in the hands of capital the most powerful means in those industries first invaded by it for lengthening the workingday beyond all bounds set by human nature it creates on the one hand new conditions by which capital is enabled to give free scope to this its constant tendency and on the other hand new motives with which to whet capitals appetite for the labour of others

        in the first place in the form of machinery the implements of labour become automatic things moving and working independent of the workman they are thenceforth an industrial perpetuum mobile that would go on producing forever did it not meet with certain natural obstructions in the weak bodies and the strong wills of its human attendants the automaton as capital and because it is capital is endowed in the person of the capitalist with intelligence and will it is therefore animated by the longing to reduce to a minimum the resistance offered by that repellent yet elastic natural barrier man this resistance is moreover lessened by the apparent lightness of machine work and by the more pliant and docile character of the women and children employed on it   

        machinery produces relative surplusvalue not only by directly depreciating the value of labourpower and by indirectly cheapening the same through cheapening the commodities that enter into its reproduction but also when it is first introduced sporadically into an industry by converting the labour employed by the owner of that machinery into labour of a higher degree and greater efficacy by raising the social value of the article produced above its individual value and thus enabling the capitalist to replace the value of a days labourpower by a smaller portion of the value of a days product during this transition period when the use of machinery is a sort of monopoly the profits are therefore exceptional and the capitalist endeavours to exploit thoroughly the sunny time of this his first love by prolonging the workingday as much as possible the magnitude of the profit whets his appetite for more profit

        as the use of machinery becomes m ore general in a particular industry the social value of the product sinks down to its individual value and the law that surplusvalue does not arise from the labourpower that has been replaced by the machinery but from the labourpower actually employed in working with the machinery asserts itself surplusvalue arises from variable capital alone and we saw that the amount of surplusvalue depends on two factors viz the rate of surplusvalue and the n umber of the workmen simultaneously employed given the length of the workingday the rate of surplusvalue is determined by the relative duration o f the necessary labour and of the surpluslabour in a day the number of the labourers simultaneously employed depends on its side on the ratio of the variable to the constant capital now however much the use of machinery may increase the surpluslabour at the expense of the necessary labour by heightening the productiveness of labour it is clear that it attains this result only by diminishing the number of workmen employed by a given amount of capital it converts what was formerly variable capital invested in labourpower into machinery which being constant capital does not produce surplusvalue it is impossible for instance to squeeze as much surplusvalue out of 2 as out of 24 labourers if each of these 24 men gives only one hour of surpluslabour in 12 the 14 men give together 24 hours of surpluslabour while 24 hours is the total labour of the two men hence the application of machinery to the production of surplusvalue implies a contradiction which is immanent in it since of the two factors of the surplusvalue created by a given amount of capital one the rate of surplusvalue cannot be increased except by diminishing the other the number of workmen this contradiction comes to light as soon as by the general employment of machinery in a given industry the value of the machineproduced commodity regulates the value of all commodities of the same sort and it is this contradiction that in its turn drives the capitalist without his being conscious of the fact to excessive lengthening of the workingday in order that he may compensate the decrease in the relative number of labourers exploited by an increase not only of the relative •but of the absolute surpluslabour

        if  then the capitalistic employment of machinery on the one hand supplies new and powerful motives to an excessive lengthening of the workingday and radically changes a s well the methods of labour as also the character of the social working organism in such a manner as to break down all opposition to this tendency on the other hand it produces partly by opening out to the capitalist new strata of the workingclass previously inaccessible to him partly by setting free the labourers it supplants a surplus working population which is compelled to submit to the dictation of capital hence that remarkable phenomenon in the history of modern industry that machinery sweeps away every moral and natural restriction on the length of the workingday hence too the economic paradox that the most powerful instrument for shortening labourtime becomes the most unfailing means for placing every moment of the labourers time and that of his family at the disposal of the capitalist for the purpose of expanding the value of his capital if dreamed aristotle the greatest thinker of antiquity if every tool when summoned or even of its own accord could do the work that befits it just as the creations of dredalus moved of themselves or the tripods of hephrestos went of their own accord to their sacred work if the weavers shuttles were to weave of themselves then there would be no need either of apprentices for the master workers or of slaves for the lords and antipatros a greek poet of the time of cicero hailed the invention of the waterwheel for grinding corn an invention that is the elementary form of all machinery as the giver of freedom to female slaves and the bringer back of the golden age oh those heathens they understood as the learned bastiat and before him the still wiser macculloch have discovered nothing of political economy and christianity they did not for example comprehend that machinery is the surest means of lengthening the workingday they perhaps excused the slavery of one on the ground that it was a means to the full development of another but to preach slavery of the masses in order that a few crude and halfeducated parvenus might become eminen t spinners extensive sausagemakers and influential shoeblack dealers to do this they lacked the bump of christianity


c intensification of labour

        the immoderate lengthening of the workingday produced by machinery in the hands of capital leads to a reaction on the part of society the very sources of whose life are menaced and thence to a normal workingday whose length is fixed by law thenceforth a phenomenon that we have already met with namely the intensification of labour develops into great importance our analysis of absolute surplusvalue had reference primarily to the extension or duration of the labour its intensity being assumed as given we now proceed to consider the substitution of a more intensified labour for labour of more extensive duration and the degree o f the former   


section iv the factory

        at the commencement of this chapter we considered that which we may call the body of the factory ie machinery organised into a system we there saw how machinery by annexing the labour of women and children augments the number of human beings who form the material for capitalistic exploitation how it confiscates the whole of the workmans disposable time by immoderate extension of the hours of labour and how finally its progress which allows of enormous increase of production in shorter and shorter periods serves as a means of systematically getting more work done in a shorter time or of exploiting labourpower more intensely we now turn to the factory as a whole and that in its most perfect form   

1 a reference to the pseudoscience of phrenology in which the bumps on a persons skull were thought to represent particular character traits r t

        so far as division of labour reappears in the factory it is primarily a distribution of the workmen among the specialized machines and of masses of workmen not however organised into groups among the various departments of thefactory in each of which they work at a number of similar machines placed together their cooperation therefore is only simple the organised group peculiar to manufacture is replaced by the connexion between the head workman and his few assistants the essential division is into workmen who are actually employed on the machines among whom are included a few who look after the engine and into mere attendants almost exclusively children of these workmen among the attendants are reckoned more or less all feeders who supply the machines with the material to be worked in addition to these two principal classes there is a numerically unimportant class of persons whose occupation it is to look after the whole of the machinery and repair it from time to time such as engineers mechanics joiners c this is a superior class of workmen some of them scientifically educated others brought up to a trade it is distinct from the factory operative class and merely aggregated to it  this division of labour is purely technical

        to work at a machine the workman should be taught from childhood in order that he may learn to adapt his own movements to the uniform and unceasing motion of an automaton when the machinery as a whole forms a system of manifold machines working simultaneously and in concert the cooperation based upon it requires the distribution of various groups of workmen among the different kinds of machines but the employment of machinery does away with the necessity of crystallising this distribution after the manner of manufacture by the constant annexation of a particular man to a particular function since the motion of the whole system does not proceed from the workman but from the machinery a change of persons can take place at any time without an interruption of the work the most striking proof of this is afforded by the relays system put into operation by the manufacturers during their revolt from 1848 to 1850 lastly the quickness with which machine work is learnt by young people does away with the necessity of bringing up for exclusive employment by machinery a special class of operatives with regard to the work of the mere attendants it can to some extent be replaced in the mill by machines and owing to its extreme simplicity it allows of a rapid and constant change of the individuals burdened with this drudgery

        although then technically speaking the old system of division of labour is thrown overboard by machinery it hangs on in the factory as a traditional habit handed down from manufacture and is afterwards systematically remoulded and established in a more hideous form by capital as a means of exploiting labourpower the lifelong specialty of handling one and the same tool now becomes the lifelong specialty of serving one and the same machine machinery is put to a wrong use with the object of transforming the workman from his very childhood into a part of a detailmachine in this way not only are the expenses of his reproduction considerably lessened but at the same time his helpless dependence upon the factory as a whole and therefore upon the capitalist is rendered complete here as everywhere else we must distinguish between the increased productiveness due to the development of the social process of production and that due to the capitalist exploitation of that process in handicrafts and manufacture the workman makes use of a tool in the factory the machine makes use of him there the movements o f the instrument of labour proceed from him here it is the movements of the machine that he must follow in manufacture the workmen are parts of a living mechanism in the factory we have a lifeless mechanism independent of the workman who becomes its mere living appendage the miserable routine of endless drudgery and toil in which the same mechanical process is gone through over and over again is like the labour of sisyphus the burden of labour like the rock keeps ever falling back on the wornout labourer2 at the same time that factory work exhausts the nervous system to the uttermost it does away with the manysided play of the muscles and confiscates every atom of freedom both in bodily and intellectual activity the lightening of the labour even becomes a sort of torture since the machine does not free the labourer from work but deprives the work of all interest every kind of capitalist production in so far as it is not only a labourprocess but also a process of creating surplusvalue has this in common that it is not the workman that employs the instruments of labour but the instruments of labour that employ the workman but it is only in the factory system that this inversion for the first time acquires technical and palpable reality by means of its conversion into an automaton the instrument of labour confronts the labourer during the labour process in the shape of capital of dead labour that dominates and pumps dry living labourpower the separation of the intellectual powers of production from the manual labour and the conversion of those powers into the might of capital over labour is as we have already shown finally completed by modern industry erected on the foundation of machinery the special skill of each individual insignificant factory operative vanishes as an infinitesimal quantity before the science the gigantic physical forces and the mass of labours that are embodied in the factory mechanism and together with that mechanism constitute the power of the master this master therefore in whose brain the machinery and his monopoly of it are inseparably united whenever he falls out with his hands contemptuously tells them the factory operatives should keep in wholesome remembrance the fact that theirs is really a low species of skilled labour and that there is none which is m ore easily acquired or of its quality more amply remunerated or which by a short training of the least expert can be m ore quickly as well as abundantly acquired     the masters machinery really plays a far more important part in the business of production than the labour and the skill of the operative which six months education can teach and a common labourer can learn the technical subordination of the workman to the uniform motion of the instruments of labour and the peculiar composition of the body of work people consisting as it does of individuals of both sexes and of all ages give rise to a barrack discipline which is elaborated into a complete system in the factory and which fully develops the before mentioned labour of overlooking thereby dividing the workpeople into operatives and over lookers into private soldiers and sergeants of an industrial army  the main difficulty in the automatic factory    lay    above all in training human beings to renounce their desultory habits of work and to identify themselves with the unvarying regularity of the complex automaton to devise and administer a successful code of factory discipline suited to the necessities of factory diligence was the herculean enterprise the noble achievement of arkwright even at the present day when the system is perfectly organised and its labour lightened to the utmost it is found nearly impossible to convert persons past the age of puberty into useful factory hands the factory code in which capital formulates like a private legislator and at his own good will his autocracy over his workpeople unaccompanied by that division of responsibility in other matters so much approved of by the bourgeoisie and unaccompanied by the still more approved representative system this code is but the capitalistic caricature of that social regulation of the labourprocess which becomes requisite in cooperation on a great scale and in the employment in common of instruments of labour and especially o f machinery the place of the slavedrivers lash is taken by the over lookers book of penalties all punishments naturally resolve themselves into fines and deductions from wages and the lawgiving talent o f the factory lycurgus so arranges matters that a violation of his laws is if possible more profitable to him than the keeping of them

        we shall here merely allude to the material conditions under which factory labour is carried on every organ of sense is injured in an equal degree by artificial elevation of the temperature by the dustladen atmosphere by the deajening noise not to mention danger to life and limb among the thickly crowded machinery which with the regularity of the seasons issues its list of the killed and wounded in the industrial battle economy of the social means o f production matured and forced as in a hothouse by the factory system is turned in the hands of capital into systematic robbery of what is necessary for the life of the workman while he is at work robbery of space light air and of protection to his person against the dangerous and unwholesome accompaniments of the productive process not to mention the robbery of appliances for the comfort of the workman is fourier wrong when he calls factories tempered bagnos


section 5 the strife between workman and machine

        the contest between the capitalist and the wagelabourer dates back to the very origin of capital it raged on throughout the whole manufacturing period but only since the introduction of machinery has the workman fought against the instrument of labour itself the material embodim ent of capital he revolts against this particular form of the means of production as being the material basis of the capitalist mode of production   


section 9 the factory acts sanitary and educational clauses of
the same their general extension in england

        factory legislation that first conscious and methodical reaction of society against the spontaneously developed form of the process of production is as we have seen just as much the necessary product of modern industry as cotton yarn selfactors and the electric telegraph before passing to the consideration of the extension of that legislation in england we shall shortly notice certain clauses contained in the factory acts and not relating to the hours of work apart from their wording which makes it easy for the capitalist to evade them the sanitary clauses are extremely meagre and in fact limited to provisions for whitewashing the walls for insuring cleanliness in some other matters for ventilation and for protection against dangerous machinery in the third book we shall return again to the fanatical opposition of the masters to those clauses which imposed upon them a slight expenditure on appliances for protecting the limbs of their workpeople an opposition that throws a fresh and glaring light on the freetrade dogma according to which in a society with conflicting interests each individual necessarily furthers the common weal by seeking nothing but his own personal advantagel   

        paltry as the education clauses of the act appear on the whole yet they proclaim elementary education to be an indispensable condition to the employment of children the success of those clauses proved for the first time the possibility of combining education and gymnastics with manual labour and consequently of combining manual labour with education and gymnastics the factory inspectors soon found out by questioning the schoolmasters that the factory children although receiving only one half the education of the regular day scholars yet learnt quite as much and often more this can be accounted for by the simple fact that with only being at school for one half o f the day they are always fresh and nearly always ready and willing to receive instruction the system on which they work half manual labour and half school renders each employment a rest and a relief to the other consequently both are far more congenial to the child  than would be the case were he kept constantly at one it is quite clear that a boy who has been at school all the morning cannot in hot weather particularly cope with one who comes fresh and bright from his work further in formation on this point will be found in seniors speech at the social science congress a t edinburgh in 1863 he there shows amongst other things how the monotonous and uselessly long school hours of the children of the upper and middle classes uselessly add to the labour of the teacher while he not only fruitlessly but absolutely injuriously wastes the time health and energy of the children   from the factory system budded as robert owen has shown us in detail the germ of the education of the future an education that will in the case of every child over a given age combine productive labour with instruction and gymnastics not only as one of the methods of adding to the efficiency of production but as the only method of producing fully developed human beings

        modern industry as we have seen sweeps away by technical means the manufacturing division of labour under which each man is bound hand and foot for life to a single detailoperation at the same time the capitalistic form o f that industry reproduces this same division of labour in a still more monstrous shape in the factory proper by converting the workman into a living appendage of the machine and everywhere outside the factory partly by the sporadic use of machinery and machine workers partly by reestablishing the division of labour on a fresh basis by the general introduction of the labour of women and children and of cheap unskilled labour

        the antagonism between the manufacturing division of labour and the methods of modern industry makes itself forcibly felt it manifests itself amongst other ways in the frightful fact that a great part of the children employed in modern factories and manufactures are from their earliest years riveted to the mast simple manipulations and exploited far years without being taught a single sort of work that would afterwards make them of use even in the same manufactory or factory


        modern industry never looks upon and treats the existing farm of a process as final the technical basis of that industry is therefore revolutionary while all earlier modes of production were essentially conservative by means of machinery chemical processes and other methods it is continually causing changes not only in the technical basis of production but also in the functions of the labourer and in the social combinations of the labourprocess at the same time it thereby also revolutionizes the division of labour within the society and incessantly launches masses of capital and a f workpeople from one branch of production to another but if modern industry by its very nature therefore necessitates variation of labour fluency of function universal mobility of the labourer on the other hand in its capitalistic farm it reproduces the old division of labour with its ossified particularisations we have seen h aw this absolute contradiction between the technical necessities a f modern industry a n d the social character inherent in its capitalistic farm dispels all fixity and security in the situation of the labourer haw it constantly threatens by taking away the instruments of labour to snatch from his hands his means of subsistence and by suppressing his detail function to make him superfluous we have seen too how this antagonism vents its rage in the creation of that monstrosity an industrial reserve army kept in misery in order to be always at the disposal of capital in the incessant human sacrifices from among the workingclass in the mast reckless squandering of labourpower and in the devastation caused by a social anarchy which turns every economic progress into a social calamity this is the negative side but if an the one hand variation of work at present imposes itself after the manner of an overpowering natural law and with the blindly destructive action of a natural law that meets with resistance at all paints modern industry on the other hand through its catastrophes imposes the necessity of recognising as a fundamental law of production variation of work consequently fitness of the labourer far varied work consequently the greatest possible development of his varied aptitudes it becomes a question of life and death far society to adapt the made of production to the normal functioning of this law modern industry indeed compels society under penalty of death to replace the detailworker of today crippled by lifelong repetition of one and the same trivial operation and thus reduced to the mere fragment of a man by the fully developed individual fit for a variety of labours ready to face any change of production and to whom the different social functions h e performs are but so many modes of giving free scope to his own natural and acquired powers

        one step already spontaneously taken towards effecting this revolution is the establishment of technical and agricultural schools and of ecoles d enseignement professionnel in which the children of the workingmen receive some little instruction in technology and in the practical handling of the various implements of labour though the factory act that first and meagre concession wrung from capital is limited to combining elementary education with work in the factory there can be no doubt that when the workingclass comes into power as inevitably it must technical instruction both theoretical and practical will take its proper place i n the working class schools  there is also no doubt that such revolutionary ferments the final result of which is the abolition of the old division of labour are diametrically opposed to the capitalistic form of production and to the economic status o f the labourer corresponding to that form but the historical development of the antagonisms immanent in a given form of production is the only way in which that form o f production can be dissolved and a new form established ne sutor ultra crepidamthis ne plus ultra of handicraft wisdom became sheer nonsense from the moment the watchmaker watt invented the steamengine the barber arkwright the throstle and the workingjeweller fulton the steamship

        so long as factory legislation is confined to regulating the labour in factories manufactori es c it is regarded as a mere interference with the exploiting rights of capital but when it comes to regulating the socalled homelabour it is immediately viewed as a direct attack on the patria potestas on parental authority the tenderhearted english parliament long affected to shrink from taking this step the force of facts however compelled it at last to acknowledge that modern industry in overturning the economic foundation on which was based the traditional family and the family labour corresponding to it had also unloosened all traditional family ties the rights of the children had to be proclaimed the final report of the ch empl comm of 1866 states it is unhappily to a painful degree apparent throughout the whole of the evidence that against no persons do the children of both sexes so much require protection as against their parents the system of unlimited exploitation of childrens labour in general and the socalled homelabour in particular is maintained only because the parents are able without check or control to exercise this arbitrary and mischievous power over their young a n d tender offspring    parents must not possess the absolute power of making their children mere machines to earn so much weekly wage    the children and young persons therefore in all such cases may justifiably claim from the legislature as a natural right that an exemption should be secured to them from what destroys prematurely their physical strength and lowers them in the scale of intellectual and moral beings it was not however the misuse of parental authority that created the capitalistic exploitation whether direct or indirect of childrens labour but on the contrary it was the capitalistic mode of exploitation which by sweeping away the economic basis of parental authority made its exercise degenerate into a mischievous misuse of power however terrible and disgusting the dissolution under the capitalist system of the old family ties may appear nevertheless modern industry by assigning as it does an important part in the process of production outside the domestic sphere to women to young persons and to children of both sexes creates a new economic foundation for a higher form of the family and o f the relations between the sexes it is  o f course just as absurd t o hold the teutonicchristian form o f the family t o be absolute and final as it would be to apply that character to the ancient roman the ancient greek o r the eastern forms which moreover taken together form a series in historical development moreover it is obvious that the fact of the collective working group being composed of individuals of both sexes and all ages must necessarily under suitable conditions become a source of humane development although in its spontaneously developed brutal capitalistic form where the labourer exists for the process of production and not the process of production for the labourer that fact is a pestiferous source of corruption and slavery   


section 10 modern industry and agriculture

        the revolution called forth by modern industry in agriculture and m the social relations of agricultural producers will be in vestigated later on in this place we shall merely indicate a few results by way of anticipation if the use of machinery in agriculture is for the most part free from the injurious physical effect it has on the factory operative its action in superseding the labourers is more intense and finds less resistance as we shall see later in detail in the counties of cambridge and suffolk for example the area of cultivated land has extended very much within the last twenty years up to 1868 while m the same period the rural population has diminished not only relatively but absolutely in the united states it is as yet only virtually that agricultural machines replace labourers in other words they allow of the cultivation by the farmer of a larger surface but do not actually expel the labourers employed in 1861 the number of persons occupied in england and wales in the manufacture of agricultural machines was 1034 whilst the number of agricultural labourers employed in the use of agricultural machines and steamengines did not exceed 1205

        in the sphere of agriculture modern industry has a more revolutionary effect than elsewhere for this reason that it annihilates the peasant that bulwark of the old society and replaces him by the wagelabourer thus the desire for social changes and the class antagonisms are brought to the same level in the country as in the town s the irrational oldfashioned methods of agriculture are replaced by scientific ones capitalist production completely tears asunder the old bond of union which held together agriculture and manufacture in their infancy but at the same time it creates the material conditions for a higher synthesis in the future viz the union of agriculture and industry o n the basis of the more perfected forms they have each acquired during their temporary separation  capitalist production b y collecting the population in great centres and causing an everincreasing preponderance of town population on the one hand concentrates the historical motive power of society on the other hand it disturbs the circulation of matter between man and the soil ie prevents the return to the soil of its elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing it therefore violates the conditions necessary to lasting fertility of the soil by this action it destroys at the same time the health of the town labourer and the intellectual life of the rural labourer but while upsetting the naturally grown conditions for the maintenance of that circulation of matter it imperiously calls for its restoration as a system as a regulating law of social production and under a form appropriate to the full development of the human race in agriculture as in manufacture the transformation of production under the sway of capital means at the same time the martyrdom of the producer the instrument of labour becomes the means of enslaving exploiting and impoverishing the labourer the social combination and organisation of labourprocesses is turned into an organized mode of crushing out the workmans individual vitality freedom and independence the dispersion of the rural labourers over larger areas breaks their power of resistance while concentration increases that of the town operatives in modern agriculture as in the urban industries the increased productiveness and quantity of the labour set in motion are bought at the cost of laying waste and consuming by disease labourpower itself moreover all progress in capitalistic agriculture is a progress in the art not only of robbing the labourer but of robbing the soil all progress in increasing the fertility o f the soil for a given time is a progress towards ruining the lasting sources of that fertility the more a country starts its development on the foundation of modern industry like the united states for example the more rapid is this process of destruction capitalist production therefore develops technology and the combining together of various processes into a social whole only by sapping the original sources of all wealththe soil and the labourer


part v the production of absolute and of
relative surplusvalue
chapter xvi absolute and relative
surplusvalue

        in considering the labourprocess we began by treating it in the abstract apart from its historical forms as a process between man and nature we stated if we examine the whole labourprocess from the p oint of view of its result it is plain that both the instruments and the subjects of labour are means of production and that the labour itself is productive labour and we further added this method of determining from the standpoint of the labourp rocess alone what is productive labour is by no means directly applicable to the case of the capitalist process of production we now proceed to the further development of this subject

        so far as the labourprocess is purely individual one and the same labourer unites in himself all the functions that later on become separated when an individual appropriates natural objects for his livelihood no one controls him but himself afterwards he is controlled by others a single man cannot operate upon nature without calling his own muscles into play under the control of his own brain as in the natural body head and hand wait upon each other so the labourprocess unites the labour of the hand with that of the head later on they part company and even become deadly foes the product ceases to be the direct product of the individual and becomes a social product produced in common by a colecture labourer ie  by a combination of workmen each of whom takes only a part greater or less in the manipulation of the subject of their labour as the cooperative character of the labourprocess becomes more and more marked so as a necessary consequence does our notion of productive labour and of its agent the productive labourer become extended in order to labour productively it is n o longer necessary for y o u to do manual work yourself enough if you are an organ of the collective labourer and perform one of its subordinate functions the first definition given above of productive labour a definition deduced from the very nature of the production of material objects still remains correct for the collective labourer considered as a whole but it no longer holds good for each member taken individually

        on the other hand however our notion of productive labour becomes narrowed capitalist production is not merely the production of commodities it is essentially the production of surplusvalue the labourer produces not for himself but for capital it no longer suffices therefore that he should simply produce he must produce surplusvalue that labourer alone is productive who produces surplusvalue for the capitalist and thus works for the self expansion of capital if we may take an example from outside the sphere of production of material objects a schoolmaster is a productive labourer when in addition to be labouring the heads of his scholars he works like a horse to enrich the school proprietor that the latter has laid out his capital in a teaching factory instead of in a sausage factory does not alter the relation hence the notion of a productive labourer implies not merely a relation between work and useful effect between labourer and product of labour but also a specific social relation of production a relation that has sprung up historically and stamps the labourer as the direct means of creating surplusvalue to be a productive labourer is therefore not a piece of luck but a misfortune   

        the prolongation of the workingday beyond the point at which the labourer would have produced just an equivalent for the value of his labourpower and the appropriation of that surpluslabour by capital this is production of absolute surplusvalue it forms the general groundwork of the capitalist system and the startingpoint for the production of relative surplusvalue the latter presupposes that the workingday is already divided into two parts necessary labour and surpluslabour in order to prolong the surpluslabour the necessary labour is shortened by methods whereby the equivalent for the wages is produced in less time the production of absolute surplusvalue turns exclusively upon the length of the working day the production of relative surplusvalue revolutionises out and out the technical processes of labour and the composition of society it therefore presupposes a specific mode the capitalist mode of production a mode which along with its methods •means and conditions arises and develops itself spontaneously on the foundation afforded by the formal subjection of labour to capital in the course of this development the formal subjection is replaced by the real subjection of labour to capital   

        from one standpoint any distinction between absolute and relative surplusvalue appears illusory relative surplusvalue is absolute since it compels the absolute prolongation o f the workingday beyond the labourtime necessary to the existence of the labourer himself absolute surplusvalue is relative since it makes necessary such a development of the productiveness of labour as will allow of the necessary labourtime being confined to a portion of the working day but if we keep in mind the behaviour of surplusvalue this appearance of identity vanishes once the capitalist mode of production established and become general the difference between absolute and relative surplusvalue makes itself felt wherever there is a question of raising the rate of surplusvalue assuming that labourpower is paid for at its value we are confronted by this alternative  given the productiveness of labour and its normal intensity the rate of surplusvalue can be raised only by the actual prolongation of the workingday on the other hand given the length of the workingday that rise can be effected only by a change in the relative magnitudes of the components of the workingday viz necessary labour and surpluslabour a change which if the wages are not to fall below the value of labourpower presupposes a change either in the productiveness or in the intensity of the labour if the labourer wants all his time to produce the necessary means of subsistence for himself and his race he has no time left in which to work gratis for others without a certain degree of productiveness in his labour he has no such superfluous time at his disposal without such superfluous time no surplus labour and therefore no capitalists no slavepowers no feudal lords in one word no class of large proprietors   


chapter xxv the general law of capitalist
accumulation
section 1 the increased demand for labourpower that accompames
accumulation the composition of capital remaining the
same

        in this chapter we consider the influence of the growth of capital on the lot of the labouring class the most important factor in this enquiry is the composition of capital and the changes it undergoes m the course of the process of accumulation

        the composition of capital is to be understood in a twofold sense on the side of value it is determined by the proportion in which it is divided into constant capital or value of the means of production and variable capital or value of labourpower the sum total of wages on the side of material as it functions in the process of production all capital is divided into means of production and living labourpower this latter composition is determined by the relation between the mass of the means of production employed on the one hand and the mass of labour necessary for their employment on the other i call the former the valuecomposition the latter the technical composition of capital between the two there is a strict correlation to express this i call the valuecomposition of capital in so far as it is determined by its technical composition and mirrors the changes of the latter the organic composition of capital wherever i refer to the composition of capital without further qualification its organic composition is always understood

        the many individual capitals invested in a particular branch of production have one with another more or less different compositions the average of the individual compositions gives us the composition of the total capital in this branch of production lastly the average of these averages in all branches of production gives us the composition of the total social capital of a country and with this alone are we in the last resort concerned in the following investigation

        growth of capital involves growth 0£ its variable constituent or of the part invested in labourpower a part of the surplusvalue turned into additional capital must always be retransformed into variable capital or additional labourfund if we suppose that all other circumstances remaining the same the composition of capital also remains constant ie that a definite mass of means of production constantly needs the same mass of labourpower to set it in motion then the demands for labour and the subsistencefund of the labourers clearly increase in the same proportion as the capital and the more rapidly the more rapidly the capital increases since the capital produces yearly a surplusvalue of which one part is yearly added to the original capital since this increment itself grows yearly along with the augmentation of the capital already functioning since lastly under special stimulus to enrichment such as the opening of new markets or of new spheres for the outlay of capital in consequence of newly developed social wants c the scale of accumulation may be suddenly extended merely by a change in the division of the surplusvalue or surplusproduct into capital and revenue the requirements of accumulating capital may exceed the increase of labourpower or of the number of labourers the demand for labourers may exceed the supply and therefore wages may rise this must indeed ultimately be the case if the conditions supposed above continue for since in each year more labourers are employed than in its predecessor sooner or later a point must be reached at which the requirements of accumulation begin to surpass the customary supply of labour and therefore a rise of wages takes place a lamentation on this score was heard in england during the whole of the fifteenth and the first half of the eighteenth centuries the more or less favourable circumstances in which the wageworking class supports and multiplies itself in no way alter the fundamental character o f capitalist production as simple reproduction constantly reproduces the capitalrelation itself ie the relation of capitalists on the one hand and wageworkers on the other so reproduction on a progressive scale ie accumulation reproduces the capitalrelation on a progressive scale more capitalists or larger capitalists at this pole more wageworkers at that the reproduction of a mass of labourpower which must incessantly reincorporate itself with capital for that capitals selfexpansion which cannot get free from capital and whose enslavement to capital is only concealed by the variety of individual capitalists to whom it sells itself this reproduction of labourpower forms in fact an essential of the reproduction o f capital itself accumulation of cap ital is therefore increase of the proletariat    

        the law of capitalist production that is at the bottom of the pretended natural law of population  reduces itself simply to this the correlation between accumulation of capital and rate of wages is nothing else than the correlation between the unpaid labour transformed into capital and the additional paid labour necessary for the setting in motion of this additional capital it is therefore in no way a relation between two magnitudes independent one of the other on the one hand the magnitude of the capital on the other the number of the labouring population it is rather at bottom only the relation between the unpaid and the paid labour of the same labouring population if the quantity of unpaid labour supplied by the workingclass and accumulated by the capitalist class increases so rapidly that its conversion into capital requires an extraordinary addition of paid labour then wages rise and all other circumstances remaining equal the unpaid labour diminishes in proportion  but as soon as this diminution touches the point at which the surpluslabour that nourishes capital is no longer supplied in normal quantity a reaction sets in a smaller part of revenue is capitalised accumulation lags and the movement of rise in wages receives a check the rise of wages therefore is confined within limits that not only leave intact the foundations o f the capitalistic system but also secure its reproduction on a progressive scale the law of capitalistic accumulation metamorphosed by economists into a pretended law of nature in reality merely states that the very nature of accumulation excludes every diminution in the degree of exploitation of labour and every rise in the price of labour which could seriously imperil the continual reproduction on an everenlarging scale of the capitalistic relation  it cannot be otherwise in a mode of production in which the la bourer exists to satisfy the needs of selfexpansion of existing values instead of on the contrary material wealth existing to satisfy the needs of development on the part of the labourer as in religion man is governed by the products of his own brain so in capitalistic production he is governed by the products of his own hand


section 3 progressive production of a relative surpluspopulation or industrial reserve army

        the accumulation of capital though originally appearing as its quantitative extension only is effected as we have seen under a progressive qualitative change in its composition under a constant increase of its constant at the expense of its variable constituent   

           with the growth of the total capital its variable constituent or the labour incorporated in it also does increase but in a constantly diminishing proportion the intermediate pauses are shortened in which accumulation works as simple extension of production on a given technical basis it is not merely that an accelerated accumulation of total capital accelerated in a constantly growing progression is needed to absorb an additional number of labourers or even on account of the constant metamorphosis of old capital to keep employed those already functioning in its turn this increasing accumulation and centralisation becomes a source of new changes in the composition of capital of a more accelerated diminution of its variable as compared with its constant constituent this accelerated relative diminution of the variable constituent that goes along with the accelerated increase of the total capital and moves more rapidly than this increase takes the inverse form at the other pole of an apparently absolute increase of the laboring population an increase always moving more rapidly than that of the variable capital or the means of employment but in fact it is capitalistic accumulation itself that constantly produces and produces in the direct ratio of its own energy and extent a relatively redundant population of labourers ie a population of greater extent than suffices for the average needs of the selfexpansion of capital and therefore a surpluspopulation   

           the labouring population therefore produces along with the accumulation of capital produced by it the means by which itself is made relatively superfluous is turned into a relative surplus population and it does this to an always increasing extent this is a law of population peculiar to the capitalist mode of production and in fact every special historic mode of production has its own special laws of population historically valid within its limits alone an abstract law of population exists for plants and animals only and only in so far as man has not interfered with them

        but if a surplus labouring population is a necessary product of accumulation or of the development of wealth on a capitalist basis this surpluspopulation becomes conversely the lever of capitalistic accumulation nay a condition of existence of the capitalist mode of production it forms a disposable industrial reserve army that belongs to capital quite as absolutely as if the latter had bred it at its own cost independently of the limits of the actual increase of population it creates for the changing needs of the selfexpansion of capital a mass of human material always ready for exploitation with accumulation and the development of the productiveness of labour that accompanies it the power of sudden expansion of capital grows also it grows not merely because the elasticity of the capital already functioning increases not merely because the absolute wealth of society expands of which capital only forms an elastic part not merely because credit under every special stimulus at once places an unusual part of this wealth at the disposal of production in the form of additional capital it grows also because the technical conditions of the process of production themselves machinery means of transport cnow admit of the rapidest transformation of masses of surplusproduct into additional means of production the mass of social wealth overflowing with the advance of accumulation and transformable into additional capital thrusts itself frantically into old branches of production whose market suddenly expands or into newly formed branches such as railways c   the need for which grows out of the development of the old ones in all such cases there must be the possibility of throwing great masses of men suddenly on the decisive points without injury to the scale of production in other spheres overpopulation supplies these masses the course characteristic of modern industry viz  a decennial cycle  interrupted by smaller oscillations of periods of average activity production at high pressure crisis and stagnation depends on the constant formation the greater or less absorption and the reformation of the industrial reserve army or surpluspopulation in their turn the varying phases of the industrial cycle recruit the surpluspopulation and become one of the most energetic agents of its reproduction this peculiar course of modern industry which occurs in no earlier period of human history was also impossible in the childhood of capitalist production the composition of capital changed but very slowly with its accumulation therefore there kept pace on the whole a corresponding growth in the demand for labour slow as was the advance of accumulation compared with that of more modern times it found a check in the natural limits of the exploitable labouring population limits which could only be got rid of by forcible means to be mentioned later the expansion by fits and starts of the scale of production is the preliminary to its equally sudden contraction the latter again evokes the former but the former is impossible without disposable human material without an increase in the number of labourers independently of the absolute growth of the population this increase is effected by the simple process that constantly sets free a part of the labourers by methods which lessen the numoer of labourers employed in proportion to the increased production the whole form of the movement of modern industry depends therefore upon the constant transformation of a part of the labouring population into unemployed or halfemployed hands   

           even malthus recognises overpopulation as a necessity of modern industry though after his narrow fashion he explains it by the absolute overgrowth of the labouring population not by their becoming relatively supernumerary he says prudential habits with regard to marriage carried to a considerable extent among the labouring class of a country mainly depending upon manufactures and commerce might injure it    from the nature of a population an increase of labourers cannot be brought into market in consequence of a particular demand till after the lapse of sixteen or eighteen years and the conversion of revenue into capital by saving may take place much more rapidly a country is always liable to an increase in the quantity of the funds for the maintenance of labour faster than the increase of population  3 after political economy has thus demonstrated the constant production of a relative surpluspopulation of labourers to be a necessity of capitalistic accumulation she very aptly in the guise of an old maid puts in the mouth of her beau ideal of a capitalist the following words addressed to those supernumeraries thrown on the streets by their own creation of additional capital  we manufacturers do what we can for you whilst we are increasing that capital on which you must subsist and you must do the rest by accommodating your numbers to the means of subsistence

        capitalist production can by no means content itself with the quantity of disposable labourpower which the natural increase of population yields it requires for its free play an industrial reserve army independent of these natural limits

        upto this point it has been assumed that the increase or diminution of the variable capital corresponds rigidly with the increase or diminution of the number of labourers employed

3 malthus principles of political economy pp 215 319 320 in this work malthus finally discovers with the help of sismondi the beautiful trinity of capitalistic production overproduction overpopulation overconsumptionthree very delicate monsters indeed marx

        the number of labourers commanded by capital may remain the same or even fall while the variable capital increases this is the case if the individual labourer yields m ore labour and therefore his wages increase and this although the price of labour remains the same or even falls only more slowly than the mass of labour rises increase of variable capital in this case becomes an index of more labour but not of more labourers employed it is the absolute interest of every capitalist to press a given quantity of labour out of a smaller rather than a greater number of labourers if the cost is about the same  in the latter case the outlay of constant capital increases in proportion to the mass of labour set in action in the former that increase is much smaller the more extended the scale of production the stronger this motive its force increases with the accumulation of capital

        we have seen that the development o f the capitalist mode of production and of the productive power of labourat once the cause and effect of accumulationenables the capitalist with the same outlay of variable capital to set in action more labour by greater exploitation extensive or intensive of each individual labourpower we have further seen that the capitalist buys with the same capital a greater mass of labourpower as he progressively replaces skilled labourers by less skilled mature labourpower by immature male by female that of adults by that of young persons or children

        on the one hand therefore with the progress of accumulation a larger variable capital sets more labour in action without enlisting more labourers on the other a variable capital of the same magnitude sets in action more labour with the same mass of labourpower and finally a greater number of inferior labourpowers by displacement of higher

        the production of a relative surpluspopulation or the setting free of labourers goes on therefore yet more rapidly than the technical revolution of the process of production that accompanies and is accelerated by the advance of accumulation and more rapidly than the corresponding diminution of the variable part of capital as compared with the constant if the means of production as they increase in extent and effective power become to a less extent means of employment of labourers this state of things is again modified by the fact that in proportion as the productiveness of labour increases capital increases its supply of labour more quickly than its demand for labourers the overwork of the employed part of the workingclass swells the ranks of the reserve whilst conversely the greater pressure that the latter by its competition exerts on the former forces these to submit to overwork and to subjugation under the dictates of capital the condemnation of one part of the workingclass to enforced idleness by the overwork of the other part and the converse becomes a means of enriching the individual capitalists and accelerates at the same time the production of the industrial reserve army on a scale corresponding with the advance of social accumulation how important is this element in the formation of the relative surpluspopulation is shown by the example of england her technical means for saving labour are colossal nevertheless if tomorrow morning labour generally were reduced to a rational amount and proportioned to the different sections of the workingclass according to age and sex the working population to hand would be absolutely insufficient for the carrying on of national production on its present scale the great majority of the labourers now unproductive would have to be turned into productive ones

5 even in the cotton famine of 1863 we find in a pamphlet of the operative cottonspinners of blackburn fierce denunciations of overwork which in consequence of the factory acts of course only affected adult male labourers the adult operatives at this mill have been asked to work from twelve to thirteen hours per day while there are hundreds who are compelled to be idle who would willingly work partial time in order to maintain their families and save their brethren from a premature grave through being overworked     we it goes on to say would ask if the practice of working overtime by a number of hands is likely to create a good feeling between masters and servants those who are worked overtime feel the injustice equally with those who are condemned to forced idleness there is in the district almost sufficient work to give to all partial employment if fairly distributed we are only asking what is right in requesting the masters generally to pursue a system of short hours particularly until a better state of things begins to dawn upon us rather than to work a portion of the hands overtime while others for want of work are compelled to exist upon charity reports of insp of fact oct 31 1863  p 8 the author of the essay on trade and commerce grasps the effect o f a relative surpluspopulation o n the employed labourers with his usual unerring bourgeois instinct another cause of idleness in this kingdom is the want of a sufficient number of labouring hands    whenever from extraordinary demand for manufactures labour grows scarce the labourers feel their own consequence and will make their masters feel it likewiseit is amazing but so depraved are the dispositions of these people that in such cases a set of workmen have combined to distress the employer by idling a whole day together essay  c pp 27 28 the fellows in fact were hankering after a rise in wages marx

        taking them as a whole the general movements of wages are exclusively regulated by the expansion and contraction of the industrial reserve army and these again correspond to the periodic changes of the industrial cycle they are therefore not determined by the variations of the absolute number of the working population but by the varying proportions in which the workingclass is divided into active and reserve army by the increase or diminution in the relative amount of the surpluspopulation by the extent to which it is now absorbed now set free for modern industry with its decennial cycles and periodic phases which moreover as accumulation advances are complicated by irregular oscillations following each other more and more quickly that would indeed be a beautiful law which pretends to make the action of capital dependent on the absolute variation of the population instead of regulating the demand and supply of labour by the alternate expansion and contraction of capital the labourmarket now appearing relatively underfull because capital is expanding now again overfull because it is contracting yet this is the dogma of the economists according to them wages rise in consequence of accumulation of capital the higher wages stimulate the working population to more rapid multiplication and this goes on until the labour market becomes too full and therefore capital relatively to the supply of labour becomes insufficient wages fall and now we have the reverse of the medal the working population is little by little decimated as the result of the fall in wages so that capital is again in excess relatively to them or as others explain it falling wages and the corresponding increase in the exploitation of the labourer again accelerates accumulation whilst at the same time the lower wages hold the increase of the workingclass in check then comes again the time when the supply of labour is less than the demand wages rise and so on a beautiful mode of motion this for developed capitalist production before in consequence of the rise of wages any positive increase of the population really fit for work could occur the time would have been passed again and again during which the industrial campaign must have been carried through the battle fought and won   

        the industrial reserve army during the periods of stagnation and average prosperity weighs down the active labourarmy during the periods of overproduction and paroxysm it holds its pretensions in check relative surpluspopulation is therefore the pivot upon which the law of demand and supply of labour works it confines the field of action of this law within the limits absolutely convenient to the activity of exploitation and to the domination of capital

        this is the place to return to one of the grand exploits of economic apologetics it will be remembered that if through the introduction of new or the extension of old machinery a portion of variable capital is transformed into constant the economic apologist interprets this operation which fixes capital and by that very act sets labourers free  in exactly the opposite way pretending that it sets free capital for the labourers only now can one fully understand the effrontery of these apologists what are set free are not only the labourers immediately turned out by the machines but also their future substitutes in the rising generation and the additional contingent that with the usual extension of trade on the old basis would be regularly absorbed         they are now all set free and every new bit of capital looking out for employment can dispose of them whether it attracts them or others the effect on the general labour demand will be nil if this capital is just sufficient to take out of the market as many labourers as the machines threw upon it if it employs a smaller number that of the supernumeraries increases if it employs a greater the general demand for labour only increases to the extent of the excess of the employed over those set free the impulse that additional capital seeking an outlet would otherwise have given to the general demand for labour is therefore in every case neutralised to the extent of the labourers thrown out of employment by the machine that is to say the mechanism of capitalistic production so manages matters that the absolute increase of capital is accompanied by no corresponding rise in the general demand for labour  and this apologist calls a compensation for the misery the sufferings the possible death of the displaced labourers during the transition period that banishes them into the industrial reserve army the demand for labour is not identical with increase of capital nor supply of labour with increase of the workingclass it is not a case of two independent forces working on one another les des sont pipes capital works on both sides at the same time if its accumulation on the one hand increases the demand for labour it increases on the other the supply of labourers by the setting free of them whilst at the same time the pressure of the unemployed compels those that are employed to furnish more laboured therefore makes the supply of labour to a certain extent independent of the supply of labourers the action of the law of supply and demand of labour on this basis completes the despotism of capital as soon therefore as the labourers learn the secret how it comes to pass that in the same • measure as they work more as they produce more wealth for others and as the productive power of their labour increases so in the same measure even their function as a means of the selfexpansion of capital becomes more and more precarious for them as soon as they discover that the degree of intensity of the competition among themselves depends wholly on the pressure of the relative surpluspopulation as soon as by trades unions c they try to organize a regular co operation between employed and unemployed in order to destroy or to weaken the ruinous effects of this natural law of capitalistic production on their class so soon capital and its sycophant political economy cry out at the infringement of the eternal and so to say sacred law of supply and demand every combination of employed and en employed disturbs the harmonious action of this law but on the other hand as soon as in the colonies eg adverse circumstances prevent the creation of an industrial reserve army and with it the absolute dependence of the workingclass upon the capitalist class capital along with its commonplace sancho panza rebels against the sacred law of supply and demand and tries to check its inconvenient action by forcible means and state interference


section 4 different forms of the relative surpluspopulation
the general law of capitalistic accumulation

        the relative surpluspopulation exists in every possible form every labourer belongs to it during the time when he is only partially employed or wholly unemployed not taking into account the great periodically recurring forms that the changing phases of the industrial cycle impress on it now an acute form during the crisis then again a chronic form during dull timesit has always three forms the floating the latent and the stagnant   

        the lowest sediment of the relative surpluspopulation finally dwells in the sphere of pauperism exclusive of vagabonds criminals prostitutes in a word the dangerous classes this layer of society consists of three categories first those able to work one need only glance superficially at the statistics of english pauperism to find that the quantity of paupers increases with every crisis and diminishes with every revival of trade second orphans and pauper children these are candidates for the industrial reserve army and are in times of great prosperity as 1860 eg speedily and in large numbers enrolled in the active army of labourers third the demoralised and ragged and those unable to work chiefly people who succumb to their incapacity for adaptation due to the division of labour people who have passed the normal age of the labourer the victims of industry whose number increases with the increase of dangerous machinery of mines chemical works c the mutilated the sickly the widows c pauperism is the hospital of the active labourarmy and the dead weight of the industrial reserve army its production is included in that of the relative surplus population its necessity in theirs along with the surplus population pauperism forms a condition of capitalist production and of the capitalist development of wealth it enters into the faux frais of capitalist production but capital knows how to throw these for the most part from its own shoulders on to those of the working class and the lower middle class

        the greater the social wealth the functioning capital the extent and energy of its growth and therefore also the absolute mass of the proletariat and the productiveness of its labour the greater is the industrial reserve army the same causes which develop the expansive power of capital develop also the labourpower a t its disposal the relative mass of the industrial reserve army increases therefore with the potential energy of wealth but the greater this reserve army in proportion to the active labourarmy the greater is the mass of a consolidated surpluspopulation whose misery is in inverse ratio to its torment of labour the more extensive finally the lazaruslayers of the workingclass and the industrial reserve army the greater are official pauperism this is the absolute general law of capitalist accumulation like all other laws it is modified in its working by many circumstances the analysis of which does not concern us here

        the folly is now patent of the economic wisdom that preaches to the labourers the accommodation of their number to the requirements of capital the mechanism of capitalist production and accumulation constantly effects this adjustment the first word of this adaptation is the creation of a relative surpluspopulation or industrial reserve army its last word is the misery of constantly extending strata of the active army of labour and the dead weight of pauperism

        the law by which a constantly increasing quantity of means of production thanks to the advance in the productiveness of social labour may be set in movement by a progressively diminishing expenditure of human power this law in a capitalist society where the labourer does not employ the means of production but the means of production employ the labourerundergoes a complete inversion and is expressed thus  the higher the productiveness of labour the greater is the pressure of the labourers on the means of employment the more precarious therefore becomes their condition of existence viz the sale of their own labourpower for the increasing of anothers wealth or for the selfexpansion of capital the fact that the means of production and the productiveness of labour increase more rapidly than the productive population expresses itself therefore capitalistically in the inverse form that the labouring population always increases more rapidly than the conditions under which capital can employ this increase for its own selfexpansion

        we saw in part iv when analysing the production of relative surplusvalue  within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social productiveness of labour are brought about at the cost of the individual labourer all means for the development o f production transform themselves into means of domination over and exploitation of the producers they mutilate the labourer into a fragment of a man degrade him to the level of an appendage of a machine destroy every remnant of charm in his work and turn it into a hated toil they estrange from him the intellectual potentialities of the labourprocess in the same proportion as science is incorporated in it as an independent power they distort the conditions under which he works subject him during the labourprocess to a despotism the more hateful for its meanness they transform his lifetime into workingtime and drag his wife and child beneath the wheels of the juggernaut of capital but all methods for the production of surplusvalue are at the same time methods of accumulation and every extension of accumulation becomes again a means for the development of those methods it follows therefore that in proportion as capital accumulates the lot of the labourer is his payment high or low must grow worse the law finally that always equilibrates the relative surpluspopulation or industrial reserve army to the extent and energy of accumulation this law rivets the labourer to capital more firmly than the wedges of vulcan did prometheus to the rock it establishes an accumulation of misery corresponding with accumulation of capital accumulation of wealth at one pole is therefore at the same time accumulation of misery agony of toil slavery ignorance brutality mental degradation at the opposite pole ie on the side of the class that produces its own product in the form of capital   


part viii the socalled primitive accumulation
chapter xxvi the secret of primitive
accumulation

        we have seen how money is changed into capital how through capital surplusvalue is made and from surplusvalue more capital but the accumulation of capital presupposes surplusvalue surplusvalue presupposes capitalistic production capitalistic production presupposes the preexistence of considerable masses of capital and of labourpower in the hands of producers of commodities the whole movement therefore seems to turn in a vicious circle out of which we can only get by supposing a primitive accumulation  previous accumulation of adam smith  preceding capitalistic accumulation a n accumulation not the result of the capitalist mode of production but its starting point

        this primitive accumulation plays in political economy about the same part as original sin in theology adam bit the apple and thereupon sin fell on the human race its origin is supposed to be explained when it is told as an anecdote of the past in times long gone by there were two sorts of people one the diligent intelligent and above all frugal elite the other lazy rascals spending their substance and more in riotous living the legend of theological original sin tells us certainly how man came to be condemned to eat his bread in the sweat of his b row but the history of economic original sin reveals to us that there are people to whom this is by no means essential never mind thus it came to pass that the former sort accumulated wealth and the latter sort had at last nothing to sell except their own skins and from this original sin dates the poverty of the great majority that despite all its labour has up to now nothing to sell but itself and the wealth of the few that increases constantly although they have long ceased to work such insipid childishness is every day preached to us in the defence of property m thiers eg had the assurance to repeat it with all the solemnity of a statesman to the french people once so spiritual but as soon as the question of property crops up it becomes a sacred duty to proclaim the intellectual food of the infant as the one thing fit for all ages and for all stages of development in actual history it is notorious that conquest enslavement robbery murder briefly force play the great part in the tender annals of political economy the idyllic reigns from time immemorial right and labour were from all time the sole means of enrichment the present year of course always excepted as a matter of fact the methods of primitive accumulation are anything but idyllic

        in themselves money and commodities are no more capital than are the means of production and of subsistence they want transforming into capital but this transformation itself can only take place under certain circumstances that centre in this viz that two very different kinds of commoditypossessors must come face to face and into contact on the one hand the owners of money means of production  means of subsistence who are eager to increase the sum of values they possess by buying other peoples labourpower on the other hand free labourers the sellers of their own labourpower and therefore the sellers of labour free labourers in the double  sense that neither they themselves form part and parcel of the means of production as in the case of slaves bondsmen c nor d o the means of production belong to them  as in the case of peasantproprietors they are therefore free from unencumbered by any means of production of their own with this polarization of the market for commodities the fundamental conditions of capitalist production are given the capitalist system presupposes the complete separation of the labourers from all property in the means by which they can realise their labour as soon as capitalist production is once on its own legs it not only maintains this separation but reproduces it on a continually extending scale the process therefore that clears the way for the capitalist system can be none other than the process which takes away from the labourer the possession of his means of production a process that transforms on the one hand the social means of subsistence and of production into capital on the other the immediate producers into wagelabourers  the socalled primitive accumulation therefore is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from the means of production it appears as primitive because it forms the prehistoric stage of capital and of the mode of production corresponding with it

        the economic structure of capitalistic society has grown out of the economic structure of feudal society the dissolution of the latter set free the elements of the former

        the immediate producer the labourer could only dispose of his own person after he had ceased to be attached to the soil and ceased to be the slave serf or bondman of another to become a free seller of labourpower who carries his commodity wherever he finds a market he must further have escaped from the regime of the guilds their rules for apprentices and journeymen and the impediments of their labour regulations hence the historical movement which changes the producers into wageworkers appears on the one hand as their emancipation from serfdom and from the fetters of the guilds and this side alone exists for our bourgeois historians but on the other hand these new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after they had been robbed of all their own means of production and of all the guarantees of existence afforded by the old feudal arrangements and the history of this their expropriation is written in the annals of mankind in letters of blood and fire

        the industrial capitalists these new potentates had on their part not only to displace the guild masters of handicrafts but also the feudal lords the possessors of the sources of wealth in this respect their conquest of social power appears as the fruit of a victorious struggle both against feudal lordship and its revolting prerogatives and against the guilds and the fetters they laid on the free development of production and the free exploitation of man by man the chevaliers d industrie however only succeeded in supplanting the chevaliers of the sword by making use of events of which they themselves were wholly innocent they have risen by means as vile as those by which the roman freedman once o n a time made himself the master of his patronus

        the startingpoint of the development that gave rise to the wagelabourer as well as to the capitalist was the servitude of the labourer the advance consisted in a change of form of this servitude in the transformation of feudal exploitation into capitalist exploitation to understand its march we need not go back very far although we come across the first beginnings of capitalist production as early as the 14th or 15th century sporadically in certain towns of the mediterranean the capitalistic era dates from the 16th century wherever it appears the abolition of serfdom has been long effected and the highest development of the middle ages the existence of sovereign towns has been long on the wane

        in the history of primitive accumulation all revolutions are epochmaking that act as levers for the capitalist class in course of formation but above all those moments when great masses o f men a re suddenly and forcibly torn from their means of subsistence and hurled as free and unattached proletarians on the labourmarket the expropriation of the agricultural producer of the peasant from the soil is the basis of the whole process the history of this expropriation in different countries assumes different aspects and runs through its various phases in different orders of succession and at different periods in england alone which we take as our example has it the classic form


chapter xxvii expropriation of the
agricultural population from the land

        in england serfdom had practically disappeared in the last part of the 14th century the immense majority of the population consisted then and to a still larger extent in the 15th century of free peasant proprietors whatever was the feudal title under which their right of property was hidden   

        the prelude of the revolution that laid the foundation of the capitalist mode of production was played in the last third of the 15th and the first decade of the 16th century a mass of free proletarians was hurled on the labourmarket by the breakingup of the bands of feudal retainers who as sir james steuart well says everywhere uselessly filled house and castle although the royal power itself a product of bourgeois development in its strife after absolute sovereignty forcibly hastened on the dissolution of these bands of retainers it was by no means the sole cause of it in insolent conflict with king and parliament the great feudal lords created an incomparably larger proletariat by the forcible driving of the peasantry from the land to which the latter had the same feudal right as the lord himself and by the usurpation of the common lands the rapid rise 6f the flemish wool manufactures and the corresponding rise in the price of wool in england gave the direct impulse to these evictions the old nobility had been devoured by the great feudal wars the new nobility was the child of its time for which money was the power of all powers transformation of arable land into sheepwalks was therefore its cry   

        with the development of capitalist production during the manufacturing period the public opinion o f europe had lost the last remnant of shame and conscience the nations bragged cynically of every infamy that served them as a means to capitalistic accumulation read eg the naive annals of commerce of the worthy a  anderson here it is trumpeted forth as a triumph of english statecraft that at the peace of utrecht england extorted from the spaniards by the asiento treaty the privilege of being allowed to ply the negrotrade until then only carried on between africa and the english west in dies between africa and spanish america as well england thereby acquired the right of supplying spanish america until 1743 with 4800 negroes yearly this threw at the same time an official cloak over british smuggling liverpool waxed fat on the slavetrade this was its method of primitive accumulation and even to the present day liverpool respectability is the pindar of the slavetrade whichcompare the work of aikin 1795 already quotedhas coincided with that spirit of bold adventure which has characterised the trade of liverpool and rapidly carried it to its present state of prosperity has occasioned vast employment for shipping and sailors and greatly augmented the demand for the manufactures of the country p 339 liverpool employed in the slavetrade in 1730 15 ships in 1751 53 in 1760 74 in 1770 96 and in 1792 132

        whilst the cotton industry introduced childslavery in england it gave in the united states a stimulus to the transformation of the earlier more or less patriarchal slavery into a system of commercial exploitation in fact the veiled slavery of the wageworkers in europe needed for its pedestal slavery pure and simple in the new world

        tantre molis erat to establish the eternal laws of nature of the capitalist mode of production to complete the process of separation between labourers and conditions of labour to transform at one pole the social means of production and subsistence into capital at the opposite pole the mass of the population into wage labourers into “free labouring poor” that artificial product of modern society if money according to augier comes into the world with a congenital bloodstain on one cheek capital comes dripping from head to foot from every pore with blood and dirt


chapter xxxi genesis of the industrial
capitalist

        the genesis of the industrial capitalist did not proceed in such a gradual way as that of the farmer doubtless many small guildmasters and yet more independent small artisans or even wagelabourers transformed themselves into small capitalists and by gradually extending exploitation of wagelabour and corresponding accumulation into fullblown capitalists in the infancy of capitalist production things often happened as in the infancy of mediaeval towns where the question which of the escaped serfs should be master and which servant was in great part decided by the earlier or later date of their flight   

  

        the discovery of gold and silver in america the extirpation enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population the beginning of the conquest and looting of the east indies the turning of africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of blackskins signaiised the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production  these idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of primitive accumulation on their heels treads the commercial war of the european nations with the globe for a theatre it begins with the revolt of the netherlands from spain assumes giant dimensions in englands antijacobin war and is still going on in the opium wars against china c the different momenta of primitive accumulation distribute themselves now more or less in chronological order particularly over spain portugal holland france and england in england at the end of the 17th century they arrive at a systematical combination embracing the colonies the national debt the modern mode of taxation and the protectionist system these methods depend in part on brute force eg the colonial system but they all employ the power of the state the concentrated and organised force of society to hasten hoth ouse fashion the process of transformation of the feudal mode of production into the capitalist mode and to shorten the transition force is the midwife of every old society pregnant with a new one it is itself an economic power

  

chapter xxxii historical tendency o f
capitalist accumulation

        what does the primitive accumulation of capital ie its historical genesis resolve itself into in so far as it is not immediate transformation of slaves and serfs into wagelabourers and therefore a mere change of form it only means the expropriation of the immediate producers ie the dissolution of private property based on the labour of its owner private property as the antithesis to social collective property exists only where the means of labour and the external conditions of labour belong to private individuals but according as these private individuals are labourers or not labourers private property has a different character the numberless shades that it at first sight presents correspond to the intermediate stages lying between these two extremes the private property of the labourer in his means of production is the foundation of petty industry whether agricultural manufacturing or both petty industry again is an essential condition for the development of social production and of the free individuality of the labourer himself of course this petty mode of production exist also under slavery serfdom and other states of dependence but it flourishes it lets loose its whole energy it attains its adequate classical form only where the labourer is the private owner of his own means of labour set in action by himself the peasant of the land which he cultivates the artisan of the tool which he handles as a virtuoso this mode of production presupposes parcelling of the soil and scattering of the other means of production as it excludes the concentration of these means of production so also it excludes cooperation division of labour within each separate process of production the control over and the productive application of the forces of nature by society and the free development of the social productive powers it is compatible only with a system of production and a society moving within narrow and more or less primitive bounds to perpetuate it would be as pecqueur rightly says to decree universal mediocrity at a certain stage of development it brings forth the material agencies for its own dissolution from that moment new forces and new passions spring up in the bosom of society but the old social organisation fetters them and keeps them down it must be annihilated it is annihilated its annihilation the transformation of the individualised and scattered means of production into socially concentrated ones of the pigmy property of the m any into the huge property of the few the expropriation of the great mass of the people from the soil from the means of subsistence and from the means of labour this fearful and painful expropriation of the mass of the people forms the prelude to the history of capital it comprises a series of forcible methods of which we have passed in review only those that have been epochmaking as methods of the primitive accumulation of capital the expropriation of the immediate producers was accomplished with merciless vandalism and under the stimulus of passions the most infamous the most sordid the pettiest the most meanly odious selfearned private property that is based so to say on the fusing together of the isolated independent labouringindividual with the conditions of his labour is supplanted by capitalistic private property which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labour of others ie on wagelabour

        as soon as this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed the old society from top to bottom as soon as the labourers are turned into proletarians their means of labour into capital as soon as the capitalist mode of production stands on its own feet then the further socialisation of labour and further transformation of the land and other means of production into socially exploited and therefore common means of production as well as the further expropriation of private proprietors takes a new form that which is now t o be expropriated is no longer the labourer working for himself but the capitalist exploiting many labourers this expropriation is accomplished by the action of the immanent laws of capitalistic production itself by the centralisation of capital one capitalist always kills many hand in hand with this centralisation or this expropriation of many capitalists by a few develop on an everextending scale the cooperative form of the labourprocess the conscious technical application of science the methodical cultivation of the soil the transformation of the instruments of labour into instruments of labour only usable in common the economizing of all means of production by their use as the means of production of combined socialised labour the entanglement of all peoples in the net of the worldmarket and with this the international character of the capitalistic regime  along with the constantly diminishing number of the magnates of capital who usurp and monopolise all advantages of this process of transformation grows the mass of misery oppression slavery degradation exploitation but with this too grows the revolt of the workingclass a class always increasing in numbers and disciplined united organised by the very mechanism of the process of capitalist production itself the monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production which has sprung up and flourished along with and under it centralisation of the means of production and socialisation of labour at last reach a point where they become incompatible with their capitalist integument this integument is burst asunder the knell of capitalist private property sounds the expropriators are expropriated

        the capitalist mode of appropriation the result of the capitalist mode of production produces capitalist private property this is the first negation of individual private property as founded on the labour of the proprietor but capitalist production begets with the inexorability of a law of nature its own negation it is the negation of negation this does not reestablish private property for the producer but gives him individual property based on the acquisitions of the capitalist era ie on cooperation and the possession in common of the land and of the means of production

        the transformation of scattered private property arising from individual labour into capitalist private property is naturally a process incomparably more protracted violent and difficult than the transformation of capitalistic private property already practically resting on socialised production into socialised property in the former case we had the expropriation of the mass of the people by a few usurpers in the latter we have the expropriation of a few surpers by the mass of the people


capital volume three
karl iviarx

        volumes two and three of capital left in incomplete manuscript by marx were later edited and brought out by engels two excerpts from volume three are presented here

        the first whose title has been given by the editor of this reader gives marxs vision of man in a future condition of freedomcreative leisure made possible by machine industry and the worldwide proletarian revolution that as he saw it was destined to liberate mans productive activity from the fetters of capitalist acquisitiveness but there would remain in this realm of freedom a residual realm of necessity the labour time required to produce needed goods under even the most advanced technology

        the second selection is the famous last chapter of volume three entitled classes in which the manuscript breaks off after marx has asked what constitutes a class in fact there is no mystery about his answer a class in marxs view is a special form of the division of labor in society 


on the realm of necessity and the realm of freedom

        we have seen that the capitalist process of production is a historically determined form of the social process of production in general the latter is as much a production process of material conditions of human life as a process taking place under specific historical and economic production relations producing and reproducing these production relations themselves and thereby also the bearers of this process their material conditions of existence and their mutual relations ie their particular socioeconomic form for the aggregate of these relations in which the agents of this production stand with respect to nature and to one another and in which they produce is precisely society considered from the standpoint of its economic structure like all its predecessors the capitalist process of production proceeds under definite material conditions which are however simultaneously the bearers of definite social relations entered into by individuals in the process of reproducing their life those conditions like these relations are on the one hand prerequisites on the other hand results and creations of the capitalist process of production they are produced and reproduced by it we saw also that capitaland the capitalist is merely capital personified and functions in the process of production solely as the agent of capitalin its corresponding social process of production pumps a definite quantity of surplus labour out of the direct producers or labourers capital obtains this surplus labour without an equivalent and in essence it always remains forced labourno matter how much it may seem to result from free contractual agreement this surplus labour appears as surplus value and this surplus value exists as a surplus product surplus labour in general as labour performed over and above the given requirements must always remain in the capitalist as well as in the slave system etc it merely assumes an antagonistic form and is supplemented by complete idleness of a stratum of society a definite quantity of surplus labour is required as insurance against accidents and by the necessary and progressive expansion of the process of reproduction in keeping with the development of the needs and the growth of population which is called accumulation from the viewpoint of the capitalist it is one of the civilizing aspects of capital that it enforces this surplus labour in a manner and under conditions which are more advantageous to the development of the productive forces social relations and the creation of the elements for a new and higher form than under the preceding forms of slavery serfdom etc thus it gives rise to a stage on the one hand in which coercion and monopolization of social development including its material and intellectual advantages by one portion of society at the expense of the other are eliminated on the other hand it creates the material means and embryonic conditions making it possible in a higher form of society to combine this surplus labour with a greater reduction of time devoted to material labour in general for depending on the development of labour productivity surplus labour may be large in a small total working day and relatively small in a large total working day if the necessary labour time  3 and the surplus labour  3 then the total working day  6 and the rate of surplus labour  100  if the necessary labour  9 and the surplus labour  3 then the total working day  12 and the rate of surplus labour only 33 13  in that case it depends upon the labour productivity how much use value shall be produced in a definite time hence also in a definite surplus labour time the actual wealth of society and the possibility of constantly expanding its reproduction process therefore do not depend upon the duration of surplus labour but upon its productivity and the more or less copious conditions of production under which it is performed in fact the realm of freedom actually begins only where labour which is determined by necessity and mundane considerations ceases thus in the very nature of things it lies beyond the sphere of actual material production just a the savage must wrestle with nature to satisfy his wants to maintain and re produce life so must civilized man and he must do so in all social formations and under all possible modes of production with his development this realm of physical necessity expands as a result of his wants but at the same time the forces of production which satisfy these wants also increase freedom in this field can only consist in socialized man the associated producers rationally regulating their interchange with nature bringing it under their common control instead of being ruled by it as by the blind forces of nature and achieving this with the least expenditure of energy and under conditions most favourable to and worthy of their human nature but it nonetheless still remains a realm of necessity beyond it begins that development of human energy which is an end in itself the true realm of freedom which however can blossom forth only with the realm of necessity as its basis the shortening of the working day is its basic prerequisite

 see for example his statement in the eighteenth brumaire 01 louis bonaparte p 608 below in so far as millions of families live under economic conditions of existence that divide their mode of life their interests and their culture from those of the other classes and put them in hostile contrast to the latter they form a class



classes


        the owners merely of labourpower owners of capital and landowners whose respective sources of income are wages profit and groundrent in other words wagelabourers capitalists and landowners constitute then three big classes of modern society based upon the capitalist mode of production

        in england modern society is indisputably most highly and classically developed in economic structure nevertheless even here the stratification of classes does not appear in its pure form middle and intermediate strata even here obliterate lines of demarcation everywhere although incomparably less in rural districts than in the cities however this is immaterial for our analysis we have seen that the continual tendency and law of development of the capitalist mode of production is more and more to divorce the means of production from labour and more and more to concentrate the scattered means of production into large groups thereby transforming labour into wagelabour and the means of production into capital and to this tendency on the other hand corresponds the independent separation of landed property from capital and labour or the transformation of all landed property into the form of landed property corresponding to the capitalist mode of production

        the first question to be answered is this what constitutes a classand the reply to this follows naturally from the reply to another question namely what makes wagelabourers capitalists and landlords constitute the three great social classes

        at first glancethe identity of revenues and sources of revenue there are three great social groups whose members the individuals forming them live on wages profit and groundrent respectively on the realisation of their labourpower their capital and their landed property

        however from this standpoint physicians and officials eg would also constitute two classes for they belong to two distinct social groups the members of each of these groups receiving their revenue from one and the same source the same would also be true of the infinite fragmentation of interest and rank into which the division of social labour splits labourers as well as capitalists and landlordsthe latter eg into owners of vineyards farm owners owners of forests mine owners and owners of fisheries
