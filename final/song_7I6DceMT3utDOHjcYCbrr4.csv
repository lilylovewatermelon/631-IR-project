verse 1
nobody wanna see us together
nobody thought wed last forever
i feel im hopin and prayin
things between us gon get better
men steady comin after you
women steady comin after me
seems like everybody wanna go for self
and dont wanna respect boundaries
tellin you all those lies
just to get on yo side
but i must admit there was a couple secrets i held inside
just know that i try to always apologize
but ima have you first always in my heart to keep you satisfied

verse 2
got every right to wanna leave
got every right to wanna go
got every right to hit the road
and never talk to me no more
you dont even have to call
even check for me at all
cause the way i been actin lately has been off the wall
especially towards you puttin girls before you
and they watchin everything i been doin just to hurt you
most of it just aint true and they wont show you
how much of a queen you are to me and why i love you baby
