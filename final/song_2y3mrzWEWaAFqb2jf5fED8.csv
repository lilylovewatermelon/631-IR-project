a regular citizen who reports seeing a crime isnt a snitch or a rat the criminals were just sloppy
snitches and rats are not the same thing let me break it down to make sure yall see what i mean
a snitch is someone minding other folks business
to find information they can sell for a price or trade for some other form of compensation
a rat is a traitor a conceiver planner or physical participator
he doesnt sell secrets for power or cash he betrays the trust of his team or his family hoping to save his own cowardly ass
the difference is at least a snitch is human but a rat is a fuckin rat periodyou might also like16embed"
