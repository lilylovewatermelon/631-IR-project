i will give some worn down excuse
bout my misguided judgements of substance abuse
i know that youll stay out of pure sympathy
there aint no use in lovin a let down like me

chorus
ill let you down darlin down babe
just like i did before
youll just keep on slammin closed hollow unlocked doors
ill let you down darlin down babe
just like times before
and youll just keep on crawin back and beggin me for more

verse 2
i will leave you broken and in ruins
call you when the works through just to find out what youre doin
so i can let you down for the hundredth last time
causе lettin downs a pick me up for me and my boys kind

chorus
ill lеt you down darlin down babe
just like i did before
youll just keep on slammin closed hollow unlocked doors
ill let you down darlin down babe
just like times before
and youll just keep on crawlin back and beggin me for more

and i know that you know that you make my spine shiver
but my past lives inside me and its branched out from my liver
but i am not the evil that you make me out to be
i will let you down and thats a damn guarantee

ill let you down darlin down babe
just like i did before
youll just keep on slammin closed hollow unlocked doors
ill let you down darlin down babe
just like times before
and youll just keep on crawin back and beggin me for more

i will give a worn down excuse
bout my misguided judgement of substance abuseembed"
