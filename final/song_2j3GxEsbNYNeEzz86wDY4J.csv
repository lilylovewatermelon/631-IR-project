all your expectations of my love are impossible
surely you know that im not easy to hold
its so sad how incapable of learning to grow i am
my heart speaks in puzzle and codes
ive been trying my whole life to solve
god only knows how ive cried
i cant take another defeat
a next time would be the ending of me
now that i see

and i aint fooling fooling what a cruel thing cruel thing
to selfinflict that pain
love is a game for fools to play
and i aint fooling again fooling what a cruel thing cruel thing
to selfinflict that pain

verse 2
how unbelievable unbelievable
of me to fall for the lies that i tell lies i tell
the dream that i sell dream i sell
when heartache its inevitable and unbearable
but im no good at doing it well
not that i care i dont care
why should anything about it be fair

can keep me satisfied satisfied satisfied
i cant keep up cant keep up cant keep up
when i keep changing my mind change my mind change my mind
the feelings flood me to the heights of no compromise
