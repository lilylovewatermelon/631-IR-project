yeah oh

verse 1
i know that hope weighs on your mind lost within the seams
it seems like we lose ourselves in between
but the harder things become the harder you push away
oh baby yeah baby it kills me

chorus
you said it you said it
ill take you at your word
promises that you cant keep
its getting harder to hold on
you said it you said it
dont ever let me fall
dont give up because youre losing
you havent lost

verse 2
in time youll find that we can sober up
clean up any dirt so we can open up
these wounds have been open for forever now
come on be strong
your mind has gotten the best of you
youve done enough and you are enough
lets fall asleep tonight
ill hold you close and show you youre not broken broken

you said it you said it
ill take you at your word
promises that you cant keep
its getting harder to hold on
you said it you said it
dont ever let me fall
dont give up because youre losing
losing losing losing losing losing

bridge
hold on hold on
hold just hold on
dont you think if its meant to be it will be
dont you think things will work out eventually eventually
hold on

chorus
you said it you said it
ill take you at your word
promises that you cant keep
its getting harder to hold on
you said it you said it
dont ever let me fall
dont give up because youre losing
you said it you said it
ill take you at your word
promises that you cant keep
its getting harder to hold on
you said it you said it
dont ever let me fall
dont give up because youre losing
losing losing losing losing losing2embed"
