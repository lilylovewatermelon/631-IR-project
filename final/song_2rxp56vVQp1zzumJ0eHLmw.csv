trying hard to speak and fighting with my weak hand
driven to distraction its all part of the plan
when something is broken and you try to fix it
trying to repair it any way you can

verse 2
i dive in at the deep end you become my best friend
i wanna love you but i dont know if i can
i know something is broken and im trying to fix it
trying to repair it any way i can

you and me are floating on a tidal wave
together
you and me are drifting into outer space
and singing
