you boys ever met a real country girl
talkin true blue out in the woods downhome country girl

verse 1
shes a hot little number in her pickup truck
daddys sweet money done jacked it up
shes a party allnighter from south carolina
a bad mamajama from down in alabama
shes a ragin cajun a lunatic from brunswick
juicy georgia peach with a thick southern drawl
sexy swing and walk brother shes all

chorus
country shoot
from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
shes country
from the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
thats the way she was born and raised
she ain’t afraid to stay
country
brother shes country

verse 2
a hell raisin sugar when the sun goes down
mama taught her how to rip up the town
honey drippin honey from the holler in kentucky
get you flippin kinda trippy like a mississippi hippie
shes a kansas princess
crazy mother trucker undercover lover
thick southern drawl sexy swing and walk
brother shes all
