verse 1 bruno mars
standing at this liquor store
whiskey coming through my pores
feeling like i run this whole block
lotto tickets cheap beer
thats why you can catch me here
tryna scratch my way up to the top

prechorus bruno mars
cause my jobs got me going nowhere
so i aint got a thing to lose
take me to a place where i dont care
this is me and my liquor store blues

chorus bruno mars
ill take one shot for my pain
one drag for my sorrow
get messed up today
ill be okay tomorrow
one shot for my pain
one drag for my sorrow
get messed up today
ill be okay tomorrow
