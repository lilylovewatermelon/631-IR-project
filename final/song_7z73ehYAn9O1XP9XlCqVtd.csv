hey ms red carpet
she can autograph my pockets
anytime anyplace anyway
ill be looking at everybody else watching
i dont wanna be obnoxious
but this girl worth the gossip
take away the smile
the tattoos now forever she very guardless
i imagine her topless
she might set off my rocket
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
on and poppin
she mad marketing
attitude like we arguing
return im gonna celebrate glitter to my life
i should twitter this is girl shes sparkling

chorus akon
she aint no rockstar
but shes got groupies
she aint no actress
but she makes movies
and when she struts that thing around
everybody be breaking their neck like
who dat girl who dat girl who dat girl
she aint got riches
but shes got fashion
she aint a model
but cameras flashing
and when she struts that thing around
everybody be breaking their neck like
who dat girl who dat girl who dat girl

hey they wanna know my mam name
cause that where she get from
they aint never shot her with silicone

touch one grab one feel one
i wish she woulda told me that

little mamma knows my body so trophy glass

and when she struts that thing around
