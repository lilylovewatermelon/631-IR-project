you stripped your love down to the wire
fire shy and cold alone outside
you stripped it right down to the wire
but i see you behind those tired eyes

prechorus
now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart
youll find the light that leads home
cause i see you for you and your beautiful scars
so take my hand dont let go

chorus
cause its not too late its not too late
i i see the hope in your heart
and sometimes you lose and sometimes youre shooting
broken arrows in the dark
but i i see the hope in your heart

verse 2
ive seen the darkness in the light
the kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
the only thing thats black and white
is that you dont have to walk alone this time

prechorus
we have to tear down walls that live in your heart
to find someone you call home
now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
so take my hand dont let go
you might also likechorus
cause its not too late its not too late
i i see the hope in your heart
and sometimes you lose and sometimes youre shooting
broken arrows in the dark
but i i see the hope in your heart

outro
its not too late its not too late
i see the hope in your heart
sometimes losing sometimes shooting
broken arrows in the dark12embed"
