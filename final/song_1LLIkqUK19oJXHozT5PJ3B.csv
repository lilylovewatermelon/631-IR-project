in the clouds where the angels sing
in her eyes where i wanna be
and her smile is all i see
she knows i need her loving
she knows i need her touching
she plays with my heart and emotion
i give her my love and devotion
she gives thoughts and a notion
i need her body it needs me too
i need somebody to love me blue
