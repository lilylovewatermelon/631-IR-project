four years old with my back to the door
all i could hear was the family war
your selfish hands always expecting more
am i your child or just a charity ward

prechorus
you have a hollowed out heart but its heavy in your chest
i try so hard to fight it but its hopeless
hopeless youre hopeless

chorus
oh father
please father
id love to leave you alone but i cant let you go
oh father
please father
put the bottle down for the love of a daughter
oh

verse 2
its been five years since weve spoken last
and you cant take back what we never had
oh well i can be manipulated only so many times
before even i love you starts to sound like a lie
you might also likeprechorus
you have a hollowed out heart but its heavy in your chest
i try so hard to fight it but its hopeless
hopeless youre hopeless

chorus
oh father
please father
id love to leave you alone but i cant let you go
oh father
please father
put the bottle down for the love of a daughter

bridge
dont you remember im your baby girl
how could you push me out of your world
lied to your flesh and your blood
put your hands on the ones that you swore you loved
dont you remember im your baby girl
how could you throw me right out of your world
so young when the pain had begun
now forever afraid of being loved

breakdown
oh father
please father
id love to leave you alone but i cant let you go
oh father
please father
outro
oh father
please father
put the bottle down for the love of a daughter
for the love of a daughter23embed"
