im so glad you made time to see me
hows life tell me hows your family
i havent seen them in a while
youve been good busier than ever
we small talk work and the weather
your guard is up and i know why

prechorus
because the last time
you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
you gave me roses and i left them there to die

chorus
so this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying im sorry for that night
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
wishing id realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december turn around and make it alright
i go back to december all the time

verse 2
these days i havent been sleeping
staying up playing back myself leaving
when your birthday passed and i didnt call
then i think about summer all the beautiful times
i watched you laughing from the passenger side
and realized i loved you in the fall
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likeprechorus
and then the cold came
the dark days when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye

chorus
so this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying im sorry for that night
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
wishing id realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time

bridge
i miss your tan skin your sweet smile
so good to me so right
and how you held me in your arms that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinking
probably mindless dreaming
but if we loved again i swear id love you right
id go back in time and change it but i cant
so if the chain is on your door i understand

chorus
but this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying im sorry for that night
and i go back to december
it turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
wishing id realized what i had when you were mine
i go back to december turn around and make it alright
i go back to december turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time
outro
all the timeembed"
