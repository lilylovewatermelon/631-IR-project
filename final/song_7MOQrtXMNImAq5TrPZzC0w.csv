yeah youve been alone
ive been gone for far too long
but with all that weve been through
after all this time im coming home to you
never let it show
the pain ive grown to know
cause with all these things we do
it dont matter when im coming home to you

chorus
i reach towards the sky ive said my goodbyes
my hearts always with you now
i wont question why so many have died
my prayers have made it through yeah
cause with all these things we do
it dont matter when im coming home to you

verse 2
letters keep me warm
helped me through the storm
but with all that weve been through
after all this time im coming home to you

chorus
i reach towards the sky ive said my goodbyes
my hearts always with you now
i wont question why so many have died
my prayers have made it through yeah
cause with all these things we do
it dont matter when im coming home to you
