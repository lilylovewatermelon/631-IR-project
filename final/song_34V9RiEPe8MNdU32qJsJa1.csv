we used to walk along the streets
when the porch lights were shinin bright
before i had somewhere to be
back when we had all night
and we were happy
i do recall a good while back
we snuck into the circus
you threw your arms around my neck
back when i deserved it
and we were happy

chorus
when it was good baby it was good baby
we showed em all up
no one could touch the way we
laughed in the dark talkin bout your daddys farm
we were gonna buy someday
and we were happy

verse 2
we used to watch the sun go down
on the boats in the water
thats sorta how i feel right now
and goodbyes so much harder
cause we were happy
