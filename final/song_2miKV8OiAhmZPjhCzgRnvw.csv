yeah another love song gone wrong
shouldve known you were a woo like based god in wonton
but i didnt and i aint even trippin
another foul ball but im still glad i hit it
cause a lot of niggas didnt you know
the couldashoulda type like oh it was slight too tight come on
i wouldve piped but our schedules contradicted were always tied down
ay pipe down the first night ya boy laid the pipe down
took off the night gown and pulled out the slinky
she screamed joey spank me and after that she even thanked me
swanky one time for my nigga dymes
lord knows we be kickin rhymes til the end of time
but back to the topic — oh yeah im pissed off
and still tripped off and wonderin why shorty dipped off
i aint gonna front — a nigga do miss her lip gloss
now she sucks the next nigga dick off and my dicks soft
so tell me what the fuck im posed to do
and you know it aint too easy gettin over you
i sent them postcards so you know its true
i promised that i wouldnt get emotional
and im not so stop it
why you front like you dont miss my whole cockpit down yo esophagus
screamin daddy stop it rippin out your tracks
chipped nail polish in the scratches on my back
like did you forget about the time we had the sticky rolled
and i tried to suck your titty hole for milk for my cheerios
did you forget about the video when you first came
i hit that spot twice and since then you havent been the same
but now i heard you fuckin with some new man
cant remember his name but my first impression — what a lame
lorraine said she seen him at a bowling lane
walkin out the bathroom kinda strange with his shoulder stained
faggot six months and im still at it
youll probably never hear this track but i still wrapped it
i guess im still attracted to you bein here
i swear i cant imagine you would not even care
whole thing played out like magic and it’s kinda weird
its like i did a trick and you wont reappear
it aint fair i need you back sometimes i get scared
but im a player aint gonna let you see my tears
you might also likebridge
cause im a player aint gonna let you see my tears
cause im a player aint gonna let you see my tears
cause im a player aint gonna let you see my tears
cause im a player

hook
i couldnt see it comin down my eyes
so i had to make the song cry
i couldnt see it comin down my eyes
so i gotta to make the song cry
i couldnt see it comin down my eyes
so i had to make the song cry
i couldnt see it comin down my eye
so i gotta to make the song cry yeah27embed"
