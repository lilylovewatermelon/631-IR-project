take this pink ribbon off my eyes
im exposed and its no big surprise
dont you think i know exactly where i stand
this world is forcing me to hold your hand

chorus
cause im just a girl oh little old me
well dont let me out of your sight
oh im just a girl all pretty and petite
so dont let me have any rights

postchorus
oh ive had it up to here

verse 2
the moment that i step outside
so many reasons for me to run and hide
i cant do the little things i hold so dear
cause its all those little things that i fear

chorus
cause im just a girl id rather not be
cause they wont let me drive late at night
oh im just a girl guess im some kind of freak
cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
oh im just a girl take a good look at me
just your typical prototype

chorus
oh im just a girl living in captivity
