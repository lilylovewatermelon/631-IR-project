oh a warm hello
would be apropos
we havent spoke in several weeks
but solitude tends to be the mood
so you probably wont hear from me
and there was once relief in the changing trees
the contrails that cut the sky
but prearranged circumstances change
and id be lying if i said im fine

prechorus
catch her in the switchbacks in the line
switching back to central standard time
each day slightly more resigned
trying to make some sense of life

chorus
so if we take off
you could quit your day job
wed call ourselves the angel youth
youll find us traveling and making tunes

but then i think of
all the people weve loved
how theyll be growing older soon
how its true for me and you
you might also likeverse 2
so i convalesced in the middle west
and fell for ohios roads
im standing still by the windowsill
where i once watched the world explode

so when its looking dark in your narrative arc
im here and you can talk with me
a hackneyed fool under fascist rule
wasting days singing about his dreams

prechorus
all of which has lead me to believe
earths a set and lifes the movie screen
and every dream that you have inbetween
theyll fade with every frame you see

bridge
oh is it selfhate
i wish i was in la
far from all the roads we knew
unworried where were going through

chorus
so if we take off
you could quit your day job
wed call ourselves the angel youth
were coming to a town near you
lonely and outraged
guess for now that ill wait
for generation angel youth
to point me towards a higher truth

outro
its on the offchance
we never come to cross hands
cause its too late to not pretend
and id for all of this to end
just glad that i could be your friend4embed"
