i gave you all of me for none of you
something that i dont ever do
you made me feel like im not good enough yeah
and i dont wanna walk away thats the last thing that i want
but hey i guess right now i have to do whatevers best for me best for me

chorus
i cant hold my breath no more
tired of your selfish love
i cant be what you want
but i still wanna be loved
never asked for nothin else
gotta do this for myself
i believed you loved me girl
when i couldnt even love myself

verse 2
im afraid of myself
you taught me how to hate myself
for you oh girl i changed myself
and chained myself down and then i start to blame myself
back and forth with my head
thinkin bout what all you said
i swear its been a week since i slept
cause mine dont feel the same as your bed
this aint love its hard to fake it
you aint mine its hard to face it
all of the time i wasted
i really tried to save us but
you might also likechorus
i cant hold my breath no more
tired of your selfish love
i cant be what you want
but i still wanna be loved
never asked for nothin else
gotta do this for myself
i believed you loved me girl
when i couldnt even love myself15embed"
