dont you dare go runnin down my little town where i grew up
and i wont cuss your city lights
if you aint ever took a ride around and cruised right through the heart of my town
anything you say would be a lie

prechorus
we may live our lives a little slower
but that dont mean i wouldnt be proud to show ya

chorus
where i come from
theres an old plow boy out turnin up dirt
where i come from
theres a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
where i come from
where a couple boys fight in the parkin lot
no nobodys gonna call the cops
where i come from

verse 2
see that door right there man i swear that it aint never been locked
and i guarantee that it never will
that old man right there in the rockin chair at the courthouse square ill tell you now
he could buy your fancy car with hundred dollar bills

dont let those faded overalls fool ya
he made his millions without one day of schoolin

chorus
where i come from
theres a pickup truck with the tailgate down
where i come from
the pine trees are singin a song of the south
where i come from
that little white church is gonna have a crowd
and yeah im pretty damn proud
of where i come from

bridge
where i come from
theres a big ol moon shinin down at night
where i come from
theres a man done wrong gonna make it right

chorus
where i come from
theres an old plow boy out turnin up dirt
where i come from
theres a preacher man in a cowboy shirt
where i come from
where a couple boys fight in the parkin lot
no aint nobody gonna call the cops
yeah that river runs across that old flint rock
where i come from
outro
where i come fromembed"
