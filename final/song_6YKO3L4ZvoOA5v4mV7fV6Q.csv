i want to feel that ocean breeze thats got me wrapped around its fingers
i want to hear a southern drawl and every word that lingers
i need a sunday morning song by a just got baptized singer
i been away too long somebody take me home

verse 2
i need a glass of sweet sun tea brewed out in the backyard
i want to see a kudzu vine sneaking up on a junk car
i need to sit on my old back porch til the world lets go of my arm
i been away too long oh somebody take me home

verse 3
lord have mercy on a poor boys soul
crank it up and make these big wheels roll
can you get me there by the morning light
and make everything alright
because i been away too long
oh somebody take me home

verse 4
i love this job i do
but my soul is wearing thin
oh i got to get lost in where im from
and find myself again
oh i been away too long
somebody take me home

i want to waste a day with my little man throwing me that old football
spend sometime with daddys girls catching up on whats going on
then remind the woman i love just how much i miss her when im gone

verse 6
oh lord have mercy on a poor boys soul
crank it up and make these big wheels roll
can you get me there by morning light
oh lord have mercy on my soul
crank it up and make these big wheels roll
i want to be there by morning light
itll make everything alright
because ive been away too long
oh ive been away too long
i been away too long
somebody please somebody take me home
oh home home homeembed"
