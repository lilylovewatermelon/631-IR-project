you say the drinking is better than a woman
and you say the thinking takes too much time
well god save your children should you have them
for to you theres nothing if theres no wine

chorus
ohohohoh you have so much more
ohohohoh where has your time gone
ohohohoh where has your time gone
ohohohoh you have so much more

verse 2
you sing like an angel your voice melts my heart
your words are of wisdom your life has been hard
and should you ever wonder where all the time has gone
youll find the answer far away from home

minichorus
ohohohoh you have so much more
ohohohoh where has your time gone

and i dont want to see you like this
when youre crawling
please dont you weep
cause i will shape the day
and make you feel alright

but you say the drinking is better than a woman
and you say the thinking takes too much time
you sing like a siren your voice breaks my heart
and when you are crying your tears are like wine

outro
ohohohoh ohohohoh
oh oh you have so much more
and i dont want to see you like this
when youre crawling
wont you weep for me
wont you breathe for me
wont you let me be
and i dont want to see you like this
when youre crawling oh oh
oh please
dont you drink
dont you let me down
wont you weep
wont you bleedembed"
