throw away my dreams
this fight for my life isnt getting behind me
and ive been told to scream
where no one can hear me it doesnt mean nothing

chorus 1
so make me believe
just take me away from this hell ive created
and im afraid
im breaking my own vows knowing ill go down in flames

verse 2
i know this cant be right
theres got to be something more that i can live for
and i can only hide
inside of this sickness for so long again

chorus 2
so make me believe
just take me away from this hell ive created
and im afraid
im breaking my own vows knowing ill go down
make me believe
just take me away from temptation thats calling me
and im afraid
im breaking my own vows knowing ill go down in flames
