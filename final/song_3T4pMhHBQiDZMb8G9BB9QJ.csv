round and round carousel
has got you under its spell
moving so fast but going nowhere

verse
up and down ferris wheel
tell me how does it feel
to be so high lookin down here

chorus
is it lonely
lonely
lonely

verse
did the clown make you smile
he was only your fool for a while
and now hes gone back home
and left you wandering there

chorus
is it lonely
lonely
