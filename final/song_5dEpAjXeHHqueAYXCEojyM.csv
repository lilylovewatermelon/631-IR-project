a dusty bulb an abandoned lot
and the nighttime was the worst
it shows you all the things youve lost

theres no light in here now
theres no light in here now

if you take the kids and go
i cant blame you for the things you know
and when im out there on the road
i think you and those kids at home

theres no light in here now
theres no light in here now

well 10000 weight in gold
never feels like treasure until you lose it all

well i packed my bag for the road
i grabbed my hat cause its time yes time is marching on
and if you see me out on the road
my bags are packed cause its time yes time is marching on

theres no light in here now
theres no light in here now
i was burned out and lost
theres no light in here now
i was burned out and lost
theres no light in here now
and the nighttime was the worst
theres no light in here now
i was burned out and lostsee the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 63you might also like2embed"
