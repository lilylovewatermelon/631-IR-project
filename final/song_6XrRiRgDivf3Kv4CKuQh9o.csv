think i got a sense for a mosh pit
likes on the gram make a bitch think she poppin
ayy and i keep a cock for a thick bitch
beat around the bush i keep a mop for a misfit

verse 1
ayy goin soul searchin with the demons
murder in july my mama made me mind my business
i dont follow my ex on instagram
cancelled out my life if you fishin for attention
