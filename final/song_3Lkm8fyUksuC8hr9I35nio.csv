maze psychopathic daze i create this waste
back away from tangents on the verge of drastic
ways cant escape this place i deny your face
sweat gets in my eyes i think im slowly dying
put me in a homemade cellar
put me in a hole for shelter
someone hear me please all i see is hate
i can hardly breathe and i can hardly take it

prechorus
hands on my face overbearing i cant get out
hands on my face overbearing i cant

verse 2
lost ran at my own cost hearing laughter scoffed
learning from the rush detached from such and such
bleak all around me weak listening incomplete
i am not a dog but im the one youre dogging
i am in a buried kennel
i have never felt so final
someone find me please losing all reserve
im fucking gone i think im fucking dying

prechorus
hands on my face overbearing i cant get out
hands on my face overbearing i cant

you all stare but youll never see
theres something inside me
you all stare but youll never see
theres something inside me
you all stare but youll never see
theres something inside me
you all stare but youll never see
theres something in you i despise

bridge
cut me show me enter i am willing
and able and never any danger to myself
knowledge in my pain knowledge in my pain
or was my tolerance a phase
empathy out of my way
i cant die
i cant die
i cant die
i cant die

chorus
you all stare but youll never see
theres something inside me
you all stare but youll never see
theres something inside me
you all stare but youll never see
theres something inside me
you all stare but youll never see
theres something in you i despise
