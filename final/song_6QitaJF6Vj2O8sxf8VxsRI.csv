the words are coming i feel terrible
is it typical for us to end like this
am i just another scene from a movie that youve seen
one hundred times
cause baby you werent the first or the last or the worst
and ive got to fill the blanks in the past with a verse
and we could sit around and cry but frankly
youre not worth it anymore

chorus
so say hello to all the boys at the top
of this table that youre under
lipstick lullabies
this is sorry for the last time
and baby i understand that youre making new friends
this is how you get by
the moral this time is
girls make boys cry and i
on any other day id shoot the boy
but your simple toy had caused a scene like this
leave him hanging on the walls just a picture in the hall
like a hundred more like a hundred more
consider this as a gift as you taste him on your lips
and hes making you scream with his hands on your hips
i hope hes leaving you empty baby this is just a fix
such a simple little whore
see mayday parade liveget tickets as low as 96you might also likechorus
so say hello to all the boys at the top
of this table that youre under
lipstick lullabies
this is sorry for the last time
and baby i understand that youre making new friends
this is how you get by
the moral this time is
girls make boys cry and i

bridge
and your name remains the same
all that has changed is this pretty face

so pull the trigger it never gets closer
you want to start over never start over
pull the trigger it never gets closer
you want to start over but never start over

chorus
so say hello to all the boys at the top
of this table that youre under
lipstick lullabies
this is sorry for the last time
and baby i understand that youre making new friends
this is how you get by
the moral this time is
girls make boys cry and i
say hello say hello
lipstick lullabies
this is sorry for the last time
and baby i understand how youre making new friends
this is how you get by
