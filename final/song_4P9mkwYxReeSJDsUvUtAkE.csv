he took his shirt off as he ran
from you so slowly away but i found him hes fine
i wasnt flirting as i am
deciding the loneliest heart in the living room was mine

verse 2
she wasnt trying to make a stand
oh you the only escape from her envy was her pride
well thats not really who i am
the deadliest sins are for those whove partaken and not i

prechorus
well it was only a matter of time

chorus
why dyou keep changing your mind
why dyou keep changing your mind

verse 3
carrying a plastic bag
threw up by your side just to show me im lonely again
well maybe i just aint a man
so loosely reduced to an infant dependant on wine

prechorus
well it was only a matter of time

why dyou keep changing your mind
why dyou keep changing your mind
why dyou keep changing your mind
why dyou keep changing your mind

i got myself stuck
and i wont come near again

he took his shirt off as he ran
from you so slowly away but i found him hes fine

chorus
why dyou keep changing your mind
why dyou keep changing your mind
why dyou keep changing your mind
