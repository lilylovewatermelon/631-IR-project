you are somebody that i dont know
but youre takin shots at me like its patrón
and im just like damn its 7 am
say it in the street thats a knockout
but you say it in a tweet thats a copout
and im just like hey are you okay

prechorus
and i aint tryna mess with your selfexpression
but ive learned a lesson that stressin and obsessin bout somebody else is no fun
and snakes and stones never broke my bones

chorus
so ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
you need to calm down youre being too loud
and im just like ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh oh
you need to just stop like can you just not step on my gown
you need to calm down

verse 2
you are somebody that we dont know
but youre comin at my friends like a missile
why are you mad when you could be glaad you could be glaad
sunshine on the street at the parade
but you would rather be in the dark ages
makin that sign mustve taken all night
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likeprechorus
you just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
and control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
cause shade never made anybody less gay

chorus
so ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
you need to calm down youre being too loud
and im just like ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh oh
you need to just stop like can you just not step on his gown
you need to calm down

bridge
and we see you over there on the internet
comparing all the girls who are killing it
but we figured you out
we all know now we all got crowns
you need to calm down

chorus
ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
you need to calm down you need to calm down
youre being too loud youre being too loud
and im just like ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh oh
you need to just stop can you stop
like can you just not step on our gowns
you need to calm down123embed"
