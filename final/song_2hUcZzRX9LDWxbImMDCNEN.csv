i would be so good
put your trust back in me
the least i think you should
well call it my pathology
so i misunderstood
a bit selfish i should be
if i could change i would
see it on my face

all i wanted was a friend
to look in me to comprehend
all i wanted was to fly
how could you sit and watch me die
all i wanted was you there
your cruelty was my despair
you just killed me so the story goes

once upon a time there was a girl
who loved me more than life itself
by the duck pond she said
carved our names into the bark
we climbed the tree
i slipped and fell behind
now im sorry
you might also likeif you would just come back to me
i would be so good
put your trust back in me
the least i think you should
well call it my pathology
so i misunderstood
a bit selfish i should be
if i could change i would
see it on my face
see it on my face

all reminds me of your name
we sought fortune through the rain
every day and every place
everywhere i kissed your face
all the sacrifice in vain
how could you put all the blame upon me
thats not fair so the story goes

once upon a time
we had the moon we had the stars we were divine
upon my shoulder she cried
now she hides the faith she fears she throws herself
before her bed of lies
shell be sorry
if you would just come back to me
i would be so good
put your trust back in me
the least i think you should
well call it my pathology
so i misunderstood
a bit selfish i should be
if i could change i would
see it on my face

if you would just come back to me
i would be so good
put your trust back in me
the least i think you should
well call it my pathology
so i misunderstood
a bit selfish i should be
if i could change i would
if you would just come back to me
if you would just come back to me oh
if you would just come back to me
i see it on my face 
its alright
its alright
its alrightembed"
