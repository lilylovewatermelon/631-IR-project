verse 1
you gotta be out there
you gotta be somewhere
wherever you are

i sing myself to sleep
and im hopin my dreams

i used to be scared of
letting someone in
but it gets so lonely
being on my own
no one to talk to
and no one to hold me
im not always strong
oh i need you here

im cryin out im ready now
turn my world upside down

im lost inside the crowd its getting loud
i need you to see im screaming for you to please
