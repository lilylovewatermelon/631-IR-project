tristan paul mack wilds is best known for his acting roles as michael lee and dixon wilson on hbo’s “the wire” and cw’s “90210” respectively but before he hit hollywood wilds dreamed of a career in music “i don’t remember a time in my life when music wasn’t a factor in my life” the staten island product says “i was immersed in what music was in the ’90s everything we heard in hiphop i could look outside of my window in the projects and see it going on”

growing up mack saw his father sing in local bands he looked to follow in his dad’s footsteps by practicing around their home in stapleton housing projects the same housing projects that produced numerous members of wutang clan wilds’ earliest music influences were stevie wonder and marvin gaye but he also took to hiphop idolizing mcs like jayz and nas

at around the age of 13 after puberty hit mack noticed his voice began to change and he then added rapping to his repertoire “the music has always been my first love” he says even though his teenage years were spent acting on television and in films like 2008’s “the secret life of bees” with queen latifah and dakota fanning and in 2012’s “red tails” alongside cuba gooding jr and terrence howard
“even with all of the accomplishments i still feel like i haven’t scratched the surface of where i’m supposed to be” mack says

to further his career and dreams mack released a freeseven song ep remember remember in 2011 the next year he hooked up with grammy awardwinning music producer salaam remi and signed with his sonydistributed remi fa record label together the two recorded new york a love story a 1990s hiphopcentered rblaced tale of love and loss

the album’s first single “own it” is produced by salaam and written by mack and rb superstar neyo backed by the same drum track that drove eric b  rakim’s hiphop classic “eric b is president” “own it” finds mack whispering sweet nothings to his dream girl with promises of a lavish life
the flirtatious “henny” samples from mobb deep’s nyc classic “the learning burn” while the seductive “my crib” borrows from jayz’s djfriendly “you me him and her” while new york a love story weaves a romantic tale sonically it’s a nostalgic reminder of the big apple’s most defining sounds– suited for 2013 of course

aside from salaam celebrated ny beat architects dj premier pete rock and havoc also lend their production efforts mack of course adds flowing harmonies over the pounding tracks “the main thing that we wanted to do with this album is show that new york city is back and who better to do it than the people who made it what it is in the first place” he says of being able to work with such an esteemed team of producers

“this is that fullon old school new york boom bap that we’ve been waiting for this sound isn’t just old school this is what is in our blood it’s bigger than a ’90’s feel this is new york”embed"
