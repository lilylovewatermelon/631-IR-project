i like your pants around your feet
and i like the dirt thats on your knees
and i like the way you still say please
while youre looking up at me
youre like my favourite damn disease

verse 2
and i love the places that we go
and i love the people that you know
and i love the way you cant say no
too many long lines in a row
i love the powder on your nose

chorus
and now i know who you are
it wasnt that hard just to figure you out
now i did you wonder why
and now i know who you are
it wasnt that hard just to figure you out
now i did you wonder why

verse 3
i like the freckles on your chest
and i like the way you like me best
and i like the way youre not impressed
while you put me to the test
i like the white stains on your dress
see nickelback liveget tickets as low as 74you might also likeverse 4
and i love the way you pass the check
and i love the good times that you wreck
and i love your lack of selfrespect
while youre passed out on the deck
i love my hands around your neck

chorus
and now i know who you are
it wasnt that hard just to figure you out
now i did you wonder why
and now i know who you are
it wasnt that hard just to figure you out
now i did you wonder why
why not before you never tried
gone for good and this is it

verse 5
i like your pants around your feet
and i like the dirt thats on your knees
and i like the way you still say please
while youre looking up at me
youre like my favorite damn disease

verse 6
and i hate the places that we go
and i hate the people that you know
and i hate the way you cant say no
too many long lines in a row
i hate the powder on your nose
chorus
and now i know who you are
it wasnt that hard just to figure you out
now i did you wonder why
and now i know who you are
it wasnt that hard just to figure you out
now i did you wonder why
why not before you never tried
gone for good and this is it3embed"
