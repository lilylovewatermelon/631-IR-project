do what they love most of all
we are the best at rhythm and laughter
thats why we love carnaval

all so clear we can sing to
sun the beaches they call
dance to the music passion and love
show us the best you can do

everyone here is on fire
get up and join in the fun
dance with a stranger romance and danger
magic could happen for real in rio

all by itself you cant see it coming
you cant find it anywhere else
its real in rio know something else
you can feel it happen
you can feel it all by yourself

all the birds of a feather
do what we love most of all
moon and the stars sun and guitars
thats why we love carnaval
you might also likeloving our life in the jungle
everythings wild and free
never alone cause this is our home
magic can happen for real in rio

all by itself you cant see it coming
you cant find it anywhere else

im the capoeira kinga kinga kinga kinga kinga
birds like me cause im a hot winga
theres your hota winga caw

everything can be for real in rio

heres something else
