hey girl open the walls
play with your dolls
well be a perfect family
when you walk away is when we really play
you dont hear me when i say
mom please wake up
dads with a slut
and your son is smoking cannabis

prechorus
no one ever listens
this wallpaper glistens
dont let them see what goes down in the kitchen

chorus
places places get in your places
throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
everyone thinks that were perfect
please dont let them look through the curtains
picture picture smile for the picture
pose with your brother wont you be a good sister
everyone thinks that were perfect
please dont let them look through the curtains

this wallpaper glistens
one day theyll see what goes down in the kitchen
