the fat is in the fire a fryer made of chicken wire
gettin sick and tired of a friggin liar
pelican with some very soft mangos
a closet full of skeletons and terry cloth kangols
flew the coop before you hit it let me warn you
she did a cool hulahoop but dont get any on you
its all a big scam to make yall eat pig ham
when hes on the mic hes like the triggerman figjam
doom not to be confused with nobody
especially since the flows he used was so nutty
never too woozy to go study
crews got no clues like old cruddy officer mcgillicuddy
watch your six he got a lot of more tricks
lyrics bricks on sticks sure got rawnytics
its a gift dont get shot for kicks
with the same slick used to plot sick vics with
spotted at a chick flick holdin hands
the other one on his swollen glans a golden chance
thats why he kept them holes in his pants
rollin in a old van is what he told his stolen fans
is that you true matched from hat to shoe
snafu snatch any brew labatts blue
black jew like thats new patch me through
no latch attached skat shoo catch twentytwo
super hes loaded dice nice
and overpriced an arm and a leg owe em your life or your ice
villain nag a grieving old hag
snag a bragger by his mic cord and leave him holding the bag
come clean a bunch of dumb mean cream puffs
a keen drum machine buff who fiends for more green stuff
instead of starvin there be problems by the goo gobs
aight somebodys robbin lou dobbs and them tonight
and hes on the next flight moon bound
and makes it a point to stay away from the goon pound
got some peers thats gone in the lost years
tears and cheers born in the crosshairs

why are you listening to this backwards reversed
hey mr thundercleese whats that you were singing
it is the robotic hymn of doom
well i always say nothin livens up a robotic hymn of doom
better than an amazing pair of jugs6embed"
