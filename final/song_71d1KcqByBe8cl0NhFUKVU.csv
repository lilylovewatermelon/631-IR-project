were far from good not good from far
ninety miles per hour down compton boulevard
with the top down screamin we dont give a fuck
drink my fortyounce of freedom while i roll my blunt
cause the kids just aint alright

interlude absoul
oh shit nigga
somethin bout to happen
nigga this shit nigga this sound like thirty keys under the compton court building
hope the dogs dont smell it

verse 1 kendrick lamar
welcome to vigilante 80s so dont you ask me
im hungry my bodys antsy i rip through your fuckin pantry
peelin off like a xanny examine my orchestra
granny said when im old enough ill be sure to be all i can be
you niggas marcus camby washed up
pussy fix your panties im mr marcus you gettin fucked uh
you aint heard nothin harder since daddy kane
take it in vain vicodins couldnt ease the pain
lightning bolts hit your body you thought it rained
not a cloud in sight just the shit that i write
strong enough to stand in front of a travelin freight train are you trained
to go against dracula draggin the record industry by my fangs
ak clips money clips and gold chains
you walk around with a p90 like its the 90s
bullet to your temple your homicidell remind me

verse 2 kendrick lamar
lets hit the county buildin gotta cash my check
spend it all on a fortyounce to the neck
and in retrospect i remember december being the hottest
squad cars neighborhood wars and stolen mazdas
i tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
up and down get a sixfour better know how to drive it
im drivin on e with no license or registration
heart racin racin past johnny because hes racist
1987 the children of ronald reagan
rake the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch im really out here my nigga
he blowin on stress hopin to ease the stress like really out here
he coppin some blow hopin that it can stretch
newborn massacre
hoppin out the passenger with calendars cause your day comin
run him down and then he gun him down im hopin that you fast enough
even the legs of michael johnson dont mean nothin because
chorus kendrick lamar  rza
