so please dont ask me how
i ended up at my wits end
and breaking down
pages torn from books we never read
cause were plugged into this grid
dont pull this plug right now
or then wed really have to live

prechorus
when i die will they remember not
what ive done but what i havent done
its not the end that i fear with each breath
its life that scares me to death

chorus
when we built these dreams on sand
how they all slipped through our hands
this might be our only chance
lets take this one day at a time
ill hold your hand if you hold mine
the time that we kill keeps us alive

verse 2
your words wont save me now
im at the edge feeling the sweat drip from my brow
get a grip on yourself is what they say
every hour every day
hands over my ears
ive been screaming all these years
you might also likeprechorus
when i die will they remember not
what ive done but what i havent done
its not the end that i fear with each breath
its life that scares me to death

chorus
when we built these dreams on sand
how they all slipped through our hands
this might be our only chance
lets take this one day at a time
ill hold your hand if you hold mine
the time that we kill keeps us alive

bridge
we came in search of answers
we left empty handed again
shots fired into the sky
are now returning
where the fuck will you hide

verse 3
hiding from the laughter in the closets of our lives
but the door hinges are squeaking letting in thin shards of light
and now a hands extending outward
quiet comfort they invite
do we dare take what they offer
do we step into the light
prechorus
when i die will they remember not
what ive done but what i havent done
its not the end that i fear with each breath
its life that scares me to death

chorus
when we built these dreams on sand
how they all slipped through our hands
this might be our only chance
lets take this one day at a time
ill hold your hand if you hold mine
the time that we kill keeps us alive
when we built these dreams on sand
how they all slipped through our hands
this might be our only chance
lets take this one day at a time
ill hold your hand if you hold mine
the time that we kill keeps us alive2embed"
