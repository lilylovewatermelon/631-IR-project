standing naked in your kitchen
feeling free that i could be alive
clearly im a contradiction
too young to be my wife
a peaceful storm is never hectic
her mellow voice that i could be within
the uniform is anorexic
a jealous choice wont win

prechorus
a metamorphosis samurai
ygot a little lord fish and i dont know why
i got a metamorphosis samurai

verse 2
paint your face cause im a black foot
i thought i counted up the fireflies
close enough to get a good look
time to mobilize

prechorus
a metamorphosis samurai
ygot a little lord fish and i dont know why
i got a metamorphosis samurai
see red hot chili peppers liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likechorus
im a lonely lad ive lost myself out on the range
i dont remember much so dont ask me ive gone insane

verse 3
taking acid in a graveyard
stealing food to keep the night alive
every day i try to play hard
even with my lies
the day they found you on a tour bus
the news was barren as a desert bone
the tabloids made a kind of small fuss
a couple pictures shown

chorus
im a lonely lad ive lost myself out on the range
i dont remember much so dont ask me ive gone insane

verse 4
slowly turning into driftwood
no one ever wants to die alone
thinking that a pretty gift could
make you less unknown
dirty sneakers on the pavement
the brilliant features of a common man
see the miracle of your life
no one ever can
chorus
im a lonely lad
ive lost myself out on the range
i dont remember much
so dont ask me ive gone insane

outro
see the world go by
the changes that we entertain
i dont recall it all
remember i have gone insane4embed"
