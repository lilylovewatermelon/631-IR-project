at night on the roof top i untie my hair
and watch from my plastic chair
as my dark hair unleashes the night

verse 2
the scent of flowers
still in bloom from morning shower
and i say your name in hopes youll hear it in the stars

chorus
and carry me out
carry me out

bridge
i drive when it rains at night when it rains i drive
and the headlight spirits they lead me down the styx
so black it shines

chorus
and carry me out
carry me out

outro
at night on the roof top i untie my hair
and watch from my plastic chair
as my dark hair unleashes the nightsee mitski liveget tickets as low as 39you might also like12embed"
