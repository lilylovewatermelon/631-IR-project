as cold as an old ice cream sandwich as focused as mr miyagi
you poke at your phone posting aerial photos of you and your smoothie
i cant keep on making you happy cause you got issues with your daddy
i miss ramen noodles and laughing at you and your gran in home movies

prechorus
but i wish i could show you more of yourself
i wish i could make you somebody else
but i left it way too late
are you stuck in your own ways
im begging

chorus
hands knees please tangerine come on back to me
you got what i need tangerine do this for me
hands knees please tangerine sugar honey sweet
got what i need tangerine

verse 2
you let the devil in and all you talk is money money money money money
its so funny how it changes how you feel
how you see how you need how you sleep
all your freedom caffeine how youre looking at me
but i love it when the light sits on you just right
tiny tangerine speckles painted in your eyes

hands knees please tangerine come on back to me
you got what i need tangerine do this for me
hands knees please tangerine sugar honey sweet
got what i need tangerine

oh my god

super clear since the late 1990s

when youre drunk watching movies
