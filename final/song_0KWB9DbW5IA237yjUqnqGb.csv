outside of your reach
i took my chance and went there
i would like to see whats there
i would like to see whats there

how about we take a trip and start it all over
how about you take me to japan
i would like to see you there
i would like to see you there

prechorus
but dont you expect me to share my love with you
oh oh no

chorus
gotta keep your heads up
gotta keep your feet down
we dont want love
at least not from that crowd

verse 2
how about we make a quick memory out of this 
i would like to be in there
i would like to be in there
you might also likeits not an evil trick you know that i told you
im not the kind that you repair
you can barely see whats there
you can barely see whats there

prechorus
but dont you expect me to share my love with you
oh oh no

chorus
gotta keep your heads up
gotta keep your feet down
we dont want love
at least not from that crowd
gotta keep your heads up
gotta keep your feet down
we dont want love
at least not from that crowdembed"
