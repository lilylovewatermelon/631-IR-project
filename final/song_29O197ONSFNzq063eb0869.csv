been working like a dog tryna please em all
tryna put another comma in the bank
tryna get these brokedown dreams to crank
sometimes a good good girls gotta break out the denim
gonna pour me a drink pour my ass in em
for heavens sake i need a good time
lord knows it aint no crime

chorus
to leave a little lipstick red on a solo
make a little mess of my head on the cuervo
i dont need no help no i got this
coming in hot as hell yall watch this
gonna tear up this town like a drunk tornado
light it up let it all go
tell that angel inside of me to hide her wings and lay low
hold my halo

verse 2
i gotta neon side
i let her shine sometimes
sitting like a devil on my shoulder
tonight im gonna let her take over

chorus
to leave a little lipstick red on a solo
make a little mess of my head on the cuervo
i dont need no help no i got this
coming in hot as hell yall watch this
gonna tear up this town like a drunk tornado
light it up let it all go
tell that angel inside of me to hide her wings and lay low
hold my halo
