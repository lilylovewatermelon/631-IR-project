if you want change you could have it
sleep on your bed you could have it
pull it to my head you could have it

if you want love you could have it
the way that you love you could have it
if you want time you could have it
ill tell you no lie you could have it

just dont kill dont kill the magic
just dont kill dont kill the magic
im not ready to give up just yet
we could stay until we both forget
so baby don’t kill dont kill
dont kill the magic

if you want space you could have it
if you want change ill make it drastic
sleep on your bed ill be your mattress
pull it to my head you could blast it

ohhh if you want love ill be tragic
the way that you love i can match it
if you want time ill be elastic
and tell you no lie you can have it
no lie
