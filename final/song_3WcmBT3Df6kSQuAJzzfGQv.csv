i had all but given up on finding the one that i could fall into
on the day before you
i was ready to settle for less than love and not much more
there was no such thing as a dream come true
oh but that was all the day before you

chorus
now youre here and everythings changing
suddenly life means so much
i cant wait to wake up tomorrow
and find out this promise is true
i will never have to go back to
the day before you

verse 2
in your eyes i see forever
it makes me wish that my life never knew
the day before you
oh but heaven knows those years without you
were shaping my heart for the that day i found you
if youre the reason for all ive been through
then im thankful for the day before you

chorus
now youre here and everythings changing
suddenly life means so much
i cant wait to wake up tomorrow
and find out this promise is true
i will never have to go back to
the day before you
