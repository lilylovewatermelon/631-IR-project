if youre bummed out
feel free to talk with me
how does lunch sound
ill ask you about your week
and the comedown
always rehashing scenes
when the suns down
and half of the worlds asleep
im halfasleep

verse 1 sophie meiers
and i wonder
what you would have done
if i kissed you
i had my chance
i held your hand
and leaned up close to you
now it just seems like i messed up
i dont know what to do
all i know is im nervous that you dont like me too
verse 2 ivy sole
i thought that home was where you are until that home is where i left
i found a home inside myself since no home for me was left
i slept with poems in my hands for seven days
slept alone and wept by twilight saw a throne a silent phone in heavens name
cause home can change and it does
coining names for new love
joining strange depictions tinted with that rose from my bud
cause blood is thick but smoke be thick as hell
eyes low my mind been shell or shellshocked
with lonely mail all cluttered on my desktop
you still got best box cutter slice and dice me sideways stumped
stutter with that tttongue
i scream gently howd you undo us
for goodness sake you make me undone
these poems underneath my nails
sweat makes the ink run
smolderheady memory brain shoulder a pink love
my poems in the mail
it was tears that made the ink run
heavy molting memory brain shedding a pink ton

ill ask you about your week
on the come down
always rehashing scenes
when the suns down
and half of the worlds asleep
