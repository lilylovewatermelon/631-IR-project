yeah

verse kid cudi
element of the surprise
such a spectacular thing i cannot lie
so many things people wanna limit you to be
i show you a glimmer inside the spectrum of the wizard
well known as a getter and a nigga with a plan
the negative that come out they mouth so sad
when i smash wipe the smirk off they face my bad
who bad i am my dad raised one hell of a man
at eleven i had to throw on the pants
still dont feel appreciated and not by my own fam
all good ill be tucked away in them shadows
workin in sweats solve the riddle and soon im ready for battle
move my fans with my love and they move me with theirs
we unified by the dark and middle fingers in air
come on who gon go half on a zone
oh thought i would be done off that coke no
let me tell you some ho
ben said everything that shine aint gold
been skeetin on pretty faces then my heart switched cold
been the nigga sittin in hell in fresh ass clothes
i know what it feels like to have a broken nose
and aint nobody hit you in it
its really cause that shit that you snorted and put all in it
that time you thought i was finished no i just experimented
and it helped me adjust and be ok with being demented
by the way nigga these cars aint rented i give a fuck who sees
so i dont bother rollin tinted look who the fuck it be
that skinny cleveland niggie i stay reppin my city bitch
been smokin no jokin cudders had that itch so i scratch
