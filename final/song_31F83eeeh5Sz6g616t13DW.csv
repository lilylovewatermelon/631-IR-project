record man play my song on the radio
you too busy tryna find that blueeyed soul
i let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
and i swear too much on the regular
we gon let them hits fly we gon let it go
if it aint xo then it gotta go
i just won a new award for a kids show
talkin bout a face numbin off a bag of blow
im like goddamn bitch i am not a teen choice
goddamn bitch i am not a bleach boy
whip game make a nigga understand though
got that hannibal silence of the lambo
hit the gas so hard make it rotate
all my niggas blew up like a propane
all these rb niggas be so lame
got a sweet asian chick she go lo mein ohohoh

chorus
you know me know me uh nanananana
you know me know me know me ohohoh
you know me know me know me nanananana
every time you try to forget who i am
ill be right there to remind you again
you know me pow pow
you know me know me

said im just tryna swim in somethin wetter than the ocean
faded off a double cup im mixin up the potion
all i wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
it just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
everybody knows it all these niggas know me
platinum off a mixtape sippin on that codeine
pour it in my trophies roll until my nose bleed
ima keep on singin while im burnin up that og
all my niggas get it they make money all alone
rock a chain around they neck makin sure im gettin home
when i travel round the globe make a couple mil a show
and i come back to my city i fuck every girl i know
used to walk round with a slouch had a mattress on the floor
now my shit straight eatin all day tryna lose weight
that good sex well sweat it out
hotel bed springs well wear it out
i aint gotta tell you

chorus
cause you know me ohohoh

you know me know me know me ohohoh
you know me know me know me nanananana
every time you try to forget who i am try to forget who i am
