hello old friend from the road
i wanted to write a note
to let you know that all in all it aint all what it seems
i feel like ive hit a low
one ive never hit before
lately ive been feeling small as the salt in the sea
oh its so much to do in so little of time
i feel like i fell a little behind
hodo hodo hodo
it seems so out of reach
the place i want to be
whoever thought id get there anyway
hodo hodo hodo

prechorus
i find it hard to get
way too hard to live
tell me what you know
now before i go

chorus
oh blue i wrote for you
to say im gonna run away from home
oh blue i love you too
but today im gonna run away from home

oh i weep through the night
cant find a love who loves me the same
or as much as you do
hodo hodo hodo
oh i reach out my hand hoping that theyll see
im more than what everyone tells me
hodo hodo hodo
see im getting tired of the way ive been living
id rather die than to live with these feelings
stuck in this world where theres so much to prove
every win gives you more room to lose
its too many ups and downs on the ride
i spent inordinate mounts of time
trapped in a lonely loner life
looking for love where im denied

prechorus
i find it hard to get
way too hard to live
tell me what you know
now before i go

chorus
oh blue i wrote for you
to say im gonna run away from home
oh blue i love you too
but today im gonna run away from home
outro
away from home
oh oh
today im gonna run away
today im gonna run away15embed"
