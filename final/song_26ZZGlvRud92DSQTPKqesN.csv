you never laugh like you used to youve got fainter expressions
you headin down the wrong path and they changin directions
maybe dont mention bout how i made me your blessin
and lately i question the shit that was taught to me
im awkwardly stoppin these conversations
hey how long you waitin till the day you wake up and thank god you made it
i dont like to dwell but man i gotta say it dont like my songs but you still gotta play it
dont like your road just nwa dr dre it
stop contemplatin and stop complainin
and recreate it actually dont recreate it be creative
reached the place where you still vibe in that shit when we replay it
living a life of pain just to alleviate it
when you havent used nothing but distractions to really take it
yeah maybe theyll change when they see we made it
we headin onto new platforms and leavin the basics
verse 3
uh my creative process is making progress
despite my background i havent gotten to playin lacrosse yet
dont you know we got a good thing goin
ive been watchin all these shows while i could be showin
ive been creeping up on the door so dangerous
you looking at statistics while i figure how im changin them
i done learned so many things in my past life
now i dont give a single shit about the rap life
thats nice aint it thats nice to be given advice when i paint it
have twice much the fame and
i cant even comprehend that much in the future
hatin the teacher but you loving the tutor
enter the game im a fuckin intruder
stealin these flows man im stuck as a looter
procrastinatin cause my fucking computer
no willpower im just stuck as a loser

verse 4
sittin alone at 3 am
chillin on a late night is the weekdays friend
man this shit is too wild i must behave ben
thats what the teachers are preachin to me but even when
im on the top of this drop and theyre rocking the world with confidence
accomplishments topplin everyone and you try stoppin it
obvious theres a problem and solvin it just aint up to me
luckily ive been trained to test the system dont you fuck with me
i hope you like my company i hope you do appreciate it
i hope that one day youll see we made it
no you cannot recreate it all of this pain i just alleviate it
im just trying to find the mindset grinding to be the greatest
that is why im strivin livin tryin im buyin
im givin dignity cryin im winnin but feel like dyin
im shining im like a diamond but i am dead on the inside
guessin now well rest with this but set it on my big mind
hook 1
and im in time
workin all my life get that in line
im tryna figure out everyone get their pictures out
nobodys gonna live without this shit on the incline
im on the incline im on the incline
stay in your lane you got your place and im in mine
im on the incline bitch im on the incline
nobody can really understand how my shit climb

verse 5
have i been livin yet spendin time on the internet
im wastin they hatin it i should be makin it aimin for goals but takin this shit instead
i stay in bed laughin at stupid shit ludicrous
who is this tenyearold pregnant with two new kids why am i doing this
why the fuck do i care i dont but i kinda do
i dont know what i try to do but whatever it is i say bye to you
hey me i lied to you dont realize well its time you do
you have no idea what i can do when the skies are gray you gotta find a blue
you gotta try to do something to put you into a new positive mindset
set headlines go wreck lines pass deadlines leave lines dead
i guess that i digress and i digest the way im blessed
impressed after im pressed you seek intent for what i said
but im just gonna move on get your groove on for my new song
do right and you do wrong got a big head jimmy neutron
you try to hate well get in line just delivered some quick rhymes
some straight bars we have came far but we lookin up on the incline

interlude 1
water break
i got a lot to say
its been eleven minutes so far
actually it hasnt its been shorter

verse 6
how can
i have a believable meaning
when all of you livin in paradise livin in luxury
nobody seen it or  greet it
but what if its different i mean its all seeming to be
and its in inconceivable dreaming
i know its so unbelievable being
stuck in this rare unachievable feeling
they givin me something i ended up leaving
they givin me nothing i ended up grievin
no positive side ended up seeing
what life could be like from a  different lead in
thank god for a cover zone
so i know when and where to cross it
all over the place
im surprised i havent lost it

hook 2
yeah ayy and im feeling like im at the top uh
livin to the max now
yeah thats how and ima say it that loud
im steppin up i never back down more focused on my background
and the music and how my rap sounds speak up cut the track down
go till the end i dont back out stuck in the trap figure that out
after ill do the math now its garbage take the trash out
but im here to stay till i pass out blackout

verse 7
okay its time to go fast
so sit back and relax and just maybe youll get it
about time but maybe youre mad i said it
you gon pay attention cash or credit
i have to let it go back a second
i have some lyrics in the past that i have to edit
now were back in the middle of the track and fed it
mix it up and if you talk then nah forget it
we moved on walked past the exit
want you to come back and pass a message
never pack bags and trash you left it
kinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it
money never am glad i spent it
if i ever had told you im mad i meant it
if you ever feel bad or sad accept it
think back to the track and the rap that ben did
yeah pretty obvious im killing it
if this isnt my time then maybe you need a syllabus
im feelin all the rhythm you can tell that i am into this
voice is more powerful than a million instruments
suddenly lyrics go demon like its somebody else
people want me to grow because of you
but im never going to level my endeavors to be better
than the people that never had trust in me
yeah uh

hook 3
and im feeling like im at the top yeah
livin to the max now uh
yeah thats how and ima say it that loud
im stepping up i never back down more focused on background
and the music and how my rap sounds

verse 8
speak up and theyre messing with the track now
people are tellin me that im fallin short
looking back at you when youre missing all the cash now
and im mad at the fact that
im not in my right mind
meant to be a halfdecent rapper
but i keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time
lookin at yourself you never know what you might find
lookin at the sky in the middle of the nighttime
i find so much life
i wonder why i cant just find mine
got so many confusing questions
so much knowledge i cant use the lessons
im emerging out with a new profession
ima do the best with my new perfection
and im doin it
im moving onto this future shit
these hooligans are complete fools in that
they just dont understand that i am through with it
improvin it im improvin it
i got my brain and im usin it
and ima make it out alive when im playin and takin
and makin this cash that im tearing these tools to bits
youre clueless
ninety percent of yall ignorant
keeping your minds ohso limited
get off your high horse because it is time to figure it out
seeming so close i can picture it now
success in my drink and im sippin it now
envisioning deeper ambitions and now
ima get to it that is what livings about

interlude 2
uh god
uh
my voice is gone already shit
alright ayy ayy ayy

verse 9
think ive got a consensus bein lost in the trenches
adolescent lessons expressin gods job is to tempt us
makin it hard to stay alive its so easy to die
makin you hang your head low but say reach for the skies
life is a walkin contradiction i see through its lies
im just tryna tell the stories ive seen through its eyes
i feel im forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry
with all this fake deep bullshit im too eager to try
yeah everybody sendin blessings in need of reply
tryna sell their own tears for they bleedin they dry
fuck your demons inside im in need of the why
so i can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh
like oh well i can say that i tried
hopped into life and then i stayed for the ride
so many beautiful faces but they vacant inside
and im just patiently waiting for the day i decide damn
this reminds me of days when i drive in la​
im screamin hi to the sky up with a smile on my face
now im hidin my face i keep tryin to trace
all of the steps that i had taken to findin my place
swept out to oceans so lonely waves feel like an embrace
and now im lookin at my mic like its sent as a prophet
i used to be an atheist but that turned me agnostic
recently ive been wondering if ive fuckin lost it
see my friends from kindergarten go to rehab
thats the type of shit that makes you think back
to simpler times blissfully ignorant minds
before reality could ground us we would live in the skies
and as a and as a kid i never thought id be bein like this nah
man as a kid i never thought this would even exist
i felt elusive intangible just steam in the mist
and now im wakin up feelin i aint even this shit
you only look at what you got once you see that its lost
and lifes too gradual for me to believe in my sauce
dont understand rappers braggin i got that paper on me
man i got kids in schools who doin presentations on me
so what the fuck you really value tryin to take that from me
to me ill take that over rollies and makin some money
rain or sunny ima do this every day i study
and write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy damn
like tyler creator tweets i just capitalize
these romans tally up my hits with the capital is
this is a natural high
i see it comin from afar im still actin surprised but i aint mastered the skies
i wrote this album so much passion i actually cried
they say cause i was never trappin my rap is a lie
they think cause im a awkward kid im invalid
as dj khaleds son receivin a platinum plaque for bein alive
threw out half of my album it wasnt good enough
shit i mean it still isnt good enough
im like a active volcano i know i could erupt
but i guess i am not full enough damn
i swear the higher you get thats the lower you feel
man thats more shit you gotta do or you wont get a deal
man thats more shit you gotta prove so they know that its real
thirty seconds of listenin thinkin you know how i feel
yeah said this a motherfucking thesis statement
yeah came a long way i cannot be complacent
every day i wake up stressed i have to be the greatest
and if not then thats a day i truly feel ive wasted
most of the pressure on my shoulders is comin from me
so when i die i know i left us with something to leave
so when i wake up in the morning with something to see
yeah i got so much shit that im wantin to be

verse 10
benny ben benjamin selena gomez has said
if you ready come get it then everyone is jealous
many want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant
got iphone camera lenses to get the instagram evidence
yeah i know im way too cocky
but im workin im figurin it all out
so when people say you cant that makes you wanna get better
thats benefit of the doubt
ive been on the top of this never droppin the bottom
its opposite from the positives got them from talkin often
and im locked in a pocket of all my thoughts and they keep turnin around
always stoppin my songs cause they keep burnin the sound im like
yeah this is freedom of speech
tryna murder all the people who be keepin the peace
sacrifice your whole life cause you need a degree
opportunity in front of you you need to achieve im like
nah im just tryna find some clarity
apparently it all has to do with popularity
there will be obstacles primarily people blinded to
what is carefully being prepared to me
sometimes youll have hilarity parody and prosperity
im askin hillary clinton to marry me powerful in the very least

verse 11
giving you all of my money but never see legacy every day that im meant to see
everyone here is impaired it is so scary and menacing but i know enemy
cause i go uh walking away hopping block and whats often the case
shot in the face gun locked and loaded been off at the race droppin the bass
off of the place brought in a way predict what i will probably say
and at the end of the day you still talking to me so obviously let the audience say
so let me explain this to those who came in looking at the stages
seeing a white kid thinking hes famous when they dont understand
that i take risks and i make hits from basic playlist to the greatest
entertaining the nation be patient whilst waiting for me to break in

verse 12
reenergize got lyrics to memorize
start an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try
thats my dream job bein lazy just sittin
with the tv on they say that im bright like neon
but i aint takin responsibility pay me for havin
limited ability with little humility
but whatever im doin it seems to be killin me
im unwillingly artistically fittin into this history
tryna show you why im better but none of you believe me
tryna win this gold and try hard good game gg
you beat me and now you see me in 3d but you cant feel me
showin up on your device controloptiondelete
consider myself elite measure myself in retweets
i be talkin way more chill so you can reach me
instead of pretendin you understand what i am talkin bout
im the exhibit you kinda scared for like a haunted house
tryna show you something instead of just sittin on the couch
ill be honest now i rarely end up walkin out
into reality in normality actually happily
found myself doin nothing and you dont laugh at me why
cause ideally you would do the same thing
nothing cause for a brain that is amazing
not complainin but the best part of life is not even livin it
love sleepin and just usin the internet
but my time is limited and i better figure this
before im slippin this opportunity out my fingertips
and let me just tell you what i have came to do
tryna show you i can rap as fast as im able to
tryna show you i can hop in here like a kangaroo
and say some stupid metaphors and leave after im breakin through
and if a major record label is looking at me
im a nice guy with bad teeth got a nice eye for bad beats
i can rap fast and rap slow
i may make mistakes but everyone has so
im like mj back when he had the afro
also im not black so maybe not
but before everyone gets angry stop
im that person then people naturally hate me block
all the people who keep on going crazy off
cause i wont be making amazing songs in a mainstream got
a lot of prominent features im a confident speaker
with some dominant teachers
i deserve to be a starter but constantly on the bleachers
im awfully smallachiever when im up on the spot and eager
they be fearin this every time that they hearin it
to know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin a pyramid
so when youre nearin this please let me know
when im standin here frozen please let it go
hear the metronome combined in the compilation
to unlock superstardom and move all across the nation
but that is just a dream and probably a combination
of a big ego and false encouragement on the way in
but when im playin just know its all a big game
i was tryna blow up bang have a big name
but when you think about it it is all insane
what can be created from chemicals in this brain
but when you look at me you lackin respect
when im crackin my neck so that i can rap to my chest
has in a breath some say that its magic i step
until im on the same stage and you have it again
but but when you think about the halloffame
you think about how people used to sit and call you names
and you check and wonder if it will be all the same
step back into reality it all remains damn

interlude 3
alright i just spilled water on my computer right now
on my computers breaking while im doing this thirtythousands words shit
hold on uh
goddamn it

verse 13
my lyrics are not showing up on the screen you knowin just what i mean
this is off the top i dont need to use no machines
hold up i know i can freestyle but i cant do it forever
but i am very clever okay okay
im gonna take a drink if youre watchin this take a drink too
these are some shit that you can drink to
but drink water unless youre of age
you know what im sayin ayy

interlude 4
okay okay
uh
uh
ayy

verse 14
i feel like im way too different ridiculous
most of humanitys made of idiots
i barely even get myself and you thinkin you understand
you think hiding behind a screen gives you the upperhand
please what i do is barely poetry
theres hope for me im noticing people starting to notice me
but still consider me confident
still consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness
but honestly all of this is haunting me probably
it is just my sense of myself wobbling toppling
into awfully small pieces normally all bleedin
its tragic and not fleetin it follows me all evening
its calling my name constantly makes it so hard to stay awake
i close my eyes and let it go and it all fades away
yeah were just tryna find that great escape
to get away from how were living life daytoday
some people find it in a drink or in a cup
or in some bling or in a drug or in the things that give us love
but all i know is that its tough
and all i know is that this stuff isnt enough its way too much

verse 15
im young and ill like the dictator man what i gotta do to make the quick paper
these kidhaters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players
that shit will make me go but im aiming high and you aiming low
got amazing rhymes and a crazy flow and i may be lyin but i came to show
what i can do when i get on the mic and im keeping it moving you said im the hype
and im seeing it through in successes inside i dont take it for granted with plans in this life
set on the wrong forgetting the right like 2 am in my head in the lights
ahead of the best of em lettin the rest of em go off to bed in the night
getting it like i be livin in first class i know that you never will surpass
getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever i work fast
remember the memos they sendin and sendin again and again  and they never will end it
and say it is splendid but never relented and every sentence i say is perfected
take a deep breath cause i need that
most of yall dont even care what im saying you really just like how i speak fast
my bars are meta i got meta bars with metaeights and metaphors
you want better cores and better cars but you dont know what im headin towards
say that i am the king of this shit crazy rhymes they aint thinkin of this
im singin and rappin and makin it happen and makin you laugh when im bringin this shit
tryna find the other way yall just waiting for another day
cause what other fourteenyearold had hit 100k
im making the most of a crazier flow so many ways it could go
im taking the throne and you chillin and stayin at home im willing to make it my own
im bakin my cake and you know that im eating it even if staying up late is the needed bit
reason is stayin the same im just fleein it leavin my life while im seeing these seasons switch
meaning these people aint feelin rich reach in the fire im heatin it
pleasin these liars theyve peaked and so now theyre recedin agreein to be a live without leading it
flows so dope i think its time that we take a break
we all make mistakes and play some hate i got 808s here to save the day
cause i am on top of it lost in my thoughts and i gotta be stoppin it rockin it
you know my flow is so dominant positive confident full of accomplishments compliments
all of these offers is boring as fuck though i am not a part of em
start a new part to the charts and i gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when im starting it
breaking it up like cartilage flow is so crazy its dope and you know it
i know that you hate to admit it but really this shit is the business rhymes keep darkenin
under the radar you dont know whats comin im comin right up and your bitch started runnin
i found to be part of a little of something called love and i guess thats the art of it
i try to go slow but it dont work
gettin better and that dont hurt and you think im dead and youre sure
youre salty and not kosher slave to the corporates and the owners
this is live and love call it shrek like the ogre
hah bitch i have had enough and i am sure i aint mad enough
forgettin the rest while im gettin success and i look at the numbers i add em up
my chart is like a parabola thank you a lot for havin us
and so every day i take one step up man i am takin the ladder up
hundred k get the plaque lookin forward not heading back
remember what i had said is that we aint givin up remember that
hit me up when youre done whining ill hit you up when im done rhyming
listen up cause im combining all my skills into one finding
we run grinding you know we do we got the shit that were goin through
these lyrics go over you you  dont listen so you dont know its true
cause we in and weve done it thousands now we a hundred
shoutout to didac and momo and the others
shit i consider them brothers shit i consider you all are my family
shoutout to those who will stand with me even when all of the others abandon me
yeah drama we move past that now i look at you with the last laugh
better trackback now i rap fast so many skills in my backpack
started off so terribly now all of these people compare to me
in the past i never anticipated what there would be
and see ya so long now off to the end of the song now
see ya next at fivehundred and a million its on now

interlude 5
its on now
oh shit im almost out of water
this is a hard this a real challenge
this like physically difficult ayy

hook 4
when i walk up in the scene i hear a orchestra
now everybody telling me i dont perform enough
my math teacher told me that id never be shit
and now im searched more then the quadratic formula
i got the formula i got the formula
you got the sauce but goddamn i got the formula ayy
people always asking ben why you record so much
i got to fry up all these rappers quick like order up

verse 16
formula like im mr krabs
i change and transform it up you stuck in the past
yeah i wear supreme goggles to my science lab
uh it hurts to write this song cause i dont like to brag
and now ive tied myself up like a nike mag
people love to criticize me for the life ive had
they make it bout white and black like im michael jack
i make these haters look confused like its dora asking where swipper at ayy
uh bitch im supreme cause i got it on me now they copy that like a walkietalkie
and im feelin like they really want to stop me tryna fold my paper like its origami
wanna justify the hate they call me cocky and i am cause your girl call me papi
tryna take tituh paparazzi im a fax machine up in a lot of copies
ayy still saying who woulda thought like who woulda guessed it
havent lifted weights in two years but somehow im always flexing
if you really want to find the answer to your question here is where you should look
want the secret to the sauce motherfucker better go and find a cookbook

verse 17
ayy they doubt a fucker with a dream
looking to the stars for some money and a scheme yeah
looking at the cars all the hundreds and the greens
serpents told you no and its like nothings as it seems
god damn i guess i really thought he was the man
i guess i really thought he had some fans but that shit is all a sham
all that cash he stocked was from a scam
all the views he got was from some spam
ive been living like man aint why he been doin what he can
why aint he just sticking to the plan
how has he been living with no limits getting millions by the minutes
i dont get it i dont really understand
ive been living like damn he aint getting money by the gram
ill do better if i study my exams do i really wanna stand
next to all these average fucking sad duds
so i hate this motherfucker with a dream cause he has one

hook 5
yeah
hate a motherfucker with a dream cause he has one
ayy
just because you gave up doesnt mean im a backup
uh uh uh
feel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones
and so they hate a motherfucker with a dream cause he

verse 18
cause he been living this passion ima just sit and imagine
ive got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap and she really been digging my track and im livin for snap
that shit invisible now im unoriginal now
im making a minimum wage this is literal aids and im needin to figure this out
how did i get to the stage i wanna get up on stage do this shit everyday
and i wont care bout whatever they say let em all pester away
but i just cant shoot my shot got a bad gun
so i hate this motherfucker with a dream cause he has one

verse 19
by now if youre still watching this shit
you are a boss and you deserve some applause for this shit
but we aint over we aint done though
am i takin a break are you dumb bro
well we nearin 10k but i still need 30k
while all you sit around i would rather work than play
lyrics go through your dome through your vertebrae
hit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates

interlude 6
that was actually a pretty good bar
i just wrote that like right a second ago before i recorded this
ayy ayy
you know just to add some fill stuff in uh

hook 6
sometimes i dont know what to think
sometimes i dont know whatll
make it okay make it okay
im snorin all day for dreams yeah ayy

verse 20
uh i wake up pondering damn my mind is wandering
all these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen
all accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence
often is the result of falling under consciousness
youd make babies cry i make crazy lives
youre just angry cause youre livin in a fading lie
and ive been feeling this energy feeling that somebodys getting the penalty
fearing that one day youll end up ahead of me feeling that this is the end of me
no will i tell you no never i think im so clever
but in the grand scheme of things i know that im no better
but i dont ever
want to go to show just one mo letter
im a gogetter i go get as and get grades
and get as then wake up and get cs but get paid
uh my life is so unusual
to most it isnt suitable to me its irrefutable
cant see me in a cubicle id rather watch my funeral
id rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero
uh but you know that im capable
you know ima pounce at any chance that is available
feeling so unique and i think its not explainable
no one hears my lyrics and says omg relatable
no thats not what im here to give
been waiting years for this youre about to experience
something that ive spent time money and thought on
learned about all the times money had thought wrong
kinda funny its long gone but time is crummy and not long
i aint lucky im not calm not by a longshot
out on the inside see me on the outside
always think im positive and never see the downsides
its bout time you know the truth you couldnt be further from it
get your head out your own ass you couldnt be further up it

interlude 7
okay
okay okay were like thirty minutes in
thirty minutes but we got thirtythousand bro
fuck

verse 21
yeah im the key to the equation bitch you better beware
im like the e that equals all other emcees squared
im just me performing in front of empty chairs
but yall see so all of yall better get prepared
i got so much opportunity i gotta make the most of it
shoes made of the banana peels i feel like im supposed to slip
man in this life we all climbing unstable ladders
its not about who goes faster but its bout the man wholl hold his grip
damn i got a crazy ass work ethic
blocked out south east and west leave in one direction
i finished my album and people saying they lovin it
fuck with it but i took it down and redid it to perfection
we all students of rap but we dont learn lessons
like a eskimos jacket all them be forgettin
wanted to fuck a nun started like really badly
and i didnt even have to ask for me to get her blessing thats a horrible bar
cant stand me cause i crossed them up their ankles hurtin
yeah uh yeah yeah im an amazing person
i base my motivation on my favorite angels words a
bout how ima make it gettin famous man that things for certain

verse 22
you keep your standards low man i keep my standards high
wanna get on any action like the brazzers camera guy
cant deny im fucking insane sometimes i fantasize
how it would be like to be normal but i just randomize
and analyze my situations leaving people paralyzed
and take a step out of bed meanwhile im at my paradise
america is very nice but id like to see the world
but id like to get out in to the open and meet my girl

verse 23
in a mercedes benz with his lady friends
crazy ben is just chillin with them women you know they be tens
they be tens or more they be tens or more
i like to talk to all these people cause they marvel at my metaphors
its free speech i can say what i want
but these listenin are tryna make me pay for my talk
they dont like what im doin they dont appreciate the banter
i get it youre jealous but listen cause im the answer uh
motherfucker ima live for the right time
fuck that ima live for the moment
sitting here in the middle of the night time
my mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowin
damn ive been livin in a headache
bitches never listenin they saying that they ready
but i can never believe them
got these goals and they can never achieve em
how can your dreams come true if you aint willin to dream em
damn thats a lot of shit to think about
suddenly company starts to come to me wondering
what im doin next i realize that shit i gotta figure out
made some beats i gotta hit em out heh
got these dreams that im livin out
in my minds eye givin out lots of songs with responses
that i never pictured wow damn damn
this beats way too holy to rap over
mental block my minds capacities thats lower
your raps slower they lack closure they lack substance
like a printer without toner yall fillin pages that have nothin
ooh but i have got somethin to tell you
i aint got some money or bullshit to sell you
speakin from late nights im thinkin of drakes life
watching these interviews thinkin one day i might
be on that stage right beside all these players
shits up to me i wont hide it in prayers
ill prove it in music i use to influence
i do this way harder than people assumin
resumin my writin viewin this lightin
that puts me to be in the view of the hidin
i do what theyre likin but that makes em hate me
no matter what i do they just mistake the
reason im flowin the reason i start up
not just for the fame and the money the star bucks
and damn i aint talking about the coffee place
most to these rappers only write this shit using copypaste
id have made a lot of songs that go to waste uh
i just need a home run i already loaded bases
i have got so many cases
been visiting living in so many places
experiences that i made me to emmy
ben ben please i hope you let me
be me i aint greedy or needy
believe me i just want to be on your tv
get on my level cause i need a new staircase
damn yeah ive been looking at their space
and one day ill be there
i know what im doin im already prepared

verse 24
ive been waiting like thirtythousand years
tryna make the world listen so make sure that you can hear
im trying to take a passion out of turning my career
im concerned without my fear but i earned it and im here
now i earned it and im here to stay
im coming in youre trying to clear the way another chance another fucking year to play
not even seventeen eighteen im so near to fame
not really look at all the shit i just hear this day
i dont know i look at the future nostalgically
id cure every disease and yall still wouldnt be proud of me
undoubtably know how to be what i am about to be
to say that money talks and that shit seems so damn loud to me

verse 25
recently i have been feeling alienated
my songs out of this world people claim that aliens made em
but baby im crazy dont hate me dont hate me cause im different
hate me because you hate me then maybe we can live with it

verse 26
people say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen
all will scream overreacting like its a drama scene
yall are mean and since the best quality is honesty
promise me that its the reality wheres keanu reeves
trapped in a matrix its how i felt sometimes back in the ages
when i would rap on the stages and now i laugh at those days and
im moving on grooving while you lose the song
move along nothing to see here except some stupid pawns
who could bomb this whole place up with one great lung
one great tongue i am that one great one
on vacation i vacate to a location
far away from where people just may run
a light to go to where there is no one no one no fun
oh son im tryna be me and so young
i can murder this beat with no gun go run
ive too many problems to handle here hold one
i just hop onto the rap boat but that ship has now sunks
and now punks can make loud junk uptown funk
was a great song catchy at first but that radio station
playing it making it just get to the worst
my heads gonna burst if i hear it again and im sure
ill throw my speakers on the ground denting the earth
and now im ending this verse and i mean it
now the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding yeah

verse 27
good rappers never get to see the light of day
but when you selling sex and a gimmick theyll sign you right away
ill obey nah whatever man what is this
im rapping so fast to the max and im playing my tracks so that people will know i mean business
nobody witness anything better than when i am showing you this shit
know im suspicious because ill be flowing and growing like oh this kid is big
know how i live it go on a mission yall better listen
till im ahead of this shit by all of the inches eah
and when im uh im telling yall that i got a story
god ignores me stop the glory cop is for me in auditory
not visually typically the original me
so unforgivable so inexplicable obvious the pinnacle digitally
damn that was fast felt so jammed till i unpacked
and im just tryna prove to you the things that i can move on the track
and im trying to get a record deal never ever felt so real
whenever were the guests to feel whenever fthis gets to feel
so different and im loving it time to change and discover it
time to make a difference and im living it so im up for it
i always talk to them other kids them other kids couldnt understand me
one path making a knot aint gonna stop for plan b

interlude 9
i wrote that one a long time ago
that was the first time that i looked that i i looked at those again
but you know i still im not that rusty not that rusty
i actually classic

verse 28
we just living in the solar system
one big world here to hold the wisdom
one big jail to control the victims
were all here tryna find a soul in rhythm
a voice in writing and a choice deciding
whether or not to follow what the boys are likin
what the girls are doing what we gotta be exposed to
think about who you are and its so true
think about the people who you think have really known you
do they really know you do you even know you
damn that shit is like a jaden smith tweet
sometimes you gotta think bout how crazy shit be
and lately it seems to make the extremes
so prominent and dominant in making big dreams
im seeing aliens scream
when i go to sleep man my brain needs fixing
but im just tryna make it in life
fuck you to people who be saying it like
i aint making it right take a vacation and hike
im chilled out bitches getting famous despite
the fact that im young and little bit nerdy
and i know a lot of people would consider me early
im just a little kid working tryna configure my searches
tryna deliver my purpose and take a shit on my burdens
im just me no i aint a victim to hurting
i just see all the people living and burning
so be free time to be a little bit nervous
it dont matter if youre scared cause this shit is disturbing
and i get it i dont wanna ever forget it
guessin im headed towards the ending and i know it is splendid
so ill see ya round underachievers
hop on my wagon cause we dragging late we gotta be leaving man

im tryna have a blast cause we growing so fast we be getting my career from a to z
and basically im great you see i made my life at the age of three
but now what am i meant to do when my own fanbase are hating me

verse 29
ive been see ple misusing their fans like crooks
manipulating their audience to catch that hook
theyll believe anything that youll tell them look

but no shots fired though
nothing wrong with a little bit of lying though
i mean look at fox news
thats the whole premise of their entire show
but no political shit i always do just enough im a minimalist
makin the most of my minimums winnin em got a couple of synonyms to help you listen to original bits
i got a lot of digital prints man your own homedog is a literal bitch
but im filling the syllables its a little predictable cause ive written this shit for all of the cynical kids
i got time maybe a little too much of it
but you know that im tryna move up a bit
people look at me and say my potential has
got a big max and you know that im lovin it
so fire cant handle me with oven mitts
underground blessed if you discovered it

verse 32
how am i gonna let all of this get to me

and in the grand scheme of things it doesnt matter
but right now its feeling like everything
the more i talk about it it just gets sadder
member thinkin about a wedding ring
but now im thinkin bout so many things
what did i do to deserve it
this shit the most petty of petty things
ill stick with how nobodys perfect
like all of my life ill forget about it
and all of the things that i said about it
but why the fuck did i get blocked
i just cannot wrap my head around it

interlude 11

verse 33
spectacular speculations
havin some reservations
imaginin all the statements
travellin through these places
back in then buy some passionate
trashin of reputations
they actually dont have facts and
reality left them baseless
i wish that we left em nameless
sociate em with faces
make judgments from expectations
and watch as their heads are shaking
people want me to crumble
and turn to some medication
to fuck up my motivation
and focus on education

hook 10
but im petty petty petty petty
thats all they really ever tell me
so many times that you convince me of shit
that i swear you couldve won an emmy
i got a phone in my hand like a note for the gram
and im thinkin about holdin your hand but you dont understand
i think t ove is eitheither gold or a scam
and you never really know till the end like how all this began

verse 34
ive been comin at this as a man
trying to figure out where i fit into the plan
how does all the drama surround me i hear em followin loudly
and i dont wanna hear about this shit again
i guess thats the way it goes when they stalk me
and do anything to try and stop me
i did nothing wrong but thats how it goes
when a basic bitch try to block me uh

verse 35
livin life but youre stayin the same
how you expect yourself to go take the fame
make your name but you dont take the pain
you wanna be unique but not make a change
like what how you expect to go through this
think about the goals man why you wanna do this
so stupid and useless if you never lose it
risk yourself a little for the movement when did i write
this aint the ode to joy this the ode to success
dont know if there is a god but i know that im blessed
and im open to no and im open to yes
ill do whatever i can to go to the best
that will go to the right and go to the left
no doubt ima show up at night instead of goin to bed
when i know that im right im explodin my chest
i keep on loadin the time and it goes over my head
i think no why do i even try these things
i need shiny things like diamond rings
and flying rings and pricey bling uh
that is what drives these strings
im so im so lively and lazy at the same time

and im not gonna stop and yes this may be costing a lot
but lookin at the end result man weve accomplished a lot
and no im not gonna regret a thing after this im still trying to master this
cause now im known as that weirdass rappin kid
the fact of it is that it is really just a giant hobby

tryna make some shit where you can really get your head nodding
verses so fire that s when its done its left sobbing
blah blah blah its uh we just a workinprogress
some of my shit means shit and other words are nonsense

every day man see me bluffin that is what i do
listen to some good shit tryna make a substitute
i got so much stuff to do and i am just a youngin too

verse 42
and how am i meant to keep my workflow up
if a girl shows up all my world blows up
im just sittin and waitin instead of becomin the greatest
tryna find a brand new motherfuckin deal
all you bitches fake all my numbers real
all my shit is punchin in your stomach like a meal
am i married to the game if i cant afford a ring
its all very much the same if i cant afford to sing
now its scary for a king damn i said its scary for a king even
they call me odd but i bring even
i bring reason to believe and youre eatin it up for free and
the meaning is rarely seen and no line can be drawn between em i dont show seasons
yeah i am me no matter what and that can grow pleasin
im barely close to anybody i dont know people
man i dont know people who so equal
i dont know nobody who doesnt own evil
man that is just a truth and a lie
a truth and a lie somethin like the blue in the sky
or a suit and a tie yeah im new to this life im new to my mind
new to the time man im like the proof in disguise
and uh im lookin at all of this shit
oh you should know im not fallin for this
you get discouraged for one minute
and the next one you be callin it quits
and ill probably get rich if i focus enough
you closeminded lets open it up
and all of these people assumin bout what i be doin
but they do not know what is up
uh i just wish
that theyd go away
and i wont obey
no i will never ever show the way
and i will try to mask it up
with other jokes on fucking jokes
always playin g
but now im movin onto other notes

interlude 16
my voice is fucking hurting
its hurting a lot im not i havent had vocal training
so i dont know how to just do this for a long period of time
without causing damage to my vocal cords but who gives a fuck
man i just live it up
im gonna go a little bit quieter now
uhhuh
yeah

chorus 1
all of these people keep on changin
all of these times and different phases
all of these lights on all these stages
all of these sights is so amazing
yeah ive seen at least a million faces
a million times a million places
but when its all said and done
i look and i wonder why uh

verse 43
everyone knows that its so amazing
all the support is my motivation
compared to the big people at the capital
my name is spelt in lower cases
people loved me before i made it
people liked it before they watched it
im wantin way too much more than i have
and im glad because now i will never stop it
man on a mission and i g vision
of talking a lot of wisdom man i gotta listen
gotta follow and be the leader and tomorrow
ill be the teacher when they need the feature
got flow and its so damn crazy
people consider me so amazing
im holding control and then folding them verses
it hurts because i am on loaded bases
advanced shit i know the basics
already know them theyre overrated
meanwhile i am not rated at all so we hopin
cause now i am open for game and
im charged up
i aint drake but im on the worst behavior
so many people they know the players
dont know the game and dont know the makers
dont know the fakers but who cares
im not here to cater im here to improve and show that im greater
im here to go move and just go on the layers
and bitch i am going so later
i got time
my own lyrics i got mine
and im on time for the wrong lines
and im not crying so lets start grinding lets go

hook 14
ive been all on my own
all on my own people keep calling my phone
wanting to know when ill be the star of the show
but im all my own yeah
and i dont want to talk about it stop to doubt it
cause the world is awfully crowded but
the ghost of me is haunting the throne
so ill make it there all on my own

verse 44
my intermission is mixing with intermissions
and following intuition conflicting with my decision
and it is more than just business cause this is for selfapproval
and it is to make it look like im living for something useful
and its sad but you know its true for most of you
appearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue the growing movement
to a new type of thing that you can gain from
to push away the past and the places that you came from
day one for me was like six months ago

interlude 17
oh holy shit
i actually reached the end of the beat
but i still have like
tenthousand more words
hold on i gotta pause this
hold on three its still one take

verse 45
past and the places that you came from
day one for me was like six months ago
look at where we been but imagine where one can go
its not fun to know that we just livin to die
its not fun to know that we just livin to die
we now know how much money you can give for a lie
give for a look but how much can you give for an eye
whats the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry
so get your ass up cause its time to make it happen
always been shitty at rappin but i practice for the passion man

hook 15
yeah ive been living life all on my own bitch
uh i aint the star of the show bitch

verse 46
i know like four people who truly respect the grind
and its usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme
and then if time is money then free time aint really free
and all my fan pissed cause my own lyrics aint really me
stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my christmas tree
i want to be whats taunting me but sorry im a minime
in the face of my full potential that is the biggest me
bigger than you bigger than anybody in history
the challenge is a challenge the fact that you got to maximize
to satisfy your lavish life and have a crazy magic time
and luckily im so damn young cause man i have the time
to learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind
im trying to master my craft and the problem is that ive got
several different things to potentially make my job
i want to make the mls and also have a mili subs
and also get a mili plays and maybe make a mili bucks
a million shit all we ever want is more really
and once i get three million i want four milli
its so silly its so tricky this whole cycle
we can never be happy but that is so vital

interlude 18
uh
those are actually some good lyrics uh

verse 47
rebirth feet hit the earth my knees hurt
theyre weaker than previously her
breathing seems to be burnt like free cds were
before we could be searched im like please just please work
like a lenient slave owner— thats edgy like gravestones oh you get me
i saved dough for a bentley tere more than a chevy
i play i play
who cares about flexin if you aint holding it heavy
uh ive been tryin to prove to all of the people i knew who didnt like what i do
disgusted like ew yeah this shit goes outta you plans have now all become true
im seeing them through man thats the reason i do all of the things that i do
its not for a crew not for a god or a demon ive really been needing a clue
fillin these shoes reading these pieces and news damn this shit really is screwed
it gives me the blues whenever im shielding my eyes from the darkness and dont get a view uh
but if ignorance is really bliss then why this ignorance be killin kids
and why this ignorance thats clearly vicious is not given shit and ends up innocent
that shit really is ridiculous its magnificently fucked up
but nobody wants to tough it up i havent seen it goin down its comin up
l—

verse 48
—cay to the vatican havin them
good times and bad times with new romans do that again well that was when
i was so young too young to really know fun
but so what i guess thats what happens when you grow up
dry your eyes and wipe your nose up
just keep drinking till you throw up no we wont judge
but we all just want to be loved and somehow get validated by those we hate
such a twisted system that weve been given to operate
ive been really thinkin and figurin out whos not a fake
wash away the thoughts i made along the way it all has changed
yeah and now we lookin its so far away
and its so far away

hook 16
this a civil war
its a fuckin civil war

recently ive been feeling my lyrics missing meaning
im trying to whitewash how much they stink like im listerineing
damn im feeling like ive missed the key and
so i guess that dj khaled is always skipping me
but yeah you know im tryn  do what i can
but these ignorant idiots just cant understand
yeah you know im tryn  do what i can
but these ignorant idiots just cant understand
i got new crews and the new friends got new views in a new lens
im the new dude im the new ben got my youtube with the new trends
but the way im growing is so unorthodox
how could i be connecting them if i have yet to sort the dots
sorta lost and very found at the same time
i pour the cost now im very loud in a daytime
and very quiet at night seem to shine when i write
and im longin to be a fiveyearold chillin flyin a kite
and i admire the sight of somebody else workin more than me
ive been staying grounded but the sky is movin towards my feet
and fortunately im on course living morally
grinding to get whats rightfully mine im headed right for my dream
damn i guess thats all i need to know for now
they put me in the drivers seat no way im slowing down
they know me now but dont know my sound it is so profound
give m two years and ill make it let me show you how
ayy ayy ayy ayy

verse 56
i gotta stop all of this bragging shit
so many haters smh is the acronym
im tryna get a couple omgs
or a wtf he is so sexy
i got no bentley beat is so deadly
walked up to the rap club no entry
and i feel a little like i wont get seen
cause im so white wont fight dont get me
cause im coming at this music with a different set of ideas
trying to bring my own crib like its ikea
heres a protip take no tips
from people who arent pros yet bitches always so stressed
damn cause they trying to find that great escape
nation of dreamers who all just trying to stay awake
every day i be waking up to my 808s
daytoday hustle im just trying to pave a way
people with the problems always give the most advice
like why dont you sort your own life dont come close to mine
im mostly fine so please leave me alone to whine
and next time that youre talking shit please bring me an open mind
cause people locking they own ideas in straitjackets
im david blaines magic helping you break past it
im trying to raise havoc not trying to stay savage
trying to make balance while finding a great passion
climbing to get up this witnessin injustice
by who people in love with or based off of skin colors
shit is so disgusting seeing it in public
im trying to make sense of it here in the discussions
close my eyes and go to sleep waiting until they notice me
wait until my creations are making everything so complete
my thoughts are scattered find lots of patterns
i try not to let it get my plots in ashes

verse 57
i dont ever think ive some money some little talent
these rappers shows look like lipsync battles with jimmy fallon
what really happened im jealous if people selling platinum
worst year of my life thats like saying the worst kendrick album
its way better than average im already established
unforgettable classic yall shit is set to go plastic
they want to see me disappear like incredible magic
your regrettable attitude is upsetting my passion
im getting listens and play fuck all the simpler days
i just took a moo mon break i got spotify paying me minimum wage
im like thats good enough man ive been eating aint full enough i just want to make it pulling up
ive been putting up with all of these amateurs sure enough ima show em how it should be done

verse 58
i got green and i want beef like a omnivore
i got that exclusive flow that cant be bought at stores
all this new shit they still be wanting more
they say that my duty is not fair like some modern war
im stacking rolls just like the michelin man
eating sushi every night but i dont live in japan
damn im trying to get as many hits as i can
and like a lazyass beaver i aint giving a damn
woah this shit is corny you really gonna ignore me
you really gon let it slide when these benjamins do adore me
and as we rise man it aint about fame and fortune
we got a greater importance thats why i wake in the morning
im tryna play a performance make a change with a chorus
i came from a tiny platform but now my stage is enormous
flawless do anything to stay out of office
cause im cautious not gonna sell my soul for the profits

verse 59
yeah i got many dreams lot of passions
ima get there by any means just imagine
just know that anything can happen
