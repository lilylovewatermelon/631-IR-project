i know this wont make sense
theres a thing that i miss
as of now im in bliss
wandering the abyss

chorus
i know that ive made you hurt
your words devour what im worth
forgive my faults in return
i will not cry i will learn

verse 2
meaningless attention
shows youre weak purposely
hold your tongue as my knife
will decide who was right

chorus
i know that ive made you hurt
your words devour what im worth
forgive my faults in return
i will not cry i will learn
