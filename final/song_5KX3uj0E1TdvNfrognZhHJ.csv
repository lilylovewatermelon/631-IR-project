if it can be broken then it can be fixed
if it can be fused then it can be split
its all under control its all under control
its all under control its all under control
if it can be lost then it can be won
if it can be touched then it can be turned
all you need is time all you need is time
all you need is time all you need is time
all you need is time

if it can be broken then it can be fixed
if it can be fused then it can be split

if it can be lost then it can be won
if it can be touched then it can be turned
all you need is time all you need is time
all you need is time all you need is

chorus
we promised the world wed tame it
what were we hoping for
we promised the world wed tame it
what were we hoping for
we promised the world wed tame it
what were we hoping for
we promised the world wed tame it
what were we hoping for

breathe in breathe out
breathe in breathe out
breathe in breathe out

so here we are reinventing the wheel
im shaking hands with a hurricane
its a colour that i cant describe
its a language i cant understand
ambition tearing out the heart of you
carving lines into you
dripping down the sides of you
outro
we will not be the last
