well youre my friend
and can you see
many times weve been out drinking
many times weve shared our thoughts
but did you ever ever notice
the kind of thoughts i got
well you know i have a love
a love for everyone i know
and you know i have a drive
to live i wont let go
but can you see its opposition
comes rising up sometimes
that its dreadful and position
comes blacking in my mind

chorus johnny cash  will oldham
and that i see a darkness
and that i see a darkness
and that i see a darkness
and that i see a darkness
did you know how much i love you
is a hope that somehow you
can save me from this darkness

verse 2 johnny cash
well i hope that someday buddy
we have peace in our lives
together or apart
alone or with our wives
and we can stop our whoring
and pull the smiles inside
and light it up forever
and never go to sleep
my best unbeaten brother
this isnt all i see
you might also likechorus johnny cash  will oldham
oh no i see a darkness
oh no i see a darkness
oh no i see a darkness
oh no i see a darkness
did you know how much i love you
is a hope that somehow you
can save me from this darkness5embed"
