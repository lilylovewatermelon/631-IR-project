between the civil war and 1900 steam and electricity replaced human muscle iron replaced wood and steel replaced iron before the bessemer process iron was hardened into steel at the rate of 3 to 5 tons a day now the same amount could be processed in 15 minutes machines could now drive steel tools oil could lubricate machines and light homes streets factories people and goods could move by railroad propelled by steam along steel rails by 1900 there were 193000 miles of railroad the telephone the typewriter and the adding machine speeded up the work of business

machines changed farming before the civil war it took 61 hours of labor to produce an acre of wheat by 1900 it took 3 hours 19 minutes manufactured ice enabled the transport of food over long distances and the industry of meatpacking was born

steam drove textile mill spindles it drove sewing machines it came from coal pneumatic drills now drilled deeper into the earth for coal in 1860 14 million tons of coal were mined by 1884 it was 100 million tons more coal meant more steel because coal furnaces converted iron into steel by 1880 a million tons of steel were being produced by 1910 25 million tons by now electricity was beginning to replace steam electrical wire needed copper of which 30000 tons were produced in 1880 500000 tons by 1910

to accomplish all this required ingenious inventors of new processes and new machines clever organizers and administrators of the new corporations a country rich with land and minerals and a huge supply of human beings to do the backbreaking unhealthful and dangerous work immigrants would come from europe and china to make the new labor force farmers unable to buy the new machinery or pay the new railroad rates would move to the cities between 1860 and 1914 new york grew from 850000 to 4 million chicago from 110000 to 2 million philadelphia from 650000 to 1 12 million

in some cases the inventor himself became the organizer of businesseslike thomas edison inventor of electrical devices in other cases the businessman compiled other peoples inventions like gustavus swift a chicago butcher who put together the icecooled railway car with the ice cooled warehouse to make the first national meatpacking company in 1885 james duke used a new cigaretterolling machine that could roll paste and cut tubes of tobacco into 100000 cigarettes a day in 1890 he combined the four biggest cigarette producers to form the american tobacco company

while some multimillionaires started in poverty most did not a study of the origins of 303 textile railroad and steel executives of the 1870s showed that 90 percent came from middle or upperclass families the horatio alger stories of rags to riches were true for a few men but mostly a myth and a useful myth for control

most of the fortune building was done legally with the collaboration of the government and the courts sometimes the collaboration had to be paid for thomas edison promised new jersey politicians 1000 each in return for favorable legislation daniel drew and jay gould spent 1 million to bribe the new york legislature to legalize their issue of 8 million in watered stock stock not representing real value on the erie railroad

the first transcontinental railroad was built with blood sweat politics and thievery out of the meeting of the union pacific and central pacific railroads the central pacific started on the west coast going east it spent 200000 in washington on bribes to get 9 million acres of free land and 24 million in bonds and paid 79 million an overpayment of 36 million to a construction company which really was its own the construction was done by three thousand irish and ten thousand chinese over a period of four years working for one or two dollars a day

the union pacific started in nebraska going west it had been given 12 million acres of free land and 27 million in government bonds it created the credit mobilier company and gave them 94 million for construction when the actual cost was 44 million shares were sold cheaply to congressmen to prevent investigation this was at the suggestion of massachusetts congressman oakes ames a shovel manufacturer and director of credit mobilier who said there is no difficulty in getting men to look after their own property the union pacific used twenty thousand workerswar veterans and irish immigrants who laid 5 miles of track a day and died by the hundreds in the heat the cold and the battles with indians opposing the invasion of their territory

both railroads used longer twisting routes to get subsidies from towns they went through in 1869 amid music and speeches the two crooked lines met in utah

the wild fraud on the railroads led to more control of railroad finances by bankers who wanted more stabilityprofit by law rather than by theft by the 1890s most of the countrys railway mileage was concentrated in six huge systems four of these were completely or partially controlled by the house of morgan and two others by the bankers kuhn loeb and company

j p morgan had started before the war as the son of a banker who began selling stocks for the railroads for good commissions during the civil war he bought five thousand rifles for 350 each from an army arsenal and sold them to a general in the field for 22 each the rifles were defective and would shoot off the thumbs of the soldiers using them a congressional committee noted this in the small print of an obscure report but a federal judge upheld the deal as the fulfillment of a valid legal contract
morgan had escaped military service in the civil war by paying 300 to a substitute so did john d rockefeller andrew carnegie philip armour jay gould and james mellon mellons father had written to him that a man may be a patriot without risking his own life or sacrificing his health there are plenty of lives less valuable

it was the firm of drexel morgan and company that was given a us government contract to float a bond issue of 260 million the government could have sold the bonds directly it chose to pay the bankers 5 million in commission

on january 2 1889 as gustavus myers reports

 a circular marked private and confidential was issued by the three banking houses of drexel morgan  company brown brothers  company and kidder peabody  company the most painstaking care was exercised that this document should not find its way into the press or otherwise become public why this fear because the circular was an invitation  to the great railroad magnates to assemble at morgans house no 219 madison avenue there to form in the phrase of the day an ironclad combination  a compact which would efface competition among certain railroads and unite those interests in an agreement by which the people of the united states would be bled even more effectively than before

there was a human cost to this exciting story of financial ingenuity that year 1889 records of the interstate commerce commission showed that 22000 railroad workers were killed or injured

in 1895 the gold reserve of the united states was depleted while twentysix new york city banks had 129 million in gold in their vaults a syndicate of bankers headed by j p morgan  company august belmont  company the national city bank and others offered to give the government gold in exchange for bonds president grover cleveland agreed the bankers immediately resold the bonds at higher prices making 18 million profit

a journalist wrote if a man wants to buy beef he must go to the butcher if mr cleveland wants much gold he must go to the big banker

while making his fortune morgan brought rationality and organization to the national economy he kept the system stable he said we do not want financial convulsions and have one thing one day and another thing another day he linked railroads to one another all of them to banks banks to insurance companies by 1900 he controlled 100000 miles of railroad half the countrys mileage

three insurance companies dominated by the morgan group had a billion dollars in assets they had 50 million a year to investmoney given by ordinary people for their insurance policies louis brandeis describing this in his book other peoples money before he became a supreme court justice wrote they control the people through the peoples own money

john d rockefeller started as a bookkeeper in cleveland became a merchant accumulated money and decided that in the new industry of oil who controlled the oil refineries controlled the industry he bought his first oil refinery in 1862 and by 1870 set up standard oil company of ohio made secret agreements with railroads to ship his oil with them if they gave him rebates discountson their prices and thus drove competitors out of business

one independent refiner said if we did not sell out we would be crushed out  there was only one buyer on the market and we had to sell at their terms memos like this one passed among standard oil officials wilkerson  co received car of oil monday 13th  please turn another screw a rival refinery in buffalo was rocked by a small explosion arranged by standard oil officials with the refinerys chief mechanic

the standard oil company by 1899 was a holding company which controlled the stock of many other companies the capital was 110 million the profit was 45 million a year and john d rockefellers fortune was estimated at 200 million before long he would move into iron copper coal shipping and banking chase manhattan bank profits would be 81 million a year and the rockefeller fortune would total two billion dollars

andrew carnegie was a telegraph clerk at seventeen then secretary to the head of the pennsylvania railroad then broker in wall street selling railroad bonds for huge commissions and was soon a millionaire he went to london in 1872 saw the new bessemer method of producing steel and returned to the united states to build a milliondollar steel plant foreign competition was kept out by a high tariff conveniently set by congress and by 1880 carnegie was producing 10000 tons of steel a month making 1 12 million a year in profit by 1900 he was making 40 million a year and that year at a dinner party he agreed to sell his steel company to j p morgan he scribbled the price on a note 492000000
morgan then formed the us steel corporation combining carnegies corporation with others he sold stocks and bonds for 1300000000 about 400 million more than the combined worth of the companies and took a fee of 150 million for arranging the consolidation how could dividends be paid to all those stockholders and bondholders by making sure congress passed tariffs keeping out foreign steel by closing off competition and maintaining the price at 28 a ton and by working 200000 men twelve hours a day for wages that barely kept their families alive

and so it went in industry after industryshrewd efficient businessmen building empires choking out competition maintaining high prices keeping wages low using government subsidies these industries were the first beneficiaries of the welfare state by the turn of the century american telephone and telegraph had a monopoly of the nations telephone system international harvester made 85 percent of all farm machinery and in every other industry resources became concentrated controlled the banks had interests in so many of these monopolies as to create an interlocking network of powerful corporation directors each of whom sat on the boards of many other corporations according to a senate report of the early twentieth century morgan at his peak sat on the board of fortyeight corporations rockefeller thirtyseven corporations

meanwhile the government of the united states was behaving almost exactly as karl marx described a capitalist state pretending neutrality to maintain order but serving the interests of the rich not that the rich agreed among themselves they had disputes over policies but the purpose of the state was to settle upperclass disputes peacefully control lowerclass rebellion and adopt policies that would further the longrange stability of the system the arrangement between democrats and republicans to elect rutherford hayes in 1877 set the tone whether democrats or republicans won national policy would not change in any important way

when grover cleveland a democrat ran for president in 1884 the general impression in the country was that he opposed the power of monopolies and corporations and that the republican party whose candidate was james blaine stood for the wealthy but when cleveland defeated blaine jay gould wired him i feel  that the vast business interests of the country will be entirely safe in your hands and he was right

one of clevelands chief advisers was william whitney a millionaire and corporation lawyer who married into the standard oil fortune and was appointed secretary of the navy by cleveland he immediately set about to create a steel navy buying the steel at artificially high prices from carnegies plants cleveland himself assured industrialists that his election should not frighten them no harm shall come to any business interest as the result of administrative policy so long as i am president  a transfer of executive control from one party to another does not mean any serious disturbance of existing conditions

the presidential election itself had avoided real issues there was no clear understanding of which interests would gain and which would lose if certain policies were adopted it took the usual form of election campaigns concealing the basic similarity of the parties by dwelling on personalities gossip trivialities henry adams an astute literary commentator on that era wrote to a friend about the election

we are here plunged in politics funnier than words can express very great issues are involved   but the amusing thing is that no one talks about real interests by common consent they agree to let these alone we are afraid to discuss them instead of this the press is engaged in a most amusing dispute whether mr cleveland had an illegitimate child and did or did not live with more than one mistress

in 1887 with a huge surplus in the treasury cleveland vetoed a bill appropriating 100000 to give relief to texas farmers to help them buy seed grain during a drought he said federal aid in such cases   encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character but that same year cleveland used his gold surplus to pay off wealthy bondholders at 28 above the 100 value of each bonda gift of 45 million

the chief reform of the cleveland administration gives away the secret of reform legislation in america the interstate commerce act of 1887 was supposed to regulate the railroads on behalf of the consumers but richard olney a lawyer for the boston  maine and other railroads and soon to be clevelands attorney general told railroad officials who complained about the interstate commerce commission that it would not be wise to abolish the commission from a railroad point of view he explained

the commission  is or can be made of great use to the railroads it satisfies the popular clamor for a government supervision of railroads at the same time that that supervision is almost entirely nominal    the part of wisdom is not to destroy the commission but to utilize it

cleveland himself in his 1887 state of the union message had made a similar point adding a warning opportunity for safe careful and deliberate reform is now offered and none of us should be unmindful of a time when an abused and irritated people    may insist upon a radical and sweeping rectification of their wrongs

republican benjamin harrison who succeeded cleveland as president from 1889 to 1893 was described by matthew josephson in his colorful study of the postcivil war years the politicos benjamin harrison had the exclusive distinction of having served the railway corporations in the dual capacity of lawyer and soldier he prosecuted the strikers of 1877 in the federal courts   and he also organized and commanded a company of soldiers during the strike 

harrisons term also saw a gesture toward reform the sherman antitrust act passed in 1890 called itself an act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and made it illegal to form a combination or conspiracy to restrain trade in interstate or foreign commerce senator john sherman author of the act explained the need to conciliate the critics of monopoly they had monopolies  of old but never before such giants as in our day you must heed their appeal or be ready for the socialist the communist the nihilist society is now disturbed by forces never felt before   
when cleveland was elected president again in 1892 andrew carnegie in europe received a letter from the manager of his steel plants henry clay frick i am very sorry for president harrison but i cannot see that our interests are going to be affected one way or the other by the change in administration cleveland facing the agitation in the country caused by the panic and depression of 1893 used troops to break up coxeys army a demonstration of unemployed men who had come to washington and again to break up the national strike on the railroads the following year

meanwhile the supreme court despite its look of somber blackrobed fairness was doing its bit for the ruling elite how could it be independent with its members chosen by the president and ratified by the senate how could it be neutral between rich and poor when its members were often former wealthy lawyers and almost always came from the upper class early in the nineteenth century the court laid the legal basis for a nationally regulated economy by establishing federal control over interstate commerce and the legal basis for corporate capitalism by making the contract sacred

in 1895 the court interpreted the sherman act so as to make it harmless it said a monopoly of sugar refining was a monopoly in manufacturing not commerce and so could not be regulated by congress through the sherman act us v e c knight co the court also said the sherman act could be used against interstate strikes the railway strike of 1894 because they were in restraint of trade it also declared unconstitutional a small attempt by congress to tax high incomes at a higher rate pollock v farmers loan  trust company in later years it would refuse to break up the standard oil and american tobacco monopolies saying the sherman act barred only unreasonable combinations in restraint of trade

a new york banker toasted the supreme court in 1895 i give you gentlemen the supreme court of the united statesguardian of the dollar defender of private property enemy of spoliation sheet anchor of the republic

very soon after the fourteenth amendment became law the supreme court began to demolish it as a protection for blacks and to develop it as a protection for corporations however in 1877 a supreme court decision munn v illinois approved state laws regulating the prices charged to farmers for the use of grain elevators the grain elevator company argued it was a person being deprived of property thus violating the fourteenth amendments declaration nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law the supreme court disagreed saying that grain elevators were not simply private property but were invested with a public interest and so could be regulated

one year after that decision the american bar association organized by lawyers accustomed to serving the wealthy began a national campaign of education to reverse the court decision its presidents said at different times if trusts are a defensive weapon of property interests against the communistic trend they are desirable and monopoly is often a necessity and an advantage

by 1886 they succeeded state legislatures under the pressure of aroused farmers had passed laws to regulate the rates charged farmers by the railroads the supreme court that year wabash v illinois said states could not do this that this was an intrusion on federal power that year alone the court did away with 230 state laws that had been passed to regulate corporations

by this time the supreme court had accepted the argument that corporations were persons and their money was property protected by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment supposedly the amendment had been passed to protect negro rights but of the fourteenth amendment cases brought before the supreme court between 1890 and 1910 nineteen dealt with the negro 288 dealt with corporations

the justices of the supreme court were not simply interpreters of the constitution they were men of certain backgrounds of certain interests one of them justice samuel miller had said in 1875 it is vain to contend with judges who have been at the bar the advocates for forty years of railroad companies and all forms of associated capital    in 1893 supreme court justice david j brewer addressing the new york state bar association said

it is the unvarying law that the wealth of the community will be in the hands of the few    the great majority of men are unwilling to endure that long selfdenial and saving which makes accumulations possible   and hence it always has been and until human nature is remodeled always will be true that the wealth of a nation is in the hands of a few while the many subsist upon the proceeds of their daily toil

this was not just a whim of the 1880s and 1890sit went back to the founding fathers who had learned their law in the era of blackstones commentaries which said so great is the regard of the law for private property that it will not authorize the least violation of it no not even for the common good of the whole community

control in modern times requires more than force more than law it requires that a population dangerously concentrated in cities and factories whose lives are filled with cause for rebellion be taught that all is right as it is and so the schools the churches the popular literature taught that to be rich was a sign of superiority to be poor a sign of personal failure and that the only way upward for a poor person was to climb into the ranks of the rich by extraordinary effort and extraordinary luck

in those years after the civil war a man named russell conwell a graduate of yale law school a minister and author of bestselling books gave the same lecture acres of diamonds more than five thousand times to audiences across the country reaching several million people in all his message was that anyone could get rich if he tried hard enough that everywhere if people looked closely enough were acres of diamonds a sampling

i say that you ought to get rich and it is your duty to get rich the men who get rich may be the most honest men you find in the community let me say here clearly   ninetyeight out of one hundred of the rich men of america are honest that is why they are rich that is why they are trusted with money that is why they carry on great enterprises and find plenty of people to work with them it is because they are honest men 
 i sympathize with the poor but the number of poor who are to be sympathised with is very small to sympathize with a man whom god has punished for his sins  is to do wrong let us remember there is not a poor person in the united states who was not made poor by his own shortcomings 

conwell was a founder of temple university rockefeller was a donor to colleges all over the country and helped found the university of chicago huntington of the central pacific gave money to two negro colleges hampton institute and tuskegee institute carnegie gave money to colleges and to libraries johns hopkins was founded by a millionaire merchant and millionaires cornelius vanderbilt ezra cornell james duke and leland stanford created universities in their own names

the rich giving part of their enormous earnings in this way became known as philanthropists these educational institutions did not encourage dissent they trained the middlemen in the american systemthe teachers doctors lawyers administrators engineers technicians politicians those who would be paid to keep the system going to be loyal buffers against trouble

in the meantime the spread of public school education enabled the learning of writing reading and arithmetic for a whole generation of workers skilled and semiskilled who would be the literate or force of the new industrial age it was important that these people learn obedience to authority a journalist observer of the schools in the 1890s wrote the unkindly spirit of the teacher is strikingly apparent the pupils being completely subjugated to her will are silent and motionless the spiritual atmosphere of the classroom is damp and chilly

back in 1859 the desire of mill owners in the town of lowell that their workers be educated was explained by the secretary of the massachusetts board of education

the owners of factories are more concerned than other classes and interests in the intelligence of their laborers when the latter are welleducated and the former are disposed to deal justly controversies and strikes can never occur nor can the minds of the masses be prejudiced by demagogues and controlled by temporary and factious considerations

joel spring in his book education and the rise of the corporate state says the development of a factorylike system in the nineteenthcentury schoolroom was not accidental

this continued into the twentieth century when william bagleys classroom management became a standard teacher training text reprinted thirty times bagley said one who studies educational theory aright can see in the mechanical routine of the classroom the educative forces that are slowly transforming the child from a little savage into a creature of law and order fit for the life of civilized society

it was in the middle and late nineteenth century that high schools developed as aids to the industrial system that history was widely required in the curriculum to foster patriotism loyalty oaths teacher certification and the requirement of citizenship were introduced to control both the educational and the political quality of teachers also in the latter part of the century school officialsnot teacherswere given control over textbooks laws passed by the states barred certain kinds of textbooks idaho and montana for instance forbade textbooks propagating political doctrines and the dakota territory ruled that school libraries could not have partisan political pamphlets or books

against this gigantic organization of knowledge and education for orthodoxy and obedience there arose a literature of dissent and protest which had to make its way from reader to reader against great obstacles henry george a selfeducated workingman from a poor philadelphia family who became a newspaperman and an economist wrote a book that was published in 1879 and sold millions of copies not only in the united states but all over the world his book progress and poverty argued that the basis of wealth was land that this was becoming monopolized and that a single tax on land abolishing all others would bring enough revenue to solve the problem of poverty and equalize wealth in the nation readers may not have been persuaded of his solutions but they could see in their own lives the accuracy of his observations

it is true that wealth has been greatly increased and that the average of comfort leisure and refinement has been raised but these gains are not general in them the lowest class do not share this association of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times  there is a vague but general feeling of disappointment an increased bitterness among the working classes a widespread feeling of unrest and brooding revolution   the civilized world is trembling on the verge of a great movement either it must be a leap upward which will open the way to advances yet undreamed of or it must he a plunge downward which will carry us back toward barbarism 

a different kind of challenge to the economic and social system was given by edward bellamy a lawyer and writer from western massachusetts who wrote in simple intriguing language a novel called looking backward in which the author fells asleep and wakes up in the year 2000 to find a socialistic society in which people work and live cooperatively looking backward which described socialism vividly lovingly sold a million copies in a few years and over a hundred groups were organized around the country to try to make the dream come true

it seemed that despite the strenuous efforts of government business the church the schools to control their thinking millions of americans were ready to consider harsh criticism of the existing system to contemplate other possible ways of living they were helped in this by the great movements of workers and farmers that swept the country in the 1880s and 1890s these movements went beyond the scattered strikes and tenants struggles of the period 18301877 they were nationwide movements more threatening than before to the ruling elite more dangerously suggestive it was a time when revolutionary organizations existed in major american cities and revolutionary talk was in the air

in the 1880s and 1890s immigrants were pouring in from europe at a faster rate than before they all went through the harrowing ocean voyage of the poor now there were not so many irish and german immigrants as italians russians jews greekspeople from southern and eastern europe even more alien to nativeborn anglosaxons than the earlier newcomers

how the immigration of different ethnic groups contributed to the fragmentation of the working class how conflicts developed among groups facing the same difficult conditions is shown in an article in a bohemian newspaper svornost of february 27 1880 a petition of 258 parents and guardians at the throop school in new york signed by over half the taxpayers of the school district said the petitioners have just as much right to request the teaching of bohemian as have the german citizens to have german taught in the public schools in opposition to this mr vocke claims that there is a great deal of difference between germans and bohemians or in other words they are superior

the irish still recalling the hatred against them when they arrived began to get jobs with the new political machines that wanted their vote those who became policemen encountered the new jewish immigrants on july 30 1902 new yorks jewish community held a mass funeral for an important rabbi and a riot took place led by irish who resented jews coming into their neighborhood the police force was dominantly irish and the official investigation of the riot indicated the police helped the rioters   it appears that charges of unprovoked and most brutal clubbing have been made against policemen with the result that they were reprimanded or fined a days pay and were yet retained upon the force

there was desperate economic competition among the newcomers by 1880 chinese immigrants brought in by the railroads to do the backbreaking labor at pitiful wages numbered 75000 in california almost onetenth of the population they became the objects of continuous violence the novelist bret harte wrote an obituary for a chinese man named wan lee

dead my revered friends dead stoned to death in the streets of san francisco in the year of grace 1869 by a mob of halfgrown boys and christian school children

in rock springs wyoming in the summer of 1885 whites attacked five hundred chinese miners massacring twentyeight of them in cold blood

the new immigrants became laborers housepainters stonecutters ditchdiggers they were often imported en masse by contractors one italian man told he was going to connecticut to work on the railroad was taken instead to sulfate mines in the south where he and his fellows were watched over by armed guards in their barracks and in the mines given only enough money to pay for their railroad fare and tools and very little to eat he and others decided to escape they were captured at gunpoint ordered to work or die they still refused and were brought before a judge put in manacles and five months after their arrival finally dismissed my comrades took the train for new york i had only one dollar and with this not knowing either the country or the language i had to walk to new york after fortytwo days i arrived in the city utterly exhausted

their conditions led sometimes to rebellion a contemporary observer told how some italians who worked in a locality near deal lake new jersey failing to receive their wages captured the contractor and shut him up in the shanty where he remained a prisoner until the county sheriff came with a posse to his rescue

a traffic in immigrant child laborers developed either by contract with desperate parents in the home country or by kidnapping the children were then supervised by padrones in a form of slavery sometimes sent out as beggar musicians droves of them roamed the streets of new york and philadelphia

as the immigrants became naturalized citizens they were brought into the american twoparty system invited to be loyal to one party or the other their political energy thus siphoned into elections an article in lltalia in november 1894 called for italians to support the republican party

when american citizens of foreign birth refuse to ally themselves with the republican party they make war upon their own welfare the republican party stands for all that the people fight for in the old world it is the champion of freedom progress order and law it is the steadfast foe of monarchial class role

there were 5 12 million immigrants in the 1880s 4 million in the 1890s creating a labor surplus that kept wages down the immigrants were more controllable more helpless than native workers they were culturally displaced at odds with one another therefore useful as strikebreakers often their children worked intensifying the problem of an oversized labor force and joblessness in 1880 there were 1118000 children under sixteen one out of six at work in the united states with everyone working long hours families often became strangers to one another a pants presser named morris rosenfeld wrote a poem my boy which became widely reprinted and recited

i have a little boy at home
a pretty little son
i think sometimes the world is mine
in him my only one   

ere dawn my labor drives me forth
tis night when i am free
a stranger am i to my child
and stranger my child to me 

women immigrants became servants prostitutes housewives factory workers and sometimes rebels leonora barry was born in ireland and brought to the united states she got married and when her husband died she went to work in a hosiery mill in upstate new york to support three young children earning 65 cents her first week she joined the knights of labor which had fifty thousand women members in 192 womens assemblies by 1886 she became master workman of her assembly of 927 women and was appointed to work for the knights as a general investigator to go forth and educate her sister workingwomen and the public generally as to their needs and necessities she described the biggest problem of women workers through long years of endurance they have acquired as a sort of second nature the habit of submission and acceptance without question of any terms offered them with the pessimistic view of life in which they see no hope her report for the year 1888 showed 537 requests to help women organize 100 cities and towns visited 1900 leaflets distributed

in 1884 womens assemblies of textile workers and hatmakers went on strike the following year in new york cloak and shirt makers men and women holding separate meetings but acting together went on strike the new york world called it a revolt for bread and butter they won higher wages and shorter hours

that winter in yonkers a few women carpet weavers were fired for joining the knights and in the cold of february 2500 women walked out and picketed the mill only seven hundred of them were members of the knights but all the strikers soon joined the police attacked the picket line and arrested them but a jury found them not guilty a great dinner was held by working people in new york to honor them with two thousand delegates from unions all over the city the strike lasted six months and the women won some of their demands getting back their jobs but without recognition of their union

what was astonishing in so many of these struggles was not that the strikers did not win all that they wanted but that against such great odds they dared to resist and were not destroyed

perhaps it was the recognition that daytoday combat was not enough that fundamental change was needed which stimulated the growth of revolutionary movements at this time the socialist labor party formed in 1877 was tiny and torn by internal arguments but it had some influence in organizing unions among foreign workers in new york jewish socialists organized and put out a newspaper in chicago german revolutionaries along with nativeborn radicals like albert parsons formed social revolutionary clubs in 1883 an anarchist congress took place in pittsburgh it drew up a manifesto

 all laws are directed against the working people   even the school serves only the purpose of furnishing the offspring of the wealthy with those qualities necessary to uphold their class domination the children of the poor get scarcely a formal elementary training and this too is mainly directed to such branches as tend to producing prejudices arrogance and servility in short want of sense the church finally seeks to make complete idiots out of the mass and to make them forego the paradise on earth by promising a fictitious heaven the capitalist press on the other hand takes care of the confusion of spirits in public life   the workers can therefore expect no help from any capitalistic party in their struggle against the existing system they must achieve their liberation by their own efforts as in former times a privileged class never surrenders its tyranny neither can it be expected that the capitalists of this age will give up their rulership without being forced to do it 

the manifesto asked equal rights for all without distinction to sex or race it quoted the communist manifesto workmen of all lands unite you have nothing to lose but your chains you have a world to win

in chicago the new international working peoples association had five thousand members published newspapers in five languages organized mass demonstrations and parades and through its leadership in strikes was a powerful influence in the twentytwo unions that made up the central labor union of chicago there were differences in theory among all these revolutionary groups but the theorists were often brought together by the practical needs of labor struggles and there were many in the mid1880s

in early 1886 the texas  pacific railroad fired a leader of the district assembly of the knights of labor and this led to a strike which spread throughout the southwest tying up traffic as far as st louis and kansas city nine young men recruited in new orleans as marshals brought to texas to protect company property learned about the strike and quit their jobs saying as man to man we could not justifiably go to work and take the bread out of our fellowworkmens mouths no matter how much we needed it ourselves they were then arrested for defrauding the company by refusing to work and sentenced to three months in the galveston county jail

the strikers engaged in sabotage a news dispatch from atchison kansas

at 1245 this morning the men on guard at the missouri pacific roundhouse were surprised by the appearance of 35 or 40 masked men the guards were corralled in the oil room by a detachment of the visitors who stood guard with pistols   while the rest of them thoroughly disabled 12 locomotives which stood in the stalls

in april in east st louis there was a battle between strikers and police seven workingmen were killed whereupon workers burned the freight depot of the louisville  nashville the governor declared martial law and sent in seven hundred national guardsmen with mass arrests violent attacks by sheriffs and deputies no support from the skilled paidpaid workers of the railway brotherhoods the strikers could not hold out after several months they surrendered and many of them were blacklisted

by the spring of 1886 the movement for an eighthour day had grown on may 1 the american federation of labor now five years old called for nationwide strikes wherever the eighthour day was refused terence powderly head of the knights of labor opposed the strike saying that employers and employees must first be educated on the eighthour day but assemblies of the knights made plans to strike the grand chief of the brotherhood of locomotive engineers opposed the eighthour day saying two hours less work means two hours more loafing about the corners and two hours more for drink but railroad workers did not agree and supported the eight hour movement

so 350000 workers in 11562 establishments all over the country went out on strike in detroit 11000 workers marched in an eighthour parade in new york 25000 formed a torchlight procession along broadway headed by 3400 members of the bakers union in chicago 40000 struck and 45000 were granted a shorter working day to prevent them from striking every railroad in chicago stopped running and most of the industries in chicago were paralyzed the stockyards were closed down

a citizens committee of businessmen met daily to map strategy in chicago the state militia had been called out the police were ready and the chicago mail on may 1 asked that albert parsons and august spies the anarchist leaders of the international working peoples association be watched keep them in view hold them personally responsible for any trouble that occurs make an example of them if trouble occurs

under the leadership of parsons and spies the central labor union with twentytwo unions had adopted a fiery resolution in the fall of 1885

be it resolved that we urgently call upon the wageearning class to arm itself in order to be able to put forth against their exploiters such an argument which alone can be effective violence and further be it resolved that notwithstanding that we expect very little from the introduction of the eighthour day we firmly promise to assist our more backward brethren in this class struggle with all means and power at our disposal so long as they will continue to show an open and resolute front to our common oppressors the aristocratic vagabonds and exploiters our warcry is death to the foes of the human race

on may 3 a series of events took place which were to put parsons and spies in exactly the position that the chicago mail had suggested make an example of them if trouble occurs that day in front of the mccormick harvester works where strikers and sympathizers fought scabs the police fired into a crowd of strikers running from the scene wounded many of them and killed four spies enraged went to the printing shop of the arbeiterzeitung and printed a circular in both english and german

revenge

workingmen to arms

   you have for years endured the most abject humiliations    you have worked yourself to death your children you have sacrificed to the factory lordin short you have been miserable and obedient slaves all these years why to satisfy the insatiable greed to fill the coffers of your thieving master when you ask them now to lessen your burdens he sends his bloodhounds out to shoot you kill you

 to arms we call you to arms

a meeting was called for haymarket square on the evening of may 4 and about three thousand persons assembled it was a quiet meeting and as storm clouds gathered and the hour grew late the crowd dwindled to a few hundred a detachment of 180 policemen showed up advanced on the speakers platform ordered the crowd to disperse the speaker said the meeting was almost over a bomb then exploded in the midst of the police wounding sixtysix policemen of whom seven later died the police fired into the crowd killing several people wounding two hundred

with no evidence on who threw the bomb the police arrested eight anarchist leaders in chicago the chicago journal said justice should be prompt in dealing with the arrested anarchists the law regarding accessories to crime in this state is so plain that their trials will be short illinois law said that anyone inciting a murder was guilty of that murder the evidence against the eight anarchists was their ideas their literature none had been at haymarket that day except fielden who was speaking when the bomb exploded a jury found them guilty and they were sentenced to death their appeals were denied the supreme court said it had no jurisdiction

the event aroused international excitement meetings took place in france holland russia italy spain in london a meeting of protest was sponsored by george bernard shaw william morris and peter kropotkin among others shaw had responded in his characteristic way to the turning down of an appeal by the eight members of the illinois supreme court if the world must lose eight of its people it can better afford to lose the eight members of the illinois supreme court

a year after the trial four of the convicted anarchistsalbert parsons a printer august spies an upholsterer adolph eischer and george engelwere hanged louis lingg a twentyoneyearold carpenter blew himself up in his cell by exploding a dynamite tube in his mouth three remained in prison

the executions aroused people all over the country there was a funeral march of 25000 in chicago some evidence came out that a man named rudolph schnaubelt supposedly an anarchist was actually an agent of the police an agent provocateur hired to throw the bomb and thus enable the arrest of hundreds the destruction of the revolutionary leadership in chicago but to this day it has not been discovered who threw the bomb

while the immediate result was a suppression of the radical movement the longterm effect was to keep alive the class anger of many to inspire othersespecially young people of that generationto action in revolutionary causes sixty thousand signed petitions to the new governor of illinois john peter altgeld who investigated the facts denounced what had happened and pardoned the three remaining prisoners year after year all over the country memorial meetings for the haymarket martyrs were held it is impossible to know the number of individuals whose political awakeningas with emma goldman and alexander berkman longtime revolutionary stalwarts of the next generationcame from the haymarket affair

as late as 1968 the haymarket events were alive in that year a group of young radicals in chicago blew up the monument that had been erected to the memory of the police who died in the explosion and the trial of eight leaders of the antiwar movement in chicago around that time evoked in the press in meetings and in literature the memory of the first chicago eight on trial for their ideas

after haymarket class conflict and violence continued with strikes lockouts blacklisting the use of pinkerton detectives and police to break strikes with force and courts to break them by law during a strike of streetcar conductors on the third avenue line in new york a month after the haymarket affair police charged a crowd of thousands using their clubs indiscriminately the new york sun reported men with broken scalps were crawling off in all directions

some of the energy of resentment in late 1886 was poured into the electoral campaign for mayor of new york that fall trade unions formed an independent labor party and nominated for mayor henry george the radical economist whose progress and poverty had been read by tens of thousands of workers georges platform tells something about the conditions of life for workers in new york in the 1880s it demanded

that property qualifications be abolished for members of juries
that grand jurors be chosen from the lowerclass as well as from the upperclass which dominated grand juries
that the police not interfere with peaceful meetings
that the sanitary inspection of buildings be enforced
that contract labor be abolished in public works
that there be equal pay for equal work for women
that the streetcars be owned by the municipal government

the democrats nominated an iron manufacturer abram hewitt and the republicans nominated theodore roosevelt at a convention presided over by elihu root a corporation lawyer with the nominating speech given by chauncey depew a railroad director in a campaign of coercion and bribery hewitt was elected with 41 percent of the vote george came second with 31 percent of the vote and roosevelt third with 2 7 percent of the vote the new york world saw this as a signal

the deepvoiced protest conveyed in the 67000 votes for henry george against the combined power of both political parties of wall street and the business interests and of the public press should be a warning to the community to heed the demands of labor so far as they are just and reasonable  

in other cities in the country too labor candidates ran polling 25000 out of 92000 votes in chicago electing a mayor in milwaukee and various local officials in fort worth texas eaton ohio and leadville colorado

it seemed that the weight of haymarket had not crushed the labor movement the year 1886 became known to contemporaries as the year of the great uprising of labor from 1881 to 1885 strikes had averaged about 500 each year involving perhaps 150000 workers each year in 1886 there were over 1400 strikes involving 500000 workers john commons in his history of the labor movement in the united states saw in that

 the signs of a great movement by the class of the unskilled which had finally risen in rebellion   the movement bore in every way the aspect of a social war a frenzied hatred of labour for capital was shown in every important strike  extreme bitterness toward capital manifested itself in all the actions of the knights of labor and wherever the leaders undertook to hold it within bounds they were generally discarded by their followers  

even among southern blacks where all the military political and economic force of the southern states with the acquiescence of the national government was concentrated on keeping them docile and working there were sporadic rebellions in the cotton fields blacks were dispersed in their work but in the sugar fields work was done in gangs so there was opportunity for organized action in 1880 they had struck to get a dollar a day instead of 75 cents threatening to leave the state strikers were arrested and jailed but they walked the roads along the sugar fields carrying banners a dollar a day or kansas they were arrested again and again for trespassing and the strike was broken

by 1886 however the knights of labor was organizing in the sugar fields in the peak year of the knights influence the black workers unable to feed and clothe their families on their wages often paid in store scrip asked a dollar a day once more the following year in the fall close to ten thousand sugar laborers went on strike 90 percent of them negroes and members of the knights the militia arrived and gun battles began

violence erupted in the town of thibodaux which had become a kind of refugee village where hundreds of strikers evicted from their plantation shacks gathered penniless and ragged carrying their bed clothing and babies their refusal to work threatened the entire sugar crop and martial law was declared in thibodaux henry and george cox two negro brothers leaders in the knights of labor were arrested locked up then taken from their cells and never heard from again on the night of november 22 shooting broke out each side claiming the other was at fault by noon the next day thirty negroes were dead or dying and hundreds wounded two whites were wounded a negro newspaper in new orleans wrote

   lame men and blind women shot children and hoaryheaded grandsires ruthlessly swept down the negroes offered no resistance they could not as the killing was unexpected those of them not killed took to the woods a majority of them finding refuge in this city  

citizens of the united states killed by a mob directed by a state judge   laboring men seeking an advance in wages treated as if they were dogs  

at such times and upon such occasions words of condemnation fall like snowflakes upon molten lead the blacks should defend their lives and if needs must die die with their faces toward their persecutors fighting for their homes their children and their lawful rights

nativeborn poor whites were not doing well either in the south they were tenant farmers rather than landowners in the southern cities they were tenants not homeowners c vann woodward notes origins of the new south that the city with the highest rate of tenancy in the united states was birmingham with 90 percent and the slums of the southern cities were among the worst poor whites living like the blacks on unpaved dirt streets choked up with garbage filth and mud according to a report of one state board of health

there were eruptions against the convict labor system in the south in which prisoners were leased in slave labor to corporations used thus to depress the general level of wages and also to break strikes in the year 1891 miners of the tennessee coal mine company were asked to sign an iron clad contract pledging no strikes agreeing to get paid in scrip and giving up the right to check the weight of the coal they mined they were paid by the weight they refused to sign and were evicted from their houses convicts were brought in to replace them

on the night of october 31 1891 a thousand armed miners took control of the mine area set five hundred convicts free and burned down the stockades in which the convicts were kept the companies surrendered agreeing not to use convicts not to require the ironclad contract and to let the miners check on the weight of the coal they mined

the following year there were more such incidents in tennessee c vann woodward calls them insurrections miners overpowered guards of the tennessee coal and iron company burned the stockades shipped the convicts to nashville other unions in tennessee came to their aid an observer reported back to the chattanooga federation of trades

i should like to impress upon people the extent of this movement i have seen the written assurance of reinforcements to the miners of fully 7500 men who will be on the field in ten hours after the first shot is fired   the entire district is as one over the main proposition the convicts must go i counted 840 rifles on monday as the miners passed while the vast multitude following them carried revolvers the captains of the different companies are all grand army men whites and negroes are standing shoulder to shoulder

that same year in new orleans fortytwo union locals with over twenty thousand members mostly white but including some blacks there was one black on the strike committee called a general strike involving half the population of the city work in new orleans came to a stop after three dayswith strikebreakers brought in martial law and the threat of militiathe strike ended with a compromise gaining hours and wages but without recognition of the unions as bargaining agents

the year 1892 saw strike struggles all over the country besides the general strike in new orleans and the coal miners strike in tennessee there was a railroad switchmens strike in buffalo new york and a copper miners strike in coeur dalene idaho the coeur dalene strike was marked by gun battles between strikers and strikebreakers and many deaths a newspaper account of july 11 1892 reported

 the longdreaded conflict between the forces of the strikers and the nonunion men who have taken their places has come at last as a result five men are known to be dead and 16 are already in the hospital the frisco mill on canyon creek is in ruins the gem mine has surrendered to the strikers the arms of its employees have been captured and the employees themselves have been ordered out of the country flushed with the success of these victories the turbulent element among the strikers are preparing to move upon other strongholds of the nonunion men 

the national guard brought in by the governor was reinforced by federal troops six hundred miners were rounded up and imprisoned in bullpens scabs brought back union leaders fired the strike broken

in early 1892 the carnegie steel plant at homestead pennsylvania just outside of pittsburgh was being managed by henry clay frick while carnegie was in europe frick decided to reduce the workers wages and break their union he built a fence 3 miles long and 12 feet high around the steelworks and topped it with barbed wire adding peepholes for rifles when the workers did not accept the pay cut frick laid off the entire work force the pinkerton detective agency was hired to protect strikebreakers

although only 750 of the 3800 workers at homestead belonged to the union three thousand workers met in the opera house and voted overwhelmingly to strike the plant was on the monongahela river and a thousand pickets began patrolling a 10mile stretch of the river a committee of strikers took over the town and the sheriff was unable to raise a posse among local people against them

on the night of july 5 1892 hundreds of pinkerton guards boarded barges 5 miles down the river from homestead and moved toward the plant where ten thousand strikers and sympathizers waited the crowd warned the pinkertons not to step off the barge a striker lay down on the gangplank and when a pinkerton man tried to shove him aside he fired wounding the detective in the thigh in the gunfire that followed on both sides seven workers were killed

the pinkertons had to retreat onto the barges they were attacked from all sides voted to surrender and then were beaten by the enraged crowd there were dead on both sides for the next several days the strikers were in command of the area now the state went into action the governor brought in the militia armed with the latest rifles and gatling guns to protect the import of strikebreakers

strike leaders were charged with murder 160 other strikers were tried for other crimes all were acquitted by friendly juries the entire strike committee was then arrested for treason against the state but no jury would convict them the strike held for four months but the plant was producing steel with strikebreakers who were brought in often in locked trains not knowing their destination not knowing a strike was on the strikers with no resources left agreed to return to work their leaders blacklisted

one reason for the defeat was that the strike was confined to homestead and other plants of carnegie kept working some blast furnace workers did strike but they were quickly defeated and the pig iron from those furnaces was then used at homestead the defeat kept unionization from the carnegie plants well into the twentieth century and the workers took wage cuts and increases in hours without organized resistance

in the midst of the homestead strike a young anarchist from new york named alexander berkman in a plan prepared by anarchist friends in new york including his lover emma goldman came to pittsburgh and entered the office of henry clay frick determined to kill him berkmans aim was poor he wounded frick and was overwhelmed then was tried and found guilty of attempted murder he served fourteen years in the state penitentiary his prison memoirs of an anarchist gave a graphic description of the assassination attempt and of his years in prison when he changed his mind about the usefulness of assassinations but remained a dedicated revolutionary emma goldmans autobiography living my life conveys the anger the sense of injustice the desire for a new kind of life that grew among the young radicals of that day

the year 1893 saw the biggest economic crisis in the countrys history after several decades of wild industrial growth financial manipulation uncontrolled speculation and profiteering it all collapsed 642 banks failed and 16000 businesses closed down out of the labor force of 15 million 3 million were unemployed no state government voted relief but mass demonstrations all over the country forced city governments to set up soup kitchens and give people work on streets or parks

in new york city in union square emma goldman addressed a huge meeting of the unemployed and urged those whose children needed food to go into the stores and take it she was arrested for inciting to riot and sentenced to two years in prison in chicago it was estimated that 200000 people were without work the floors and stairways of city hall and the police stations packed every night with homeless men trying to sleep

the depression lasted for years and brought a wave of strikes throughout the country the largest of these was the nationwide strike of railroad workers in 1894 that began at the pullman company in illinois just outside of chicago

annual wages of railroad workers according to the report of the commissioner of labor in 1890 were 957 for engineers the aristocrats of the railroadbut 575 for conductors 212 for brakemen and 124 for laborers railroad work was one of the most dangerous jobs in america over two thousand railroad workers were being killed each year and thirty thousand injured the railroad companies called these acts of god or the result of carelessness on the part of the workers but the locomotive firemens magazine said it comes to this while railroad managers reduce their force and require men to do double duty involving loss of rest and sleep    the accidents are chargeable to the greed of the corporation

it was the depression of 1893 that propelled eugene debs into a lifetime of action for unionism and socialism debs was from terre haute indiana where his father and mother ran a store he had worked on the railroads for four years until he was nineteen but left when a friend was killed after falling under a locomotive he came back to join a railroad brotherhood as a billing clerk at the time of the great strikes of 1877 debs opposed them and argued there was no necessary conflict between capital and labor but when he read edward bellamys looking backward it deeply affected him he followed the events at homestead coeur dalene the buffalo switchmens strike and wrote

if the year 1892 taught the world any lesson worthy of heed it was that the capitalist class like a devilfish had grasped them with its tentacles and was dragging them down to fathomless depths of degradation to escape the prehensile clutch of these monsters constitutes a standing challenge to organized labor for 1893

in the midst of the economic crisis of 1893 a small group of railroad workers including debs formed the american railway union to unite all railway workers debs said

a life purpose of mine has been the federation of railroad employees to unify them into one great body is my object    class enrollment fosters class prejudices and class selfishness  it has been my lifes desire to unify railroad employees and to eliminate the aristocracy of labor  and organize them so all will be on an equality 

knights of labor people came in virtually merging the old knights with the american railway union according to labor historian david montgomery

debs wanted to include everyone but blacks were kept out at a convention in 1894 the provision in the constitution barring blacks was affirmed by a vote of 112 to 100 later debs thought this might have had a crucial effect on the outcome of the pullman strike for black workers were in no mood to cooperate with the strikers

in june 1894 workers at the pullman palace car company went on strike one can get an idea of the kind of support they got mostly from the immediate vicinity of chicago in the first months of the strike from a list of contributions put together by the reverend william h carwardine a methodist pastor in the company town of pullman for three years he was sent away after he supported the strikers

the pullman strikers appealed to a convention of the american railway union for support

mr president and brothers of the american railway union we struck at pullman because we were without hope we joined the american railway union because it gave us a glimmer of hope twenty thousand souls men women and little ones have their eyes turned toward this convention today straining eagerly through dark despondency for a glimmer of the heavensent message you alone can give us on this earth 

you all must know that the proximate cause of our strike was the discharge of two members of our grievance committee five reductions in wages  the last was the most severe amounting to nearly thirty per cent and rents had not fallen  

water which pullman buys from the city at 8 cents a thousand gallons he retails lo us at 500 percent advance   gas which sells at 75 cents per thousand feet in hyde park just north of us he sells for 225 when we went to tell him our grievances he said we were all his children 

pullman both the man and the town is an ulcer on the body politic he owns the houses the schoolhouses and churches of god in the town he gave his once humble name

and thus the merry warthe dance of skeletons bathed in human tearsgoes on and it will go on brothers forever unless you the american railway union stop it end it crush it out

the american railway union responded it asked its members all over the country not to handle pullman cars since virtually all passenger trains had pullman cars this amounted to a boycott of all trainsa nationwide strike soon all traffic on the twentyfour railroad lines leading out of chicago had come to a halt workers derailed freight cars blocked tracks pulled engineers off trains if they refused to cooperate

the general managers association representing the railroad owners agreed to pay two thousand deputies sent in to break the strike but the strike went on the attorney general of the united states richard olney a former railroad lawyer now got a court injunction against blocking trains on the legal ground that the federal mails were being interfered with when the strikers ignored the injunction president cleveland ordered federal troops to chicago on july 6 hundreds of cars were burned by strikers

the following day the state militia moved in and the chicago times reported on what followed

company c second regiment    disciplined a mob of rioters yesterday afternoon at fortyninth and loomis streets the police assisted and    finished the job there is no means of knowing how many rioters were killed or wounded the mob carried off many of its dying and injured

a crowd of five thousand gathered rocks were thrown at the militia and the command was given to fire

 to say that the mob went wild is but a weak expression   the command to charge was given   from that moment only bayonets were used  a dozen men in the front line of rioters received bayonet wounds  

tearing up cobble stones the mob made a determined charge the word was passed along the line for each officer to take care of himself one by one as occasion demanded they fired point blank into the crowd  the police followed with their clubs a wire fence enclosed the track the rioters had forgotten it when they turned to fly they were caught in a trap

the police were not inclined to be merciful and driving the mob against the barbed wires clubbed it unmercifully   the crowd outside the fence rallied to the assistance of the rioters the shower of stones was incessant  

the ground over which the fight had occurred was like a battlefield the men shot by the troops and police lay about like logs 

in chicago that day thirteen people were killed fiftythree seriously wounded seven hundred arrested before the strike was over perhaps thirtyfour were dead with fourteen thousand police militia troops in chicago the strike was crushed debs was arrested for contempt of court for violating the injunction that said he could not do or say anything to carry on the strike he told the court it seems to me that if it were not for resistance to degrading conditions the tendency of our whole civilization would be downward after a while we would reach the point where there would be no resistance and slavery would come

debs in court denied he was a socialist but during his six months in prison he studied socialism and talked to fellow prisoners who were socialists later he wrote i was to be baptized in socialism in the roar of conflict in the gleam of every bayonet and the flash of every rifle the class struggle was revealed  this was my first practical struggle in socialism

two years after he came out of prison debs wrote in the railway times

the issue is socialism versus capitalism i am for socialism because i am for humanity we have been cursed with the reign of gold long enough money constitutes no proper basis of civilization the time has come to regenerate societywe are on the eve of a universal change

thus the eighties and nineties saw bursts of labor insurrection more organized than the spontaneous strikes of 1877 there were now revolutionary movements influencing labor struggles the ideas of socialism affecting labor leaders radical literature was appearing speaking of fundamental changes of new possibilities for living

in this same period those who worked on the landfarmers north and south black and whitewere going far beyond the scattered tenant protests of the precivil war years and creating the greatest movement of agrarian rebellion the country had ever seen

when the homestead act was being discussed in congress in 1860 a senator from wisconsin said he supported it

  because its benign operation will postpone for centuries if it will not forever all serious conflict between capital and labor in the older free states withdrawing their surplus population to create in greater abundance the means of subsistence

the homestead act did not have that effect it did not bring tranquility to the east by moving americans to the west it was not a safety valve for discontent which was too great to be contained that way as henry nash smith says virgin land and as we have seen on the contrary the three decades following its passage were marked by the most bitter and widespread labor trouble that had yet been seen in the united states

it also failed to bring peace to the farm country of the west hamlin garland who made so many americans aware of the life of the farmer wrote in the preface to his novel jason edwards tree land is gone the last acre of available farmland has now passed into private or corporate hands in jason edwards a boston mechanic takes his family west drawn by advertising circulars but he finds that all land within 30 miles of a railroad has been taken up by speculators he struggles for five years to pay off a loan and get title to his farm and then a storm destroys his wheat just before harvest

behind the despair so often registered in the farm country literature of that day there must have been visions from time to time of a different way to live in another garland novel a spoil of office the heroine speaks at a farmers picnic

i see a time when the farmer will not need to live in a cabin on a lonely farm i see the farmers coming together in groups i see them with time to read and time to visit with their fellows i see them enjoying lectures in beautiful halls erected in every village i see them gather like the saxons of old upon the green at evening to sing and dance i see cities rising near them with schools and churches and concert halls and theaters i see a day when the farmer will no longer be a drudge and his wife a bond slave but happy men and women who will go singing to their pleasant tasks upon their fruitful farms when the boys and girls will not go west nor to the city when life will be worth living in that day the moon will be brighter and the stars more glad and pleasure and poetry and love of life come back to the man who tills the soil

hamlin garland dedicated jason edwards written in 1891 to the farmers alliance it was the farmers alliance that was the core of the great movement of the 1880s and 1890s later known as the populist movement

between 1860 and 1910 the us army wiping out the indian villages on the great plains paved the way for the railroads to move in and take the best land then the farmers came for what was left from 1860 to 1900 the population of the united states grew from 31 million to 75 million now 20 million people lived west of the mississippi and the number of farms grew from 2 million to 6 million with the crowded cities of the east needing food the internal market for food was more than doubled 82 percent of the farm produce was sold inside the united states

farming became mechanizedsteel plows mowing machines reapers harvesters improved cotton gins for pulling the fibers away from the seed and by the turn of the century giant combines that cut the grain threshed it and put it in bags in 1830 a bushel of wheat had taken three hours to produce by 1900 it took ten minutes specialization developed by region cotton and tobacco in the south wheat and corn in the midwest

land cost money and machines cost moneyso farmers had to borrow hoping that the prices of their harvests would stay high so they could pay the bank for the loan the railroad for transportation the grain merchant for handling their grain the storage elevator for storing it but they found the prices for their produce going down and the prices of transportation and loans going up because the individual farmer could not control the price of his grain while the monopolist railroad and the monopolist banker could charge what they liked

william faulkner in his novel the hamlet described the man on whom southern farmers depended

he was the largest landholder  in one county and justice of the peace in the next and election commissioner in both he was a farmer a usurer a veterinarian he owned most of the good land in the county and held mortgages on most of the rest he owned the store and the cotton gin and the combined grist mill and blacksmith shop 

the farmers who could not pay saw their homes and land taken away they became tenants by 1880 25 percent of all farms were rented by tenants and the number kept rising many did not even have money to rent and became farm laborers by 1900 there were 4 12 million farm laborers in the country it was the fate that awaited every farmer who couldnt pay his debts

could the squeezed and desperate farmer turn to the government for help lawrence goodwyn in his study of the populist movement the democratic promise says that after the civil war both parties now were controlled by capitalists they were divided along northsouth lines still hung over with the animosities of the civil war this made it very hard to create a party of reform cutting across both parties to unite working people south and northto say nothing of black and white foreignborn and nativeborn

the government played its part in helping the bankers and hurting the farmers it kept the amount of moneybased on the gold supply steady while the population rose so there was less and less money in circulation the farmer had to pay off his debts in dollars that were harder to get the bankers getting the loans back were getting dollars worth more than when they loaned them outa kind of interest on top of interest that is why so much of the talk of farmers movements in those days had to do with putting more money in circulationby printing greenbacks paper money for which there was no gold in the treasury or by making silver a basis for issuing money

it was in texas that the farmers alliance movement began it was in the south that the croplien system was most brutal by this system the farmer would get the things he needed from the merchant the use of the cotton gin at harvest time whatever supplies were necessary he didnt have money to pay so the merchant would get a liena mortgage on his cropon which the farmer might pay 25 percent interest goodwyn says the crop lien system became for millions of southerners white and black little more than a modified form of slavery the man with the ledger became to the farmer the furnishing man to black farmers simply the man the farmer would owe more money every year until finally his farm was taken away and he became a tenant

goodwyn gives two personal histories to illustrate this a white farmer in south carolina between 1887 and 1895 bought goods and services from the furnishing merchant for 268102 but was able to pay only 68731 and finally he had to give his land to the merchant a black farmer named matt brown in black hawk mississippi between 1884 and 1901 bought his supplies from the jones store kept falling further and further behind and in 1905 the last entry in the merchants ledger is for a coffin and burial supplies

how many rebellions took place against this system we dont know in delhi louisiana in 1889 a gathering of small farmers rode into town and demolished the stores of merchants to cancel their indebtedness they said

in the height of the 1877 depression a group of white farmers gathered together on a farm in texas and formed the first farmers alliance in a few years it was across the state by 1882 there were 120 suballiances in twelve counties by 1886 100000 farmers had joined in two thousand suballiances they began to offer alternatives to the old system join the alliance and form cooperatives buy things together and get lower prices they began putting their cotton together and selling it cooperativelythey called it bulking

in some states a grange movement developed it managed to get laws passed to help farmers but the grange as one of its newspapers put it is essentially conservative and furnishes a stable well organized rational and orderly opposition to encroachments upon the liberties of the people in contrast to the lawless desperate attempts of communism it was a time of crisis and the grange was doing too little it lost members while the farmers alliance kept growing

from the beginning the farmers alliance showed sympathy with the growing labor movement when knights of labor men went on strike against a steamship line in galveston texas one of the radical leaders of the texas alliance william lamb spoke for many but not all alliance members when he said in an open letter to alliance people knowing that the day is not far distant when the farmers alliance will have to use boycott on manufacturers in order to get goods direct we think it is a good time to help the knights of labor   goodwyn says alliance radicalism populismbegan with this letter

the texas alliance president opposed joining the boycott but a group of alliance people in texas passed a resolution

whereas we see the unjust encroachments that the capitalists are making upon all the different departments of labor  we extend to the knights of labor our hearty sympathy in their manly struggle against monopolistic oppression and  we propose to stand by the knights

in the summer of 1886 in the town of cleburne near dallas the alliance gathered and drew up what came to be known as the cleburne demandsthe first document of the populist movement asking such legislation as shall secure to our people freedom from the onerous and shameful abuses that the industrial classes are now suffering at the hands of arrogant capitalists and powerful corporations they called for a national conference of all labor organizations to discuss such measures as may be of interest to the laboring classes and proposed regulation of railroad rates heavy taxation of land held only for speculative purposes and an increase in the money supply

the alliance kept growing by early 1887 it had 200000 members in three thousand suballiances by 1892 farmer lecturers had gone into fortythree states and reached 2 million farm families in what goodwyn calls the most massive organizing drive by any citizen institution of nineteenth century america it was a drive based on the idea of cooperation of farmers creating their own culture their own political parties gaining a respect not given them by the nations powerful industrial and political leaders

organizers from texas came to georgia to form alliances and in three years georgia had 100000 members in 134 of the 137 counties in tennessee there were soon 125000 members and 3600 suballiances in ninetytwo of the states ninetysix counties the alliance moved into mississippi like a cyclone someone said and into louisiana and north carolina then northward into kansas and the dakotas where thirtyfive cooperative warehouses were set up

one of the leading figures in kansas was henry vincent who started a journal in 1886 called the american nonconformist and kansas industrial liberator saying in the first issue

this journal will aim to publish such matter as will tend to the education of the laboring classes the farmers and the producer and in every struggle it will endeavor to take the side of the oppressed as against the oppressor 

by 1889 the kansas alliance had fifty thousand members and was electing local candidates to office

now there were 400000 members in the national farmers alliance and the conditions spurring the alliance onward got worse corn which had brought 45 cents a bushel in 1870 brought 10 cents a bushel in 1889 harvesting wheat required a machine to bind the wheat before it became too dry and this cost several hundred dollars which the farmer had to buy on credit knowing the 200 would be twice as hard to get in a few years then he had pay a bushel of corn in freight costs for every bushel he shipped he had to pay the high prices demanded by the grain elevators at the terminals in the south the situation was worse than anywhere90 percent of the farmers lived on credit

to meet this situation the texas alliance formed a statewide cooperative a great texas exchange which handled the selling of the farmers cotton in one great transaction but the exchange itself needed loans to advance credit to its members the banks refused a call was issued to farmers to scrape together the needed capital for the exchange to operate thousands came on june 9 1888 to two hundred texas courthouses and made their contributions pledging 200000 ultimately 80000 was actually collected it was not enough the farmers poverty prevented them from helping themselves the banks won and this persuaded the alliances that monetary reform was crucial

there was one victory along the way farmers were being charged too much for jute bags to put cotton in which were controlled by a trust the alliance farmers organized a boycott of jute made their own bags out of cotton and forced the jute manufacturers to start selling their bags at 5 cents a yard instead of 14 cents

the complexity of populist belief was shown in one of its important leaders in texas charles macune he was a radical in economics antitrust and capitalist a conservative in politics against a new party independent of the democrats and a racist macune came forward with a plan that was to become central to the populist platformthe subtreasury plan the government would have its own warehouses where farmers would store produce and get certificates from this subtreasury these would be greenbacks and thus much more currency would be made available not dependent on gold or silver but based on the amount of farm produce

there were more alliance experiments in the dakotas a great cooperative insurance plan for farmers insured them against loss of their crops where the big insurance companies had asked 50 cents an acre the cooperative asked 25 cents or less it issued thirty thousand policies covering 2 million acres

macunes subtreasury plan depended on the government and since it would not be taken up by the two major parties it meant against macunes own beliefs organizing a third party the alliances went to work in 1890 thirtyeight alliance people were elected to congress in the south the alliance elected governors in georgia and texas it took over the democratic party in georgia and won threefourths of the seats in the georgia legislature six of georgias ten congressmen

this was however goodwyn says an elusive revolution because the party machinery remained in the hands of the old crowd and the crucial chairmanships of important committees in congress in the state legislatures remained in the hands of the conservatives and corporate power in the states in the nation could use its money to still get what it wanted

the alliances were not getting real power but they were spreading new ideas and a new spirit now as a political party they became the peoples party or populist party and met in convention in 1890 in topeka kansas the great populist orator from that state mary ellen lease told an enthusiastic crowd

wall street owns the country it is no longer a government of the people by the people and for the people but a government of wall street by wall street and for wall street our laws are the output of a system which clothes rascals in robes and honesty in rags   the politicians said we suffered from overproduction overproduction when 10000 little children   starve to death every year in the us and over 100000 shop girls in new york are forced to sell their virtue for bread 

there are thirty men in the united states whose aggregate wealth is over one and onehalf billion dollars there are half a million looking for work  we want money land and transportation we want the abolition of the national banks and we want the power to make loans direct from the government we want the accursed foreclosure system wiped out    we will stand by our homes and stay by our firesides by force if necessary and we will not pay our debts to the loanshark companies until the government pays its debts to us

the people are at bay let the bloodhounds of money who have dogged us thus far beware

at the peoples party national convention in 1892 in st louis a platform was drawn up the preamble was written by and read to the assemblage by another of the great orators of the movement ignatius donnelly

we meet in the midst of a nation brought to the verge of moral political and material ruin corruption dominates the ballot box the legislatures the congress and touches even the ermine of the bench these people are demoralized   the newspapers are subsidized or muzzled public opinion silenced business prostrate our homes covered with mortgages labor impoverished and the land concentrating in the hands of capitalists

the urban workmen are denied the right of organization for selfprotection imported pauperized labor beats down their wages a hireling standing army   established to shoot them down  the fruits of the toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes   from the same prolific womb of governmental injustice we breed two classespaupers and millionaires 

a peoples party nominating convention in omaha in july of 1892 nominated james weaver an iowa populist and former general in the union army for president the populist movement was now tied to the voting system their spokesman polk had said they could link their hands and hearts together and march to the ballot box and take possession of the government restore it to the principles of our fathers and run it in the interest of the people weaver got over a million votes but lost

a new political party had the job of uniting diverse groupsnorthern republicans and southern democrats urban workers and country farmers black and white a colored farmers national alliance grew in the south and had perhaps a million members but it was organized and led by whites there were also black organizers but it was not easy for them to persuade black farmers that even if economic reforms were won blacks would have equal access to them blacks had tied themselves to the republican party the party of lincoln and civil rights laws the democrats were the party of slavery and segregation as goodwyn puts it in an era of transcendent white prejudice the curbing of vicious corporate monopoly did not carry for black farmers the ring of salvation it had for white agrarians

there were whites who saw the need for racial unity one alabama newspaper wrote

the white and colored alliance are united in their war against trusts and in the promotion of the doctrine that farmers should establish cooperative stores and manufactures and publish their own newspapers conduct their own schools and have a hand in everything else that concerns them as citizens or affects them personally or collectively

the official newspaper of the alabama knights of labor the alabama sentinel wrote the bourbon democracy are trying to down the alliance with the old cry nigger it wont work though

some alliance blacks made similar calls for unity a leader of the florida colored alliance said we are aware of the fact that the laboring colored mans interests and the laboring white mans interest are one and the same

when the texas peoples party was founded in dallas in the summer of 1891 it was interracial and radical there was blunt and vigorous debate among whites and blacks a black delegate active in the knights of labor dissatisfied with vague statements about equality said

if we are equal why does not the sheriff summon negroes on juries and why hang up the sign negro in passenger cars i want to tell my people what the peoples party is going to do i want to tell them if it is going to work a black and white horse in the same field

a white leader responded by urging there be a black delegate from every district in the state they are in the ditch just like we are when someone suggested there be separate white and black populist clubs which would confer together r m humphrey the white leader of the colored alliance objected this will not do the colored people are part of the people and they must be recognized as such two blacks were then elected to the state executive committee of the party

blacks and whites were in different situations the blacks were mostly field hands hired laborers most white alliance people were farm owners when the colored alliance declared a strike in the cotton fields in 1891 for a dollar a day wages for cotton pickers leonidas polk head of the white alliance denounced it as hurting the alliance farmer who would have to pay that wage in arkansas a thirtyyearold black cotton picker named ben patterson led the strike traveling from plantation to plantation to get support his band growing engaging in gun battles with a white posse a plantation manager was killed a cotton gin burned patterson and his band were caught and fifteen of them were shot to death

there was some blackwhite unity at the ballot box in the south resulting in a few blacks elected in north carolina local elections an alabama white farmer wrote to a newspaper in 1892 i wish to god that uncle sam could put bayonets around the ballot box in the black belt on the first monday in august so that the negro could get a fair vote there were black delegates to third party conventions in georgia two in 1892 twentyfour in 1894 the arkansas peoples party platform spoke for the downtrodden regardless of race

there were moments of racial unity lawrence goodwyn found in east texas an unusual coalition of black and white public officials it had begun during reconstruction and continued into the populist period the state government was in the control of white democrats but in grimes county blacks won local offices and sent legislators to the state capital the district clerk was a black man there were black deputy sheriffs and a black school principal a nightriding white mans union used intimidation and murder to split the coalition but goodwyn points to the long years of interracial cooperation in grimes county and wonders about missed opportunities

racism was strong and the democratic party played on this winning many farmers from the populist party when white tenants failing in the croplien system were evicted from their land and replaced by blacks race hatred intensified southern states were drawing up new constitutions starting with mississippi in 1890 to prevent blacks from voting by various devices and to maintain ironclad segregation in every aspect of life

the laws that took the vote away from blackspoll taxes literacy tests property qualificationsalso often ensured that poor whites would not vote and the political leaders of the south knew this at the constitutional convention in alabama one of the leaders said he wanted to take away the vote from all those who are unfit and unqualified and if the rule strikes a white man as well as a negro let him go in north carolina the charlotte observer saw disfranchisement as the struggle of the white people of north carolina to rid themselves of the dangers of the rule of negroes and the lower class of whites

tom watson the populist leader of georgia pleaded for racial unity

you are kept apart that you may be separately fleeced of your earnings you are made to hate each other because upon that hatred is rested the keystone of the arch of financial despotism which enslaves you both you are deceived and blinded that you may not see how this race antagonism perpetuates a monetary system which beggars both

according to the black scholar robert alien taking a look at populism reluctant reformers watson wanted black support for a white mans party no doubt when watson found this support embarrassing and no longer useful he became as eloquent in affirming racism as he had been in opposing it

still watson must have addressed some genuine feelings in poor whites whose class oppression gave them some common interest with blacks when h s doyle a young black preacher who supported watson for congress was threatened by a lynch mob he came to watson for protection and two thousand white farmers helped doyle escape

it was a time that illustrated the complexities of class and race conflict fifteen blacks were lynched during watsons election campaign and in georgia after 1891 the alliancecontrolled legislature alien points out passed the largest number of antiblack bills ever enacted in a single year in georgia history and yet in 1896 the georgia state platform of the peoples party denounced lynch law and terrorism and asked the abolition of the convict lease system

c vann woodward points to the unique quality of the populist experience in the south never before or since have the two races in the south come so close together as they did during the populist struggles

the populist movement also made a remarkable attempt to create a new and independent culture for the countrys farmers the alliance lecture bureau reached all over the country it had 35000 lecturers the populists poured out books and pamphlets from their printing presses woodward says

one gathers from yellowed pamphlets that the agrarian ideologists undertook to reeducate their countrymen from the ground up dismissing history as taught in our schools as practically valueless they undertook to write it overformidable columns of it from the greek down with no more compunction they turned all hands to the revision of economics political theory law and government

the national economist a populist magazine had 100000 readers goodwyn counts over a thousand populist journals in the 1890s there were newspapers like the comrade published in the cotton country of louisiana and the toilers friend in rural georgia also revolution was published in georgia in north carolina the populist printing plant was burned in alabama there was the living truth it was broken into in 1892 its type scattered and the next year the shop was set afire but the press survived and the editor never missed an issue

hundreds of poems and songs came out of the populist movement like the farmer is the man    the farmer is the man
the farmer is the man
lives on credit till the fall
with the interest rates so high
its a wonder he dont die
and the mortgage mans the one
that gets it all

the farmer is the man
the farmer is the man
lives on credit till the fall
and his pants are wearing thin
his condition its a sin
hes forgot that hes the man
that feeds them all

books written by populist leaders such as henry demarest lloyds wealth against commonwealth and william harvey coins financial school were widely read an alabama historian of that time william garrott brown said about the populist movement that no other political movementnot that of 1776 nor that of 18601861ever altered southern life so profoundly

according to lawrence goodwyn if the labor movement had been able to do in the cities what the populists did in the rural areas to create among urban workers a culture of cooperation self respect and economic analysis there might have been a great movement for change in the united states there were only fitful occasional connections between the farmer and labor movements neither spoke eloquently enough to the others needs and yet there were signs of a common consciousness that might under different circumstances lead to a unified ongoing movement

norman pollack says on the basis of a close study of midwestern populist newspapers that populism regarded itself as a class movement reasoning that farmers and workers were assuming the same material position in society an editorial in the farmers alliance spoke of a man working fourteen to sixteen hours a day he is brutalized both morally and physically he has no ideas only propensities he has no beliefs only instincts pollack sees that as a homespun version of marxs idea of workers alienation from his human self under capitalism and finds many other parallels between populist and marxist ideas

undoubtedly populists along with most white americans had racism and nativism in their thinking but part of it was that they simply did not think race as important as the economic system thus the farmers alliance said the peoples party has sprung into existence not to make the black man free but to emancipate all men  to gain for all industrial freedom without which there can be no political freedom   

more important than theoretical connections were the populist expressions of support for workers in actual struggles the allianceindependent of nebraska during the great strike at the carnegie steel plant wrote all who look beneath the surface will see that the bloody battle fought at homestead was a mere incident in the great conflict between capital and labor coxeys march of the unemployed drew sympathy in the farm areas in osceola nebraska perhaps five thousand people attended a picnic in coxeys honor during the pullman strike a farmer wrote to the governor of kansas unquestionably nearly if not quite all alliance people are in fullest sympathy with these striking men

on top of the serious failures to unite blacks and whites city workers and country farmers there was the lure of electoral politicsall of that combining to destroy the populist movement once allied with the democratic party in supporting william jennings bryan for president in 1896 populism would drown in a sea of democratic politics the pressure for electoral victory led populism to make deals with the major parties in city after city if the democrats won it would be absorbed if the democrats lost it would disintegrate electoral polities brought into the top leadership the political brokers instead of the agrarian radicals

there were those radical populists who saw this they said fusion with the democrats to try to win would lose what they needed an independent political movement they said the much ballyhooed free silver would not change anything fundamental in the capitalist system one texas radical said silver coinage would leave undisturbed all the conditions which give rise to the undue concentration of wealth

henry demarest lloyd noted that the bryan nomination was subsidized in part by marcus daly of anaconda copper and william randolph hearst of the silver interests in the west he saw through the rhetoric of bryan that stirred the crowd of twenty thousand at the democratic convention we have petitioned and our petitions have been scorned we have entreated and our entreaties have been disregarded we have begged and they have mocked when our calamity came we beg no longer we entreat no more we petition no more we defy them lloyd wrote bitterly

the poor people are throwing up their hats in the air for those who promise to lead them out of the wilderness by way of the currency route   the people are to be kept wandering forty years in the currency labyrinth as they have for the last forty years been led up and down the tariff bill

in the election of 1896 with the populist movement enticed into the democratic party bryan the democratic candidate was defeated by william mckinley for whom the corporations and the press mobilized in the first massive use of money in an election campaign even the hint of populism in the democratic party it seemed could not be tolerated and the big guns of the establishment pulled out all their ammunition to make sure

it was a time as election times have often been in the united states to consolidate the system after years of protest and rebellion the black was being kept under control in the south the indian was being driven off the western plains for good on a cold winter day in 1890 us army soldiers attacked indians camped at wounded knee south dakota and killed three hundred men women and children it was the climax to four hundred years of violence that began with columbus establishing that this continent belonged to white men but only to certain white men because it was clear by 1896 that the state stood ready to crush labor strikes by the law if possible by force if necessary and where a threatening mass movement developed the twoparty system stood ready to send out one of its columns to surround that movement and drain it of vitality

and always as a way of drowning class resentment in a flood of slogans for national unity there was patriotism mckinley had said in a rare rhetorical connection between money and flag

 this year is going to be a year of patriotism and devotion to country i am glad to know that the people in every part of the country mean to be devoted to one flag the glorious stars and stripes that the people of this country mean to maintain the financial honor of the country as sacredly as they maintain the honor of the flag

the supreme act of patriotism was war two years after mckinley became president the united states declared war on spain3embed"
