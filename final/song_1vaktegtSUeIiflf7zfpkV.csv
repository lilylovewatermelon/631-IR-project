i fly a gigantic monster
i am captain evil stomper
i get to wear big black helmet
i pilot the hatredcopter

verse 1
i fly the beast made of steel
thick knives that cut the night
gas tank is filled with vengeance
machine guns shooting spite
cant find the thing that makes this
thing take a hard turn right
i follow where it leads me
night bat with wings of might

chorus
you will most likely die by the hands of my arm
when i come and fly and take offa your face
with the front of my hatredcopter

death growl

preverse
i fly a gigantic monster
i am captain evil stomper
i get to wear big black helmet
i pilot the hatredcopter
see dethklok liveget tickets as low as 47you might also likeverse 2
i fly the hatredcopter
im going to hunt you down
i get paid lots of money
for all the bounties found
cant seem to find the button
that turns the radar on
cant work the hatredcopter
the hunt for you is on

prechorus
i am likely to find
for my failure to fly
that i will be fired
for not killing you
cause that is my job
hatredcopter

chorus
you will most likely die by the hands of my arm
when i come and fly and take offa your face
with the front of my hatredcopter
