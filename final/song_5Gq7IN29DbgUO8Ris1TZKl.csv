verse 1 justin timberlake
i can tell you want it good girl
you aint gotta worry no more
you keep my bottles cold and you pop em
as soon as i walk in the door
these dudes dont know me from adam and eve
thats why they cant mess up my flow
and when this beat drops your heart stops
you feel it from your head to your toes
