one more night

verse 1
you are all i can remember
after all that weve been through
forever in my heart
now im through
and june feels like november
still cant believe its true
too long weve been apart

chorus
one more night
i wanna be with you
where i wanna hold you tight
it feels so right tonight
so leave it up to you
and i think the time is right to stop the fight
one more night
i wanna be with you
where i wanna to hold you tight
it feels so right tonight
so leave it up to you
and i think the time is right to stop the fight stop the fight
stop the fight

verse 2
why cant true love be forever
why did my dream explode
the day you went away
cause i will keep the spell together
and wish you well of hope
your girl from yesterday

chorus
one more night
i wanna be with you
where i wanna hold you tight
it feels so right tonight
so leave it up to you
and i think the time is right to stop the fight
one more night
i wanna be with you
where i wanna hold you tight
it feels so right tonight
so leave it up to you
and i think the time is right to stop the fight stop the fightembed"
