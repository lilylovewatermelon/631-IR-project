no one will believe in you unless you do
heres to the crazy ones the misfists the rebels the troublemakers the round pegs and the square holes
were supposed to be different folks
and when people look at us  believe in yourself

verse 1

before you say you made it this life is a fucking headache
neither money nor a lottery ticket will fucking fade it
funny how they point at a way i felt the spirit of an artist
skeptical when i see the roaches
lost in confusion struggle in the game
you wanna go forth and back it has to be done action 
let’s get it out truth gets imagination
i had a dream then stunned by people’s reaction
a passion as a weapon back then kinda lost an adolescent
one thing my mind is gone so let me wander
pour out some bleach hold on damn i wonder
fuck i do the player get a balance good and evil
the quiet beared the toil do the math i blow the whistle
go get it spare the ego ain’t no muthafucking role models
eyes wide open i could see the end of the tunnel

chorus
light show me the way
i get carried away
light show me the way
i don’t wanna be blind at night
still a long journey
light show me the way
no support i get carried away
i guess i get it reload it
light show me the way
yeah yeah
its fate when you like then hate cause i love it

blinded imma do it allow me to shine it
once it started no way done it i can’t rewind it
seen a little seen enough tired to remind it
once you get a chance might be really hard to find it
thousand miles hence like a mirage a bit dizzy
bitter dried tasteless just a little gravy
exhausted so i rap freedom so i write
reluctant put that shit into perspective aight 
sewed fiber for a purse cotton into pillow
running out ink writing stories through my pilot
saddened daily routine ain’t no need to pay a psychic
smoke my ashes dope like a classic
lights flashing paradoxical insipid
mental of an ox ain’t no fucking way to stop it man
scifi merges with real facts
go fast there ain’t no time for me to back track

chorus

light show me the way
the master of my own destiny
i get carried away
controlling my own process
light show me the way
i dont wanna be blind at night
light show me the way
still a long journey
no support i get carried away
so im gonna keep it up
light show me the way
its fate when you like then hate cause i love it
yeah yeah
verse 3

drop your therapy on track right on the melody
serendipity the whole a perfect harmony
been dealing with you but still rocking with
hateful anger shit  a part of my accomplishment
must need a message don’t you know the sound of a gun 
pollution to my ears like smoke in your lungs
fresh breeze protest like a pacifist
massacre when the evil is done we passafist
sun is the polar star future is embellished
youth storytellers were high like a fantasist
take it like an act of god an earthquake
don’t take it like a joke it’s a heartbreak
acting like a star in a movie
harsh life rated r hard to believe me
dealing with animosity mood too intoxicated
looking for light in gloom suffering suffocated

chorus

light show me the way
alright its clear now
i get carried away
i can see it with my own eyes
light show me the way
its fate when you like it then hate cause i love it come on yeah
i dont wanna be blind at night
light show me the way
keep it going i know where im at hows it going 
no support i get carried away
light show me the way
its fate when you like it then hate cause i love it
yeah yeah
light show me the way
i get carried away
i can see it with my own eyes
light show me the way
its fate when you like it then hate cause i love it come on yeah
light show me the way
keep it going i know where im at hows it going 
no support i get carried away
light show me the way
i dont wanna be blind at nightembed"
