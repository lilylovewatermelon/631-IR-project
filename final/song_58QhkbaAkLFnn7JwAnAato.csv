photoshoot
you know everybodys been tellin me
what they think about me for the last few months
its too loud
maybe its time i tell em what i think about them
cant hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
its too loud
threes not a crowd all up in it
slow fire
chorus justin vernon
dont fall on my face
dont fall on my faith oh
dont fall on my fate
dont fall on my faith oh

verse 1 eminem
gotta concentrate against the clock i race
got no time to waste im already late i got a marathoners pace
went from addict to a workaholic word to dr dre
in that first marijuana tape—guess i got a chronic case yeah
and i aint just blowin smoke less its in your mamas face
i know this time paul and dre
they wont tell me what not to say nope
and though me and my party days
have all pretty much parted ways
youd swear to god i forgot im the guy that made not afraid yah
one last time for charlamagne
if my response is late its just how long it takes
to hit my fuckin radar im so far away woo
these rappers are like hunger games
one minute theyre mockin jay yeah
next minute they get their style from migos or they copy drake
maybe i just dont know when to turn around and walk away
but all the hate i call it walkonwatergate
ive had as much as i can tolerate
im sick and tired of waitin i done lost my patience
i can take all of you motherfuckers on at once yeah

verse 2 eminem
somebody tell budden before i snap he better fasten it
or have his body bag get zipped
the closest thing hes had to hits is smackin bitches pump it up
and dont make me have to give it back to akademiks
say this shit is trash again ill have you twisted
like you had it when you thought you had me slippin at the telly yeah
even when im gettin brain youll never catch me with a thot
lacking with it he aint spittin like this on his last shit
ho you better go back and listen
you know me better thinkin ill slow or let up
call it trap cause its a total setup
hopin that you rappers fall in that
dre said hold your head up huh—kathy griffin
stackin ammunition slap the clip in cock it back on competition
this is how i shot ahead pew—gabby gifford
my attack is vicious jack the ripper back in business
tyler create nothin i see why you called yourself a  bitch
its not just cause you lack attention
its because you worship d12s balls youre sackreligious
if youre gonna critique me
you better at least be as good or better
get earl the hooded sweater
whatever his name is to help you put together
some words more than just two letters
the fans waited for this moment like that feature
when i stole the show ha sorry if i took forever haha
chorus justin vernon  eminem
dont fall on my face yeah
dont fall on my faith oh i wont
dont fall on my fate line em up
dont fall on my faith oh haha
dont fall on my fate its too easy

verse 3 eminem
just remember i was here before you
and ill be here after you make your runin for you
detractors ima have to fuck pitchfork with a corkscrew ah
just what the doctor ordered
revenge is the best medicine yeah
increase the dose from least to most
and then tell the grammys to go and fuck themselves
they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
so they nominate em get em there get a name to mc the show
every parasite needs a host haha
then give album of the year to somebody that no ones ever even heard of
all i know is i wrote every single word of everything i ever murdered
time to separate the sheep from goats yeah
and i got no faith in your writers i dont believe in ghosts
when rap needed it most i was that wing and a prayer huh
a beacon of hope put a bird in the air
somewhere some kid is bumpin this while he lipsyncs in the mirror
thats who im doin it for the rest i dont really even care
but you would think im carryin a oxford dictionary in my pocket
how im buryin these artists
on a scale of turnt youre minus
mine says very yours says hardly
and whats scary is you probly can compare me to your car cause im just barely gettin started woo
and far as lord jamar you better leave me the hell alone
or ill show you an elvis clone
walk up in this house you own thrust my pelvic bone
use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
put my feet up and just make myself at home yeah
i belong here clown dont tell me bout the culture
i inspired the hopsins the logics the coles the
seans the kdots the 59s and oh
brought the world 50 cent you did squat piss and moan
but im not gonna fall bitch yeah
outro justin vernon
its too loud
