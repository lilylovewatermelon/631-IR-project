this may be the last thing that i write for long
can you hear me smiling when i sing this song for you
and only you
as i leave will you be someone to say goodbye
as i leave will you be someone to wipe your eye
my foot is out the door and you cant stop me now

prechorus
you wanted the best it wasnt me will you give it back
now ill take the lead when theres no more room to make it grow
ill see you again youll pretend youre naive is this what you want
is this what you need how you end up let me know

chorus
as i go remember all the simple things you know
my mind is just a crutch and i still hope that you will miss me when im gone
this is the last song

verse 2
the hearts start breaking as the year is gone
the dreams beginning and the time rolls on
it seems so surreal now i sing it
somehow i knew that it would be this way
somehow i knew that it would slowly fade
now i am gone just try and stop me now

you wanted the best it wasnt me will you give it back
now ill take the lead when theres no more room to make it grow
ill see you again youll pretend youre naive is this what you want
is this what you need how you end up let me know

chorus
as i go remember all the simple things you know
my mind is just a crutch and i still hope that you will miss me when im gone
this is the last song

bridge
and will you need me now youll find a way somehow
you want it too i want it too

chorus
as i go remember all the simple things you know
my mind is just a crutch and i still hope that you will miss me when im gone
last song
as i go
as i go remember all the simple things you know things you know
my mind is just a crutch and i still hope that you will miss me when im gone
this is the last songembed"
