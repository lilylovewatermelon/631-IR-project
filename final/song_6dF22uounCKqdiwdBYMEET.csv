looking back i still have so many questions
so many things unanswered
like what did i do
what could i do
was there ever a moment you cared
was i always ugly and abandoned
remembering all the times you wished me harm
you wished me dead
how could i have changed to make it better
and would i
would i
why

verse 2
i still feel so much hate inside of me
seems like you were just waiting for me to fail
im sorry i cant forgive you
do you blame me
you never forgave me
ive tried to grow from this
every day is a new challenge
because with you theres just no winning
like it or not im still a part of you
and youre still a part of me
like it or not youre still a part of me
yeah

so this is how it ends
all the tears all the blood
its all been for nothing
as the candle dwindles and flickers out
