on darker nights
i call the moon
to light the essence
of empty rooms
a blade of silver
across your chest
there is no struggle
lay you to rest

chorus
hold me closer
tie me down
cut me open
dont turn around
count your curses
in blood i’ll drown
with lacerations
i wont be found
hold me closer
tie me down
cut me open
dont turn around
count your curses
in blood i’ll drown
with lacerations
i wont be found

the reddest water
to be consumed
from precious skulls
your lust will loom
i find it hard
to let you go
i find it harder
to let them know

chorus
hold me closer
tie me down
cut me open
dont turn around
count your curses
in blood ill drown
with lacerations
i wont be found
hold me closer
tie me down
cut me open
dont turn around
count your curses
in blood ill drown
with lacerations
i wont be found
instrumental break

chorus
hold me closer
tie me down
cut me open
don’t turn around
count your curses
in blood i’ll drown
with lacerations
i wont be found
hold me closer
tie me down
cut me open
don’t turn around
count your curses
in blood ill drown
with lacerations
i wont be foundembed"
