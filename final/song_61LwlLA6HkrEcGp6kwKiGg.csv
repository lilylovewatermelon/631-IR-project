they treat me like mcgregor when im out in dublin they do yes they do
my momma dont like it when i be cussin she dont
but fuck these motherfuckers momma i dont trust them fuck em

dolce and gabbana cappuccino gelato
in a grotto out in cabo amateurs so apollo
whip this bulky like costco im out here and dodging 50
i hit the block with that top low a dookie rolled with a poncho
but it aint about to rain on me
tryna sing up in this bitch but i aint on key
now i stay genuine im the same old g
