the shit he write down it be so amazin when you read it
but have you ever seen a nigga shot so many times it amazin that he breathin
niggas actin like it aint no afterlife but that shit made you a believer
he need a transfusion but the only one that know his blood type is the pavement where he leakin
you get desperate you say take a pint of mine take it if he needs it
save him and he bleedin
have you ever met death
after my first encounter this alien wouldve been beggin for them to take him to a leader liter
you wouldve been stuck in awe
im not even suppose to be here the ops didnt do they fuckin job
when i got his call i immediately removed the serial from every gun i saw
i thought i hit the lottery
they told me i had a quarter on the card i just knew i was supposed to scratch somethin off
im fuckin off
you in htown today this aint arizona this the spiderverse you miles away
get taped and bound today
he gonna feel right at home when i throw him in the trunk
yeah cause now the alien is out of outerspace
ride around wit ace
you cant phone home and ima drive this joint for you
they say the alien sittin on bars like et ridin right
well its lit from this point forward
do one for me
who this dude truly is thats in blue before me
before i was all in the mix i was a star with the knicks i went ewing on em
switchin loads doin laundry spinnin more and stoppin a civil war you can lose an army
maneuver raw we were movin on him
burnin money i will torture rack and thats why i kept a luger on me
hold up hold up hold up hold up hold up
i said im just tryin to introduce myself to the alien
and if that dont work the first contact gon do it for me
i said i got a few things to call you on cornell powell
why your stories dont involve your dawgs
huh you might keep a pistol akh and a little rock but i really aint sure where you at like the state of arkansas
movin on to war it goes on and on
its on sight aint no on and off
walmart nigga i got a question
have you ever had one of your targets robbed
thats why i never driveby you get walked up on
i learned this from john john the don
i swear to god before i take this shot ima get closer to powell pau than marc gasol
ill mark ya all
i said these ya homies
whoever fuck wit em ima make it so his house isnt fun to be
cause aint none of you niggas safe when shit is up wit me
if im tryin to put rum in a barrel like captain morgans this nigga bet not have a lick of liquor company
who told this bitch to fuck wit me
aint nobody say this yet
you took punchin from  a punch  and a birthday lick and you made it yes
but what i cant respect is a crip that dont give us that feel
which i guess you cant really expect
you do the same exact shit over and over fan duel
you just stick with the safest bet
but you get main events paid respect major checks
but to the next phase of battling goats and greats you aint made it yet
you got one of the biggest fan bases yet you rasheed wallace we dont know shit bout his bitch ass but blazin tecs blaze and techs
i think mris and xrays is next
we dont feel you cause you havent shown nobody where your pain is yet
you remember deontay wilder versus tyson fury
we dont give a fuck how strong the punches are if the audience cant connect
we get paid respect
until then its fuck a punch these feet we usin
fuck a punch ored teeth removin
ill lean a cuz he leakin fluid
fuck a punch til his features ruined
stompin ya man
stompin ya man
this shit look like im startin a band for sweet chin music
it get gruesome every time
when i think about the shit i done did i lose my very mind
i start feelin like travis scott and kendrick lamar houston
i get the goosebumps every time
you punch in battles for oohs and aahs
i punch niggas in real life you can view the scars
you call yourself no let up cuz webb baphomet all that shit is super odd
yeah the only name that fits you is the alien cause you leave earth every battle but dont nobody really know who you are
now rap you bitch ass nigga
say somethin to me
you might also likeround 1 rum nitty
off the rip believe he dyin
a clean sweep 3peat
he got the cheat sheet rhymin
they said the alien sittin on bars like et ridin
nigga i will first 48 and ae ya
stainless nina
shooters will slide in the grayest kia

but if i send 6843 6000843 then i mean goodbye like a pager beeper

12 dump from a shotgun

hit the crib for a minute then im back out the cut like a southside fade
or i might pull up to the house yall stay
known to scheme if you holdin kis
40s squeeze

ace bandages aint enough for the blood splashin
they gonna be fillin ya patna wounds with cotton ballsstuff happens
i did see that one battle you oversnapped
against ty pretty im glad you exposed that man
but you were supposed to smoke his ass
middle of the stage
get pretty in the range pretty  deranged like doja cat
its over facts
closed curtains pole burstin
let six toss nigga better sprint off no service
cold murder pistol whip til amin crack like a stone burger
the shows over
aye when i first heard i hit ace amin i really hit the gym up
i wasnt frontin
i aint duckin nothin
i hit the treadmill runnin runnin
inclines 100 of em
i went from eatin fried pork bellies to stomach crunches
let me ask this muslim somethin
i wonder why you out here tellin people you dont gamble drink alcohol or eat pork
we all know that stuff a lie allah
you wanna die
be careful patna air a chopper
three clap send em right through amin a mean hat like harry potter
prepare for drama
dont get me amped
youll get the hands before you get to trippin fam
this a rival gang an away team wont even get the chance
you goin for ace this ya man
get split in half
pull out them blads like jayz and jigga fan
ive been the champ
you cant keep it real yourself go ahead
round 2 ace amin
i said in battle rap you kill whole families no regard for fuckin kids
in real life you go home to four children and tuck em in
in battle rap you 65 all the toughest niggas run from him
in real life you not even 56 my nigga you the most trusted friend
in battle rap his homies go in drivebys he jumpin in
in real life he jump out the car like tre from boyz n the hood and thats why i cant let ya punchin win
nigga tuck ya chin
i wasnt on his hitlist make this the biggest hit then keep rollin limp bizkit
his homie kg but he dont sell big tickets
he wanted murda got a murderer that dig ditches
sticks lifted
rifle smoke then do the dash with the boat big pimpin
he went from calicoe to ace amin thats a big difference
one nigga he be out this bitch skinny dippin
the other nigga hell put a red dot on ya forehead either way its six bitches
bitch listen i used to have to walk to 1st with free base
id rather get caught layin in somebodys surveillance than layin behind police tape
i keep a big ass broom for this beef you dont wanna win this sweepstakes
cheapskates i had to pick up magazine so i could buy my shoes from eastbay
caught my case in a peak state
fight nights to reach day
nigga you wanted to see the light lyt you was battlin to reach day
when you was in phoenix takin over like jean grey
i was down and out standin out for count
countin down each day
when he dont like what a league say he tag another league page
these weak plays
you got a nigga that complain about a battle drop verse a nigga that didnt complain about a release date
niggas seem fake and you took from nu jerooz style we know what the fuck had happened
a bunch of habits you know the growly voice shaky hands writin like him a bunch of habits
a touch of magic
you get on stage and perform with the dramatics
everybody knows what you did with tworks shit man its so obvious
thats how the fuck this happened
yeah niggas wasnt surprised when we got this call
cause they already know that you stole summer madness
the fuck has happened
nigga hide ya face when you do good in battle rap its your style they decide to take
thats what happens when you establish great value rum just ask ya man elijah strait
you cant hide from ace
before you had all these designer clothes yak man had you fitted like you was signed for sure
for a small check dawg dressin like a 9 year old
cash appeals his whole brand was dyin slow
every battle i watch this nigga with tees from al kapone
now im up here puttin a cig sig in ya shirt cause i hate when niggas advertise and smoke
you was thirsty for the look
for 500 you was the first person that they booked
you shouldve been starin in a mirror
you wouldve been had conceited by now if you was just only worried about ya looks
get 30d by a crook
i said he was a crip that joined writers bloque for five minutes
then was 4th quarter team homi that was a side mission
when he joined efb i had to buy extensions
ima tell you why he different
cause he the type to switch teams like five times
im the type that buy my team five switches
you supposed to lead and not follow
this nigga rum be gettin passed around like everybody put in on a bottle
my foot is on the throttle and you cant touch none
nigga you on everybody battle rap group as a plus one
plus rum dont rap about none of that dumb shit where he come from
hollow gave you a dum dum
robbin niggas the goal was to hit enough licks that you could eventually become one
niggas come from insane but im not the nigga you wanna confront
they put up front you better hope your menll help your mental health after this metal melt ya metal up front
slump somethin
this the nigga that wanna punch with legends verses a nigga thatll really punch one
chkchk i said pump one heavy arms dead site the gun dump
the kick back will kick you back
wherever the fuck you come from
i said niggas lack substance
what the fuck is a punch if it dont impact somethin
nigga listen this the difference
you gifted but you a lazy parent on christmas you dont wrap nothin
ran from it niggas didnt get no tlc like tboz and became mac mack dumpers
fake yola sellin bootleg cola black compass
waitin for a bitch to volunteer and play pat summitt
when i aim this i cant miss shaq dunkin
sold out okc home game pack thunder
fuck punchin back to back
you ever had to fight with your back to back puncher
turn and got ya back punctured by the nigga thats supposed to have ya back puncher
they thought without no shine on this card it was gon be lackluster
they gave a nigga who doesnt drink rum and thought i was gonna know to act sucka
p beasley yall believe in me thanks for havin my back brother
cause this shit is tragic and i know for a fact that none aint have it
i said none aint have it like smack number
i said you punch in battles for oohs and aahs
i punch niggas in real life you can view the scars
no let up baphomet cuz webb all that shit is super odd
only name that fits him is the alien cause he take off in every battle but we dont know who he are
tell him to have a conversation wit yall

rap thats round

round 2 rum nitty
if i pop the trunk you die bro
a lot of guns let a hollow dump ya mind blow
try to bump this 9 show

i give a fuck about that bid you did in that prison in them gates
think he a killer when he aint
you aint tough cause you robbed an armored truck for dead presidents this bitchll lift up from the waist waste
pistol whip all this is finna break
they be stitchin it in place
puttin it together like mike tyson tattoo assembling a symbol in his face
a get to trippin out the gate
i told beas send direct payment this man dead
ima hit the gun sto for an sk and a mac10
vest place and i grab lead
i went tool shoppin like a hardware store then i left ace with a flat head flathead
you past dead
you bout to get all the smoke and take so many punches
the fans yelling get off the ropes
bitch try it its gon be ya last bump like len bias
snap his arm twist tied it get your roll on big time big tymers
tear the rotator cuff thats inside it
just use a lotta strength when you hold it and some body weight somebody wait on the shoulder like a hitch hiker
get did violent violate
snap his neck head to side hangin die mangled
these hands can break down anything amin i mean sign language
9 blaze it
catch a body then i switch it
shoot then put the arm up for a minute sanaa lathan
he tried to play me thats something that he fell short for
you a battler
ace no
rum or a ufc fighter we cant even tell no more
i got a shotgun and a srt you can catch a shell your choice
you gon make me get the sawed off from the demon like hellboy horns
somebody better tell old boy im just destined to be great
in each state on a level that he aint
deadly how we play
stay with it on me testin the heatwave
youll see smoke comin from the nose like an angry emojiwhen the textin a mean tecs in amin face

well really slide by a nigga set
not a computer thug who play gangsta when this 9 fire hit the deck
or a roundll get stuck itll look like itll be lines lyin in your chest
itll look like a pacemaker youre dealin with a live wire in the flesh
bitch you next
you cant keep it real yourself
suicide or ill do the job you decide kill yourself

round 3 ace amin

ace goes up to sheed happens
ayo if he starts rappin like that again punch him in his fuckin face  punch him in his face if he starts rappin like that again punch him in his face punch him aight

let me talk to you for a second bro
talk to you not rum nitty not the fans its cornell

in every time zone and language real is the same
every nigga act like they man fuck that crip you wanna know whats really insane
they say i use a lot of words but i couldnt when they put me in back of the crown
pattin me down the package wasnt found so i stashed the rest in my teeth behind the back of the crown
im mad as shit
but i dont wanna get caught so all i could manage was frowns
if you ever had to hide your own work in ya mouth then you know why a nigga like ace aint never crackin crack in a smile
do you know whats really insane nigga
huh breakin the law
nah i mean breakin the law so much you start to think its a sport
hangin it all on the line til you cant get support
then you end up fightin a case tougher than anybody mayweather fought
when they said i had john john and cortez i started throwin up
flashbacks
what really is insane i thought i was gonna be in the bullpen waitin for cort court
do you know whats really insane nigga
having to fake play crazy so the state time cant take it out of me
watchin the doctors show when they come up to examine me like greys anatomy
fake outbursts a bunch lame profanity
you might know everything i wasnt raised in a gang or family
so you gonna tell me all about the set you claim but you cant tell me nothin about havin to go to court to claim insanity
do you know whats really insane nigga
this the truth
when i went missin last year my sanity went missin too
livin through the weirdest shit hearin shit wakin up like i dont know where this is and i have to fix my mood
in addition to havin to get permission to
wantin to kill myself from people in my head that i never knew
so when you say suicide you decide or you do the job bitch i dont even know which voice to listen to
do you know whats really insane nigga
aye smack we gotta talk a bit
cause your company fast talked me like an auctioneer awful shit
im talkin they said they was gonna help get me in a mental health facility they offered it
kd researched it then they gave me a call said they ran into a problem quick
then beasley sat me down and said hey ace i know we agreed that we was gonna pay for half but now the offer switched
nah it aint one of them type of rounds
they some real niggas instead of payin half them niggas said they gon pay all of it
i know yall convinced that they hold us back and they dont help me out
i told them i needed a battle for my mental health
they booked me for two of em in a row them niggas held me down
see i never said this and never addressed it but everything i ever got here i rapped for
smack is not my blood brother beasley is not my cousin them hatin niggas got that wrong
but them same hatin battle rappers that run with that shit
man they would smack they cousin and call beas they brother just to rap on this platform
i aint got no rap for em
aye smack i know you sick of niggas goin public and your name you cant help defend so ima do it
tell em how many times you moved niggas to new states and you helped em in
smack a lot
ace how many times did you know shit you wasnt supposed to know about niggas and you held it in
how many times did you pay niggas bail and when it was time to pay they debt them niggas bailed again
keep it real my friend
my niggas thats over there headlining max out where did they start
surf with no thirds and subtitles where did it start
jaz virginity don demarco where did it start
niggas act like they dont know who number one is but ima remind yall where the shit start
see the problem is money talks and niggas cant fake their worth
since 2021 url has had 88 events
my nigga you could put nothin in the place of work
but niggas that dont understand value they think spendin money on names is what makes it work
them niggas got a zerox machine they tryin to copy respect but they just gonna run outta paper first
lets make this work
aye smack from here on out we dont fool wit these niggas
we are 100 through with these niggas
i dont care where they from or who went to school wit these niggas
we dont fool wit these niggas

if they got ill words for you ask em who are these niggas
i said you dont even have to speak on it
fuck all the back and forth im just glad that we had this talk
pass the glock show me where arp at ima make all this madness stop
im startin at the top
hammer cocked
ragnarök
blast a shot
damage spots
its like hiroshima aint gonna be no war after i make adam atom drop

i need yall to treat this shit like a fitbit please go home and watch the app
we aint stoppin that
round man

round 3 rum nitty
theyd rather sit back and hate than congratulate
and fabricate like im average and my numbers on the app is fake
but the ones that yall had as great cant match the pace
thats what the statsll say
i can quit rap today
go give my life to god return get a welcome back still be ranked past em ace pastor mae
these facts i state
but you dont gotta speak when your numbers talkin
in corona season we gave yall roof top battles for the low and thats somethin that my brother started
when yall first stopped releasin on youtube and wasnt nothin droppin
i was in go mode
i held the app down for so long i couldve uninstalled it
my app record second to none damn near fuckin flawless
i made that effort you cant compare it to niggas like aces app aap record its a fuckin problem
see what you started you just come with drama
perform then bring out a baby bump who knocked up rihanna
up the chopper try and test me
heater get to sparkin i fire steady
aint nothin sweet about this carbon its a diet pepsi
break down bones in ya features mariah carey
arm shot bones sittin on the outside like mike amiri
you dyin really i can spin it backwards
youll get smoked thinkin shit is a joke i aint with the laughin
catch you right after the event and get to clappin
see if its still humorous humerus outside like an amiri jacket
we really active
i aint even playin no more
a little compact glock with a 30 i snuck it straight through those doors
i aint playin no more
soon as he go for the bump a bumper a stickll sticker get used i got the baby on board
aye thats what the gang is known for
this finna be a bad encounter
certain shit i cant allow it
two piece put you right to sleep thats a downer
grab him slam this coward
whos strong enough to throw ace through a wall i got gambit power
youll get clapped for doubtin
say goodbye
losin hp on the gateway to the gracious sky
the ekg machine like a laptop just pull the plug and acell die
say goodbye
fuckin fool
bust a move
you be actin like you a professional hitman that aint nothin new
but i heard a battle rapper was actin tough and got punked
was it you

ill let a stick blow
get you murdered ditch the burner
im doin life if they catch me
they tryin to give me time for a weapon like the prince of persia
bitch you earned it
