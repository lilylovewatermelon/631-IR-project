i rolled in bumpin 10s into broadway
dirty boots been a workin like a dog day
boot scootin to the juke for some conway
or anything to get my honky tonk on
you walked in cutoffs lookin real skimpy
the hottest thing my side of the mississippi
and i could spin you round and round til i get you dizzy
but you look like you got hillbilly in your bones

chorus
so lets ditch this holeinthewall
mix some sticks with a fifth of homemade alcohol
disappear somewhere with a lower population
i aint sayin that you wanna but if its any consolation
i got a redneck yes i do
i got a redneck how bout you
i got a four by four with a toolbox
just to keep them ole mountains blue
you got a drank youre barely sippin
i got a tank full of paycheck money
im good friends with mason dixon
girl whatcha say we do somethin country

verse 2
ill close thе tab quick
we can go get halflit
hit the rivеr skinny dip or catch a catfish
yeah ill take you to the holler
i aint talking bout a hollow
put some red on the tread
hell ill wash it off tomorrow

so lets ditch this holeinthewall
mix some sticks with a fifth of homemade alcohol
disappear somewhere with a lower population
i aint sayin that you wanna but if its any consolation
i got a redneck yes i do
i got a redneck how bout you
i got a four by four with a toolbox
just to keep them ole mountains blue
you got a drank youre barely sippin
i got a tank full of paycheck money
im good friends with mason dixon
girl whatcha say we do somethin country

bridge
whatcha say whatcha say
we can take a little stroll maybe roll in some hay
whats it gon be whats it gon be
shorty if you wanna get your back forty on with me

chorus
then lets ditch this holeinthewall
mix some sticks with a fifth of homemade alcohol
disappear somewhere with a lower population
i aint sayin that you wanna but if its any consolation
i got a redneck yes i do
i got a redneck how bout you
i got a four by four with a toolbox
just to keep them ole mountains blue
you got a drank youre barely sippin
