parking lot looks like a field growin pickup trucks
people come from miles around just to get a little unwound
i want to drink a little dance a little line them lone stars up

them neon lights shinin bright as diamonds
boots and hats and pearl snaps wall to wall
fiddle singin and cowgirls swingin
keep me comin through them doors
for long neck bottles and honky tonk hardwood floors

soon as i walk in its like i get my second wind
i wanna keep that good time feeling rockin all night long
i cant seem to get enough yall its gotta be in my blood
cause the louder that crowd gets the more i feel at home

well them neon lights shinin bright as diamonds
boots and hats and pearl snaps wall to wall
fiddle singin and cowgirls swingin
keep me comin through them doors
for long neck bottles and honky tonk hardwood floors

yeah i wanna drink a little
i wanna dance a little
i wanna line them lone stars up
see cody johnson liveget tickets as low as 15you might also likewell them neon lights shinin bright as diamonds
boots and hats and pearl snaps wall to wall
fiddle singin and cowgirls swingin
keep me comin through them doors
for them long neck bottles and honky tonk hardwood floors
