you ought to know that i think were one and the same
i dont think we could help it no i dont think we could help it
we dont talk much guess cause nothing has changed
and im not sure i like it and im so tired of fighting

chorus
if i told you youd know how to go and break my heart in two
cause i would anyways wed end up like always
you know me you better show me that you could say it to my face
cause you know were the same theres worse things i can take

verse 2
i know you hate it when theres nothing to say
im not quite sure wеd fix it guess were so usеd to it
wish i had known this from the beginning
wed find it hard to work out why we have all this doubt

chorus
if i told you youd know how to go and break my heart in two
cause i would anyways wed end up like always
you know me you better show me that you could say it to my face
cause you know were the same theres worse things i can takeyou might also like8embed"
