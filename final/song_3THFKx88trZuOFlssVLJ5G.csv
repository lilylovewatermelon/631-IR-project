distant stars
come in black or red
ive seen their worlds
inside my head
they connect
with the fall of man
they breathe you in
then dive as deep as they can

prechorus 1
theres nothing you can do for them
they are the force between
when the sunlight is arising
theres nothing you can say to him
he is in outer heart
and the space has been broken

chorus
its broken
our love
its broken
its broken
our love
its broken

is it far away
in the glitter freeze
or in our eyes
every time they meet
its by the light
of the plasma screens
we keep switched on
all through the night while we sleep

prechorus 2
theres nothing you can do for them
they are the force between
when the sunlight is arising
theres nothing you can say to her
i am without a heart
and the space has been broken

chorus
its broken
our love
its broken
its broken
our love
its broken
its broken
our love
its broken
its broken
our love
its broken27embed"
