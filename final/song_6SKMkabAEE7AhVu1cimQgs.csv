hey hey hey

verse 1
yeah we sleep in cars
oh so far from home
watch the sun go down
on the open road
ive been searching for this
part of my life

then the sun will rise
well be driving slow
watch the kids fly by
on their telephones
ive been racing all my life
and now im free

chorus
well i know i was born for this
every night i dreamt of it
in my hooome
in my hooohome

verse 2
fast the moon approaches
and with hungry eyes
well be lighting torches
well be mesmerized
ive been yearning for this
cover of night
you might also likewhen the stars come out
you are stereo
where we going dear
i dont know

chorus
well i know i was born for this
every night i dreamt of it
in my hooome
in my hooohome

verse 3
we are not lost
were just searching
we are always always searching for
home
hey hey hey

well be going dear
bright lights
i dont know i fear
im paralyzed
im paralyzed

outro
in my hooooome
in my hooohome
and we are not lost
were just searching
we are always always searching for
