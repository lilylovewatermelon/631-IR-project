i am the son and the heir
of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i am the son and the heir
of nothing in particular

chorus
you shut your mouth
how can you say
i go about things the wrong way
i am human and i need to be loved
just like everybody else does

refrain
i am the son and the heir
of a shyness that is criminally vulgar
i am the son and heir of nothing in particular

chorus
you shut your mouth
how can you say
i go about things the wrong way
i am human and i need to be loved
just like everybody else does

interlude
theres a club if youd like to go
you could meet somebody who really loves you
so you go and you stand on your own
and you leave on your own
and you go home and you cry and you want to die

when you say its gonna happen now
when exactly do you mean
see ive already waited too long
and all my hope is gone

chorus
you shut your mouth
how can you say
i go about things the wrong way
i am human and i need to be loved
just like everybody else does1embed"
