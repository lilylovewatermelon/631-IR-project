you know i find it hard to sleep when
im sleeping by myself
and i’m lying in the spare room
thinking i should be somewhere else
you should know when weve been drinking
we can sabotage ourselves
like smashing up the kitchen
now theres nothing that seems to help

prechorus
and i don’t want to wake you up
tell you that im leaving town
i already packed my stuff
cant go back now
but the way you look brings me straight back down
i dont want to wake you up right now

chorus
i was ready to go ready to go
i dont want to wake you up right now
i was ready to go ready to go
i dont want to wake you up right now

verse 2
youre breaking out the windows
while i was tearing down the doors
and now im picking up the ashtray
that you threw against the wall
’cause we take and we take just a little more
i have no idea what we’re fighting for
no were standing right here outside your door
now i know now i know

and i don’t want to wake you up
tell you that im leaving town
i already packed my stuff
cant go back now
but the way you look brings me straight back down
i dont want to wake you up right now

chorus
i was ready to go ready to go
i don’t want to wake you up right now
i was ready to go ready to go
i dont want to wake you up right now

cause i cant live with you i cant live without you
you feel like home you feel like home
cause i cant live with you i cant live without you
you feel like home you feel like home

i dont want to wake you up right now
