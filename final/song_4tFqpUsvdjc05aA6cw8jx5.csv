broken down on the side of the road
itd be nice if you could help me out
i drove for miles to the place i was told
i could find you in the shadow of doubt

prechorus ryan merchant  soseh
but you werent there i was there
you werent there i was there

chorus ryan merchant
chasing you
its the only thing i want to do
but now im facing you
what the hell am i supposed to do

verse 2 ryan merchant  soseh
is it foolish to follow the rules
when everybodys following you
you gave directions that make no sense
and now im fucking stuck in a loop

prechorus ryan merchant  soseh
but you werent there i was there
you werent there i was there

chasing you
its the only thing i want to do
but now im facing you
what the hell am i supposed to do

verse 3 soseh
you must think im a mannequin
because i only come alive in my sunday best
but somehow im on the run again
so you probably shouldnt hold your breath
dont train yourself to be a fool
i only want to stick around if you pass the test
dont cross the line stop chasing time
cause in time youll find that iiim just
chasing you
chasing you

chorus ryan merchant
chasing you
its the only thing i want to do
but now im facing you
what the hell am i supposed to do

chorus ryan merchant
im chasing you
its the only thing i want to do
but now im facing you
what the hell am i supposed to do
