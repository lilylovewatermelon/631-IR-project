beat me up beat me down
mess me up beyond all recognition
for what its worth id do it again
with no consequence i will do it again
hard up so hunt me down down down
jump the gun bust a cap hit the ground

verse 2
yo yo yo word
my dignitys never returned
perceived like a big fat jerk
ive been silly but not absurd
criminal thats what i herd
thinking thoughts thats most impure
no efforts expenditured
im just that soup de jour’d

chorus
on the fence the consequence
what do they know about that
on the track ahead of the pack
what do they know about that
im quite impressed im quite a mess
