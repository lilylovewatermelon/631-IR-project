just take it easy dont worry about a thing these days mistake

and i i have been learning

verse 2
to just to let it all go and stay quiet when i feel like speaking
my mind done whatever it is i need to make clear and just say

sticking around and if we should pay
tied down im looking around
and i know what i want so dont hold me down
