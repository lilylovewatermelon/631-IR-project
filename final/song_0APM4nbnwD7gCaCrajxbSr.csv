i don’t feel much like starting now
walking now lonely has worked like a charm
i’m the only one i have to let down

but watching you makes me think that that is wrong

i can go on with my insecure nature
i can keep living off sympathy
i can tell all the people that all of their success
is a direct reflection on me

but watching you makes me think that that is wrong

what is important what’s really important
am i not to know by my name
will i ever know silence without mental violence
will the ringing at night go away

it’s up to you my father call on me

i haven’t finished a thing since i started my life
i don’t feel much like starting now

i haven’t finished a thing since i started my lifesee the avett brothers liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likeembed"
