intro 50 cent
yeah lets take em back
uhhuh

verse 1 50 cent
coming up i was confused my mommy kissing a girl
confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
daddy aint around probably out committing felonies
my favorite rapper used to sing check check out my melody
i wanna live good so shit i sell dope
for a four finger ring one of them gold ropes
nana told me if i passed id get a sheepskin coat
if i can move a few packs id get the hat now thatd be dope
tossed and turned in my sleep that night
woke up the next morning niggas had stole my bike
different day same shit aint nothing good in the hood
id run away from this bitch and never come back if i could

chorus 50 cent  the game
hate it or love it the underdogs on top
and im gon shine homie until my heart stop
go head envy me im raps mvp
and i aint going nowhere so you can get to know me
hate it or love it the underdogs on top
and im gon shine homie until my heart stop
go head envy me im raps mvp
and i aint going nowhere so you can get to know me

on the grill of my lowrider
guns on both sides right above the gold wires
ill fofive em kill a nigga on my song
and really do it thats the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 gs will take your daughter out her air forces
believe you me homie i know all about losses
im from compton wear the wrong colors be cautious
one phone call ill have your body dumped in marcy
i stay strapped like car seats
been bangin since my lil nigga rob got killed for his barkleys
thats 10 years i told pooh in 95
ill kill you if you try me for my air max 95s
told banks when i met him ima ride
and if i gotta die id rather homicide
i aint have 50 cent when my grandmama died
now im going back to cali
with my jacob on see how time fly

chorus 50 cent  the game
hate it or love it the underdogs on top
and im gon shine homie until my heart stop

bridge 50 cent
from the beginning to the end
losers lose winners win
this is real we aint got to pretend
the cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
enough of me nigga now listen to game

verse 3 the game
used to see fiveo throw the crack by the bench
now im fuckin with 50 its all starting to make sense
my moms happy she aint gotta pay the rent
and she got a red bow on that brand new benz
waiting on sha money to land sitting in the range
thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
when theres kids starvin
pac is gone and brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
i wanna know whats going on like i hear marvin
no schoolbooks they used that wood to build coffins
whenever im in the booth and i get exhausted
i think what if marie baker got that abortion i love you ma

chorus 50 cent  the game
