you dont know how bad
i wish i was home
cant wait to get back
but while im gone yall carry on

chorus
drink one for me for all the old times
we tore up that town raised hell alright
tell the boys thanks for having my back
some of the best memories ive ever had
so go on and get crazy
and drink one for me

verse 2
i cant count the miles
it just feels so far
and it could be a while
til im where you are so keep me in your heart

chorus
drink one for me for all the old times
we tore up that town raised hell alright
tell the boys thanks for having my back
some of the best memories ive ever had
so go on and get crazy
