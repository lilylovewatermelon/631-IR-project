its never enough to say im sorry
its never enough to say i care
but im caught between what you wanted from me
and knowing that if i give that to you
i might just disappear

and i i cant change your mind
i know its like trying to turn around on a one way street
i cant give you what you want
and its killing me
and i im starting to see
maybe were not meant to be
