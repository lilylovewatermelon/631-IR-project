verse 2
tell me somethin
you mothafuckas cant tell me nothin
id rather die than to listen to you
my dna not for imitation
your dna an abomination
this how it is when you in the matrix
dodgin bullets reapin what you sow
and stackin up the footage livin on the go
and sleepin in a villa
sippin from a grammy walkin in the buildin
diamond in the ceilin marble on the floors
beach inside the window peekin out the window
baby in the pool godfather goals
only lord knows ive been goin hammer
dodgin paparazzi freakin through the cameras
eat at four daughters brock wearin sandals
yoga on a monday stretchin to nirvana
watchin all the snakes curvin all the fakes
phone never on i dont conversate
i dont compromise i just penetrate
sex money murder—these are the breaks
these are the times level number nine
look up in the sky ten is on the way
sentence on the way killings on the way
motherfucker i got winners on the way
you aint shit without a body on your belt
you aint shit without a ticket on your plate
you aint sick enough to pull it on yourself
you aint rich enough to hit the lot and skate
tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
gonna be your fate gonna be our faith
peace to the world let it rotate
sex money murder—our dna
