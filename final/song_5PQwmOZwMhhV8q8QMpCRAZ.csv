i was born and raised
as an eastern girl in a western world
i was told to choose
to choose to be what i chose to be
speaking impartially
there doesnt seem to be a place for me
but when i look inside i find
a place to run to hide

verse 2
i was born to love
a distant land and a rising sun
i was born to love this
green and pleasant land
which way should i turn
cos i seem to fall towards burning
but when i look inside i find the place
to cry to fly to die

chorus
you and i born as fools now
you and i think think we rule now

verse 3
now i see the world
as an ancient place as a smiling face
i can choose to be
what i want to be if i choose to be
speaking impartially
if the smile grows cold without me
i know a secret place to cry to fly to die to try
you might also likebridge
you know im burning in a flame now
you know

verse 4
now i see the world
as an ancient place as a smiling face
now i see the world
as a place where i can run to hide to
which way should i turn
cos i seem to fall towards burning
but when i look inside i find the place
to try to hide to fly

chorus
you and i born as fools now
you and i think think we rule now
you and i born as fools now
you and i think think we rule now

outro
i will burn
i am falling
i feel the world burning
