e equals mc squared
i got a blimp inside my head
flew over the cuckoos nest
the lights are on but theres no one here
puffing with the dragons
im livin for the thrill formula
screws loose on a monday
screws loose wheres the propane
screws loose tell em
screws loose tell em
screws loose tell em
im livin for the thrill formula tell em
puffing with the dragons
screws loose tell em
im livin for the thrill formula screws loose
