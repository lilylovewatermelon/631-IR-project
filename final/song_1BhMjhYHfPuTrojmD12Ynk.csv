ol switcherooass bitch made motherfuckers just be friends
outlaw nigga westside throw it up
hahaha had love for em but why you turnin on me
why me westside how you do it boy

verse 1 2pac
i went from nothin to somethin now they all wanna see me fallin
and the player haters hate to see a thug nigga ballin
they say we hate the east coast but thats funny
got a lot of love for any nigga gettin money
i made a song about my enemies and niggas tripped
it was hiphop until 2pac fucked biggie bitch
yall niggas hypocrites and bitch made
now either love me or hate me but real thug niggas get paid
have me catchin cases all across the nation
i went from jail to bail to barely on probation
they got a player facin three strikes
and we might just blast god bless the child that can get cash
but all these niggas turnin and never learn
got a long line of niggas player hatin me but gettin burned
talk a lot of shit but yous a trick in drag
like the mac make you fall back and stick yo ass for back stab

hook yusef sharid  2pac2

it started so innocent but ended in the fifth precinct
although two juvenile delinquents we still decent
playin catch and kiss used to diss the herbs
fuck school we was skippin drink a fifth on the curb
me and you no closer two while drinkin brew
what you need nigga anything at all come to me nigga
you can wear my clothes and my gold for the hoes
gave you the keys to the jeep offered my home as an open door
but then you picked a new direction in the blink of an eye
my time away just made perfection did you think id die
i never got a single visit yet i carry on
all my old friends too busy now my money gone
said i got raped in jail picture that ​laughter​
revenge is a payback bitch get ya gat
fuck ​wendy williams​ and i pray you choke
on the next dick down your throat
for turnin on me
