the little things you do to me are
taking me over i wanna show you
everything inside of me oh
like a nervous heart that is crazy beating

prechorus 1
my feet are stuck here against the pavement
i wanna break free i wanna make it
closer to your eyes get your attention
before you pass me by

back up back up take another chance
dont you mess up mess up
i dont wanna lose you
wake up wake up
this aint just a thing that you give up give up
dont you say that id be
better off better off sleeping by myself and wondering
if im better off better off without you boy
