chorus
i aint worryin bout no fucking i aint worried bout no fucking
does sexing on the late night mean that much to you
my love dont mean that much to you
fucking these hoes meant too damn much to you
i just hope when you fucking on that nigga when you finished
he can say that he love you
now do you feel better bout yourself
do you feel better by yourself
did you feel better when i left
mark my words ima ball without you
i came home last night to a ménage
got my dick sucked and i was thinking about you
i was fucking on a slut and i was thinking about you
when you fucking on that nigga hope you thinking about me
when you laying with that nigga hope you thinking about me
cause im thinking about you

verse 2
i want you to fuck him in paradise
cause i wanna be in your head tonight
if loving me in public aint safe
you can take my love and hide it
dont give up on me today
hold on to me like a true love
i told you it was a true love
i ended up with temptations
you goin out the country
you posting up on ig
im laid up with my sidepiece
the one that text while you was right there laying up beside me
now tell me you dont want me
tell me that the pussy aint mines no more
tell me you moving on and you dont love me no more
