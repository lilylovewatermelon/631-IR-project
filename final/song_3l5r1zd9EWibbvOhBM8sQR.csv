back in the day when it was a dream
nobody believed in what i could be
but now im laughin at em like hahaha
cause ima be okay
back in the day when it was a dream
nobody believed in what i could be
but now im laughin at em like hahaha
cause ima be okay

verse 1
i used to have a dream now it seem that ima live it in real life
gettin free jeans good weed feelin real nice
used to think that i was too short or too dumb
just a newcomer to the game tryna do somethin
used to runnin after ice cream trucks
but now i just stroll lac–µ my nikes up
im a nice clean cut good lookin individual
fillin up a notebook with rhymes when i be in the school
learn quick that nobody here invincible
we feel big but in reality we minuscule
try and make a million bucks before i reach my pinnacle
supernova status from basically invisible
growin up thinkin it was cool to be a criminal
until i saw a couple homies go down
see now that isnt me or anything im finna be
i want the money cars hoes clothes a kid can dream
i used to talk to girls that wasnt even into me
now they hit me up wantin intimacy
but nah i got a girl and she down for me
my little juliet chillin on the balcony
if i need it she gon run a hundred miles for me
love me for me not who im bout to be
and if they didnt believe then i can do without em
cause at the end of the day im just malcolm

verse 2
just a little snotty nose tryna find his pot of gold
stayin up late on the phone always callin hoes
never thought id blow no one took me serious
now they see me walkin down the street like oh there he is
as a kid anything was possible
but mama knows the hottest flow dont put me on the honor roll
grades started slippin the classes i be skippin
tried to tell me that i was a fool i wouldnt listen no
as a youngin i was playin pretend
my wonder years never woulda thought they could end
back back in my glory days way before the haze
a good night sleep had me energized for the day
when i would look up at the planets in they orbit
before this life got distorted
before the money was a plan
before i ever thought that i would need to be a man
somethin like a peter pan nah i aint tryna grow up
cause bein old sucks i just wanna go nuts
before i drank a beer or ever took a hit of weed
when entertainment was my moms readin mysteries
takin you back to them nursery rhymes
when i thought the world just deserved to be mine
said im takin you back to them nursery rhymes
back to the beginning put the verse in rewind
chorus
back in the day when it was a dream
nobody believed in what i could be

cause ima be okay
back in the day when it was a dream
nobody believed in what i could be
but now im laughin at em like hahaha
cause ima be okay
