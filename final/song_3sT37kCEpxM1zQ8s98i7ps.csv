certified thick by the fda
certified rich like your sugar daddy
i’m just tryna clout sharpay evans in this bitch
now where my troy at gabriella in the ditch

verse 1
hey it’s shargay evans is the last name
people claim we’re all in this together
i say eff these hoes getcha head in the game
fbi banging on my back door
handcuffs what about my encore
they sat me down to say your’e certified thick by us government
when i drop it low they like oh shit
doing so well like “is that brad pitt”
ive never done drugs but i’m high as shit
gabriella i left your man on read
missed call from you as well i’m not joining your pyramid scheme
i’m busy counting these racks
like paula deen

chorus
line round the block won’t let you in unless you slick
i could be in a room of 10s and still be crowned queen thick
i’m just tryna clout sharpay evans in this bitch
screw troy where’s chad at
oh he’s with ryan oh okay
certified thick thick

not trying to be loud just want it to be known who’s the queen bee
my haters looking like gabriella montez bitch science geeks
now that i’ve bopped it to the top my bank account be breaking free
this ain’t the start of something new you peaked in high school thats the tea
the spotlight loves me not even trying to be a drama queen
these dudes be married but theyre in my dms like want a piece
thought i had fans cause of talent turns out it’s just cause my ass fat
famous cause i’m hot but no filler my lips just look like that

chorus
line round the block won’t let you in unless you slick
i could be in a room of 10s and still be crowned queen thick
i’m just tryna clout sharpay evans in this bitch
now wheres my troy at i kinda feel like he wants to hit it
certified thick thick
certified rich rich

were thick

bye bitch
verse 3
aint giving it up unless my man chads at the door
at this point i don’t even give it to troy no more
gabby keeps texting me drunk saying she wants to sexually explore
fuck the fame for real that better be chad at the door
pucker up bitch cause sharpay got a mother fucking 40 inch waist
ass fat eat it up like frosted flakes
aint no stripper but i’ll bust it open for that dude in florida
give him what he wants then he gives me the money its so adorable

chorus
line round the block won’t let you in unless you slick
i could be in a room of 10s and still be crowned queen thick
i’m just tryna clout sharpay evans in this bitch

and ill make you rich
certified thick thick
