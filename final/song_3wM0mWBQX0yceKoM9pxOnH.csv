chorus
how many drugs you gon mix thats three
how many sluts you miss thats none
how many racks you gon put in her purse
how she get lipstick on yo gun
shit aint been the same since you followed that hearse
how you got pain spillin from yo cup

verse
tighten up boy ayy
you gon cut him off but it aint that deep
get the last word but shit thats me
i was popping xans like twenty a week
mama just prayin im somewhere asleep
i aint ever had shit before i rap
so i talk cash shit on these beats
you dont sell drugs why you sleep in the trap
ridin my brothers round when i sleep
i dont trust nobody but that home
efg rip pop free lo
and im with a diva she like to
why i see a demon at one of my shows
damn leave it up to me yo assll be gone
leavе it up to me ill never bе wrong
why she keep peepin to see my phone
aint shit a nut but drank and percs
never love an addict but we made it work
know you did me right when i speak in circles
never drunk act but im chasin purple
spent everything cause im really rich
took it to the net cause he really a bitch
you aint got heart but you proud of me
drink in the bentley like cmg
now we dont speak but she in reach
too much trauma took three to sleep
youll be a ex if you leave it to me cant let em down cause my people with me
and they made a way but its deeper than me
