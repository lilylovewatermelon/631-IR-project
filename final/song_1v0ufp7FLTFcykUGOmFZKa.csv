run your fingers down the cool
underbelly of the blue evening
crank that vaporwagon
start that kick dragon beating
step out on the patio
follow where your daddyos leading

verse 2 kevin parker
wrestle with our shadow twins
hold em till theyre glowin in warning
hit that bubble kit now
laughin as you breathe out easy
drop another daffodil
we can push on through till morning
drop another daffodil
sail off the map until morning

instrumental break

verse 3 kevin parker
baby just say no to sleep
bodies got to keep exploring
sweet volcano violence
vast new continents spawning
drop another daffodil
we can push on through till morning
drop another daffodil
sail right off the map until morning

verse 4 kevin parker
put another record on
maybe chaka khan or rocky
catch on fire above the
green empire of the kraken
flow with the isosceles
to the beat of six knees knocking

outro kevin parker
drop another daffodil
we can push on through till morning
drop another daffodil
sail right off the map until morning
