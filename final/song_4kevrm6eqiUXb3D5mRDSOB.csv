i dont wanna take my mind off you
please take me home and kiss me slow
and do anything you want to
run your hand through my hair
its okay to be rough
im a little bit tougher
than all of your other girlfriends

chorus
but youre not allowed
shes got you under lock and chain
too late to let her down
so youre not allowed
what a shame it would be if you left her now
now

verse 2
i dont wanna take my mind off you
please make me laugh and kiss me back
and do everything you want to
push me up against the wall
its okay to be rough
i can handle this stuff
only if youre comfortable

but youre not allowed
shes got you under lock and chain
too late to let her down
so youre not allowed
what a shame it would be if you left her now
