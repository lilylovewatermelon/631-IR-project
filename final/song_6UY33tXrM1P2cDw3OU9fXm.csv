memorial day came and went again
and i feel the same
how much youve changed

verse 1
and ive heard all about
where youve been
how you are now
but im still remembering
last years parade
crowded streets left me with
a longing for nothing more

chorus
memorial day came and went again
and i feel the same
how much youve changed

verse 2
and ill let you take a stab at me
maybe then youll know what i mean
last years streets at summers end
left me with a longing for something more
ill let you take a stab at me
ill let you take a stab at meyou might also likeembed"
