obstacles runnin round dodgin these obstacles
because i know i got a lot to lose
dont care if it hurts just tell the truth
i promise i wont be mad at you
thats on everything you say its factual
countin blessings gotta equal my gratitude
wake up gettin money do what i gotta do
never switch up on the gang thats constitute
tell a lie on the gang thats treason
niggas woke up feelin different switch for no reason
niggas they be switchin man quicker than the seasons
