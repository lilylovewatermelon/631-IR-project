every christmas
its always the same
im still here waiting praying for you to finally come my way
its been so long
since ive seen your face
if santa cared for me at all then you wouldnt be
so so far away

prechorus
santa isnt listening no
and im losing hope
oh god if it isnt too much
please bring my baby home

chorus
every christmas
counting the days
maybe this year will be different
and i wont be be alone again
under the mistletoe
let it snow
come on home
every christmas ill wait

verse 2
oh every christmas
i turn on all the lights
and i make a fire so maybe the smoke can clear
that youre home tonight
but i just dont know i dont know
well know deep inside deep inside
i know that you should be here but i feel
were running running out of time

every christmas
counting the days
maybe this year will be different
and i wont be be alone again
under the mistletoe
let it snow
come on home

under the mistletoe
let it snow
come on home
every christmas ill wait
every christmas
