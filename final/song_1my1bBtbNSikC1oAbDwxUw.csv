losing the track of the time
confused in a sun covered life

birdsong is all i hear while i am here
im lost but cannot see these things i feel
circles appear in my mind
floating through space and through time

you might feel laughter in the sun
but laughter might help us when were done
you might feel laughter in the sun
but laughter might help us when were done

silhouetted by the sun my anel comes
dressed in white
a broad wide smile outshines the sun
oh such a picture this is
my angel dhe stoops for a kiss

you might feel laughter in the sun
but laughter might help us when were done
you might feel laughter in the sun
but laughter might save us when were done
i said you might feel laughter in the sun
but laughter might save us when were done
you might feel laughter in the sun
but laughter might save us when were doneyou might also likeembed"
