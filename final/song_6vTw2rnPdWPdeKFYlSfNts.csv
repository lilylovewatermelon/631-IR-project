you you

verse 1
tell me how has it taken so long for me to open up my eyes
as i feel you now i wont fall for the things youve said before
how has it taken so long for me to finally realize
im in my team they wont run away but back tto believe
and when they all turn against you you better be prepared to fight

chorus
they say im a sinner
but nobody knows
you only do what youre told
you better hope that youre right
they say im a sinner
im not the only one
you want to point your finger
you better make a choice tonight
cause ill stand up for what is right

verse 2
how has such a bitter person become the man i am
im tearing my heart out just give me the time
tell me how
how am i to change when im still trying to figure out how
how to save my life save me so save me how to be saved
and when they all turn against you
try not to look the other way
