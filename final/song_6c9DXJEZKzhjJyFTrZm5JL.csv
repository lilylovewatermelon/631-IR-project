where all dreams we make
theres a place we once knew
something old something true
to just spend all day
going back that way
now the days go so fast
give me time give me past

and i know
its been so long
since we were children of the sun
so we go

lay our heads down on the green
like when we were young
see the world up from the trees
like when we were young
memories memories

how id love to find
that old place of mine
feel the afternoon glow
something warm something slow
but our minds got small
when our legs grew tall
and our eyes dont see right
give me soul give me sight
see the paper kites liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likeand i know
its been so long
since we were children of the sun
so we go

lay our heads down on the green
like when we were young
see the world up from the trees
like when we were young
memories memories

on the green
on the greenembed"
