set your clock back looking at the map
wondering where you be at
cause its so bad when youre not around
youre never around
it used to be you and me holding hands smoldering
kicking up leaves talking about getting older
but now youre not around

prechorus 1
therell never be a rhyme or reason
for when it rolls around to this season
when all the leaves start their turning
and you start to burn again in my brain

chorus
im falling for you im falling
i cant forget you now its cold and
all of the leaves on all of the trees
are falling with me down to the ground and
im falling for you

verse 2
youre like a good book
snuggled up on the sofa when its raining outside
but im warm cause i feel you around
but youre so outta town
i kinda wanna call
but i bet that youre busy with that fancy new job
and the fall wont affect you like how
it makes me feel now
you might also likeprechorus 2
octobers so overwhelming
and all of my friends they tell me
november it should get better
but i still see you all over the place

chorus
im falling for you im falling
i cant forget you now its cold and
all of the leaves on all of the trees
are falling with me down to the ground and
im falling im falling

bridge
oh you are like sunshine with a chance of rain
i love the cool crisp air
and i dont care if youre near cause i feel you
like youre here
youre everywhere

chorus
im falling for you im falling
i cant forget you now its cold and
all of the leaves on all of the trees
are falling with me down to the ground and
im falling im falling
im falling for you2embed"
