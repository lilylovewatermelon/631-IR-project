dont talk dont say a thing
cause your eyes they tell me more than your words
dont go dont leave me now
cause they say the best way out is through

bridge
and i am short on words knowing whats occurred
she begins to leave because of me

chorus
her bag is now much heavier
i wish that i could carry her
but this is our ungodly hour

verse 2
and i know youre leaving now
cause i held on to my way tightly
stay still until you know
tomorrow finds the best way out is through

bridge
and i am short on words knowing whats occurred
she begins to leave because of me

chorus
her bag is now much heavier
i wish that i could carry her
but this is our ungodly hour
