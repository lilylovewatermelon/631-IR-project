verse 1
im way too intelligent
to play with my intelligence
what you tryna tell me what im sayings not relevant
still represent
cause ima represent
3 bands for a 9 piece chicken dinner
young bounce right back like a rubberband
bought a whip look yall
no hands
topless stop this
wheres your roof
all this nonsense
theres no use
married to the game
yeah we just got a load
depending on the shipment
we might need a boat
im talking big money
anybody own a bank
had to switch up the style
they was on to the tank

verse 2
used to bet on all hiphop
young killed hiphop
dont you know this dumb nigga still talking crack rocks
got everybody following him
does that make him a leader
does that mean he needs to get indicted
just to make you a believer
if thats the case
then i really do apoligize
that i memorize
that i fantasized
that i visualized
that i strategize
1 false move will get your ass penalized
you cant be serious
what if pac was hearing this
you bullshitting me
im sure biggie would agree
if he had to pass the torch
then that bitch would go to me
now wouldnt you agree
it doesnt matter i accept
hook

verse 3
you ever seen a blue rolls
caught in the black grass
nigga go broke
and invest in a black mask
entrepreneur
he found him a new craft
a round of applause
congratulate that nigga
cause when he get rich
you gon hate that nigga
i bet the haters try they best
try to break that nigga
fly
how fly
fly
how fly
fly
how fly
flyyyy
