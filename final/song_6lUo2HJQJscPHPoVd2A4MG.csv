hey i wanna crawl out of my skin
apologize for all my sins
all the things i should have said to you
hey i cant make it go away
over and over in my brain again
all the things i should have said to you

chorus
counting stars wishing i was okay
crashing down was my biggest mistake
i never ever meant to hurt you
i only did what i had to
counting stars again

verse
hey ill take this day by day by day
under the covers im okay i guess
lifes too short and i feel small

chorus
counting stars wishing i was okay
crashing down was my biggest mistake
i never ever meant to hurt you
i only did what i had to
counting stars again
