for me its a beach bar
or on a boat underneath the stars
or with my band up on a stage
for a while everythings okay
for some its a fast car
moonshine in a mason jar
and everybody has their way
somehow to escape

chorus
reality yeah sometimes life
it is not all that its cracked up to be
so lets take a chance and live this fantasy
because everybody needs to break free from reality yeah yeah

verse 2
yeah some days its a bitch its a bummer
we need a rock and roll show in the summer
to let the music take us away
take our minds to a better place
where we feel that sense of freedom
leave our worries behind we dont need them
all we need is a sunny day and an old tailgate
and well escape
