flesh and blood

beside a singin mountain stream
where the willow grew
where the silver leaf of maple
sparkled in the morning dew
i braided twigs of willows
made a string of buckeye beads
but flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
and youre the one i need
flesh and blood need flesh and blood
and youre the one i need

i leaned against a bark of birch
and i breathed the honey dew
i saw a northbound flock of geese
against a sky of baby blue
beside the lily pads
i carved a whistle from a reed
mother natures quite a lady
but youre the one i need
flesh and blood needs flesh and blood
and youre the one i need

a mockingbird sang just for me
and i thanked him for the song
then the sun went slowly down the west
and i had to move along
these were some of the things
on which my mind and spirit feed
but flesh and blood need flesh and blood
and youre the one i need
flesh and blood need flesh and blood
and youre the one i need

i was still not satisfied
i knew evrything i touched
would wither and one day die
and love was all that would remain
and grow from all these seed
flesh and blood need flesh and blood
and youre the one i need
flesh and blood need flesh and blood
and youre the one i need4embed"
