every second every minute man i swear that she can get it

hands up high hands up high
tell em dim the lights down right now put me in the mood
im talkin bout dark room perfume
go go

verse 1 kendrick lamar
i recognize your fragrance hol up you aint never gotta say shit uh
and i know your taste is a little bit mmm high maintenance uh
everybody else basic you live life on an everyday basis
with poetic justice poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it
i mean i write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
youre in the mood for empathy theres blood in my pen
better yet where your friends and em i really wanna know you all
i really wanna show you off fuck that pour up plenty
of champagne cold nights when you curse this name
you called up your girlfriends and yall curled in that little bitty range i heard that
she wanna go and party she wanna go and party
nigga dont approach her with that atari nigga that aint good game homie sorry
they say conversation rule a nation i can tell
but i could never right my wrongs less i write it down for real ps

i really hope you play this cause oh girl you test my patience
with all these seductive photographs and all these oneoff vacations
youve been takin clearly a lot for me to take in it dont make sense
young east african girl you too busy fuckin witcha other man
i was tryna put you on game put you on a plane take you and your momma to the motherland i could do it
maybe one day when you figure out youre gonna need someone
when you figure out its alright here in the city and you dont run from where we come from
that sound like poetic justice poetic justice
you were so new to this life but goddamn you got adjusted
i mean i write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress ooh
good god what you doin that walk for
when i see that thing move i just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
they say communication save relations i can tell
but i can never right my wrongs unless i write em down for real ps

verse 3 kendrick lamar
every time i write these words they become a taboo
makin sure my punctuation curve every letter heres true
livin my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof im talkin
poetic justice poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room would you trust it
i mean you need to hear this love is not just a verb
its you lookin in the mirror love is not just a verb
its you lookin for it maybe call me crazy we can both be insane
a fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
i mean you need to hear this love is not just a verb
and i can see power steerin sex drive when you swerve
i want that interference its coherent i can hear it mhmm
thats your heartbeat it either caught me or it called me mhmm
read slow and youll find gold mines in these lines
sincerely yours truly and right before you go blind ps

chorus kendrick lamar  janet jackson
anytime
you can get it you can get it you can get it you can get it
and i know just know just know just know just know just what you want
poetic justice put it in a song
