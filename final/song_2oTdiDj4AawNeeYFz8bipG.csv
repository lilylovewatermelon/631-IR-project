things we lost to the flames
things well never see again
all that we have amassed
sits before us shattered into ash

chorus
these are the things the things we lost
the things we lost in the fire fire fire
these are the things the things we lost
the things we lost in the fire fire fire

verse 1

down the backs of table tops ticket stubs and your diaries
i read them all one day when loneliness came and you were away
oh they told me nothing new but i love to read the words you use

chorus
these are the things the things we lost
the things we lost in the fire fire fire
these are the things the things we lost
the things we lost in the fire fire fire

the futures in our hands and we will never be the same again
