verse 1
waiting in the car
waiting for a ride in the dark
at night the city grows
look at the horizon glow

instrumental bridge

verse 2
waiting in the car
waiting for a ride in the dark
drinking in the lights
following the neon signs
waiting for a word word
looking at the milky skyline skyline
the city is my church the city is my church
it wraps me in its blinding twilight twilight

instrumental bridge

outro
waiting in the car
waiting for the ride in the dark
waiting in the car waiting in the car
waiting for the ride in the dark ride in the dark
waiting in the car car
waiting for the ride in the dark
waiting in the car waiting in the car
waiting for the ride in the dark
waiting in the car waiting in the car
waiting for the ride in the dark
