she said i dressed in your favâ€”
chorus
say what you need so you can get what you want get what you want
because it really doesnt matter if you think nobodys watching
you would do it too cause youre just like us
dont you play the role and disappoint all of the people who adore you
or you can run away from here right now
and take me with you
they wont know where to look for you cause
they dont know anything about you

verse
i think i know what you mean but watch what you say
cause theyll be tryin to knock you down in some way
i keep a couple of feet between everybody and me
you like to take em away and attempt to ruin my day
and it feels like love feels like love
and it seems like fate seems like
but we wont know we wont
youre away

chorus
say what you need so you can get what you want

or you can run away from here right now
and take me with you
they wont know where to look for you cause
