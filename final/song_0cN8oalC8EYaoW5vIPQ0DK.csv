im so nervous it shakes the fingertips that are coursing through your hair
with these lovely lips that are made to kiss you know you put me in a spin
youve got the body of a goddess
youve got the moves that make me sweat
youve got a voice that makes me breathless

chorus
girl ive got you
under a spell and i dont think ill be letting you out
ive got you
if this is heaven then baby i dont want to know hell

verse 2

the thoughts shes thinking i know im not worthy
i know what i need to sweep her off her feet
she knows the work will damn near kill me

chorus
girl ive got you
under a spell and i dont think ill be letting you out
ive got you
if this is heaven then baby i dont want to know hell

chorus
ive got you
under a spell and i dont think ill be letting you out
ive got you
if this is heaven then baby i dont want to know hell
