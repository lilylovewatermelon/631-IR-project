verse 1
walking out into the dark cutting out a different path
lead by a beating heart
all the people of the town cast their eyes right to the ground
in matters of the heart

prechorus
the night was all you had
you ran into the night from all you had
found yourself a path up on the ground
you ran into the night you cant be found

chorus
but this is your heart
can you feel it can you feel it
pumps through your veins
can you feel it can you feel it

verse 2
summer evening breezes blew drawing voices deep from you
lead by your beating heart
what a year and what a night what terrifying final sights
put out your beating heart

the night was all you had
you ran into the night from all you had
found yourself a path up on the ground
you ran into the night you cant be found

chorus
but this is your heart
can you feel it can you feel it
pumps through your veins
can you feel it can you feel it

if you had your gun
would you shoot it at the sky why
to see where it would fall
or will you come down at all
if you had your gun
would you shoot it at the sky why
to see where your bullet would fall
or will you come down at all

chorus
this is your heart
can you feel it can you feel it
pumps through your veins
can you feel it can you feel it
this is your racing heart
can you feel it can you feel it
pumps through your veins
can you feel it can you feel it118embed"
