verse 1 bob
yeah they wanna taste that rapper life
but the road of fame usually spoils the appetite
we live the type of dreams you wish for in the afterlife
but all that they can see is velvet ropes and flashing lights
huh not everything is lavished life
but in the mirror all i see is all the nights i had to fight
and so i run it all i had to sacrifice
but now i got the money
i get everything for half the price
