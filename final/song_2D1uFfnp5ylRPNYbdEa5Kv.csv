yet again im hustling hustling hustling
yet again im hustling hustling hustling
yet again im hustling hustling hustling
but i cant seem to catch a dime
take a little hit and i lose the time

verse 1
i took the man and his horse and ran before he looked up
i said the lights gonna change but im calm and feeling warm
now im sticking out my hands
and feeling weightless again
you got to push got to shove
got to eat before they eat me
got the crown and the cup
got to write to my family
and say im calm and feeling warm
im not quite there but im close
and its a world of a difference

chorus
yet again im hustling hustling hustling
yet again im hustling hustling hustling
yet again im hustling hustling hustling
but i cant seem to catch a dime
take a little hit and i lose the time

got the worst all behind me
yeah theyll never be able to find me
im the king of the city
im a roach and theyre all primates
this is meal time real life
im not gonna fight
no im gonna start a war
ive been right ive been wrong
my smokes have come and gone
ive been crazy been fed enough to not wind up dead
and im lonely my eyes have been closed to the world
cause the worlds got nothing for me

chorus
yet again im hustling hustling hustling
yet again im hustling hustling hustling
yet again im hustling hustling hustling
but i cant seem to catch a dime
take a little hit and i lose the time
yet again im hustling hustling hustling
yet again im hustling hustling hustling
yet again im hustling hustling hustling
but i cant seem to catch a dime
take a little hit and i lose the time
outro
yet again im hustling hustling hustling
yet again im hustling hustling hustling
yet again im hustling hustling hustling9embed"
