theres only 24 hours in a day
and half as many ways for you to lie to me my little love
theres only 24 hours in a day
and half of those you lay awake
with thoughts of murder and carnage

prechorus
if you lie down with dogs then youll get fleas
be careful of the company you keep

chorus
theres only 24 hours
and thats not enough
to lie like you lie
or love like you love

postchorus
hmm hmm
hmm hmm

verse 2
theres only 24 hours in a day
and half of those you lay
between the sheets with me my lying love
theres only 24 hours so youd say
for most of them you pay
for all the things they paid you for my love

if you lie down with dogs then youll get fleas
be careful of the ones you choose to leave

chorus
theres only 24 hours
and thats not enough
to lie like you lie
or love like you love

give me your heat
give me your diamonds
you hit that street
and my crooked words
you count to three
while theyre all dying
youre hard to reach
youre cold to touch
