layin back against this windshield
parked out in this georgia red field
this is where we burn our summer nights
moonlit lipstick kisses on the hood of that tacoma
we were seventeen goin on free and wild

prechorus
she was smoking hot a whiskey shot a cherry coke
sparks were flying every time i smelled smoke

chorus
im sittin by a bonfire watchin her swayin
me and my buddies and the guitar playin
sipping on forties on a saturday night
buzzing through a chorus of dixieland delight
high as the stars in the milky way
those summer days drifted away
but shell always float
back through my mind like smoke

verse 2
july flames october ashes
southern skin and blue jean flashes
strike a match and light a memory
we never said goodbye we let it fly into thin air
tonight im stoned on longgone love so strong i swear

im sittin by a bonfire watchin her swayin
me and my buddies and the guitar playin
sipping on forties on a saturday night
buzzing through a chorus of dixieland delight
high as the stars in the milky way
those summer days drifted away
but shell always float
back through my mind like smoke

prechorus
she was smoking hot a whiskey shot a cherry coke
sparks were flying every time i smelled smoke

chorus
im sittin by a bonfire watchin her swayin
me and my buddies and the guitar playin
sipping on forties on a saturday night
buzzing through a chorus of dixieland delight
high as the stars in the milky way
those summer days drifted away
but shell always float
back through my mind like smoke
