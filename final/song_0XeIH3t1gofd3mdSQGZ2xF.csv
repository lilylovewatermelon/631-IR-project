everyday i swim an ocean fighting your memory like endless waves
i surrender to the truth ill always love you but i know someday
im going to reach the banks of a distant shore where i wont miss you anymore
once in a while i ride the river of whiskey wishes from an old shot glass
but the way it used to be follows me downstream so i keep knocking em back
till i reach the banks of a distant shore where i wont miss you anymore
someday im going to get there it might take my last prayer
one of these days im going to cross that oceansome sweet angel will set me free
and theyll tell my stories sing a song about glory and read psalm 23
when i reach the banks of that distant shore where i wont miss you anymore
going to rest my soul in the hands of the lord where i wont miss you anymoresee dierks bentley liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likeembed"
