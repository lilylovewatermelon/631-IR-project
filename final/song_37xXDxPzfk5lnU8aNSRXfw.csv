you only fuck for love
told me you could never get enough
posing as a playboy centerfold
you could be my penthouse pet i know

chorus
you make me think of
storms on the beaches
with all the lights off
everything is wrong but its all right
everything is wrong but its all right
youre the only good thing in my life

verse 2
do what your heart desires
love is always strange when it just starts
shouldnt have a care left in the world
naked tanning by the swimming pool

chorus
you make me think of
storms on the beaches
with all the lights off
everything is wrong but its all right
everything is wrong but its all right
youre the only good thing in my life
you might also likeoutro
layin in the sun
never need to tell me when you come
cause you know that i can just feel it2embed"
