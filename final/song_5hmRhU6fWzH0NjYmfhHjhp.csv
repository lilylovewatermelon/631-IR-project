theres only so much you can learn in one place
the more that i wait the more time that i waste

verse 1
i havent got much time to waste its time to make my way
im not afraid of what ill face but im afraid to stay
im going down my own road and i can make it alone
ill work and ill fight till i find a place of my own

chorus
are you ready to jump get ready to jump
dont ever look back oh baby
yes im ready to jump just take my hands
get ready to jump

verse 2
we learned our lesson from the start my sisters and me
the only thing you can depend on is your family
lifes gonna drop you down like the limbs of a tree
it sways and it swings and it bends until it makes you see

chorus
are you ready to jump get ready to jump
dont ever look back oh baby
yes im ready to jump just take my hands
get ready to are you ready

breakdown
i can make it alone
i can make it alone
i can make it alone my sisters and me my sisters and me
i can make it alone
i can make it alone
i can make it alone
i can make it alone my sisters and me my sisters and me
i can make it alone
i can make it alone
