verse 1 gucci mane
canary diamonds on my fist
on my wrists and on my neck
ms lady say she know my name
and i aint even told her yet
no need to introduce myself
i let my money do the greeting
so conceited that if she aint worth talking to then im not speaking
gucci
im so single ay lets mingle
can i buy you some champagne
and my sex game gladiator
tell me are you entertained
im an entertainer baby but my name aint cedric
i got cheddar and etcetera so stop the rhetoric
but enough about me baby
sweetie tell bout yourself
are you married or divorced
dont gotta tell me thats your choice
i like your voice i like your swagg
so let nature take its course
maybe in the future gorgeous i can buy your ass a porsche gucci

verse 2 gucci mane
dont be shy you and i
me and you can be as one
i cant lie wont deny
every time with you is fun
in dubai london paris baby we can watch the sun
set and rise or just lay back on the beach and watch the sky
gucci
shes been sent to me lent to me
i feel she is gods gift to me
its gucci mane on the mic
while zay control the symphony
no twisting it she switching it
but she not all promiscuous
its obvious shes marvelous
and wants to be a part of this
i give her 1000 but this that 5050 shit
im wealthy and im healthy
so cut off that boy you kicking with
give her 1000 but this that 5050 shit
im wealthy and im healthy
so cut off that lame you kick it with

verse 3 gucci mane
dinner date please dont be late
im fiending and dont want to wait
sex so hot and passionate
itll make her hyperventilate
yeah im a bachelor
but im working my masters
and no im not a doctor
but my money go way past one
shes hotter than my last one
sexy like my last chick
im checking out her assets
her exboyfriend is past tense
i talk to her i listen to her
text her then she text me
i rap to her she walks to me
and damn her walk is sexy
our last night was so good
i think about her next day
more butts than 4 ashtrays
she told me boy you crazy
burning all my candles and lighting all my incense
im giving her my imprint
cause damn i like her accent
chorus jason caesar
i think im in love
she think she in love
she falling in love2embed"
