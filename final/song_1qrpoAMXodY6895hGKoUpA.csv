youre on the phone with your girlfriend shes upset
shes goin off about something that you said
cause she doesnt get your humor like i do
im in my room its a typical tuesday night
im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like
and shell never know your story like i do

prechorus
cause she wears short skirts i wear tshirts
shes cheer captain and im on the bleachers
dreaming bout the day when you wake up and find
that what youre lookin for has been here the whole time

chorus
if you could see that im the onе who understands you
been here all along so why cant you see
you bеlong with me you belong with me

verse 2
walking the streets with you and your wornout jeans
i cant help thinking this is how it ought to be
laughin on a park bench thinking to myself
hey isnt this easy
and youve got a smile that could light up this whole town
i havent seen it in a while since she brought you down
you say youre fine i know you better than that
hey what you doin with a girl like that

she wears high heels i wear sneakers
shes cheer captain and im on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what youre lookin for has been here the whole time

chorus
if you could see that im the one who understands you
been here all along so why cant you see
you belong with me
standin by and waitin at your back door
all this time how could you not know baby
you belong with me you belong with me

bridge
oh i remember you
driving to my house in the middle of the night
im the one who makes you laugh when you know youre bout to cry
i know your favorite songs and you tell me bout your dreams
think i know where you belong think i know its with me

chorus
cant you see that im the one who understands you
been here all along so why cant you see ah

standin by and waitin at your back door
all this time how could you not know baby
