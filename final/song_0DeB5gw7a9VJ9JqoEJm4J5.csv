verse 1
hes all right hes all wrong
hes a player hes a dog
hes my friend hes my foe
i just cant leave him i cant go
i got my reasons got my pride
i got these kids we got these ties
we had this love i had these dreams
im falling apart at the seams

prechorus
hes my man when were at home
and it cant hurt if i dont know
all his secrets all his lies
i just keep pushing out my mind
i wish that everybody would stop judging
pointing fingers its cutting
my heart is broken up im open and feeling so bad
ive gotta make decisions
im strong but who am i kidding
ill be okay but this love is tearing me in half

he makes me feel like a child
