dead man lying on the bottom of the grave
wondering when savior comes is he gonna be saved
maybe youre a sinner into your alternate life
maybe youre a joker maybe you deserve to die

chorus serj tankian  daron malakian
they were crying when their sons left god is wearing black
hes gone so far to find no hope hes never coming back
they were crying when their sons left all young men must go
hes come so far to find the truth hes never going home

verse 2 serj tankian  daron malakian
young men standing on the top of their own graves
wondering when jesus comes are they gonna be saved
cruelty to the winner bishop tells the king his lies
maybe youre a mourner maybe you deserve to die

chorus serj tankian  daron malakian
they were crying when their sons left god is wearing black
hes gone so far to find no hope hes never coming back
they were crying when their sons left all young men must go
hes come so far to find the truth hes never going home
