she was drivin last friday on the way to cincinnati
on a snowwhite christmas eve
goin home to see her mama and her daddy
with the baby in the backseat
fifty miles to go and she was runnin low
on faith and gasoline
itd been a long hard year
she had a lot on her mind and she didnt pay attention
she was goin way too fast
before she knew it
she was spinnin on a thin black sheet of glass
she saw both their lives flash before her eyes
she didnt even have time to cry
she was so scared
she threw her hands up in the air

chorus
jesus take the wheel
take it from my hands
cause i cant do this on my own
im letting go
so give me one more chance
save me from this road im on
jesus take the wheel

it was still gettin colder when she made it to the shoulder
and the car came to a stop
she cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
sleepin like a rock
and for the first time in a long time
she bowed her head to pray
she said im sorry for the way
ive been livin my life
i know ive got to change
so from now on tonight

chorus
jesus take the wheel
take it from my hands
cause i cant do this on my own
im letting go
so give me one more chance
save me from this road im on
oh jesus take the wheel
oh im letting go
so give me one more chance
save me from this road im on
from this road im on
jesus take the wheel
oh take it take it from me
outro
oh woah ooh21embed"
