this is evolution
the monkey the man then the gun
if christ was in texas
the hammer the sickle the only son
this is your creation
the atom of eden was a bomb
if jack was a baptist
wed drink wine from his head

chorus
this is evolution
the monkey the man then the gun
this is evolution
the monkey the man and the gun

verse 2
i am a revolution
pull my knuckles down if i could
i am a revelation
and im nailed to the holy wood

chorus
this is evolution
the monkey the man then the gun
this is evolution
the monkey the man and the gun
you might also likebridge
we are dead and tomorrows canceled
because of things we did yesterday
we are dead and tomorrows canceled
they crucify us in our space
in our space in our space
in our space in our space
in our space in our space
in our space in our space

outro
this is evolution
the monkey the man then the gun
this is evolution
the monkey the man then the gun
this is evolution
the monkey the man then the gun
this is evolution
the monkey the man then the gun
this is evolution
the monkey the man then the gun
this is evolution
the monkey the man then the gun
this is evolution
the monkey the man then the gun
this is evolution
the monkey the man then the gunembed"
