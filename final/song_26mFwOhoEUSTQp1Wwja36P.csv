spoken
yeah whats the deal yall this missy elliott
givin yall magazine writers radio cats listeners or plain ol haters
a small piece of of my album which is titled under construction
under construction simply states that im a work in progress
im workin on myself you know
uh ever since aaliyah passed i view life in a more valuable way
lookin at hate and anger and gossip or just plain old bullshit became ignorant to me
when you realize in a blink of an eye you walkin down a church isle
and that was meant for weddings and happiness but realizing those same church isles are used to
to view a loved one for the last time
from the world trade families to the left eye family
big pun family you know biggie family pac family
to the hiphop family we all under construction tryna rebuild you know ourselves
hiphop done gained respect from you know not even respect from but just like rock and roll
and it took us a lot of hard work to get here
so all that hate and the animosity between folks you need to kill it with a skillet
you dont see bill gates and donald trump arguin with each other
cause both of em got paper and they got better shit to do
get more paper
so all im sayin is lets take hiphop back to the rope follow me
