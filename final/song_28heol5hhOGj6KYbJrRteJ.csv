we could be strangers in the night
we could be passing in the shadows
we couldnt be closer if we tried
when were caught in the headlights
we could be faces in the crowd
we could be passin in the shadows
lovin the risk of bein found
when were caught in the headlights

and now im lost in us

but i guess its got somethin to do with you
to do with you
i dont know why
