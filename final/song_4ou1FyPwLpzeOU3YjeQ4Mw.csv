as i drove across on the highway
my jeep began to rock
i didnt know what to do
so i stopped and got out
and looked down i noticed id got a flat
so i walked out parked the car like sideways
so i can find what i can fix
i looked around there were no cars on the highway
i felt a strange feeling like a mist
i walked down toward the end of a road
and in the fog a woman appeared
she said dont you worry my friend
ill take care take my hand
ill take you there

chorus
oohohoh
take me to a place without no name
take me to a place without no name

verse 2
as she took me right through the fog
i seen a beautiful city appear
awhere kids are playin and people are laughin and asmilin an nothin to fear
she said this is the place where no people have pain
with love and happiness
she turned around looked down
in my eyes and started cryin
and grabbed my hand
youve got a friend

she started likin me
kissin me and huggin me
she didnt really really want me to leave
she showed me places ive never seen
and things ive never done
this really looks like a lot of fun
ive seen the grass and the skies and the birds
and the flowers surrounded by the trees
this place is filled with love and happiness
how in the world could i wanna leave

took my wallet on out
with my pictures of my family and girl

when you thought
