helium blowing up because we stay light that’s illumination getting higher than a satellite with my third vision no limitation
and we never wait switching levels watch us levitate
like we’re feather weight
past life yeah i’m on a mission came to decimate
you underestimate for the record ‘bout to set it straight
i never built a bomb that didn’t detonate
doing damage you want to live then you should run the track
you have no time to hate solar wind i’m something like the sun radiation on the radio
spoke too soon you should have checked your tongue
words were empty mine weigh a ton
now when they see me they don’t make a sound
yeah i’m faded off the ground i’m going pound for pound
every single day i wake up and i’m breathing loud
then i pray something to god so they don’t come around
and you know we’re getting through it
you can feel the flow is fluid
never realized i was smart they always told me i was stupid
i don’t plan on giving up going loopy never knew me
people couldn’t understand me now i’m coming for the grammy
i don’t plan on giving up
people couldn’t understand me now i’m coming for the grammy

verse 2 rhythmic syns
yo i been raised hellfire since birth
mah own angels don’t like to fuck wit’ me  i’m such a jerk
no respect for wha’s poppin’ right now  i work
monster’s inc on u mumble bumble bastards  i lurk
lookin for mah next victim  when i spit mah rhymes hurt
like a asthmatic lungs when they smokin’ upon the purp’
ya need a bigger piece of paper to figure out my worth
it all comes down to the money  cool herc
and i aint talkin’ calculators  fuck a hater
verbatim  terminator x a muthafucka out
rhythmic slay um wit’ a throwback
’m in mah bag like pimp on a ho’ back
screamin’ past life so u ho’ niggas know that
i came to get down  u know i came to get down
i came to show u stevie wonder’s how we flame in mah town
i came for the crown  u know i came for the crown
so it aint no big surprises when i reach higher ground
helium

see i was in the back like a spare tire
man im flyer then a pilot at the airlines

shoot the thang make you hoes dipset camron
solar eclipse in my world

niggas is mad cause their tracks dont get no airtime
and to all you niggas

yogi you only get injuries nigga flat line

verse 4 mr every day
they say the first shall be last in this situation
i’m about as real as they come no exaggeration
these bars aint a thing to me rappin’s my pedigree
been around the game and this poetry since the age of three
my choice was to do this even my pops knew this
in everybody’s family there’s one that that’s the truest
i blame the music you see this talent had to shine
like a nickel plated 45 or two chrome nines
letting off in this bitch over the counter rich
i’m making hits after hits after hits after hits
not many can do this i’ve known for quite some time
my pension and passion to destroy you line after line
for the last time i’m tired of talking and schooling you niggas
in 96 i should have been on but there was too many wiggas
my brains the trigger go figure
you should of expected this onslaught
i build to destroy all those lost ones see its your fault
i’m only here to spit for the real fuck yo deal
when i’m done you’ll think its 300
xercees kneel its heliumembed"
