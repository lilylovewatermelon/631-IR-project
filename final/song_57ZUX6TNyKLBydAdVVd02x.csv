it aint nothing i want more
aint nothing i want more
i aint c–
i told you when i first came here i said i aint come here to waste my time
i came here
they gave us a chance to get in like we asked for
and thats thats what we here to do
yeah nigga 26
the job still aint done
straight up
but i i said you you know what im here for

verse j cole
back on top punchin the clock clutchin sanity
i got more cribs than habitat for humanity
shit profound we propagating more profanity
paid off collections from recollections of calamity oh shit look that nigga gonna shoot
the shit pop off i learned to duck under the canopy oh shit run nigga run
til it cool off they murked a nigga right in front of me
told him to come off his chain for tryna floss
died over a cross just like the start of christianity
when i was a boy the teacher often reprimanded me jermaine
thought it was toys it was a glock this nigga handed me
i busted the trees was barely strong enough to squeeze
bullets traveled through leaves it probably killed somebody randomly
ran in the crib and played it off amongst the family
nightmare scenes the police finally apprehended me
woke up screamin seen a demon had his hand on me
still sport the scar on my arm from where he branded me
like a que dog my niggas burnin with the mute off
loud pack smoke through the cracks i catch a contact
triggerin a paranoid mindset now im back
teeterin between enlightened and insanity
now that im rich i feel nobody understandin me
all i can do is cut the mic on holler at you
cant let the fame scare me off from speaking candidly
all them niggas is so kane they started singin like danity
now im left here paid like i planned to be damn

a lot of times those situations are um are handled way before the time comes
in the summer i think when you truly prepare yourself and
with training and conditioning and things like that
when you cheat yourself you fail in those moments
you know you crash and when you really put the time in and
whether people see it or whether people know it or not
you know it always come to light83embed"
