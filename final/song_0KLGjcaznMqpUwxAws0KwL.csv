i was a highwayman
along the coach roads i did ride
with sword and pistol by my side
many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
the bastards hung me in the spring of 25
but i am still alive

verse 2 kris kristofferson
i was a sailor
i was born upon the tide
and with the sea i did abide
i sailed a schooner around the horn to mexico
i went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
and when the yards broke off they said that i got killed
but i am living still

verse 3 waylon jennings  all
i was a dam builder
across a river deep and wide
where steel and water did collide
a place called boulder on the wild colorado
i slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
they buried me in that gray tomb that knows no sound
but i am still around
ill always be around
and around and around and around
and around and around and around
see the highwaymen liveget tickets as low as 48you might also likeverse 4 johnny cash  all
i fly a starship
across the universe divide
and when i reach the other side
ill find a place to rest my spirit if i can
perhaps i may become a highwayman again
or i may simply be a single drop of rain
but i will remain
and ill be back again
and again and again and again
and again and again20embed"
