you better trust that voice in your head
that your world is not what it seems
its not the monster under your bed
its the one with you in the sheets

its hard enough just trying to feel alive
meanwhile our fever is running
and kings bow down to the dollar sign

giants think the world is theirs
well i got a handful of magic beans
and theres a raindance in my head
and if you want a storm come dance with me

its hard enough just trying to feel alive
meanwhile our fever is running
and kings bow down to the bottom line
