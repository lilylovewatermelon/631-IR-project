im
never gonna live never gonna give
never gonna die your way
fuck no go away

never gonna try never wonder why
never gonna change
no say it what

never understand never gave a damn
never see it through your eyes
fuck you no way

never understand never lend a hand
never see it through my eyes

prechorus
theres a fire within hate to admit it
but i always knew
violence and sin keeps me fearless
keeps me from being

chorus
you so dated
you outdated
you so fading away
you cant take it
you just fake it
you are just in my way

verse 2
im
never gonna quit never gave a shit
never gonna walk away
fuck you all day

never gonna drop never gonna stop
never gonna fall
no what say it

never understood never really could
never saw it through your eyes
fuck off no way

never understand never give a damn
never gonna change my mind

prechorus
theres a fire within hate to admit it
but i always knew
violence and sin keeps me fearless
keeps me from being

chorus
you so dated
you outdated
you so fading away
you cant take it
you just fake it
you are just in my way
i dont give a fuck about you
