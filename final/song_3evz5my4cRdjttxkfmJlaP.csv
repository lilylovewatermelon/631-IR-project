you are my favorite girl
i was your favorite guy
and somehow i thought that wed always be down down
we went through crazy times
inside this crazy mind
somehow i thought that you would always be around
somehow we changed up we flamed up
and every day youre fighting with me
baby baby baby
and then it came up i asked did you love me
baby do you love me
who knew that would be the last time we speak

chorus
all i could say is why why why why why why
what did i do what did i say why i didnt see this coming oh why
all i can say is why why why why why why why
for the last two months i was kissing you goodbye
bye bye bye goodbye bye goodbye
kissing you goodbye
bye bye bye goodbye bye goodbye

verse 2
behind your lovely eyes eyes
couldnt see those lovely lies lies
that kept recurring over the course of time
you could unbreak this glass heart
by just saying were not apart
but how can i go on knowing my love is blind
so many makeups so many breakups
i never thought id see you leave you leave you leave
ima put it to rest cause all i want is the best for you
you still havent told me how i hurt you
so i deserve the answer to
you might also likechorus
why why why why oh why why
what did i do what did i say why i didnt see this coming
all i can say is why oh why why
why oh why why why why
for the last two months i was kissing you goodbye
bye bye bye goodbye bye goodbye
kissing you goodbye
bye bye bye goodbye bye goodbye

bridge
oh baby how can you leave me like this
through all the smiles and all the cries
love we had i thought was the vibe
no why could you do me like this
i guess loves questionless and what ive learned this is
there are no real answers to

chorus
why why why why oh
what did i do what did i say i didnt see this coming
oh why why oh oh why oh baby why why
for the last two months i was kissing you goodbye
bye bye bye goodbye bye goodbye
baby why baby why
goodbye bye bye bye goodbye bye goodbye
baby why shawty why
