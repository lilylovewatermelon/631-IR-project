i just want to liberate my madness

verse 1 corey taylor
section off myself
put a wall up what the hell have i done
keep the dog at bay
survive by saving me
values and the game
not a fuckup not a part of your lie
i am one i am all im above and beyond

verse 2 corey taylor
i am not ashamed
what is vital isnt always humane
you can break in vain
but you cant break away
even in my face
lot of bullshit not a lotta the truth
i cant see from here
but i can smell your fear
prechorus corey taylor  chris fehn
back off of the shit
stand off or ill spit
so soft you forget
your garbage in is garbage out
you dont give a shit
i wont play the fit
get off get on this
your garbage in is garbage out
