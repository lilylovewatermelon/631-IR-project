i spill the cup for you take it or leave it

verse 1 swae lee
she wanna ride
i just want some time when im fried
she bad as fuck
but i know she would bury me alive
just say that its dead
if you wanna live on a lot
if you get in the mood
i want you to keep me in mind
i got the booze we can rendezvous
jump inside baby we can cruise
dont be led by the goddamn fools
yeah right beside me you cannot lose

chorus swae lee
i spill the cup for you take it or leave it
i saved some room for you take it or leave it
i gotta crazy view take it or leave it
i got love for you take it or leave it
i know you pick up on the very first ring
lets go somewhere where we can just be unseen
im reachin out to you take it or leave it
reachin out to you take it or leave it

remember how you held me down
when all i had was a vision
i could cop a model bitch but
you the one that im missin
girl i hope you get this message
and i pray that you hit me
cause you the one thats on my mind
late night when im driftin
pour a shot for me pour a shot for you
im still around cause i fuck with you
just say the word we can go missin
long as we together it dont make a difference

chorus swae lee

i gotta crazy view take it or leave it
i got love for you take it or leave it
i know you pick up on the very first ring
