up with your turret
arent we just terrified
shale screen your worry
from what you wont ever find

chorus
dont let it fool you
dont let it fool you
down
dancing around
folds in her gown

verse 2
sea and the rock below
cocked to the undertow
bones blood and teeth erode
with every crashing node

chorus
wings wouldnt help you
wings wouldnt help you
down
down fills the ground
gravitys proud
you might also likeverse 3
you barely are blinking
wagging your face around
whend this just become a mortal home
now

chorus
wont wont wont wont wont let you talk me
wont let you talk me
down
will pull it taut
nothing let out44embed"
