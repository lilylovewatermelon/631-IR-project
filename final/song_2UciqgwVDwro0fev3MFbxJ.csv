verse 1
i know that its difficult
im stackin this paper its sort of habitual
i blow the residual
and fuckin yo bitch like its part of my ritual
pardon the visual
but money it give me a hardon its typical
i want it in physical
a million dollars i count up in intervals
without it im miserable
dont wanna fall off so im all in my bag
thankin god like its biblical
i know its gon solve every problem i have
i balled on the principal
remember the teachers was all on my ass
now look all of them pitiful
and all of a sudden im so good at math

verse 2
proceed with caution
i heard if you chase it only results in
a hole in your heart
fuck it i take the whole cake and i wont leave a portion
its only an organ
thank god mama couldnt afford the abortion
the loneliest orphan
i flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
my rollie is scorchin
them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin
now cole he important
my niggas beside me like tommy and martin
we ball on your court and
then skate with your bitch like we tonya harding
she dont need her garments
she horny from all the money we countin

chorus

count it up count it up count it up count it
