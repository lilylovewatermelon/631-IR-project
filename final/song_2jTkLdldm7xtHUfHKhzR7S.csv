how fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
i struggle to find any truth in your lies
and now my heart stumbles on things i dont know
my weakness i feel i must finally show
lend me your hand and well conquer them all
but lend me your heart and ill just let you fall
lend me your eyes i can change what you see
but your soul you must keep totally free
har har har har
har har har har

chorus
awake my soul
awake my soul

verse 2
how fickle my heart and how woozy my eyes
i struggle to find any truth in your lies
and now my heart stumbles on things i dont know
my weakness i feel i must finally show
har har har har
