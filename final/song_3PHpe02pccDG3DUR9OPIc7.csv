some folks living in the country cant wait
to get in their pickup trucks and go to town
theres people living in a penthouse
dying to get out in the sticks and ride around
theres a man above the mountaintop
wants to go down breath the salt air by the shore
theres a guy on an island he aint smiling
dont want to be on an island anymore

verse 2
theres a lady locked in a love affair
wouldnt care if she was single again
theres a lonely soul whose only goal
is to get that golden ring upon their hand
in the middle of nowhere where theres nobody
trying to get that fifteen minutes of fame
someplace theres a superstar
thinking lord if i could only change my name

chorus
round and round and round and round we go
why we cant be satisfied i dont know
i dont know

verse 3
theres a young man wishing he could grab the hands of time
and speed them up a year or two
theres an old man wishing he could just go back
and stop the clock and hang on to his youth
theres a stoner on the sidewalk
wishing he could just get straight for a day
theres a man in a suit and tie
thinking getting high might be a better way

round and round and round and round we go
why we cant be satisfied i dont know
from the day were born it seems like it never stops
why are we always wanting something we aint got
oh we aint got

chorus
round and round and round and round we go
why we cant be satisfied i dont know
til the day we die it seems like it never stops
why are we always wanting something we aint got
oh we have not got

outro
round and round and round and round we goembed"
