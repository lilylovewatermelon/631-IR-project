down below the cars in the city go rushing by
i see it here alone and i wonder why
friday night and everyones moving
i can feel the heat but its soothing heading down
i search for the beat in this dirty town

downtown the young ones are going
downtown the young ones are growing

were the kids in america
were the kids in america
everybody live for the music around

bright lights
the music gets faster
look boy dont check on your watch not another glance
im not leaving now honey not a chance
hot shot give me no problems
much later baby youll be saying nevermind
you know life is cruel
life is never kind

kind hearts dont make a new story
kind hearts dont grab any glory
see cascada liveget tickets as low as 83you might also likewere the kids in america
were the kids in america
everybody live for the music around

come closer honey thats better
gotta get a brand new experience feelin right
oh dont try to stop baby hold me tight
outside a new day is dawning
outside suburbia calling everywhere
i dont want to go baby
new york to east california
theres a new way come in on ya

were the kids in america
were the kids in america
everybody live for the music aroundembed"
