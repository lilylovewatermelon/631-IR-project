the ragged and the bones
strewn around the room

i recall another hazy may
take a round in the ring
gone hungry for the win

heres the part i just lose everything
i cracked a spark just to hear you sing
sing

i took it out
the papers and the trash
old among the cans
this golden love gone bad

shined it up
aiming at the sun
just a light year from us
hop a cab ride and weâ€™re off

and all the ravens came along to play
the simple notes you sang just went astray

everything was up its coming down
everything was up its coming down
