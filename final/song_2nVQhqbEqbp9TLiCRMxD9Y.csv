but you were never there you were never there
im still hanging downtown with our friends
but you were never there you were never there
baby find a way back home now
cause i miss you im hurting
i still believe our love is burning

i keep calling you i never stop
youre still missing but i wont give up
im confident as hell we can break the spell
i keep calling you i wont give in
holding back would be a sin
im confident as hell we can break the spell

believe me i never meant for us to fail
to let us drift apart oh no no no no
there are things that i need to tell you
that i learned my lesson well
that i know better now so much better now
baby find a way back home now
cause i miss you im hurting
i still believe our love is burning

i keep calling you i never stop
youre still missing but i wont give up
im confident as hell we can break the spell
i keep calling you i wont give in
holding back would be a sin
im confident as hell we can break the spell
you might also likeand even though theres trouble in the air
i can smell your sweet perfume
and ever since your voodoo got a hold on me
youre the only one to set me free yeah yeah

i keep calling you i never stop
youre still missing but i wont give up
i keep calling you i never stop
youre still missing but i wont give up
im confident as hell we can break the spell
i keep calling you i wont give in
holding back would be a sin
im confident as hell we can break the spellembed"
