you found out it wasnt a true love
now that he is gone
lets go steady one more time

please dont cry
youve got to be strong dear
i know he was wrong dear
but now that hes gone

i know he was wrong to come to the dance
with another girl the way that he did
i knew he was wrong when he took your love from me
after all he was once my best friend

thats all in the past
lets forget you
hell never hurt you
i wont let him
now that hes gone
lets go steady one more time

yes he was wrong to come to the dance
with another girl the way that he did
i knew he was wrong when he took your love from me
after all he was once my best friend
you might also likethats all in the past
lets forget him
hell never hurt you
i wont let him
now that hes gone
lets go steady one more timeembed"
