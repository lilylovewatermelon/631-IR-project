my eyes are bifocal
my hands are septjointed
i live in the future
in my prewar apartment
and i count all my blessings
i have friends in high places
and im upgraded daily
all my wires without traces

chorus
hooked into machine hooked into machine
hooked into machine
im hooked into hooked into
hooked into machine hooked into machine
hooked into machine
im hooked into hooked into machine

verse 2
i collect my moments
into a correspondence
with a mightier power
who just lacks my perspective
and who lacks my organics
and who covets my defects
and im downloaded daily
i am part of a composite

hooked into machine hooked into machine
hooked into machine
im hooked into hooked into
hooked into machine hooked into machine
hooked into machine
im hooked into hooked into machine

verse 3
everythings provided
consummate consumer
part of worldly taking
apart from worldly troubles
living in your prewar apartment
soon to be your postwar apartment
and you lived in the future
and the future
its here its bright its now2embed"
