i wanna start this out and say
i gotta get it off my chest my chest

so theres some things i gotta say
gonna jot it down and then get it out
and then ill be on my way

prechorus
no youre not half the man you think that you are
and you cant fill the hole inside of you with money drugs and cars
im so glad i never ever had a baby with you
cause you cant love nothing unless theres something in it for you

chorus
oh i feel so sorry i feel so sad
i tried to help you it just made you mad
and i had no warning about who you are
im just glad i made it out without breaking down
and then ran so fucking far
that you would never ever touch me again
wont see your alligator tears
cause know ive had enough of them
