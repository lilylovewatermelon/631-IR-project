separate
sifting through the wreckage i cant concentrate
searching for a message in that fear and pain
broken down and waiting for the chance to feel alive

chorus chester bennington
now in my remains
are promises that never came
set this silence free
to wash away the worst of me

verse 2 chester bennington
come apart
falling in the cracks of every broken heart
digging through the wreckage of your disregard
sinking down and waiting for the chance to feel alive

chorus chester bennington
now in my remains
are promises that never came
set this silence free
to wash away the worst of me

one by one by one
