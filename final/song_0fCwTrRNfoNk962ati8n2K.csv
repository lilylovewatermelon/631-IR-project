drivin through the road work oh the work they took forever on
the road cones blur like memries of the miles we shared between
the place you learned to say your prayers the place i took to prayin
loadin in and breakin down my road dog door deal dreams
long before we ever met i made up my direction
long before i knew the half of half im sure of now
though id say it aint the way that youd have gone about it
you follow me and lead me on and never let me down

chorus
so ill love you til my lungs give out i aint lyin
im all yourn and youre all mine
there aint two ways around it
there aint no tryin bout it
im all yourn and youre all mine

verse 2
fried morels and fine hotels and all that in the middle
every bite and curtain drawn i wanna taste with you
goddess in my days inn pen the muse i aint refusin
the part of me that aint around im always talking to

chorus
so ill love you til my lungs give out i aint lyin
im all yourn and youre all mine
there aint two ways around it
there aint no tryin bout it
im all yourn and youre all mine
