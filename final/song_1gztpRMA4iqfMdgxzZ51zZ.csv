it was a summer night
the stars were all aligned
you you you you showed up and blew my mind
we didnt sleep at all
played records all night long
that that that night i kinda fell in love

prechorus
somethin in your kiss made my body electric
and you set me free
that night brought to life all the magic thats inside
of you and me

chorus
wherever you are you are forever on my mind
wherever you are know that our love will never die
wherever you are oh
wherever you are love will never die
wherever you are
wherever you are

verse 2
electric warrior love
the sun was comin up
red red red wine and whiskey on your tongue
tangled up in your sheets
you saw the real me
you you you give me somethin to believe

somethin in your kiss made my body electric
you set me free
that night brought to life all the magic thats inside
of you and me

chorus
wherever you are you are forever on my mind
wherever you are know that our love will never die
wherever you are oh
wherever you are love will never die
wherever you are
wherever you are wherever wherever

those nights we spent together

wherever you are oh
wherever you are love will never die
wherever you are wherever you are
