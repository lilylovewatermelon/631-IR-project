evil  i yes to find a shore
a beast that doesnt quiver anymore
and we could crush some plants to paint my walls
and i wont try to fight in the weekend wars
was i i was too lazy to bathe
or paint or write or try to make a change
now i can shoot a gun to kill my lunch
and i dont have to love or think too much

chorus 1
instant battle plans written on the sidewalk
mental mystics in a twisted metal car
tried to amplify the sound of light and love

verse 2
christ is cursed of fathers and martyrs
might even take a knife to split a hair
or even scare the children off my lawn
givin us time to make the makeshift bombs
every mess invested was a score
we couldnt use computers anymore
but its difficult to win unless youre bored
and you might have to plan for the weekend wars

chorus 2
try to break my heart ill drive to arizona
it might take a hundred years to grow an arm
ill sit and listen to the sound of sand and cold
twisted diamond heart im the weekend warrior huh
my predictions are the only things i have
i can amplify the sound of light and love

im a curse and im a sound when i open up my mouth
theres a reason i dont win i dont know how to begin
im a curse and im a sound when i open up my mouth
theres a reason i dont win i dont know how to begin
im a curse and im a sound when i open up my mouth
theres a reason i dont win i dont know how to begin
im a curse and im a sound when i open up my mouth14embed"
