your body may be gone im gonna carry you in
in my head in my heart in my soul
and maybe well get lucky and well both live again
well i dont know i dont know
i dont know dont think so

chorus 1
well that is that and this is this
you tell me what you want and ill tell you what you get
you get away from me you get away from me
collected my belongings and i left the jail
well thanks for the time i needed to think a spell
i had to think awhile i had to think awhile

verse 2
the ocean breathes salty wont you carry it in
in your head in your mouth in your soul
and maybe well get lucky and well both grow old
well i dont know i dont know
i dont know i hope so

chorus 1
well that is that and this is this
you tell me what you want and ill tell you what you get
you get away from me you get away from me
collected my belongings and i left the jail
well thanks for the time i needed to think a spell
i had to think awhile i had to think awhile
see modest mouse liveget tickets as low as 76you might also likebridge
well that is that and this is this
will you tell me what you saw and ill tell you what you missed
when the ocean met the sky you missed
you missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye
you missed
when the earth folded in on itself you missed
and said good luck for your sake i hope heaven and hell
you missed you missed
are really there but i wouldnt hold my breath
you missed you missed
you wasted life why wouldnt you waste death
you missed you missed
you wasted life why wouldnt you waste death

verse 3
the ocean breathes salty wont you carry it in
in your head in your mouth in your soul
the more we move ahead the more were stuck in rewind
well i dont mind i dont mind
how the hell could i mind

chorus 2
well that is that and this is this
you tell me what you want and ill tell you what you get
you get away from me you get away from me
well that is that and this is this
will you tell me what you saw and ill tell you what you missed
when the ocean met the sky you missed
you wasted life why wouldnt you waste the afterlife22embed"
