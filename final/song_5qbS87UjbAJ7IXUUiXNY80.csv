on the broken backs of all the words we spared
like little soldiers in the trenches
it was a march we made towards ruin and despair
but we held hands all the while

chorus
i swear that i loved you
i swear that i loved you
i swear that i loved you
i swear i swear

verse 2
beneath the table you would offer up my bones
and all the dogs would lick your fingers
and i dragged you through every room inside our home
but you still held me at night

chorus
i swear that you loved me
i swear that you loved me
i swear that you loved me
i swear i swear

we didnt give up we wouldnt dare surrender
it was an honest loss

now the aftermath will ring with songs youve sung
all of our words sent home in boxes
i fought with tooth and nail before the flag had flown
but you were already gone

chorus
ill swear that i loved you
ill swear that i loved you
ill swear that i loved you
i swear i swear

ill swear that i loved you
ill swear that i loved you
ill swear that i loved you
i swear i swear1embed"
