verse 2
women hold the weight of the world
but you still talk down and call me little girl
i hate that shit
its a no if she needs to be coerced
my bodys not an object or dessert
i am not your bitch
i am not your bitch wanna see me switch
get psycho like they say i am
scared of me you flinch
i dont need your inches
yall in my mentions
i feel fuckboy rich
think youre slick
i burn bridges quick
i wont sacrifice my humanity
sanity for the dick i wont
