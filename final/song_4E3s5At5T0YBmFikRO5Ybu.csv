verse 1
tired eyes barely open
crippled by a promise broken
i have seen an empire falling
hopeless can you hear me calling

prechorus
turn away from all that i know
burning this bridge behind me
light the way and ill follow
where you go
chorus
can you tell me what is real
cause ive lost my way again
can you tell me how to feel
cause i dont feel anything
now that im down here again
im down with the fallen again

searching through the darkness below
for a light in seas of shadows
far from you but i could never
abdicate ill fight forever

prechorus
turn away from all that i know
burning this bridge behind me
light the way and ill follow
where you go

chorus
can you tell me what is real
cause ive lost my way again
can you tell me how to feel
cause i dont feel anything
now that im down here again
im down with the fallen again

bridge
i will not run
i will not fall
i will not bury it
this is war
war
this is war
war
chorus
tell me what is real
cause ive lost my way again
can you tell me how to feel
cause i dont feel anything
now that im down here again
tell me what is real
cause ive lost my way again
can you tell me how to feel
cause i dont feel anything
now that im down here again
im down with the fallen again
