she came through the front door looking fast as a big train
booking down the line
and she was looking fine
long and lean and dressed to kill
stacked up high with perfect wheels
and there arenâ€™t no chance that girl would ever dance with me
she got all those city boys pushing and shoving
a country boy like me dont ever get no uptown loving

verse 2
shes sweet shes got them melting in her hand
whoever gets a taste of that cup of sugar
sure is a lucky man
shes sweet telling you boys
shes babelicious i cant reach that georgia peach
but she sure looks delicious

verse 3
i had nothing else to do
so i threw down two more shots of booze
and it made me strong
i strapped my courage on
i said would you like a drink
by chance no what i mean is would you like to dance with me
please in my best southern ease
it got hot on the dance floor when she whispered in my ear
i think i found my county boy lets get out of here
you might also likechorus
i said sweet
im melting in her hand
i feel like a spoon in a cup of blonde sugar
yall looking at the lucky man
i said sweet
mmm boys shes babelicious
that georgia peach is now in my reach
and dont she look delicious

chorus
look here now shes sweet
im melting in her hand
i feel like a spoon in a cup of blonde sugar
yall looking at the lucky man
shes sweet mmm boys shes babelicious
that georgia peach is now in my reach
and dont she look delicious
shes sweetembed"
