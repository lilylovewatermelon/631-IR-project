verse 1 eminem
life handed me lemons i jumped back in the public eye
and squirted lemon juice in it by now you just wish i’d fuckin’ die
but i electrify get electrocuted executed by the execution
of my flow too quick for the human eye to detect zoomin’ by
choomchiggachoomchoomchoomchoom waa
yep yep—guess who what’s happenin’ guy
they told me to shit i fell off that pot
hopped right back on that crapper and i
said “fuck it” with a capital i look who’s back to antaggonize
you don’t like it you can eat shit fuck off little faggot and die
you right back like a magnet on my dick grabbin’ at my
shit better get to the back of the line
if you wanna get your shot at me what kinda crap is that battle
what kind of rapper would i be
fore i let another rapper think he’s hot
ill bury my face in his stinky twat and go licking
girl my head space is limited
ain’t even room in the back of my mind
that’s why i ain’t thinking about you i don’t got time
i done told you a thousand times
so how can i find the time to put
an alkaline battery in royce’s back
and at the same time put juice in mine

verse 2 crooked i
i’m a menace villain my pen is sick and spillin’ my lyrics killin’
then i let you witness shit when it hit the ceilin’
a nigga’s willin’ to give the listeners the sickest feelin’
like mixin’ some benadryl and penicillin then i’m fillin’ the clip
with a written pow can you picture my pistol drillin’
a million women and children when i’m illin’ but it isn’t real
it’s a rap on the real it’s a wrap how could you possibly
stop the apocalypse when i’m atomic bombin’ the populace
shock the metropolis hostile as a kid
poppin’ the glock at his mom’s and his pop’s
then he hops in his drop with his ipod
rockin’ his slaughterish documentation of lyrics
i write with confidence write like a columnistslashnovelist
i’m in this game to demolish it
establish my dominance over prominent rappers
you poppin’ shit ’til ya opposite i can spit ominous so spit politics
now i’m haile selassie gandhi and pac
of this hip hop genre bitch

verse 3 royce da 5’9”
lyrically i’m a cocaine altoid dope
ability so brain it’s a no brain bow boy fresh
physically i’m literally a cocaine cowboy
waitwait did i just go almost four bars
without talking about my big dick
the other day me and your thick bitch
had a great date and we ate cake
and then we walked and then she tried to jack me off but she lost
’cause she couldn’t handle my shake weight
i swear the irony of ryan is i am bipolar while i’m rhyming
standing beside a big ol’ big ol’ white bear
neither one of us fight fair
you are literally looking at woody and wesley
in a movie where the white boy ain’t got to jump
nowhere ’cause i’m here
nigga i’m on fire yeah and i’m every bitch’s dream
one two i’m coming for you i’m a big ol’ big ol’ nightmare
nigga this the slaughter step it up
i’ll pretty much slap your ass and tell you to shut the fuck up
after that i’ll slap your ass again
and tell you to shut the fuck up shutting up
and that’s how you body a fucking beat goodbye

refrain crooked i
slaughterhouse
verse 4 joell ortiz
uh i should be the one that goes slow
nah get a stopwatch clock my flow hit the button on top
watch your jaw drop ohoh dotdot oh yaowa
when i drop i go outer space
blackout like darth vader’s face placed in a molten shower
say something and get done proper
mama poppa pouring out vodka mama mia
em pass me the scissors
there’s visitors in the slaughterhouse casa
better jet boy go home better jet boy g4 chrome
better jet boy mark sanchez santonio holmes
i’m not your any old homeboy
sitting in the lab picking up a pad i be spitting bad
i’mma get you mad with this gift i have
little ducks sufferin’ succotash when the trigger blast
i’ma put your beak on your fitted hat
where the liquor at sip a yac bad bitch and a vicious track
i relididax slide prodools to both
so smooth i coast to the west like where crooked living at
new york here’s a piggy back ride
to the motherland hold on brother man
on the other hand get down i’m gutter fam
gun butt you with the eagle handle cunningham
i don’t wanna talk i just wanna beef i don’t want a piece
i want it all baby boy i don’t wanna eat i wanna feast
stuff my cheeks with rough beats and shit
you done weak i’m the one capisce

refrain crooked i
slaughterhouse

verse 5 joe budden
uh insane what they call us how you married to the game
but you probably shouldn’t have came to the altar
every bar like propane for the sawedoff
you shoulda hang and they’ll fault ya
eminem mr porter slaughter my sentiments eminent torture
all of you feminine marauders
they’re swimming that water men will assault ya
tommy’s and bats to resemble lasorda
kidnap your trembling daughter
at least a quarter i’m a menacing supporter
it’s got an aura more like sodom and gomorrah
normally something’s wrong with me
blame it on quantity of the porn i see on the pawns to me
when i fix the game y’all think shit came with a warranty
how the fuck are they gonna stop what i was born to be
corner me shit belong to me
two choices you can get along with me
or sit your faggot ass right there in dormancy
wait all he missing is heels to be rupaul
ain’t nobody that’s real ever knew y’all
and i’m second to none and i’m dealing with bums
whose timell never come now deal with the blue balls
you ain’t gotta fear me but you respect me
niggas who never met me threaten me want to gillette me
comin’ to a sword fight against a machete
swinging spaghetti like it’s heavy
some said he deserve an espy in a chevy like andretti
put the desi where his chest be
