i found a wallet
i found a wallet
inside were pictures of your small family
you were so young
your hair dark brown
you had been born in nineteen fiftythree

verse 2
your winter birthday
was stamped on the plastic
of a license so recently expired
i was so tired
as i walked through my door
i laid all the contents of your wallet on the floor

bridge
and like a holy relic
or a mystery novel
i thumbed them in the dim light
searching for a clue
a blockbuster card
an old stick of juicy fruit
a crumpled receipt
from a pair of leather boots

i have no wallet
i have no wallet
i keep my cards together with a blue rubber band
and with a free hand
i search in my pockets
for pieces of pieces of paper and change

outro
ill take your wallet
to my local blockbuster
theyll find your number
in their computer
youll never know me
ill never know you
but youll be so happy
when they call you upembed"
