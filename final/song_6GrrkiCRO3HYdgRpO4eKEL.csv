am i loud and clear or am i breaking up
am i still your charm or am i just bad luck
are we getting closer or are we just getting more lost

prechorus
ill show you mine if you show me yours first
lets compare scars ill tell you whose is worse
lets unwrite these pages and replace them with our own words

chorus
we live on front porches and swing life away
we get by just fine here on minimum wage
if love is a labor ill slave till the end
i wont cross these streets until you hold my hand

verse 2
ive been here so long i think that its time to move
the winters so cold summers over too soon
lets pack our bags and settle down where palm trees grow

verse 3
ive got some friends some that i hardly know
but weve had some times i wouldnt trade for the world
we chase these days down with talks of the places that we will go

we live on front porches and swing life away
we get by just fine here on minimum wage
if love is a labor ill slave till the end
i wont cross these streets until you hold my hand
until you hold my hand
