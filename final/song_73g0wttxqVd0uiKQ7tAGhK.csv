and i dont spit no game to these bitches and they know it
and everything i say is real i aint gotta show it
my nigga say he got the lean well nigga pour it
im trappin on my iphone and best believe its stolen
and niggas talkin pounds but my nigga i dont hold it
these streets aint safe thats why my niggas ride loaded
these crookedass cops want to catch a nigga slippin
but when the nigga get killed them pigs be missin
crazy ass world but we all just livin
thats why my blunt lit and i maintain my pimpin
and i dont fuck with niggas most of them be trippin
and i dont love these hoes cause they just want attention
and i just fuck these hoes and give my love to these women
i ride with my family cause we all got a vision
but we gon stay humble we gon get there in a minute
my wardrobe vintage nigga i dont fuck with finished

verse 2
you just gotta face it my nigga you lose
dont catch an attitude cause i dont fuck with you
my plug shipped it in so i gotta get it through
if you aint got the cash then i cant fuck with you
my last bitch was crazy cause she pop up out the blue
and nigga whats old cause aint a damn thing new
spittin game to a ho thats what i dont do
i tell her straight up cause thats what real niggas do
