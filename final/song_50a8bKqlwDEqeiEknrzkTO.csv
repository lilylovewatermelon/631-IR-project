verse 1
you runnin round drinkin liquor
takin pictures cause you miss me
i know you miss me
you runnin round drinkin liquor
fuckin niggas cause you miss me
you just want attention
you can sleep with half the world
bet you still wont forget me
on god
you could find love get married have kids
id still be realest nigga to hit it
straight up straight up straight up straight up
i was gettin some head earlier and you crossed my mind straight up
im as solid as they come but you crossed the line 21
yeah you been stopped keepin it real i can see the signs on god
when it came to havin your back im so real
i prolly wouldve gave you my spine straight up
id rather have loyalty than love
cause love really dont mean jack straight up
see love is just a feeling
you can love somebody and still stab them in they back on god
it dont take much to love
you can love somebody just by being attached 21
see loyalty is a action
you can love or hate me and still have my back facts

verse 2
you crossed me once its fuck you forever straight up
middle school got my heart broke stop writin love letters 21
heart cold yeah so cold had to buy the moncler sweater on god
valentines day she ripped the card and urinated on the rose petals damn
you was my rock heavy metal
now you aint shit to me facts
i thought it was love until i woke up
and had an epiphany 21
keep the fame and keep the love
just give me the loyalty on god
nefertiti king tut
i treat you like royalty fact

i just wish your love wouldnt fade away
even when the smoke clear im here to stay
dont you ever let a nigga take my place
would you be around if i had minimum wage

chorus
i gave you my all my all
you was my dawg you was my dawg
i would have went to war with the world on your call on your call
thought you had my back nah
