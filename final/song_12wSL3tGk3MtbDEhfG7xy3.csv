woo

verse 1
you wake up
it’s raining and it’s monday
looks like one of those rough days
time’s up
you’re late again so get out the door out the door
sometimes you feel like running
find a whole new life and jump in
let go get up and hit the dancefloor

prechorus 1
but when the lights go down it’s the ending of the show show
and you’re feeling like you got nowhere to go
don’t you know

chorus
you can change your hair and you can change your clothes
you can change your mind that’s just the way it goes
you can say goodbye and you can say hello
but you’ll always find your way back home
you can change your style you can change your jeans
you can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
you can laugh and cry but everybody knows
you’ll always find your way back home
