i feel so unsure
as i take your hand
and lead you to the dance floor
as the music dies
something in your eyes
calls to mind a silver screen
and all its sad goodbyes

chorus
im never gonna dance again
these guilty feet have got no rhythm
though its easy to pretend
i know youre not a fool
i should have known better than to cheat a friend
and waste the chance that ive been given
so im never gonna dance again
the way i danced with you oh

verse 2
time can never mend
the careless whispers
of a good friend
to the heart and mind
ignorance is kind
theres no comfort in the truth
pain is all youll find

im never gonna dance again
these guilty feet have got no rhythm
though its easy to pretend
i know youre not a fool
i should have known better than to cheat a friend
and waste the chance that ive been given
so im never gonna dance again
the way i danced with you oh

bridge
tonight the music seems so loud
i wish that we could lose this crowd
maybe its better this way
we hurt each other with the things we wanna say
we could have been so good together
we could have lived this dance forever
now whos gonna dance with me
please stay

chorus
im never gonna dance again
these guilty feet have got no rhythm
though its easy to pretend
i know youre not a fool
i should have known better than to cheat a friend
and waste this chance that ive been given
so im never gonna dance again
the way i danced with you oh
