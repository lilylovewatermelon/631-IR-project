no need to translate
cause my eyes give me away
even though my lips don’t say
should be so easy but my head gets in the way
all the things that i wanna tell you

prechorus
you’re the most perfect yet
most definitely that i’ve met
and i wonder if you know that’s how i feel about you
mmm i hope you know

chorus
cause i have so much love for you
do with it what you will
and i have nothing more to prove
say to me what you will
say say it again

verse 2
