i wear my emotions on my sleeve you know what im saying
ive always been like that my whole life man
if i fuck with you im all the way out there
if i dont fuck with you
i dont mind you knowing i dont fuck with you

verse  1
breaking down a key of coke i aint never seen a boat
khaza got circumcised thinkin imma need a load
boobie he a shooter hit the top of your medulla
from a scooter with a ruger i dont think he even need a scope
attending college been a goal that im after
evaded doin life without parole wearin shackles
im only fucking with what matters
a washed up rapper talking trash doesnt matter
front windshield of the car went in shatters
my nigga brains blown out layin in my lap
told god take me everybody blamed me
praying till im prayed out wont bring him back

bridge
they say my life is amazing
funny been a question kinda wonder how i made it
forest gump and i got something in common
the world treat you different when brilliant
see kevin gates liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likeverse 2
we aint booted off a molly we dont do shrooms
all we do is pass gas loud excuse who
twinturbo 911 make it vroom vroom
we in all black my mechanic make the tool move
say you sip lean yeah i do too
i aint tryna hit your cup nigga do you
im michael jackson im reincarnated
i channel this spirit like ali the greatest
medicinal marijuana am i medicated
aerosmith jaded
she looked like nala when she got on top me
i gazed in her eyes and responded
can we go half on a baby
broke another fingernail scratching up my back
navel was to the ceiling when im pushing on her pelvis
see my tattoo of elvis when im tearing up her cat
she tapped

hook
im a perfect imperfection
my craft has been perfected
i just need affection
emotionally imma introvert but it comes off as aggression
no one understand me and everybody cant be slow
its refreshing to find someone who think like me so i cant be wrong
im a perfect imperfection and i dont find interest in the radio
so everytime i get high i watch the time pass by like away we go
is it okay to cry when youre dying inside
seem like codeine is the one thing that help take my mind from the lies
verse 3
point the flame at my brain with the full clip
drake said gates do his thing he dont bullshit
all you other niggas rap about is bullshit
studio on drugs and you get all in your feelings
look into your eyes nigga you aint ever lived it
but always talking cooking dope nigga ever had heart ache
ever lost money learning how to cook oil based
ever grind hard tryna pay for your lawyer
get him paid off and you still go to jail
and that bitch that you love dont pick up when you call her
fuckin with your nigga when you get out and you dog her
going with your mood with a nigga you dont argue
came here to die in the game im retarded
know its got a name i aint knowing what to call it
mama 3 way the call chopping game me and 40
freeman i look to you nigga and i love you
know you lost your parents but with me you got a brother
malaki and chris sprite all same trap
cousin lil quick telling me he wanna rap
uptown beezy the white house administration
get the paper had to see tyrese in a scrap
when his seatbelt strap make it hard to lean back
sittin up straight in the car with the shades on
young seven with the jensen and my main man gone
i was doing time up in rivers when he came home
now im waiting on a nigga for the get out of line
no drive by we jump out and dump where you grind
excuse me i meant to say where you spend time
you too scared to hustle you just wasting time
i used to spend nights with khalil and jaquincy
and his brother fucked with the ones who against me
stop making threats cause i swear i hate livin
you say you dont like me well shut up or kill me
well shut up or kill me
you say you dont like me well shut up or kill me
bitch shut up or kill me
hook
im a perfect imperfection
my craft has been perfected
i just need affection
emotionally imma introvert but it comes off as aggression
no one understand me and everybody cant be slow
its refreshing to find someone who thinks like me so i cant be wrong
im a perfect imperfection and i dont find interest in the radio
so everytime i get high i watch the time pass by like away we go
is it ok to cry when youre dying inside
