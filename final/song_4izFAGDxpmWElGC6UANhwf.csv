to return to the cold
it isnt much fun
to touch the trees no one has known
go rest your head cause you cant miss this

prechorus
poor boy became a slave to use

verse 2
now despair moves in so close
too many years free at last
he didnt know so learned to speak
he clears his throat cause you cant miss this

chorus
poor boy became a slave to use
rebuild whats left of this child so weak

bridge
sorry changes trample the plan
death stores victims once more
keep on burnin through the noose
keep on burnin through the noose
keep on burnin through the noose
keep on burnin through the noose
keep on

poor boy became a slave to use
rebuild whats left of this child so weak

outro
to return to the cold
it isnt much but im free at lastembed"
