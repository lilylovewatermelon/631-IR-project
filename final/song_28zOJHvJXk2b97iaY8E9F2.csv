well you never liked them much
but i broke out these old boots again
gonna jump in that old truck
head down to the bar and hang out with an old friend
been a while since i fired up a cigarette
and got drunk on some draft beer
well where i’m going tonight
there’s a good chance you won’t want me back here
i tried to be what you were looking for
but i can’t do that anymore

chorus
im better at being who i am
better at letting my rebel run
and nothing about me worth a damn
if i can’t be my old man’s son
your world and mine are worlds apart
this square peg round hole things too hard
being something that aint never had a chance
i’m better at being who i am

verse 2
i wasn’t ever gonna change
i don’t know who in the hell i thought i was kiddin’
for a little while there it seemed like the sex would make it all alright but it didn’t
this ain’t my side of the tracks
i got good at forgetting that

i’m better at being who i am
better at letting my rebel run
ain’t nothing about me worth a damn
if i can’t be my old man’s son
your world and mine are worlds apart
this square peg round hole things too hard
being something i ain’t never had a chance
i’m better at being back on my side of town
back down to earth
a blue jean boy and a flannel shirt
i’m just not what you deserve
for what it’s worth for what it’s worth

chorus
im better at being who i am
better at being where im from
aint nothing about me is worth a damn
if i can’t be my old man’s son
your world and mine are worlds apart
this square peg round hole things too hard
being something i aint never had a chance
i’m better at being who i amembed"
