met a girl thought she was grand
fell in love found out first hand
went well for a week or two
then it all came unglued

prechorus
in a trap trip i cant grip
never thought id be the one whod slip
then i started to realize
i was living one big lie

chorus
she fucking hates me
trust
she fucking hates me
la la la love
i tried too hard
and she tore my feelings like i had none
and ripped them away

verse 2
she was queen for about an hour
after that shit got sour
she took all i ever had
no sign of guilt
no feeling of bad no
