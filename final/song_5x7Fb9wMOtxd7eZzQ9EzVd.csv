that dj on the side stage aint played one song i like
its all craft beer served in here cant even get a cold bud light it aint right
i see you sittin over there barely sippin your drink
lookin like you might need a little scenery change
got a spot ive been hittin since back in the day
what ya say we slip away and say the hell with this place

chorus
go get a little gone girl on a black jack label
in the middle of a dirt road dance floor
way out nobody in our business
just us and the crickets and the good lord
stars gonna burn on out moon gonna sneak on down
we could have a hell of a time ill get to makin you mine
with the rest of whats left of the night til its gone girl

verse 2
gone like that six pack we gonna tip back on my hood
gone like our levis  gonna hang em on an old dogwood
yeah the thought of you and me in the back 40
with the trees and the bees and the birds
cant think of nothin better but baby no pressure
really all you gotta do is say the word

chorus
we can get a little gone girl on a black jack label
in the middle of a dirt road dance floor
way out nobody in our business
just us and the crickets and the good lord
stars gonna burn on out moon gonna sneak on down
we could have a hell of a time ill get to makin you mine
with the rest of whats left of the night til its gone girl
til its gone girl

chorus
lets get a little gone girl on a black jack label
