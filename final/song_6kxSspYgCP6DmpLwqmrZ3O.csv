and you play a twisted little game
but i know in a way
you need to complicate it
believe that though we never eat
we still know how to feed
we still know how to bleed oh

verse 2
my arms keep you in the room
barely let you move
show me what you do oh
tonight were secondguessed again
let me wrap the chains
addicted to the pain

do you wanna see how far it goes
do you wanna test me now my love
you must be crazy if you think that i will give in so easily
things we buried low
coming to the surface now my love
you must be crazy if you think that i will give up the game
oh whoa
