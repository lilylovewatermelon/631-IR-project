ive lied to you
the same way that i always do
this is the last smile
that ill fake for the sake of being with you

prechorus chester bennington  mike shinoda
everything falls apart even the people
who never frown eventually break down
the sacrifice of hiding in a lie
everything has to end youll soon find
were out of time left to watch it all unwind
the sacrifice is never knowing

chorus chester bennington
why i never walked away why i played myself this way
now i see youre testing me pushes me away
why i never walked away why i played myself this way
now i see youre testing me pushes me away

verse 2 chester bennington
ive tried like you
to do everything you wanted to
this is the last time
ill take the blame for the sake of being with you
