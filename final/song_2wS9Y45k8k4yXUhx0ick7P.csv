oh lord i once had a daddy
he said hed give me everything in sight

said hed give me everything in sight
i said hon i want the sunshine
and take the stars out of the night

i aint the kind of woman
whod make your life a bed of ease
im not the kind of woman
to make your life a bed of ease
yeah but if you just wanna go out drinkin honey
