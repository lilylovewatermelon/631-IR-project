search for the answers i knew all along
i lost myself
we all fall down
never the wiser of what ive become
alone i stand
a broken man

prechorus
all i have is one last chance
i wont turn my back on you
take my hand
drag me down
if you fall then i will too
and i cant save whats left of you

chorus
sing something new
i have nothing left
i cant face the dark without you
theres nothing left to lose
the fight never ends
i cant face the dark without you

verse 2
swallow me under and pull me apart
i understand theres nothing left
pain so familiar and close to the heart
no more no less i wont forget
come back down save yourself
i cant find my way to you
and i cant bear to face the truth
