verse 1 yung carecrow
carecrow rising while devisin
my master plan to move in silence
live through violence blood flow drivin me to kill a fuckboy hidin
manic schizo life dejected
dont think im soft cause im depressed bitch
just infected just neglected
always rejected but respected
lucifers firstborn of the fallen triple six scream bodies calling
ive evolved into revolving my own way of problemsolving murder murder murder murder murder
murder murder druggie junkie

zip up my brain six hundred and sixtysix stitches i feel the pain

hot as a block when the cops know the spot
cop a rock and then crack in his top leave him blue yeah yeah yeah yeah

bring the bodies to the swamp
leave em as bait for the chomp and im gone
