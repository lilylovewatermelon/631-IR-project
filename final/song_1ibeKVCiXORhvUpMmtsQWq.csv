i tried to be perfect but nothin was worth it
i dont believe it makes me real
i thought itd be easy but no one believes me
i meant all the things i said

chorus
if you believe its in my soul
id say all the words that i know
just to see if it would show
that im tryin to let you know
that im better off on my own

verse 2
this place is so empty my thoughts are so tempting
i dont know how it got so bad
sometimes its so crazy that nothing can save me
but its the only thing that i have

chorus
if you believe its in my soul
id say all the words that i know
just to see if it would show
that im tryin to let you know
that im better off on my own

verse 3
i tried to be perfect it just wasnt worth it
nothing could ever be so wrong
its hard to believe me it never gets easy
i guess i knew that all along

chorus
if you believe its in my soul
id say all the words that i know
just to see if it would show
that im tryin to let you know
that im better off on my own28embed"
