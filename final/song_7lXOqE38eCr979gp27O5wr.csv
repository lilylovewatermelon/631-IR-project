oh oh oh i
i was a city boy
right into dangers where id always run
a boy who had his fun
but i wouldnt have done
all the things that i have done
if i knew one day youd come
nah baby nah baby nah baby nah baby

verse 2
oh oh oh i
i know it breaks your heart
to picture the only one you wanna love
in someone elses arms
but i wouldnt have done
all the things that i have done
if i knew one day youd come
nah baby nah baby no baby nah baby

bridge
oh baby please lets leave the past behind us
behind us
so that we can go where love will find us
yeah will find us
i know most girls would leave me
but i know that you believe me
