“kynez was a good baby” ma’dear told the producer “real good he never gave me no trouble at all no he didnt he almost never cried a little bit here and there like a normal child but beyond that no…he was good real good he had a good behavior”

“what was he like cognitively” the producer asked the producers director of photography fiddled in front of the camera he kept his eyes on to watch ma’dear as he recorded her the sound girl sat still nearly asleep madear pat at her nose thinking it was shining she hated that kept tissue in her purse for it she had done a few of these by now it was all so much more technical and drawn out boring even than tv ever show madear always heat up too much under the lights one time she got faint

“what” she asked the producer

“cognitively you know how would you say he thought on a cognitive basis”

“say again” madear squinted

“were his intellectual capabilities and intelligence on par with other kids his age would you say did he enjoy learning activities on par with other children his age”

“oh that kind of stuff well oh sure i suppose so”

i left the living room for the kitchen poured myself some red koolaid but i could still hear madear thought back

“well i guess kynez started counting and knowing his letters all that same time as these other kids ‘bout three he pottytrained a little later than my girl but not too late no nothing out of the ordinary kynez was a creative child he liked to color with them…them…crayons all the time he get a box on his birthday or christmas and every last one of them crayons be worn down to the nub by time easter come and hed want me to buy more hed just draw and draw”

“oh really what did kynez like to draw”
“well whatever kids draw i dont know rainbows trains cars trucks houses dogs cats fire trucks anything anything at all i got so tired of putting his little stuff up on that there refrigerator and these walls oh he’d tickle me so with all his mess”

“did any of his drawings have indication of violence or deviant tendencies”
“oh no none at all like i say he mostly draw rainbows and simple stuff he loved trains animals and crosses even with angels around them kynez loved the lord very much he was a good kid it wasn’t ‘til”

“oh missus madison we have towait theres…we still rolling oh”

then “we got broll”

finally just as i came out to watch and put my two cents in “ok…looks like i’m out of tape thank you so much well be back next week i think ok cut”

in 21 days my brother my twin my dawg my homie my partner my best friend mi amigo my uncle my don my bonnie my clyde my tonto my grandmas son and my mothers brother will be executed by the state of indiana by lethal injection by law

i’m a witness i turned paperwork into the department of corrections last week again to make sure kynez put my name on his list asked for me specifically out of just three or four people he got room for he already had a lastminute 120day reprieve for him to fantasize on freedom for his lawyers to grasp for straws for reporters to knock on our door for strangers who didnt know him before to hear his name now for the ones of us who do know him to sit in limbo and wait and remember for this giant and monstrous and really real thing thats been an elephant in our dark rooms for eight years to keep its control over our lives and do something not even god can do stop time

two days after that im supposed to get married about that i aint so sure i didnt plan for the dates to coincide why would i hes supposed to be gone already funeral got to be sped up or put off just cause im marrying my girl god forbid it all winds up on the same day everybody at my wedding talking about him crying and shit while im supposed to be dancing and happy and drunk every time my anniversary roll around theres a memory more outstanding than that a chill over it an evil twin to it a hyde am i supposed to carry the flowers from the funeral home and use them at the church for the wedding do we bring all the cakes left over from his repast to my reception hall just in case we run out and need extras i dont know it makes no sense

“well…when im tired of waiting spencer” denetria had badgered

“after the execution” i told her at one time that time was last summer then it became this past winter i would turn up my music bob my head press the headphones deep into my ear drums to jay and pac kanye and common lauryn and mos ti

but the initial execution was put off twice a few times and a few months not stayed just appealed twice bullshit new evidence his lawyers claimed now last minute its been nine years what could they know about now they couldnt know about then how come it took them so long to find out what about all the time he spent in there already whos paying that back what about all the times they told him all of us this shit would all be reversed how many times you think you can get peoples hopes up and then go right back to what it was all along people aint puppets

shakes aint talking he aint really eating he aint going out he aint showering he aint taking his meds he aint giving interviews he aint begging for commissary cash hes writing to us every day sending note after note after note home in perfect cursive one line hieroglyphics the next line a comic strip on the next and illustrations at the end having to do with god and the devil and jesus i dont open mine no more madear open hers and mine too she claim they make some sense and she can understand ‘em and im just not trying hard enough i heard that one before

but she aint my mama shes really his shes just my grandma shakes was born a few months before i was my mother was just in high school with sickle cell anemia and a kentucky fried chicken job and a boyfriend who came by for a while when i was brand new once they graduated he went off to college in the south and married a cheerleader he met on a campus during freaknik so kynez and me raised together all our life are really like brothers ma died when she was 25 i was 9 its been 25 years since i saw her face outside a picture frame or figment of my imagination im over it i guess now my life is about looking at shakes pictures with madear talking about my daughter with denetria and basically being run around told what to do…by everybody
“serenitys gonna be in preschool next year” denetria used to remind me “i found a good one off in hammond all the parents i met at the orientation work fulltime at the casino and the hospital theyre married went to college got big pretty rings spencer i dont want my daughter walking up in there the only one without a daddy”

“she got a daddy” i reminded denetria my girl my baby mama my fiancé

who was i a boogieman a leprechaun santa claus dropping off presents a fairy godfather whipping up captain crunch for breakfast and grilled cheese for dinner serenity aint got no damned daddy news to me

i have to watch my words denetria has the apartment not me all my stuff is just there i travel i suppose im liable to pull up one day and find my shit at the curb where would it go then my woman got the upper hand she remind me of it all the time

madears house is down the street from the horseshoe casino on 119th street same place its been since i was three my damned self it seem the pink brick onestory on the corner the big yard and chain link fence and doghouse in the back and three black dogs running to the front the rottweilers dont bite they just go crazy to get out the fence thats what i tell everybody who ride by or came to get me all these years the pink brick onestory on the corner after while it just came known as that this is where we was spencer and shakes one and the same together coming out the house with hightop fades lined up fresh crown royal sagging our hoodie pockets a couple blunts stuck in our socks and money clips on the timbos we were popular but that was back then now i realize we should have been paying more attention to more

all this magnifies fact i wound up working in the crematorium and incinerator associated with the lake country coroners office mostly dealing with lake county in indiana but having something or other to do with chicago sometimes the citys downtown is about fifteen miles away since nobody at work knows i know shakes he come on the news and i hear different perspective “that nigger crazy”…“let ‘em fry”… “how the fuck did not somebody see that coming” we didnt i stay quiet handle the cases and bodies and burials of people who have no next of kin or no money for coffins usually theyre people found randomly in motels and hotels and alleys and apartments in big buildings or little houses on unsettled but quiet blocks contrary to what most people think when they hear of a coroner and his office the majority of people ive ashed to a final grave werent at all murdered or killed in any violent ways usually it was pretty natural stuff the fact they have to be buried by paid strangers in a coroners office is usually the most unnatural thing about both how they lived and died

though i dont work in the offices i hear theyre bodies whose kids havent seen them in years or whose grandkids forgot their addresses or whose neighbors liked them enough to chitchat close to their doors but not enough to lend money for their headstones a lot of ‘em didnt have a regular doctor to sign the death certificate they come to me rolled in plastic and tarp and bound with twine theyve hardened and shrunk no matter who and what they were when alive theyre featureless and faceless and nameless but numbered with a tag on the plastic so we know which slot to put their cardboard box of ashes in down in the cool cellar when its been a year or two after the person was found but nobodys ever come to claim their ashes we bury the ashes in a communal plot donated by the county and paid for with sales from the deceaseds auctioned estates i wear a fiber filtration mask for the dust and the ashes and the fumes i wear paper booties and a jumpsuit for caution i listen to wgci when im working with a body and i watch wgn when i get a rest

now in 21 days before the sun rise shakes is gonna die the state i work for gets what it want the mothers and fathers and brother and sisters and uncles and aunts and cousins and friends of tina maples get what they want—and deserve according to most the white folks who see us every day like gangsters on the news and pass us in strack van till and carson pirie scott and bp amoco and the casino without so much as a kind word or one look in our direction with whatever ideas they keep from seeing us on the news will know they still runnin it theyll know they can run to the woods starting every october with license to shoot down deer who aint bothering nobody and they can even gloat about it put it on their walls show it off in back of pickups order restored reality checked a grave dug the lord avenged

shakes aint do it hes say that since day one do i believe him do i gotta choice weve watched him transform babyface grown wrinkled short fade gone dready bird chest gone pumped up wide eyes yellowed hes good behaved but like madear says in his movie he always has been nobody been more surprised about his outcome than us yeah we broke curfew we brought girls home when madear was at church we called ourselves trying to steal cars joyriding for a bit before parking ‘em right back in the garages of the friends whose parents were never none the wiser thats the stuff i want to think about and remember everything he done dumped on me from inside—the bloody fights the tough baloney sandwiches dropping the soap—i forgot or at least i try to dont do me no good to remember i dont know why its a film

madear cant settle on an outfit she want shakes to see her in for the last time ever i wanna tell her she aint picking out her dress for easter or the last big birthday party shes ever going to have shes dragged me to dsw and bakers to look for new shoes she still got hope we gonna find high heels with the toe part being wide enough to fit her bunions she got an appointment with miss vera to do her hair the day before so we can check in a motel in michigan city by at least noon the next day and have time to get settled and eat something and then go on to the facility for a visit if we get one then get back in our rooms to stick by the phone until shakes aint got no more time to call and then go back to the facility least two hours ahead of midnight to make sure all is well and we on time then after he goes to sleep we can get back to the motel to try to get some sleep ourselves in the morning we get to the michigan city medical examiners office to claim shakes body and bring him back home to us to bury him

“its all in divine order…” madear chants over and over and over “i swear ‘fore god ill break a commandment and kill somebody ‘fore i miss it we just going to a funeral and lord knows i been to plenty of those all this is two funerals in a row”

and the sisters from the church who keep on coming by just nod with her they pray they bring plates covered in aluminum foil cake chicken casseroles dressing she leaves me tupperware on the stove to take to work for lunch

denetria found a wedding dress at davids bridal with the back out and no sleeves her tattoos will show the one of her mother and fathers names one of my name one of serenitys a loopy downturned aries cross for herself the church is in chicago its gonna be the same one she was christened and baptized in its the one serenitys getting baptized in on sunday denetria wants carnations cause theyre cheap enough for her to fill the church with but her bouquet gotta be roses she keeps telling me she keeps going to macys on state street in chicago a couple of times with her girls the hot chicks at the mac counter make up her face in a variety of palettes she checks with me on each one i like none cause they change her face too much i tell her i like all shes gone to another store in macys for the stationary to print the invitations on the envelopes are purple the information inside is printed in gold on butter cream paper im supposed to go to davids bridal to get a tux with a purple bowtie and cummerbund sometime before the wedding im also supposed to notify a best man and a two other groomsmen to match her one sister and best friend from high school when they all walk down the aisle to “here and now” by luther vandross and gregory hines or “always and forever” by somebody whose name i just dont know i just go by what im told i got a mind whose gonna do it but i aint officially asked them yet ill do it in a few days i guess after the baptism they got to come get fitted for the same attire ill wear or at least similar denetria planned all this four months ago around valentines day soon as i gave her a cluster from zales when we woke up we had had sex it was supposed to be a promise ring but she took it and ran with it for more much
in 21 days my brother my twin my dawg my homie my partner my best friend mi amigo my uncle my don my bonnie my clyde my tonto my grandmas son and my mothers brother will be executed he got the first death order a few days after valentines day when i got engaged all of a sudden we found out about his date the very same day the minute i gave her a ring which denetria had pointed out herself she told me day and time for everything else i had no say about a week later i told her

“they set the date its gonna be ‘round that time start of the summer”

“well but ummm…i done told everybody ‘bout the wedding already”

“well tell ‘em something else shakes gonna die we gonna have to change it”

“thats tacky i mean i already had serenity damned near three years ago”

“whats one more year or a few more months”

“nigga you just dont want to do it thats all…you aint fooling nobody”

“aint trying to” i switched the record to a song more slow then i took off the headphones best i could do was make love to her and then i could run out to empire chinese for the shrimp fried rice veggie tempura and egg rolls she loves

she continued because she had my attention and i would listen “i mean its been almost ten years since all this started…i didnt even know you back then you dont even go see him no more i know its hard trust me im with you baby i deal with it when you deal with it im just saying we cant help it now keep our lives on hold you using all this as an excuse…”

she was partially right truth is i didnt much see the need for it i still dont in 21 days the state of indiana will take the one person ive told more secrets to than her and walk him into a chamber where im supposed to watch him go to sleep forever like a dog gone sick and never have one more chance to say “whats up” or “how you doin” or “happy birthday” or “merry christmas” and this is the law this is organized and ordained and practiced this is the way of the land now with rules and randomness like that i dont see how and why my rules of thinking im enough of a husband and father without all that fanciness isnt enough in my land i am here with my family all the time a phone call text email shout out blackplanet note away i “like” everybodys shit on facebook i come when im called to everybody gave up my life for them everybody everything little of it had much to do with me but serenity shes mine that much i admit i dont deny i could have been more responsible i cant blame or scorn her for that the rest of it well i got swept up

shakes started smoking weed when we was about 13 he dropped out of school when he was 16 i couldnt i actually liked it i was on the basketball team gym teacher recommended me point guard at calumet ‘cb‘ average it could have been a ‘b if i had tried just a tad bit harder but all that didnt appeal to me i went to classes all week practice after classes kfc on friday and saturday if i didnt have a game church on sundays kfc hired me because they remembered my mother kfc kept me because they remembered my mother i was always late i brought home more than my share of buckets and biscuits got to the point where madear and shakes and everybody else depended on me for it then got to the point where shakes wasnt here

shakes was in and out for a few years leaving behind a son to boot for madear to take care of shakes just had to have a baby by a chick who was worse off into that life than his ass was janice still pop up every now and again after shakes got convicted she dropped their kid off one sunday after church and disappeared for the next two weeks then madear said “thats it” she wouldnt let it out of her sight ever since madear sometimes acts mad at me like the boy is mine jamesll be 12 a few weeks after the execution hes too young to witness he still remember shakes though with some pride it took me a couple of years to get him off my back like i was his daddy and not his cousin but i guess now after all thats happened and all the talk he understands hes accepted it or at least he pretends to hes in the seventh grade now taller than me and his daddy shakes been locked up whole time hes been in school so the boy hasnt had to explain or talk about it he got his mamas last name—perry—and not ours—madison so nobody associate him with any of it weve kept it quiet for his own good

on y2k 2000 when everybody i knew had filled up their bathtubs with water and the cabinets with canned goods and the cars with gas and the minds with nonsense shakes was out and about with one or more of the unsavories he brought by the house whom madear told him not to bring back i hadnt met denetria yet i was with another chick at the time i remember her name was felicia she kept me plenty occupied for this i was grateful and on y2k 99 going to 2000 when the folks who had some money was worried about computers losing it and the folks who didnt have money worried about computers messing up government checks me and shakes wasnt worried nothing much was going to change for us either way i just would have been annoyed if the streetlights hadnt worked no more like everybody predicted

maybe all the scrambling we were supposed to believe would go on would erase the bills my relatives had run up in my name without paying or all the parking tickets i owed in my own name so for me it was all a good thing stay in the house until everybody else got over the mayhem get used to actually counting out change and saving money in the top drawer again i had a couple grand on me from kfc where i was had been since graduation i never scored more than a 16 on the act so my options were limited i was at calumet college staying warmed up and tight on the lake michigan courts thinking of a transfer but honestly just content where i was why wouldnt i be the pink brick onestory house on the corner was paid for the bills minimal the clubs in chicago just thirty minutes away up and down the tollway i could have left it all before the job big mama denetria the name the story i could have been free

shakes was into some other stuff i didnt quite know about or understand nor did i want to it was above my head and my means i always been yellowhearted he used to be somebody the ladies who knew me haggled me about “where shakes where shakes at call that fine nigga…” dressed down and up depending on which way you was looking in karl kani fubu rocawear phat farm but he was smoking that weed every day and all day his lips turned black and thin like purple playdoh rolled out he lost a tooth by time he was going on nineteen he was on his way to two years in cook county boot camp for an east chicago corner store robbery where he drove the car but didnt have the pistol so he was spared the real deal boot camp waiting list was so long he got out early a few weeks or months i dont remember all this shit exact then by time he was twenty he started to wear the same outfits a few days in a row and wipe off pools of sweat whenever he showed up to sit with me on the porch to see the dogs for a bit they still recognized him easy i didnt he shook he drooled he rambled he stunk of not enough deodorant but too much cologne he laughed crazy he was on that shit

“you need to get on out of madears house” he always told me his head stood an inch taller than mine even when we sat down on the porch his biceps pumped out of a dingy and torn muscle shirt like he was the one shooting layups as if he once thought his life depended on it i had on a down jacket he claimed he wasnt even cold

“im good” i had told him he wiped his nose with his bare forearm he didnt even mind the snowflakes come down on the mouth of the sunkist i suspected as his only meal before he appeared in the kitchen to devour all our bacon and eggs then he took a few video games he claimed he would bring right back and ran all the hot water out the shower so ma bitched later on she couldnt wash any white clothes until the night

and about two weeks after that last time we sat on the porch when we threw off a whole pack of raw bacon to the dogs knowin madear would hit the roof so we laughed in advance at her reaction when i shivered in my down jacket and shakes sweat in his bare arms the weather turned a bit friendlier the snow thawed on the indiana dunes near a stone quarry a salt worker saw tina maples body with part of her face blasted off but her oncepregnant belly intact—preserved in the snow like she had expected to come back after somebody forced her from a day at the mall to withdraw cash from a remote atm where brown and gray faces were recorded and one of them looked like shakes just a little bit



some five years ago in winter 2008 a white man who claimed he wasnt white “im jewish” showed up at the pink onestory brick house on the corner he brought a book with his name on the front and picture on the back to show us ma was impressed

now this wasnt about us it was about our neighbor state of illinois they had a governor sweet enough to commute a life back to everybody on death row over there damn if we could have just lived across indianapolis boulevard at the fringe of chicago shakes would have been one of them so this set other folks off to rebel and rally all of america to let capital punishment go robert and jessica lepavsky were the producers and directors of a movie of this husband and wife they mean well i guess got our information from shakes who gave it to his lawyers to pass robert lepavsky and his people dont look too different to me from the coaches who sat on rickys raggedy couch in boyz in the hood knowing the boy could barely read but they wanted him to make their schools into football champions regardless same thing here shakes had always been spoiled he could turn madear on with a look or a plea like it wasnt nothing and according to himself he wanted robert lepavsky lepavskys assistants and this documentary film company to tell his story for the whole world to know from here on out and madear was just gonna have to go along with that

just cause i knew somebody sitting in a six by nine jail cell on count of it i didnt have nothing to do with the decision to be part of no movies about the death penalty had i had something to do with it somebody would have been paying me and anybody else oncamera we wouldve had some royalties or something coming back here for it if hollywood had been my calling this aint the movie i would have auditioned for even if id been into making porn which im shamed to admit i have kinda sorta done just privately with willing subjects i wouldve gotten paid some real good money for it

the film crew is a bunch of people who all have jobs in the colleges in chicago where nobody i know can even get into i never say too much to the crew thankfully and respectfully only a few people robert comes with a bundle of two or three people to run a camera and lights and a microphone an hour maybe two gonna be compressed out of all these hundreds of hours of film they pushed out of our lives of course the most ridiculous or emotional or upsetting times gonna make the cut like a reality tv show we really are just normal people we work sleep talk eat watch television play spades get drunk get high drive around ordinary shit though the majority of the time is caught up with this big thing dumped in our lives nobody is gonna say it or talk about it we cant do anything about it so why should we talk about it

and some things just private i wasnt about to explain the nightmares i been having since all this started and not the ones you know are nightmares even when you sleep its something to be said for dreaming about a place you never seen or been with a cast full of faces you cant recognize its a little bit of control in that situation like watching a scary movie in the theatre with your friends but letting yourself be scared for fun but when you sleep and theres giant horses right in the same kitchen you just made a sandwich in or headless bodies on the same lawn your bedroom window faces or an impression of somebody you just talked to that day sketched in the trees by your house its harder to call it a dream in the moment the time span between what you did and what you dreamed is too short not to wonder what you might have missed the first time those the conditions under which i signed a waiver to be included in shakes movie just by default and for documentation i was halfasleep i wish i hadnt signed

everybody else got excited about it made the best of it its better than getting your ass kicked and weave tore out and relationship shattered on jerry springer just to be on television i suppose they thought my problem with the whole situation was the lack of reverence i mean if i was going into somebodys house and jail cell since technically thats somebodys house i would be somber and overcourteous im not saying robert and jessica arent anyone they bring around is gradea classy people but they all just seem a little bit too energetic and overeager given the context of the situation when their cameras stop rolling we keep going despite ordinary shit for us every single day

“i aint ‘bout to stop my life right along with it” madear said when it came up and it was just a front because her life stopped to doing nothing but talking bout shakes



iii

sodium thiopental will put shakes to sleep make him unconscious basically like hes about to get his teeth or appendix pulled out were just gonna wave we discussed

pancuronium bromide will stop his breathing but since hes sleep he wont know hes not taking any breaths thats the second shot

potassium chloride breaks his heart hell get that shot last and thats it



when my baby was born january 2010 i was 26 years old and unhappy working at kentucky fried chicken it was getting embarrassing to be a nearly sixfoot tall man with a sixpack—but wearing an apron and bonnet to work i only made barely 10 dollars an hour the only glory in it was i could say i had become a supervisor this humiliation was especially since my woman was a retail manager at carson pirie scott in the juniors and lingerie sections she brought home sexy dresses and lace underwear and designer baby clothes i brought home fried chicken it didnt match up i felt least i could do was bring home a decent paycheck—with some real benefits health insurance life insurance savings for my babies

by this time everybody was starting to look for jobs online i didnt have the internet at home yet libraries always been too quiet for me i went to the back of a few papers and saw information about the oil fields stockyards kirby vacuum cleaner sales chicago bridge operators the coroners office was hiring this was the government i thought it would be more stable give me more days off and sound more prestigious i went to the office in crown point for a group interview with about eight other people mostly men and one mexican woman when they asked what qualified us for the position i talked about being used to handling animal parts in high heat for whatever reason i wasnt called back i called the office a few times over the next month to find out when they would be looking for people again i was told that was it for the year

but one day i got to the pink brick onestory on the corner and there was a message for me on the machine i was invited in for another interview then i was sent to a doctors office in crown point to do a drop i stopped smoking weed on the september 2001 morning shakes was convicted so it was clear i was hired a few days later and in a paidorientation by the next week after a few months of checks i was able to book for me and denetria to go on an apple vacation to jamaica for a holiday after a year of checks i could pay for half her rent and a brand new dodge saturn for myself after two years of checks i decided to go to school for business and mortuary science degrees if i took a little more time to save i could keep student loans out of my hair

i always regret i never gave proper notice to my manager at kfc mystery harris worked with my mother at the same kfc back when they were in high school of course since it was only a few miles away and we had gotten hooked on it over all these years me quitting didnt stop us from going through the drivethrough the people i knew and worked with always seemed to wait on denetria and madear when i wasnt around whenever i went up there i got the new faces—silly young girls who gossiped while they took my order they seemed to be mean ugly people who never said “thanks”

i knew mystery worked the morning shift on saturdays she was old enough not to care about going out no more and all the teenagers who worked there still needed their friday nights i dont know why it hit me one day but i wanted to go see her ever since the date was set for shakes i hadnt been able to get to sleep or stay there i get up like this again on saturday early i let the dogs out to do their business i let them back in i watch an auditorium church service on television i heat up a frozen pack of pancakes eggs and sausages i drink all the orange juice i play with myself like i usually do after a few nights of staying away from denetrias at the pink brick onestory on the corner with madear instead i watch some cartoons i wash the dishes by the time madear is unlocking her bedroom door ive gone out to the car to go get lunch and dinner for the day madear appears at the door all of a sudden just as i had pulled off

“spencer spencer” she yells i pull the car back a little bit

“any mail” she asks

i put the car in park get out and open the black box we had erected on the fence to keep the dogs from confronting the postman it was empty and hollow as a sewer tunnel i shake my head and head back to the car

“where you going” madear yells

“ill be back” i yell i dont want to get sidetracked into errands im not shakes             im free

iv

mystery was past 50 but you couldnt tell her that she only put her bonnet on when the health inspectors showed up otherwise she had her shoulderlength red hair curled for work and this bright plum lipstick used to smell so sweet when she got up in my face she always wore big earrings herself but got on the girl workers to only wear studs she had a son who only used his fathers last name one time—when mystery twisted it on the application so the franchise owner wouldnt know they were related she even had grandchildren—two one way past serenitys age at only nine oclock in the morning it isnt busy at kfc it isnt even open i park my saturn walk up to the drivethrough window knock on the glass and smile big

one of the things been going on since last fall is people been remembering shakes when they would have otherwise forgotten all about him and us thats cause hes been in the news for the least little thing ever since his first date was announced in the winter and with every news report every psychiatric test his lawyers demand every interview his crusaders give every stunned politician who gets a question about his execution and even the reemergence of a juror who said she would have decided differently if she had known he failed math a couple of paragraphs are printed or spoken about his murder of tina maples 14 years before so people stay reminded they remember and know kynez thomas madison also known as “shakes” got himself hooked on heroin when he could have done a million other things with his life and then he tried to rob a stranger who turned out to be feisty and pregnant he killed her and her baby for approximately 500 she was able to withdraw from harris bank at once

although its a test of peoples character and trust i could have done without i figure the folks who actually bring up shakes are real the phonies who skirt around the obvious fact of him are untrustworthy first mystery grabs me by my shoulders and swings me so hard i lose my breath

“hey stranger” is her greeting its been a couple of years since ive seen her true but “i stop by all the time” i tell her “you just aint never in here”

“oh now you must got the wrong place…im always here alright” mystery says

she asks me if i want something to eat i tell her i dont she has her man in the back drop me some wings anyway she brings a small container of potato salad and a few biscuits to the counter where i stand i reach over into the back bins for plastic packets of honey within five minutes of mystery letting me into the back door and drawing a bit of a blush out of me shes talking about it

“how madear doing with all this mess going with shakes” she asks while she looks down to get the days three cash registers ready

“shes alright” i say “shes been wanting to go shopping for new clothes to wear to everything wants him to remember her right”

“its just such a damn shame” mystery says “first her daughter joanne your mama and now her only son”

“dont forget her husband” i say grandaddy was a bit older than madear he had worked in the oil refinery since he was eighteen and his high school teachers father made him one of the scarce black boys hired it all but paid for the pink brick onestory house on the corner but it made him sick by the time he was fifty he was bonychested and coughing up black stuff i never really got to know him all that well

“oh yes” mystery says “i had just started working here with your mama ‘round the time her daddy died well least madear got you out of all of it grandkids”

i crack apart a wing and concentrate on it im not about to go into the weight on my shoulders from being madears only living descendant besides serenity whom she had once all but taken over until denetria grew suspicious and possessive and hip had i not rushed out of the house before she woke up today i would have gotten a laundry list of work to do—none of it having to do with me my life or my wishes of course i pick up her high blood pressure medicine i open cans her arthritis would otherwise keep shut i shovel the dog shit in the yard and bury it in a deep pit near the shed i stand on the dining room chairs and atop the mattresses to swipe the dust bunnies off the ceiling and ceiling fans i go to the store nearly every day for something she had meant to get the day before i carry some stuff down to the basement and i carry other stuff up from it i catch the mice and trap the garters i feed the dogs i unpack the bags i answer the telephone and the door im the main one shes still cooking for every day way too much then im the one who drove around passing the leftovers out

“yeah shes still trying to spoil somebody” i tell mystery “serenity got so many clothes and toys…”

“oh serenity” mystery shrieks “her mama came in her about last year some time i think around the fourth she such a pretty little ole thang”

“thats my baby” i say “shes getting baptized tomorrow”

“now isnt that precious”

“yeah and you know im getting married”

“what” mystery yells i blush again and more given how much its constantly talked about close to home i forget the outside world dont know nothing about it

“yeah in a couple of weeks matter of fact” i explain mystery checks the pop machines and fusses with extra sleeves of cups to sit atop it she glances at the clock—close to 1000 am and opening time—with her back to me while she speaks

“now that is good news” she says “thats the kind of stuff they need to be telling us in these papers not all folks other business who got killed drugs gangs…”

“yeah i decided last valentines day to gone ahead and make that move”

“now are you just telling me or are you inviting me”

“you know youre invited ill make sure denetria drop off an invitation”

“no no no” mystery wags her finger “dont you bring my invitation to this place i dont like for none of these people in here to know my business shoot i might have to call off or say im sick if they need me to work that day”

we hear the back door slam in seconds a small girl appears at the cash register to punch in her employee numbers i say “good morning”

“you late mazzie” mystery says

“yeah yeah yeah…” without so much as a look in my direction the girl slips to the back mystery glares to the back with her eyes slit and her hands on her hips

“now that girl is late every single day spencer…every single day”

i lower my head and i shake it

“shes on parole” mystery whispers

she turns to grab a large round chicken bucket from atop the empty rotisseries and dark shelves a familiar allconsuming homey and spicy smell envelopes the restaurant as the fryer man in back prepares to fill these for the first part of the day

“what” i roll my eyes as mystery leans in closer to continue

“now her parole officer had to beg me to hire her”

“man what she do” i ask

“hooking to a undercover cop and then offered him drugs on top of it”

“damn”

“now somebody look past all that to give you a job and you cant even be on time” mystery switches to the back i already know what shes doing shes going to stuff a bucket of chicken and few paper bags of biscuits for me to carry home she remembers we like wings breasts and thighs—no drumsticks and for my wedding present she will drop off what she can for serenitys baptism dinner at the house she is one of the real fam ones we can trust i suspect shes not in it to gossip and she dont look at us like we did anything wrong to bring this down to our names i bet she wont even tell nobody she saw me it feels good to be just another person on just another day



v

its all only twenty days away so we may as well get a break on cooking i ran around too much getting home too late to partially bring home lunch and dinner so madear wont have to cook saturday shell get sunday shes been complaining about her knees and james is here tonight again i put the two buckets of chicken on top of the stove free for all who come by and if the last few weeks is any indication there will be visitors—the film people a few reporters church folks the neighborhood though i dont know how much the reporters or film folks ive seen like kentucky fried chicken they bring evian bottles trail mix granola bars they dont even drink from our glasses

on my way to the bathroom to move around what mystery stuffed me with i see a lump in the gray plaid covers on madears bed one little brown foot with a few of his toes stuck out of the covers james is snoring usually james takes over the couch or the bed when he visits now hes in madears bed this is new shes been moving to the couch little by little night by night my stomach churns and i feel like im heavier just as im bout to sit on the throne the telephone rings i answer the phone its denetria

“you staying there or coming here tonight” she asks me “we got to get your stuff put up tonight ‘cause tomorrow we gotta get to church early”

denetrias mother father and aunt will travel from milwaukee to attend serenitys baptism they may spend the night since denetria is always going up there and complains no one comes to see her they think i simply stay over from timetotime we usually take my records coats personal items and other things down to denetrias storage bin in the basement of the complex we know her aunt and mother like to snoop

“ill be there” i tell her with the solstice coming it takes longer for the sun to set a few weeks ago i would have been there by now but madear is frazzled and talking to herself playing records and pouring gin i can stay in a few weeks ill spend every single night with denetria or maybe i wont something tells me ill still be split between two homes the wedding is just a formality something the women want from me they need to see it get dressed up smell the flowers drink the aldis champagne dance twirl frosty figurines from the top of a cake ill be there i have to be

on my way to my small old bedroom where pictures of all of us in rusty and sagging picture frames with the images having none of the power to pierce my imagination and memory like they had before to give me dreams where the laughter is out loud to keep me knowing any body i burn can not feel it madear stops me

“come dance with me” she says she gave me a promise few days ago she will not talk about shakes anymore make me read his letters force me to recall stories ive forgotten or do anything at all but keep our plans for me to drive her up and back while i watch what we have to watch so shes gotten creative in talking to me about other things it seems she sits in the dark on the couch in the living room i hear “little things mean a lot” and nat king cole from the cassette tape player she taps the fake stained glass lamp atop her candle and incenselit altar to my mother and her own big mamas the ones i never knew and would never meet she stands up in the yellow light

“madear man im tired” i groan but she has me in a grip

“you too old now to dance with your grandmama” she asks

“naw” i tell her “im tired”

madear is soft and jiggly with tart breath and sloppiness and warmth she has freckles at her collarbones around the boat neck of her house dress madear used to dress like a boss widebrimmed hats scarves down to her knees boots up to her thighs platform shoes short leather skirts suede coats and jackets and now her body flops about in clothes the size of drapes and her scalp stays tight under prickly largesize green rollers i grumble into her arms all the way the telephone rings we both know its denetria again she uses serenity as excuse to get me onto the phone

“my grandbaby wants to talk to her daddy” madear says

“and her greatgrandma too” i say “to say goodnight”

but she doesnt release me the telephone stops

“i saw mystery today” i tell her my feet dont move and only my hips waist

“oh my goodness” madear feels to warm all over “mystery no wonder smell of fried chicken woke me up your mamas little friend they were so tight back then they were true friend she was”

“she said shes gonna come to the wedding”

the cassette tape begins to hiccup

“of course she deserve an invitation just past midnight now we on sunday thank god wedding in 21 days it is 21 days now that child ordered the cake yet”

“she said she gonna do it next week”

“stay away from that buttercream you know my sugar”

“madear i cant tell denetria nothing about this wedding she gonna do what she wanna do”

“get used to it”

she sighs we dance the cassette tape works itself out its smooth once more

“just so you know i done cut my part of the filming in that movie” she says

oh

“jessica come callin me today ‘bout something im sick of it i told ‘em no more then i hung up the phone”

“what happened”

madears laugh is like a grumble

“robert come callin me back all frantic miss madison…miss madison i told him ‘enough they got other folks for they damned movie and enough material or they should have by now mightve been them calling back just now”

from the bedroom off to the side james starts coughing and sounds like a whistle without a pea

“see this child here getting sick and we got a baptism tomorrow and a wedding in 21 days” madear continues “i told them film people to gone on we too busy for that”

“but i thought we signed a contract” i ask

“i aint signed nothing not a damned thang say i gotta keep on working just they can use my likeness and words”

“okay we should make sure…”

“im sure so far i been being generous letting them come ‘round more than i thought they was going to at the end of the day shakes said he wanted to be in some movie to stop the death penalty his decision wont help any of us now”

but she catches herself gets creative

“i think one of the dogs is sick” madear claims

i hadnt noticed that they seemed fine and friendly to me

“which one” i ask her

“the lil one” she says “been just throwing up whining listless sick and tired”

i hadnt noticed that at all but i decide ill let madear be right for the next 19 days and many more after them probably she will need to be so she is right and we dance and we laugh and she falls asleep on the couch with hair rollers untangling to the floor my dreams—or nightmares depending on how you look at it but ive had so many that could fit in that category im so used to it i cant single some out—include the task of burning shakes body down down to ash at my incinerator i know its him but i continue on like its another with the crackle and spittle of the fire sparking orange ashes and flames breathed by dragons i cant see or hear or stop i sleep well thoughembed"
