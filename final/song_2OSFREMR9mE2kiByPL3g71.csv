you and i were two old and tortured souls
repaired by a love of broken things
in a life just some bodies growin old
no fear of the end of anything

chorus
were just ordinary people you and me
time will turn us into statues eventually

verse 2
we got by though we never needed much
a sliver of hope no diamond rings
we got high it was heaven it was hell
flyin over them with broken wings

chorus
were just ordinary people you and me
time will turn us into statues eventually
ohoh
just two ordinary people you and me
time will turn us into statues eventually

bridge
our bones forever in stone
monuments of life
to dust as everything must
fade away in time ohohohoh
see foo fighters liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likeinstrumental break

chorus
were just ordinary people you and me
time will turn us into statues eventually
ohoh
just two ordinary people you and me
ohoh
time will turn us into statues eventually3embed"
