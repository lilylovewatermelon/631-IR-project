the walls between the walls between
you and i you and i
always pushing us apart nothing left but scars fight after fight
the space between the space between
our calm and rage rage
started growing shorter disappearing slowly day after day

prechorus
i was sitting there waiting in my room for you
you were waiting for me too
and it makes me wonder

chorus
the older i get
will i get over it
its been way too long for the times we missed
i didnt know then it would hurt like this but i think
the older i get
maybe ill get over it
its been way too long for the times we missed
i cant believe it still hurts like this

verse 2
the time between the time between
those cutting words words
built up our defenses never made no sense it just made me hurt
do you believe do you believe
that time heals all wounds all wounds
it started getting better but its easy not to fight when im not with you you
see skillet liveget tickets as low as 60you might also likeprechorus
i was sitting there waiting in my room for you
you were waiting for me too
and it makes me wonder

chorus
the older i get
will i get over it
its been way too long for the times we missed
i didnt know then it would hurt like this but i think
the older i get
maybe ill get over it
its been way too long for the times we missed
i cant believe it still hurts like this

bridge
what was i waiting for what was i waiting more
i shouldve taken less and given you more
i shouldve weathered the storm
i need to say so bad
what were you waiting for what were you waiting for
this could have been the best we ever had
oh

chorus
the older i get
will i get over it
its been way too long for the times we missed
i didnt know then it would hurt like this but i think
the older i get
maybe ill get over it
its been way too long for the times we missed
i cant believe it still hurts like this
hurts like this
outro
im just getting older
im not getting over you
im trying to
wish it didnt hurt like this
its been way too long for the times we missed
i cant believe it still hurts like this2embed"
