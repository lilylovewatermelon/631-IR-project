i was just a normal guy life was just a nine to five
with bills and pressure piled up to the sky
she never asked she knew id been hangin with my wilder friends
lookin for some other way to fly

verse 2
and three days straight was no big feat could get by with no food or sleep
and crazy was becomin my new norm
id pass out on the bedroom floor
and sleep right through the calm before the storm

chorus
my life was just an old routine every day the same damn thing
i couldnt even tell i was alive
i tell you the high cost of livin
aint nothin like the cost of livin high

verse 3
that southern baptist parkin lot was where id go to smoke my pot
an sit there in my pickup truck and pray
starin at that giant cross just reminded me that i was lost
and it just never seemed to point the way

verse 4
as soon as jesus turned his back id find my way across the tracks
lookin just to score another deal
with my back against that damn eightball
i didnt have to think or talk or feel
you might also likechorus
my life was just an old routine every day the same damn thing
i couldnt even tell i was alive
i tell you the high cost of livin
aint nothin like the cost of livin high

verse 5
my whole life went through my head layin in that motel bed
watchin as the cops kicked in the door
i had a job and a piece of land my sweet wife was my best friend
but i traded that for cocaine and a whore

verse 6
with my newfound sobriety ive got the time to sit and think
of all the things i had and threw away
this prison is much colder than
that one that i was locked up in just yesterday

chorus
my life is just an old routine every day the same damn thing
hell i cant even tell if im alive
i tell you the high cost of livin
aint nothin like the cost of livin high

outro
i tell you the high cost of livin
it aint nothin like the cost of livin high
just leave that stuff alone1embed"
