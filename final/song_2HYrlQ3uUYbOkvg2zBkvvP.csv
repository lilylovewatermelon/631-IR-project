now i can say i know more now than i used to
now i be doing missions that you rookies couldnt do
and i got special moves that you losers cant use
imma float right here and eat his soul with a spoon
if she wanna see me tell her look up at the moon
im coming with my squad to your section very soon
and when we pull up expect your women to be swooned
and watch your little teammates scurry like raccoons
imma break a rapper ass very very soon
well fuck that rapping shit ill send that nigga through the roof
i wont believe a damn thing till i see some proof
im the truth
and the truth is you rappers just some fools
you bitch

verse 2 chris travis
bitch im fully charged like a new iphone
christmas lights im in the dark smoking like a burning home
ion hear a damn thing but the silence in my zone
let me know where you wanna go
i can leave you ghost
slit your throat
leave you on the boat with a bloody note
you a joke and ion like the ho
leave you to the ghost
bitch im about money motherfuck these hoes
smoke good weed and i get free clothes
waterboyz ganging and your bitch deepthroat
youtube booming dont need a vevo
better get your squad if you talking dlow
pull up quick like a 6 speed show
lets get rich then go see mo
backyard looking like a damn sea show
chris fuckin travis gotta let he know
ill never play motherfucker she know
gotta get cake and stay real low
and watch how we move cause the squad gonna blow bitchyou might also like3embed"
