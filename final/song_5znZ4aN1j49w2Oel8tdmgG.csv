she is not scared to die
best things in life drive her to cry
crucify then learn

chorus
take so much away from inside you
makes no sense you know he cant guide you
hes your fucking shoulder to lean on
sit and watch me burn be strong
take so much away from inside you
makes no sense you know he cant guide you
hes your fucking shoulder to lean on
be strong

verse 2
shes led to believe that itd be okay
look at your face
scarred in dismay
but times have changed and so have you
i think id rather crucify than learn

chorus
take so much away from inside you
makes no sense you know he cant guide you
hes your fucking shoulder to lean on
sit and watch me burn be strong
take so much away from inside you
makes no sense you know he cant guide you
hes your fucking shoulder to lean on
be strong

id like to take you down
and show you deep inside my life my inner working
to smell and lack of inner pride
to touch upon the surface is not for what it seems
i take away my problems
but only in my dreams

refrain
take so much away from inside you
makes no sense you know he cant guide you
hes your fucking shoulder to lean on
be strong
take so much away from inside you
makes no sense you know he cant guide you
hes your fucking shoulder to lean on
be strong

chorus
crucify then learn
take so much away from inside you
makes no sense you know he cant guide you
hes your fucking shoulder to lean on
sit and watch me burn be strong
take so much away from inside you
makes no sense you know he cant guide you
hes your fucking shoulder to lean on
crucify then learn be strong
take so much away from inside you
makes no sense you know he cant guide you
hes your fucking shoulder to lean on
sit and watch me burn be strong
take so much away from inside you
makes no sense you know he cant guide you
hes your fucking shoulder to lean on
crucify then learn be strong
take so much away from inside you
makes no sense you know he cant guide you
hes your fucking shoulder to lean on
sit and watch me burn be strong
take so much away from inside you
makes no sense you know he cant guide you
hes your fucking shoulder to lean on
crucify then learn be strong
take so much away from inside you
