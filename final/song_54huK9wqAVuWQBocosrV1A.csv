i got my five
and i don’t want to think
about my job anymore
i’m gonna pay my blinds
fold most of the time
i ain’t afraid to shoot it out with anyone
there’s gotta be much more
to this game than luck
sunglasses on my hand is strong
gotta smile inside myself
so what you got kid
i call you out cause i’m all in
in a smoke filled room
the end is coming soon
i’m short stacked with a pair of jacks
and it’s time to make my move
he raised ten
i called all in
my pair’s no match to
the straight he had
next monday i’ll be at it againyou might also likeembed"
