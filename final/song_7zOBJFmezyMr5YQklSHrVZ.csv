fools
they dont know what theyre on about
those fools
dont get my dreams

chorus
and i want it i want it i want it
and i want it i want it i want it
all
you cant wait to watch me fall

singin stories on a wrecking ball
colliding fast
to bring you down

if you want it you want it you want it
if you want it you want it you want it
all
sometimes things we build to fall
