take me down to the river bend
take me down to the fighting end
wash the poison from off my skin
show me how to be whole again
fly me up on a silver wing
past the black where the sirens sing
warm me up in a novas glow
and drop me down to the dream below

chorus mike shinoda mike shinoda  chester bennington
cause im only a crack
in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see
for you to see

verse 2 mike shinoda  chester bennington
bring me home in a blinding dream
through the secrets that i have seen
wash the sorrow from off my skin
and show me how to be whole again

chorus mike shinoda  chester bennington
cause im only a crack
in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see
for you to see

cause im only a crack
in this castle of glass
hardly anything else i need to be

cause im only a crack
in this castle of glass
hardly anything there for you to see
