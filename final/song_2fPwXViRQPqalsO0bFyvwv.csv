names of people the duchesse de guermantes — saintloup at doncières — mme de villeparisis at home — my grandmother’s illness — bergotte’s illness — the duke and the doctor — decline and death of my grandmother

   the twittering of the birds at daybreak sounded insipid to françoise every word uttered by the maids upstairs made her jump disturbed by all their running about she kept asking herself what they could be doing in other words we had moved certainly the servants had made no less noise in the attics of our old home but she knew them she had made of their comings and goings familiar events now she faced even silence with a strained attention and as our new neighbourhood appeared to be as quiet as the boulevard on to which we had hitherto looked had been noisy the song distinct at a distance when it was still quite faint like an orchestralmotif of a passerby brought tears to the eyes of a françoise in exile and so if i had been tempted to laugh at her in her misery at having to leave a house in which she was ‘so well respected on all sides’ and had packed her trunks with tears according to the use of combray declaring superior to all possible houses that which had been ours on the other hand i who found it as hard to assimilate new as i found it easy to abandon old conditions i felt myself drawn towards our old servant when i saw that this installation of herself in a building where she had not received from the hallporter who did not yet know us the marks of respect necessary to her moral wellbeing had brought her positively to the verge of dissolution she alone could understand what i was feeling certainly her young footman was not the person to do so for him who was as unlike the combray type as it was possible to conceive packing up moving living in another district were all like taking a holiday in which the novelty of one’s surroundings gave one the same sense of refreshment as if one had actually travelled he thought he was in the country and a cold in the head afforded him as though he had been sitting in a draughty railway carriage the delicious sensation of having seen the world at each fresh sneeze he rejoiced that he had found so smart a place having always longed to be with people who travelled a lot and so without giving him a thought i went straight to françoise who in return for my having laughed at her tears over a removal which had left me cold now shewed an icy indifference to my sorrow but because she shared it the ‘sensibility’ claimed by neurotic people is matched by their egotism they cannot abide the flaunting by others of the sufferings to which they pay an ever increasing attention in themselves françoise who would not allow the least of her own ailments to pass unnoticed if i were in pain would turn her head from me so that i should not have the satisfaction of seeing my sufferings pitied or so much as observed it was the same as soon as i tried to speak to her about our new house moreover having been obliged a day or two later to return to the house we had just left to retrieve some clothes which had been overlooked in our removal while i as a result of it had still a ‘temperature’ and like a boa constrictor that has just swallowed an ox felt myself painfully distended by the sight of a long trunk which my eyes had still to digest françoise with true feminine inconstancy came back saying that she had really thought she would stifle on our old boulevard it was so stuffy that she had found it quite a day’s journey to get there that never had she seen such stairs that she would not go back to live there for a king’s ransom not if you were to offer her millions — a pure hypothesis — and that everything everything that is to say to do with the kitchen and ‘usual offices’ was much better fitted up in the new house which it is high time now that the reader should be told — and told also that we had moved into it because my grandmother not having been at all well though we took care to keep this reason from her was in need of better air — was a flat forming part of the hôtel de guermantes

   at the age when a name offering us an image of the unknowable which we have poured into its mould while at the same moment it connotes for us also an existing place forces us accordingly to identify one with the other to such a point that we set out to seek in a city for a soul which it cannot embody but which we have no longer the power to expel from the sound of its name it is not only to towns and rivers that names give an individuality as do allegorical paintings it is not only the physical universe which they pattern with differences people with marvels there is the social universe also and so every historic house in town or country has its lady or its fairy as every forest has its spirit as there is a nymph for every stream sometimes hidden in the heart of its name the fairy is transformed to suit the life of our imagination by which she lives thus it was that the atmosphere in which mme de guermantes existed in me after having been for years no more than the shadow cast by a magic lantern slide or the light falling through a painted window began to let its colours fade when quite other dreams impregnated it with the bubbling coolness of her flowing streams

   and yet the fairy must perish if we come in contact with the real person to whom her name corresponds for that person the name then begins to reflect and she has in her nothing of the fairy the fairy may revive if we remove ourself from the person but if we remain in her presence the fairy definitely dies and with her the name as happened to the family of lusignan which was fated to become extinct on the day when the fairy mélusine should disappear then the name beneath our successive ‘restorations’ of which we may end by finding as their original the beautiful portrait of a strange lady whom we are never to meet is nothing more than the mere photograph for identification to which we refer in order to decide whether we know whether or not we ought to bow to a person who passes us in the street but let a sensation from a bygone year — like those recording instruments which preserve the sound and the manner of the various artists who have sung or played into them — enable our memory to make us hear that name with the particular ring with which it then sounded in our ears then while the name itself has apparently not changed we feel the distance that separates the dreams which at different times its same syllables have meant to us for a moment from the clear echo of its warbling in some distant spring we can extract as from the little tubes which we use in painting the exact forgotten mysterious fresh tint of the days which we had believed ourself to be recalling when like a bad painter we were giving to the whole of our past spread out on the same canvas the tones conventional and all alike of our unprompted memory whereas on the contrary each of the moments that composed it employed for an original creation in a matchless harmony the colour of those days which we no longer know and which for that matter will still suddenly enrapture me if by any chance the name ‘guermantes’ resuming for a moment after all these years the sound so different from its sound today which it had for me on the day of mile percepied’s marriage brings back to me that mauve — so delicate almost too bright too new — with which the billowy scarf of the young duchess glowed and like two periwinkle flowers growing beyond reach and blossoming now again her two eyes sunlit with an azure smile and the name guermantes of those days is also like one of those little balloons which have been filled wilh oxygen or some such gas when i come to explode it to make it emit what it contains i breathe the air of the combray of that year of that day mingled with a fragrance of hawthorn blossom blown by the wind from the corner of the square harbinger of rain which now sent the sun packing now let him spread himself over the red woollen carpet to the sacristy steeping it in a bright geranium scarlet with that so to speak wagnerian harmony in its gaiety which makes the wedding service always impressive but even apart from rare moments such as these in which suddenly we feel the original entity quiver and resume its form carve itself out of the syllables now soundless dead if in the giddy rush of daily life in which they serve only the most practical purposes names have lost all their colour like a prismatic top that spins too quickly and seems only grey when on the other hand in our musings we reflect we seek so as to return to the past to slacken to suspend the perpetual motion by which we are borne alcng gradually we see once more appear side by side but entirely distinct from one another the tints which in the course of our existence have been successively presented to us by a single name

   what form was assumed in my mind by this name guermantes when my first nurse — knowing no more probably than i know today in whose honour it had been composed — sang me to sleep with that old ditty gloire à la marquise de guermantes or when some years later the veteran maréchal de guermantes making my nurserymaid’s bosom swell with pride stopped in the champselysées to remark “a fine child that” and gave me a chocolate drop from his comfitbox i cannot of course now say those years of my earliest childhood are no longer a part of myself they are external to me i can learn nothing of them save as we learn things that happened before we were born — from the accounts given me by other people but more recently i find in the period of that name’s occupation of me seven or eight different shapes which it has successively assumed the earliest were the most beautiful gradually my musings forced by reality to abandon a position that was no longer tenable established themselves anew in one slightly less advanced until they were obliged to retire still farther and with mme de guermantes was transformed simultaneously her dwelling itself also the offspring of that name fertilised from year to year by some word or other that came to my ears and modulated the tone of my musings that dwelling of hers reflected them in its very stones which had turned to mirrors like the surface of a cloud or of a lake a dungeon keep without mass no more indeed than a band of orange light from the summit of which the lord and his lady dealt out life and death to their vassals had given place — right at the end of that ‘guermantes way’ along which on so many summer afternoons i retraced with my parents the course of the vivonne — to that land of bubbling streams where the duchess taught me to fish for trout and to know the names of the flowers whose red and purple clusters adorned the walls of the neighbouring gardens then it had been the ancient heritage famous in song and story from which the proud race of guermantes like a carved and mellow tower that traverses the ages had risen already over france when the sky was still empty at those points where later were to rise notre dame of paris and notre dame of chartres when on the summit of the hill of laon the nave of its cathedral had not yet been poised like the ark of the deluge on the summit of mount ararat crowded with patriarchs and judges anxiously leaning from its windows to see whether the wrath of god were yet appeased carrying with it the types of the vegetation that was to multiply on the earth brimming over with animals which have escaped even by the towers where oxen grazing calmly upon the roof look down over the plains of champagne when the traveller who left beauvais at the close of day did not yet see following him and turning with his road outspread against the gilded screen of the western sky the black ribbed wings of the cathedral it was this ‘guermantes’ like the scene of a novel an imaginary landscape which i could with difficulty picture to myself and longed all the more to discover set in the midst of real lands and roads which all of a sudden would become alive with heraldic details within a few miles of a railway station i recalled the names of the places round it as if they had been situated at the foot of parnassus or of helicon and they seemed precious to me as the physical conditions — in the realm of topographical science — required for the production of an unaccountable phenomenon i saw again the escutcheons blazoned beneath the windows of combray church their quarters filled century after century with all the lordships which by marriage or conquest this illustrious house had brought flying to it from all the corners of germany italy and france vast territories in the north strong cities in the south assembled there to group themselves in guermantes and losing their material quality to inscribe allegorically their dungeon vert or castle tripletowered argent upon its azure field i had heard of the famous tapestries of guermantes i could see them mediaeval and blue a trifle coarse detach themselves like a floating cloud from the legendary amaranthine name at the foot of the ancient forest in which childebert went so often hunting and this delicate mysterious background of their lands this vista of the ages it seemed to me that as effectively as by journeying to see them i might penetrate all their secrets simply by coming in contact for a moment in paris with mme de guermantes the princess paramount of the place and lady of the lake as if her face her speech must possess the local charm of forest groves and streams and the same secular peculiarities as the old customs recorded in her archives but then i had met saintloup he had told me that the castle had borne the name of guermantes only since the seventeenth century when that family had acquired it they had lived until then in the neighbourhood but their title was not taken from those parts the village of guermantes had received its name from the castle round which it had been built and so that it should not destroy the view from the castle a servitude still in force traced the line of its streets and limited the height of its houses as for the tapestries they were by boucher bought in the nineteenth century by a guermantes with a taste for the arts and hung interspersed with a number of sporting pictures of no merit which he himself had painted in a hideous drawingroom upholstered in ‘adrianople’ and plush by these revelations saintloup had introduced into the castle elements foreign to the name of guermantes which made it impossible for me to continue to extract solely from the resonance of the syllables the stone and mortar of its walls and so in the heart of the name was effaced the castle mirrored in its lake and what now became apparent to me surrounding mme de guermantes as her dwelling had been her house in paris the hôtel de guermantes limpid like its name for no material and opaque element intervened to interrupt and blind its transparence as the word church signifies not only the temple but the assembly of the faithful also this hôtel de guermantes comprised all those who shared the life of the duchess but these intimates on whom i had never set eyes were for me only famous and poetic names and knowing exclusively persons who themselves also were names only did but enhance and protect the mystery of the duchess by extending all round her a vast halo which at the most declined in brilliance as its circumference increased

   in the parties which she gave since i could not imagine the guests as having any bodies any moustaches any boots as making any utterances that were commonplace or even original in a human and rational way this whirlpool of names introducing less material substance than would a phantom banquet or a spectral ball round that statuette in dresden china which was madame de guermantes kept for her palace of glass the transparence of a showcase then after saintloup had told me various anecdotes about his cousin’s chaplain her gardener and the rest the hôtel de guermantes had become — as the louvre might have been in days gone by — a kind of castle surrounded in the very heart of paris by its own domains acquired by inheritance by virtue of an ancient right that had quaintly survived over which she still enjoyed feudal privileges but this last dwelling itself vanished when we had come to live beside mme de villeparisis in one of the flats adjoining that occupied by mme de guermantes in a wing of the hôtel it was one of those old town houses a few of which are perhaps still to be found in which the court of honour — whether they were alluvial deposits washed there by the rising tide of democracy or a legacy from a more primitive time when the different trades were clustered round the overlord — is flanked by little shops and workrooms a shoemaker’s for instance or a tailor’s such as we see nestling between the buttresses of those cathedrals which the aesthetic zeal of the restorer has not swept clear of such accretions a porter who also does cobbling keeps hens grows flowers and at the far end in the main building a ‘comtesse’ who when she drives out in her old carriage and pair flaunting on her hat a few nasturtiums which seem to have escaped from the plot by the porter’s lodge with by the coachman’s side on the box a footman who gets down to leave cards at every aristocratic mansion in the neighbourhood scatters vague little smiles and waves her hand in greeting to the porter’s children and to such of her respectable fellowtenants as may happen to be passing who to her contemptuous affability and levelling pride seem all the same

   in the house in which we had now come to live the great lady at the end of the courtyard was a duchess smart and still quite young she was in fact mme de guermantes and thanks to françoise i soon came to know all about her household for the guermantes to whom françoise regularly alluded as the people ‘below’ or ‘downstairs’ were her constant preoccupation from the first thing in the morning when as she did mamma’s hair casting a forbidden irresistible furtive glance down into the courtyard she would say “look at that now a pair of holy sisters that’ll be for downstairs surely” or “oh just look at the fine pheasants in the kitchen window no need to ask where they came from the duke will have been out with his gun”— until the last thing at night when if her ear while she was putting out my nightthings caught a few notes of a song she would conclude “they’re having company down below gay doings i’ll be bound” whereupon in her symmetrical face beneath the arch of her now snowwhite hair a smile from her young days sprightly but proper would for a moment set each of her features in its place arranging them in an intricate and special order as though for a countrydance

   but the moment in the life of the guermantes which excited the keenest interest in françoise gave her the most complete satisfaction and at the same time the sharpest annoyance was that at which the two halves of the great gate having been thrust apart the duchess stepped into her carriage it was generally a little while after our servants had finished the celebration of that sort of solemn passover which none might disturb called their midday dinner during which they were so far taboo that my father himself was not allowed to ring for them knowing moreover that none of them would have paid any more attention to the fifth peal than to the first and that the discourtesy would therefore have been a pure waste of time and trouble though not without trouble in store for himself for françoise who in her old age lost no opportunity of standing upon her dignity would without fail have presented him for the rest of the day with a face covered with the tiny red cuneiform hieroglyphs by which she made visible — though by no means legible — to the outer world the long tale of her griefs and the profound reasons for her dissatisfactions she would enlarge upon them too in a running ‘aside’ but not so that we could catch her words she called this practice — which she imagined must be infuriating ‘mortifying’ as she herself put it‘vexing’ to us —‘saying low masses all the blessed day’

   the last rites accomplished françoise who was at one and the same time as in the primitive church the celebrant and one of the faithful helped herself to a final glass undid the napkin from her throat folded it after wiping from her lips a stain of watered wine and coffee slipped it into its ring turned a doleful eye to thank ‘her’ young footman who to shew his zeal in her service was saying “come ma’am a drop more of the grape it’s d’licious today” and went straight across to the window which she flung open protesting that it was too hot to breathe in ‘this wretched kitchen’ dexterously casting as she turned the latch and let in the fresh air a glance of studied indifference into the courtyard below she furtively elicited the conclusion that the duchess was not ready yet to start brooded for a moment with contemptuous impassioned eyes over the waiting carriage and this meed of attention once paid to the things of the earth raised them towards the heavens whose purity she had already divined from the sweetness of the air and the warmth of the sun and let them rest on a corner of the roof at the place where every spring there came and built immediately over the chimney of my bedroom a pair of pigeons like those she used to hear cooing from her kitchen at combray

    “ah combray combray” she cried and the almost singing tone in which she declaimed this invocation might taken with the arlesian purity of her features have made the onlooker suspect her of a southern origin and that the lost land which she was lamenting was no more really than a land of adoption if so he would have been wrong for it seems that there is no province that has not its own southcountry do we not indeed constantly meet savoyards and bretons in whose speech we find all those pleasing transpositions of longs and shorts that are characteristic of the southerner “ah combray when shall i look on thee again poor land when shall i pass the blessed day among thy hawthorns under our own poor lilyoaks hearing the grasshoppers sing and the vivonne making a little noise like someone whispering instead of that wretched bell from our young master who can never stay still for half an hour on end without having me run the length of that wicked corridor and even then he makes out i don’t come quick enough you’d need to hear the bell ring before he has pulled it and if you’re a minute late away he flies into the most towering rage alas poor combray maybe i shall see thee only in death when they drop me like a stone into the hollow of the tomb and so nevermore shall i smell thy lovely hawthorns so white and all but in the sleep of death i dare say i shall still hear those three peals of the bell which will have driven me to damnation in this world”

   her soliloquy was interrupted by the voice of the waistcoatmaker downstairs the same who had so delighted my grandmother once long ago when she had gone to pay a call on mme de villeparisis and now occupied no less exalted a place in franchise’s affections having raised his head when he heard our window open he had already been trying for some time to attract his neighbour’s attention in order to bid her good day the coquetry of the young girl that françoise had once been softened and refined for m jupien the querulous face of our old cook dulled by age illtemper and the heat of the kitchen fire and it was with a charming blend of reserve familiarity and modesty that she bestowed a gracious salutation on the waistcoatmaker but without making any audible response for if she did infringe mamma’s orders by looking into the courtyard she would never have dared to go the length of talking from the window which would have been quite enough according to her to bring down on her ‘a whole chapter’ from the mistress she pointed to the waiting carriage as who should say “a fine pair eh” though what she actually muttered was “what an old rattletrap” but principally because she knew that he would be bound to answer putting his hand to his lips so as to be audible without having to shout

    “you could have one too if you liked as good as they have and better i dare say only you don’t care for that sort of thing”
   and franoise after a modest evasive signal of delight the meaning of which was more or less “tastes differ you know simplicity’s the rule in this house” shut the window again in case mamma should come in these ‘you’ who might have had more horses than the guermantes were ourselves but jupien was right in saying ‘you’ since except for a few purely personal gratifications such as when she coughed all day long without ceasing and everyone in the house was afraid of catching her cold that of pretending with an irritating little titter that she had not got a cold like those plants that an animal to which they are wholly attached keeps alive with food which it catches eats and digests for them and of which it offers them the ultimate and easily assimilable residue françoise lived with us in full community it was we who with our virtues our wealth our style of living must take on ourselves the task of concocting those little sops to her vanity out of which was formed — with the addition of the recognised rights of freely practising the cult of the midday dinner according to the traditional custom which included a mouthful of air at the window when the meal was finished a certain amount of loitering in the street when she went out to do her marketing and a holiday on sundays when she paid a visit to her niece — the portion of happiness indispensable to her existence and so it can be understood that françoise might well have succumbed in those first days of our migration a victim in a house where my father’s claims to distinction were not yet known to a malady which she herself called ‘wearying’ wearying in the active sense in which the word ennui is employed by corneille or in the last letters of soldiers who end by taking their own lives because they are wearying for their girls or for their native villages françoise’s wearying had soon been cured by none other than jupien for he at once procured her a pleasure no less keen indeed more refined than she would have felt if we had decided to keep a carriage “very good class those juliens” for françoise readily assimilated new names to those with which she was already familiar “very worthy people you can see it written on their faces” jupien was in fact able to understand and to inform the world that if we did not keep a carriage it was because we had no wish for one this new friend of françoise was very little at home having obtained a post in one of the government offices a waistcoatmaker first of all with the ‘chit of a girl’ whom my grandmother had taken for his daughter he had lost all interest in the exercise of that calling after his assistant who when still little more than a child had shewn great skill in darning a torn skirt that day when my grandmother had gone to call on mme de villeparisis had turned to ladies’ fashions and become a seamstress a prentice hand to begin with in a dressmaker’s workroom set to stitch a seam to fasten a flounce to sew on a button or to press a crease to fix a waistband with hooks and eyes she had quickly risen to be second and then chief assistant and having formed a connexion of her own among ladies of fashion now worked at home that is to say in our courtyard generally with one or two of her young friends from the workroom whom she had taken on as apprentices after this jupien’s presence in the place had ceased to matter no doubt the little girl a big girl by this time had often to cut out waistcoats still but with her friends to assist her she needed no one besides and so jupien her uncle had sought employment outside he was free at first to return home at midday then when he had definitely succeeded the man whose substitute only he had begun by being not before dinnertime his appointment to the ‘regular establishment’ was fortunately not announced until some weeks after our arrival so that his courtesy could be brought to bear on her long enough to help françoise to pass through the first most difficult phase without undue suffering at the same time and without underrating his value to françoise as so to speak a sedative during the period of transition i am bound to say that my first impression of jupien had been far from favourable at a little distance entirely ruining the effect that his plump cheeks and vivid colouring would otherwise have produced his eyes brimming with a compassionate mournful dreamy gaze led one to suppose that he was seriously ill or had just suffered a great bereavement not only was he nothing of the sort but as soon as he opened his mouth and his speech by the way was perfect he was quite markedly cynical and cold there resulted from this discord between eyes and lips a certain falsity which was not attractive and by which he had himself the air of being made as uncomfortable as a guest who arrives in morning dress at a party where everyone else is in evening dress or as a commoner who having to speak to a royal personage does not know exactly how he ought to address him and gets round the difficulty by cutting down his remarks to almost nothing jupien’s here the comparison ends were on the contrary charming indeed corresponding possibly to this overflowing of his face by his eyes which one ceased to notice when one came to know him i soon discerned in him a rare intellect and one of the most spontaneously literary that it has been my privilege to come across in the sense that probably without education he possessed or had assimilated with the help only of a few books skimmed in early life the most ingenious turns of speech the most gifted people that i had known had died young and so i was convinced that jupien’s life would soon be cut short kindness was among his qualities and pity the most delicate and the most generous feelings for others but his part in the life of françoise had soon ceased to be indispensable she had learned to put up with understudies

   indeed when a tradesman or servant came to our door with a parcel or message while seeming to pay no attention and merely pointing vaguely to an empty chair françoise so skilfully put to the best advantage the few seconds that he spent in the kitchen while he waited for mamma’s answer that it was very seldom that the stranger went away without having ineradicably engraved upon his memory the conviction that if we ‘did not have’ any particular thing it was because we had ‘no wish’ for it if she made such a point of other people’s knowing that we ‘had money’ for she knew nothing of what saintloup used to call partitive articles and said simply ‘have money’ ‘fetch water’ of their realising that we were rich it was not because riches with nothing else besides riches without virtue were in her eyes the supreme good in life but virtue without riches was not her ideal either riches were for her so to speak a necessary condition of virtue failing which virtue itself would lack both merit and charm she distinguished so little between them that she had come in time to invest each with the other’s attributes to expect some material comfort from virtue to discover something edifying in riches

   as soon as she had shut the window again which she did quickly — otherwise mamma would it appeared have heaped on her ‘every conceivable insult’— françoise began with many groans and sighs to put straight the kitchen table

    “there are some guermantes who stay in the rue de la chaise” began my father’s valet “i had a friend who used to be with them he was their second coachman and i know a fellow not my old pal but his brotherinlaw who did his time in the army with one of the baron de guermantes’s stud grooms does your mother know you’re out” added the valet who was in the habit just as he used to hum the popular airs of the season of peppering his conversation with all the latest witticisms

   françoise with the tired eyes of an ageing woman eyes which moreover saw everything from combray in a hazy distance made out not the witticism that underlay the words but that there must be something witty in them since they bore no relation to the rest of his speech and had been uttered with considerable emphasis by one whom she knew to be a joker she smiled at him therefore with an air of benevolent bewilderment as who should say “always the same that victor” and she was genuinely pleased knowing that listening to smart sayings of this sort was akin — if remotely — to those reputable social pleasures for which in every class of society people make haste to dress themselves in their best and run the risk of catching cold furthermore she believed the valet to be a friend after her own heart for he never left off denouncing with fierce indignation the appalling measures which the republic was about to enforce against the clergy françoise had not yet learned that our cruellest adversaries are not those who contradict and try to convince us but those who magnify or invent reports which may make us unhappy taking care not to include any appearance of justification which might lessen our discomfort and perhaps give us some slight regard for a party which they make a point of displaying to us to complete our torment as being at once terrible and triumphant

   the duchess must be connected with all that lot” said françoise bringing the conversation back to the guermantes of the rue de la chaise as one plays a piece over again from the andante “i can’t recall who it was told me that one of them had married a cousin of the duke it’s the same kindred anyway ay they’re a great family the guermantes” she added in a tone of respect founding the greatness of the family at once on the number of its branches and the brilliance of its connexions as pascal founds the truth of religion on reason and on the authority of the scriptures for since there was but the single word ‘great’ to express both meanings it seemed to her that they formed a single idea her vocabulary like cut stones sometimes shewing thus on certain of its facets a flaw which projected a ray of darkness into the recesses of her mind “i wonder now if it wouldn’t be them that have their castle at guermantes not a score of miles from combray then they must be kin to their cousin at algiers too” my mother and i long asked ourselves who this cousin at algiers could be until finally we discovered that françoise meant by the name ‘algiers’ the town of angers what is far off may be more familiar to us than what is quite near françoise who knew the name ‘algiers’ from some particularly unpleasant dates that used to be given us at the new year had never heard of angers her language like the french language itself and especially that of placenames was thickly strewn with errors “i meant to talk to their butler about it what is it again you call him” she interrupted herself as though putting a formal question as to the correct procedure which she went on to answer with “oh of course it’s antoine you call him” as though antoine had been a title “he’s the one who could tell me but he’s quite the gentleman he is a great scholar you’d say they’d cut his tongue out or that he’d forgotten to learn to speak he makes no response when you talk to him” went on françoise who used ‘make response’ in the same sense as mme de sévigné “but” she added quite untruthfully “so long as i know what’s boiling in my pot i don’t bother my head about what’s in other people’s whatever he is he’s not a catholic besides he’s not a courageous man” this criticism might have led one to suppose that françoise had changed her mind about physical bravery which according to her in combray days lowered men to the level of wild beasts but it was not so ‘courageous’ meant simply a hard worker “they do say too that he’s thievish as a magpie but it doesn’t do to believe all one hears the servants never stay long there because of the lodge the porters are jealous and set the duchess against them but it’s safe to say that he’s a real twister that antoine and his antoinesse is no better” concluded françoise who in furnishing the name ‘antoine’ with a feminine ending that would designate the butler’s wife was inspired no doubt in her act of wordformation by an unconscious memory of the words chanoine and chanoinesse if so she was not far wrong there is still a street near notredame called rue chanoinesse a name which must have been given to it since it was never inhabited by any but male canons by those frenchmen of olden days of whom françoise was properly speaking the contemporary she proceeded moreover at once to furnish another example of this way of forming feminine endings for she went on “but one thing sure and certain is that it’s the duchess that has guermantes castle and it’s she that is the lady mayoress down in those parts that’s always something”

    “i can well believe that it is something” came with conviction from the footman who had not detected the irony

    “you think so do you my boy you think it’s something why for folk like them to be mayor and mayoress it’s just thank you for nothing ah if it was mine that guermantes castle you wouldn’t see me setting foot in paris i can tell you i’m sure a family who’ve got something to go on with like monsieur and madame here must have queer ideas to stay on in this wretched town rather than get away down to combray the moment they’re free to start and no one hindering them why do they put off retiring they’ve got everything they want why wait till they’re dead ah if i had only a crust of dry bread to eat and a faggot to keep me warm in winter a fine time i’d have of it at home in my brother’s poor old house at combray down there you do feel you’re alive you haven’t all these houses stuck up in front of you there is so little noise at nighttime you can hear the frogs singing five miles off and more”

    “that must indeed be fine” exclaimed the young footman with enthusiasm as though this last attraction had been as peculiar to combray as the gondola is to venice a more recent arrival in the household than my father’s valet he used to talk to françoise about things which might interest not himself so much as her and françoise whose face wrinkled up in disgust when she was treated as a mere cook had for the young footman who referred to her always as the ‘housekeeper’ that peculiar tenderness which princes not of the blood royal feel towards the wellmeaning young men who dignify them with a ‘highness’

    “at any rate one knows what one’s about there and what time of year it is it isn’t like here where you won’t find one wretched buttercup flowering at holy easter any more than you would at christmas and i can’t hear so much as the tiniest angélus ring when i lift my old bones out of bed in the morning down there you can hear every hour there’s only the one poor bell but you say to yourself ‘my brother will be coming in from the field now’ and you watch the daylight fade and the bell rings to bless the fruits of the earth and you have time to take a turn before you light the lamp but here it’s daytime and it’s nighttime and you go to bed and you can’t say any more than the dumb beasts what you’ve been about all day”

    “i gather méséglise is a fine place too madame” broke in the young footman who found that the conversation was becoming a little too abstract for his liking and happened to remember having heard us at table mention méséglise

    “oh méséglise is it” said françoise with the broad smile which one could always bring to her lips by uttering any of those names — méséglise combray tansonville they were so intimate a part of her life that she felt on meeting them outside it on hearing them used in conversation a hilarity more or less akin to that which a professor excites in his class by making an allusion to some contemporary personage whose name the students had never supposed could possibly greet their ears from the height of the academic chair her pleasure arose also from the feeling that these places were something to her which they were not for the rest of the world old companions with whom one has shared many delights and she smiled at them as if she found in them something witty because she did find there a great part of herself

    “yes you may well say so son it is a pretty enough place is méséglise” she went on with a tinkling laugh “but how did you ever come to hear tell of méséglise”
    “how did i hear of méséglise but it’s a wellknown place people have told me about it — yes over and over again” he assured her with that criminal inexactitude of the informer who whenever we attempt to form an impartial estimate of the importance that a thing which matters to us may have for other people makes it impossible for us to succeed

    “i can tell you it’s better down there under the cherry trees than standing before the fire all day”

   she spoke to them even of eulalie as a good person for since eulalie’s death françoise had completely forgotten that she had loved her as little in her lifetime as she loved every one whose cupboard was bare who was dying of hunger and after that came like a good for nothing thanks to the bounty of the rich to ‘put on airs’ it no longer pained her that eulalie had so skilfully managed sunday after sunday to secure her ‘trifle’ from my aunt as for the latter françoise never left off singing her praises

    “but it was at combray surely that you used to be with a cousin of madame” asked the young footman

    “yes with mme octave — oh a dear good holy woman my poor friends and a house where there was always enough and to spare and all of the very best a good woman you may well say who had no pity on the partridges or the pheasants or anything you might turn up five to dinner or six it was never the meat that was lacking and of the first quality too and white wine and red wine and everything you could wish” françoise used the word ‘pity’ in the sense given it by labruyère “it was she that paid the damages always even if the family stayed for months and years” this reflection was not really a slur upon us for françoise belonged to an epoch when the words ‘damages’ was not restricted to a legal use and meant simply expense “ah i can tell you people didn’t go empty away from that house as his reverence the curé has told us many’s the time if there ever was a woman who could count on going straight before the throne of god it was she poor madame i can hear her saying now in the little voice she had ‘you know françoise i can eat nothing myself but i want it all to be just as nice for the others as if i could’ they weren’t for her the victuals you may be quite sure if you’d only seen her she weighed no more than a bag of cherries there wasn’t that much of her she would never listen to a word i said she would never send for the doctor ah it wasn’t in that house that you’d have to gobble down your dinner she liked her servants to be fed properly here it’s been just the same again today we haven’t had time for so much as to break a crust of bread everything goes like ducks and drakes”

   what annoyed her more than anything were the rusks of pulled bread that my father used to eat she was convinced that he had them simply to give himself airs and to keep her ‘dancing’ “i can tell you frankly” the young footman assured her “that i never saw the like” he said it as if he had seen everything and as if in him the range of a millennial experience extended over all countries and their customs among which was not anywhere to be found a custom of eating pulled bread “yes yes” the butler muttered “but that will all be changed the men are going on strike in canada and the minister told monsieur the other evening that he’s clearing two hundred thousand francs out of it” there was no note of censure in his tone not that he was not himself entirely honest but since he regarded all politicians as unsound the crime of peculation seemed to him less serious than the pettiest larceny he did not even stop to ask himself whether he had heard this historic utterance aright and was not struck by the improbability that such a thing would have been admitted by the guilty party himself to my father without my father’s immediately turning him out of the house but the philosophy of combray made it impossible for françoise to expect that the strikes in canada could have any repercussion on the use of pulled bread “so long as the world goes round look there’ll be masters to keep us on the trot and servants to do their bidding” in disproof of this theory of perpetual motion for the last quarter of an hour my mother who probably did not employ the same measures of time as françoise in reckoning the duration of the latter’s dinner had been saying

    “what on earth can they be doing they’ve been at least two hours at their dinner”

   and she rang timidly three or four times françoise ‘her’ footman the butler heard the bell ring not as a summons to themselves and with no thought of answering it but rather like the first sounds of the instruments being tuned when the next part of a concert is just going to begin and one knows that there will be only a few minutes more of interval and so when the peals were repeated and became more urgent our servants began to pay attention and judging that they had not much time left and that the resumption of work was at hand at a peal somewhat louder than the rest gave a collective sigh and went their several ways the footman slipping downstairs to smoke a cigarette outside the door françoise after a string of reflexions on ourselves such as “they’ve got the jumps today surely” going up to put her things tidy in her attic while the butler having supplied himself first with notepaper from my bedroom polished off the arrears of his private correspondence

   despite the apparent stiffness of their butler françoise had been in a position from the first to inform me that the guermantes occupied their mansion by virtue not of an immemorial right but of a quite recent tenancy and that the garden over which it looked on the side that i did not know was quite small and just like all the gardens along the street and i realised at length that there were not to be seen there pit and gallows or fortified mill secret chamber pillared dovecot manorial bakehouse or tithebarn dungeon or drawbridge or fixed bridge either for that matter any more than tollhouses or pinnacles charters muniments ramparts or commemorative mounds but just as elstir when the bay of balbec losing its mystery had become for me simply a portion interchangeable with any other of the total quantity of salt water distributed over the earth’s surface had suddenly restored to it a personality of its own by telling me that it was the gulf of opal painted by whistler in his ‘harmonies in blue and silver’ so the name guermantes had seen perish under the strokes of françoise’s hammer the last of the dwellings that had issued from its syllables when one day an old friend of my father said to us speaking of the duchess “she is the first lady in the faubourg saintgermain hers is the leading house in the faubourg saintgermain” no doubt the most exclusive drawingroom the leading house in the faubourg saintgermain was little or nothing after all those other mansions of which in turn i had dreamed and yet in this one too and it was to be the last of the series there was something however humble quite apart from its material components a secret differentiation

   and it became all the more essential that i should be able to explore in the drawingroom of mme de guermantes among her friends the mystery of her name since i did not find it in her person when i saw her leave the house in the morning on foot or in the afternoon in her carriage once before indeed in the church at combray she had appeared to me in the blinding flash of a transfiguration with cheeks irreducible to impenetrable by the colour of the name guermantes and of afternoons on the banks of the vivonne taking the place of my shattered dream like a swan or willow into which has been changed a god or nymph and which henceforward subjected to natural laws will glide over the water or be shaken by the wind and yet when that radiance had vanished hardly had i lost sight of it before it formed itself again like the green and rosy afterglow of sunset after the sweep of the oar has broken it and in the solitude of my thoughts the name had quickly appropriated to itself my impression of the face but now frequently i saw her at her window in the courtyard in the street and for myself at least if i did not succeed in integrating in her the name guermantes i cast the blame on the impotence of my mind to accomplish the whole act that i demanded of it but she our neighbour she seemed to make the same error nay more to make it without discomfiture without any of my scruples without even suspecting that it was an error thus mme de guermantes shewed in her dresses the same anxiety to follow the fashions as if believing herself to have become simply a woman like all the rest she had aspired to that elegance in her attire in which other ordinary women might equal and perhaps surpass her i had seen her in the street gaze admiringly at a welldressed actress and in the morning before she sallied forth on foot as if the opinion of the passersby whose vulgarity she accentuated by parading familiarly through their midst her inaccessible life could be a tribunal competent to judge her i would see her before the glass playing with a conviction free from all pretence or irony with passion with illhumour with conceit like a queen who has consented to appear as a servantgirl in theatricals at court this part so unworthy of her of a fashionable woman and in this mythological oblivion of her natural grandeur she looked to see whether her veil was hanging properly smoothed her cuffs straightened her cloak as the celestial swan performs all the movements natural to his animal species keeps his eyes painted on either side of his beak without putting into them any glint of life and darts suddenly after a bud or an umbrella as a swan would without remembering that he is a god but as the traveller disappointed by the first appearance of a strange town reminds himself that he will doubtless succeed in penetrating its charm if he visits its museums and galleries so i assured myself that had i been given the right of entry into mme de guermantes’s house were i one of her friends were i to penetrate into her life i should then know what within its glowing orangetawny envelope her name did really objectively enclose for other people since after all my father’s friend had said that the guermantes set was something quite by itself in the faubourg saintgermain

   the life which i supposed them to lead there flowed from a source so different from anything in my experience and must i felt be so indissolubly associated with that particular house that i could not have imagined the presence at the duchess’s parties of people in whose company i myself had already been of people who really existed for not being able suddenly to change their nature they would have carried on conversations there of the sort that i knew their partners would perhaps have stooped to reply to them in the same human speech and in the course of an evening spent in the leading house in the faubourg saintgermain there would have been moments identical with moments that i had already lived which was impossible it was thus that my mind was embarrassed by certain difficulties and the presence of our lord’s body in the host seemed to me no more obscure a mystery than this leading house in the faubourg situated here on the right bank of the river and so near that from my bed in the morning i could hear its carpets being beaten but the line of demarcation that separated me from the faubourg saintgermain seemed to me all the more real because it was purely ideal i felt clearly that it was already part of the faubourg when i saw the guermantes doormat spread out beyond that intangible equator of which my mother had made bold to say having like myself caught a glimpse of it one day when their door stood open that it was a shocking state for the rest how could their diningroom their dim gallery upholstered in red plush into which i could see sometimes from our kitchen window have failed to possess in my eyes the mysterious charm of the faubourg saintgermain to form part of it in an essential fashion to be geographically situated within it since to have been entertained to dinner in that room was to have gone into the faubourg saintgermain to have breathed its atmosphere since the people who before going to table sat down by the side of mme de guermantes on the leathercovered sofa in that gallery were all of the faubourg saintgermain no doubt elsewhere than in the faubourg at certain parties one might see now and then majestically enthroned amid the vulgar herd of fashion one of those men who were mere names and varyingly assumed when one tried to form a picture of them the aspect of a tournament or of a royal forest but here in the leading house in the faubourg saintgerman in the drawingroom in the dim gallery there were only they they were wrought of precious materials the columns that upheld the temple indeed for quiet family parties it was from among them only that mme de guermantes might select her guests and in the dinners for twelve gathered around the dazzling napery and plate they were like the golden statues of the apostles in the saintechapelle symbolic consecrative pillars before the holy table as for the tiny strip of garden that stretched between high walls at the back of the house where on summer evenings mme de guermantes had liqueurs and orangeade brought out after dinner how could i not have felt that to sit there of an evening between nine and eleven on its iron chairs — endowed with a magic as potent as the leathern sofa — without inhaling the breezes peculiar to the faubourg saintgermain was as impossible as to take a siesta in the oasis of figuig without thereby being necessarily in africa only imagination and belief can differentiate from the rest certain objects certain people and can create an atmosphere alas those picturesque sites those natural accidents those local curiosities those works of art of the faubourg saintgermain never probably should i be permitted to set my feet among them and i must content myself with a shiver of excitement as i sighted from the deep sea and without the least hope of ever landing there like an outstanding minaret like the first palm like the first signs of some exotic industry or vegetation the welltrodden doormat of its shore

   but if the hôtel de guermantes began for me at its halldoor its dependencies must be regarded as extending a long way farther according to the duke who looking on all the other tenants as farmers peasants purchasers of forfeited estates whose opinion was of no account shaved himself every morning in his nightshirt at the window came down into the courtyard according to the warmth or coldness of the day in his shirtsleeves in pyjamas in a plaid coat of startling colours with a shaggy nap in little lightcoloured coats shorter than the jackets beneath and made one of his grooms lead past him at a trot some horse that he had just been buying more than once indeed the horse broke the window of jupien’s shop whereupon jupien to the duke’s indignation demanded compensation “if it were only in consideration of all the good that madame la duchesse does in the house here and in the parish” said m de guermantes “it is an outrage on this fellow’s part to claim a penny from us” but jupien had stuck to his point apparently not having the faintest idea what ‘good’ the duchess had ever done and yet she did do good but — since one cannot do good to everybody at once — the memory of the benefits that we have heaped on one person is a valid reason for our abstaining from helping another whose discontent we thereby make all the stronger from other points of view than that of charity the quarter appeared to the duke — and this over a considerable area — to be only an extension of his courtyard a longer track for his horses after seeing how a new acquisition trotted by itself he would have it harnessed and taken through all the neighbouring streets the groom running beside the carriage holding the reins making it pass to and fro before the duke who stood on the pavement erect gigantic enormous in his vivid clothes a cigar between his teeth his head in the air his eyeglass scrutinous until the moment when he sprang on the box drove the horse up and down for a little to try it then set off with his new turnout to pick up his mistress in the champselysées m de guermantes bade good day before leaving the courtyard to two couples who belonged more or less to his world the first some cousins of his who like workingclass parents were never at home to look after their children since every morning the wife went off to the schola to study counterpoint and fugue and the husband to his studio to carve wood and beat leather and after them the baron and baronne de norpois always dressed in black she like a pewopener and he like a mute at a funeral who emerged several times daily on their way to church they were the nephew and niece of the old ambassador who was our friend and whom my father had in fact met at the foot of the staircase without realising from where he came for my father supposed that so important a personage one who had come in contact with the most eminent men in europe and was probably quite indifferent to the empty distinctions of rank was hardly likely to frequent the society of these obscure clerical and narrowminded nobles they had not been long in the place jupien who had come out into the courtyard to say a word to the husband just as he was greeting m de guermantes called him ‘m norpois’ not being certain of his name

    “monsieur norpois indeed oh that really is good just wait a little this individual will be calling you comrade norpois next” exclaimed m de guermantes turning to the baron he was at last able to vent his spleen against jupien who addressed him as ‘monsieur’ instead of ‘monsieur le duc’
   one day when m de guermantes required some information upon a matter of which my father had professional knowledge he had introduced himself to him with great courtesy after that he had often some neighbourly service to ask of my father and as soon as he saw him begin to come downstairs his mind occupied with his work and anxious to avoid any interruption the duke leaving his stableboys would come up to him in the courtyard straighten the collar of his greatcoat with the serviceable deftness inherited from a line of royal bodyservants in days gone by take him by the hand and holding it in his own patting it even to prove to my father with a courtesan’s or courtier’s shamelessness that he the duc de guermantes made no bargain about my father’s right to the privilege of contact with the ducal flesh lead him so to speak on leash extremely annoyed and thinking only how he might escape through the carriage entrance out into the street he had given us a sweeping bow one day when we had come in just as he was going out in the carriage with his wife he was bound to have told her my name but what likelihood was there of her remembering it or my face either and besides what a feeble recommendation to be pointed out simply as being one of her tenants another more valuable would have been my meeting the duchess in the drawingroom of mme de villeparisis who as it happened had just sent word by my grandmother that i was to go and see her and remembering that i had been intending to go in for literature had added that i should meet several authors there but my father felt that i was still a little young to go into society and as the state of my health continued to give him uneasiness he did not see the use of establishing precedents that would do me no good

   as one of mme de guermantes’s footmen was in the habit of talking to françoise i picked up the names of several of the houses which she frequented but formed no impression of any of them from the moment in which they were a part of her life of that life which i saw only through the veil of her name were they not inconceivable

    “tonight there’s a big party with a chinese shadow show at the princesse de parme’s” said the footman “but we shan’t be going because at five o’clock madame is taking the train to chantilly to spend a few days with the due d’aumale but it’ll be the lady’s maid and valet that are going with her i’m to stay here she won’t be at all pleased the princesse de parme won’t that’s four times already she’s written to madame la duchesse”

    “then you won’t be going down to guermantes castle this year”

    “it’s the first time we shan’t be going there it’s because of the duke’s rheumatics the doctor says he’s not to go there till the hot pipes are in but we’ve been there every year till now right on to january if the hot pipes aren’t ready perhaps madame will go for a few days to cannes to the duchesse de guise but nothing’s settled yet”

    “and to the theatre do you go sometimes”

    “we go now and then to the opéra usually on the evenings when the princesse de parme has her box that’s once a week it seems it’s a fine show they give there plays operas everything madame refused to subscribe to it herself but we go all the same to the boxes madame’s friends take one one night another another often with the princesse de guermantes the duke’s cousin’s lady she’s sister to the duke of bavaria and so you’ve got to run upstairs again now have you” went on the footman who albeit identified with the guermantes looked upon masters in general as a political estate a view which allowed him to treat françoise with as much respect as if she too were in service with a duchess “you enjoy good health ma’am”

    “oh if it wasn’t for these cursed legs of mine on the plain i can still get along” ‘on the plain’ meant in the courtyard or in the streets where françoise had no objection to walking in other words ‘on a plane surface’ “but it’s these stairs that do me in devil take them good day to you sir see you again perhaps this evening”

   she was all the more anxious to continue her conversations with the footman after he mentioned to her that the sons of dukes often bore a princely title which they retained until their fathers were dead evidently the cult of the nobility blended with and accommodating itself to a certain spirit of revolt against it must springing hereditarily from the soil of france be very strongly implanted still in her people for françoise to whom you might speak of the genius of napoleon or of wireless telegraphy without succeeding in attracting her attention and without her slackening for an instant the movements with which she was scraping the ashes from the grate or laying the table if she were simply to be told these idiosyncrasies of nomenclature and that the younger son of the duc de guermantes was generally called prince d’oléron would at once exclaim “that’s fine that is” and stand there dazed as though in contemplation of a stained window in church

   françoise learned also from the prince d’agrigente’s valet who had become friends with her by coming often to the house with notes for the duchess that he had been hearing a great deal of talk in society about the marriage of the marquis de saintloup to mlle d’ambresac and that it was practically settled

   that villa that operabox into which mme de guermantes transfused the current of her life must it seemed to me be places no less fairylike than her home the names of guise of parme of guermantesbaviere differentiated from all possible others the holiday places to which the duchess resorted the daily festivities which the track of her bowling wheels bound as with ribbons to her mansion if they told me that in those holidays in those festivities consisted serially the life of mme de guermantes they brought no further light to bear on it each of them gave to the life of the duchess a different determination but succeeded only in changing the mystery of it without allowing to escape any of its own mystery which simply floated protected by a covering enclosed in a bell through the tide of the life of all the world the duchess might take her luncheon on the shore of the mediterranean at carnival time but in the villa of mme de guise where the queen of parisian society was nothing more in her white linen dress among numberless princesses than a guest like any of the rest and on that account more moving still to me more herself by being thus made new like a star of the ballet who in the fantastic course of a figure takes the place of each of her humbler sisters in succession she might look at chinese shadow shows but at a party given by the princesse de parme listen to tragedy or opera but from the box of the princesse de guermantes

   as we localise in the body of a person all the potentialities of that person’s life our recollections of the people he knows and has just left or is on his way to meet if having learned from françoise that mme de guermantes was going on foot to luncheon with the princesse de parme i saw her about midday emerge from her house in a gown of fleshcoloured satin over which her face was of the same shade like a cloud that rises above the setting sun it was all the pleasures of the faubourg saintgermain that i saw before me contained in that small compass as in a shell between its twin valves that glowed with roseate nacre

   my father had a friend at the ministry one a j moreau who to distinguish him from the other moreaus took care always to prefix both initials to his name with the result that people called him for short ‘aj’ well somehow or other this a j found himself entitled to a stall at the opéracomique on a gala night he sent the ticket to my father and as berma whom i had not been again to see since my first disappointment was to give an act of phèdre my grandmother persuaded my father to pass it on to me

   to tell the truth i attached no importance to this possibility of hearing berma which a few years earlier had plunged me in such a state of agitation and it was not without a sense of melancholy that i realized the fact of my indifference to what at one time i had put before health comfort everything it was not that there had been any slackening of my desire for an opportunity to contemplate close at hand the precious particles of reality of which my imagination caught a broken glimpse but my imagination no longer placed these in the diction of a great actress since my visits to elstir it was on certain tapestries certain modern paintings that i had brought to bear the inner faith i had once had in this acting in this tragic art of berma my faith my desire no longer coming forward to pay incessant worship to the diction the attitudes of berma the counterpart that i possessed of them in my heart had gradually perished like those other counterparts of the dead in ancient egypt which had to be fed continually in order to maintain their originals in eternal life this art had become a feeble tawdry thing no deeplying soul inhabited it any more

   that evening as armed with the ticket my father had received from his friend i was climbing the grand staircase of the opera i saw in front of me a man whom i took at first for m de charlus whose bearing he had when he turned his head to ask some question of one of the staff i saw that i had been mistaken but i had no hesitation in placing the stranger in the same class of society from the way not only in which he was dressed but in which he spoke to the man who took the tickets and to the boxopeners who were keeping him waiting for apart from personal details of similarity there was still at this period between any smart and wealthy man of that section of the nobility and any smart and wealthy man of the world of finance or ‘big business’ a strongly marked difference where one of the latter would have thought he was giving proof of his exclusiveness by adopting a sharp haughty tone in speaking to an inferior the great gentleman affable pleasant smiling had the air of considering practising an affectation of humility and patience a pretence of being just one of the audience as a privilege of his good breeding it is quite likely that on seeing him thus dissemble behind a smile overflowing with good nature the barred threshold of the little world apart which he carried in his person more than one wealthy banker’s son entering the theatre at that moment would have taken this great gentleman for a person of no importance if he had not remarked in him an astonishing resemblance to the portrait that had recently appeared in the illustrated papers of a nephew of the austrian emperor the prince of saxony who happened to be in paris at the time i knew him to be a great friend of the guermantes as i reached the attendant i heard the prince of saxony or his double say with a smile “i don’t know the number it was my cousin who told me i had only to ask for her box”

   he may well have been the prince of saxony it was perhaps of the duchesse de guermantes whom in that event i should be able to watch in the process of living one of those moments of her unimaginable life in her cousin’s box that his eyes formed a mental picture when he referred to ‘my cousin who told me i had only to ask for her box’ so much so that that smiling gaze peculiar to himself those so simple words caressed my heart far more gently than would any abstract meditation with the alternative feelers of a possible happiness and a vague distinction whatever he was in uttering this sentence to the attendant he grafted upon a commonplace evening in my everyday life a potential outlet into a new world the passage to which he was directed after mentioning the word ‘box’ and along which he now proceeded was moist and mildewed and seemed to lead to subaqueous grottoes to the mythical kingdom of the waternymphs i had before me a gentleman in evening dress who was walking away from me but i kept playing upon and round him as with a badly fitting reflector on a lamp and without ever succeeding in making it actually coincide with him the idea that he was the prince of saxony and was on his way to join the duchesse de guermantes and for all that he was alone that idea external to himself impalpable immense unstable as the shadow projected by a magic lantern seemed to precede and guide him like that deity invisible to the rest of mankind who stands beside the greek warrior in the hour of battle

   i took my seat striving all the time to recapture a line from phèdre which i could not quite remember in the form in which i repeated it to myself it had not the right number of feet but as i made no attempt to count them between its unwieldiness and a classical line of poetry it seemed as though no common measure could exist it would not have surprised me to learn that i must subtract at least half a dozen syllables from that portentous phrase to reduce it to alexandrine dimensions but suddenly i remembered it the irremediable asperities of an inhuman world vanished as if by magic the syllables of the line at once filled up the requisite measure what there was in excess floated off with the ease the dexterity of a bubble of air that rises to burst on the water’s brink and after all this excrescence with which i had been struggling consisted of but a single foot

   a certain number of orchestra stalls had been offered for sale at the box office and bought out of snobbishness or curiosity by such as wished to study the appearance of people whom they might not have another opportunity of seeing at close quarters and it was indeed a fragment of their true social life ordinarily kept secret that one could examine here in public for the princesse de parme having herself distributed among her friends the seats in stalls balconies and boxes the house was like a drawingroom in which everyone changed his place went to sit here or there wherever he caught sight of a woman whom he knew

   next to me were some common people who not knowing the regular subscribers were anxious to shew that they were capable of identifying them and named them aloud they went on to remark that these subscribers behaved there as though they were in their own drawingrooms meaning that they paid no attention to what was being played which was the exact opposite of what did happen a budding genius who had taken a stall in order to hear berma thinks only of not soiling his gloves of not disturbing of making friends with the neighbour whom chance has put beside him of pursuing with an intermittent smile the fugitive — avoiding with apparent want of politeness the intercepted gaze of a person of his acquaintance whom he has discovered in the audience and to whom after a thousand indecisions he makes up his mind to go and talk just as the three hammerblows from the stage sounding before he has had time to reach his friend force him to take flight like the hebrews in the red sea through a heaving tide of spectators and spectatresses whom he has obliged to rise and whose dresses he tears as he passes or tramples on their boots on the other hand it was because the society people sat in their boxes behind the general terrace of the balcony as in so many little drawingrooms the fourth walls of which had been removed or in so many little cafés to which one might go for refreshment without letting oneself be intimidated by the mirrors in gilt frames or the red plush seats in the neapolitan style of the establishment it was because they rested an indifferent hand on the gilded shafts of the columns which upheld this temple of the lyric art it was because they remained unmoved by the extravagant honours which seemed to be being paid them by a pair of carved figures which held out towards the boxes branches of palm and laurel that they and they only would have had minds free to listen to the play if only they had had minds

   at first there was nothing visible but vague shadows in which one suddenly struck — like the gleam of a precious stone which one cannot see — the phosphorescence of a pair of famous eyes or like a medallion of henri iv on a dark background the bent profile of the due d’aumale to whom an invisible lady was exclaiming “monseigneur must allow me to take his coat” to which the prince replied “oh come come really madame d’ambresac” she took it in spite of this vague prohibition and was envied by all the rest her being thus honoured

   but in the other boxes everywhere almost the white deities who inhabited those sombre abodes had flown for shelter against their shadowy walls and remained invisible gradually however as the performance went on their vaguely human forms detached themselves one by one from the shades of night which they patterned and raising themselves towards the light allowed their seminude bodies to emerge and rose and stopped at the limit of their course at the luminous shaded surface on which their brilliant faces appeared behind the gaily breaking foam of the feather fans they unfurled and lightly waved beneath their hyacinthine locks begemmed with pearls which the flow of the tide seemed to have caught and drawn with it this side of them began the orchestra stalls abode of mortals for ever separated from the transparent shadowy realm to which at points here and there served as boundaries on its brimming surface the limpid mirroring eyes of the waternymphs for the folding seats on its shore the forms of the monsters in the stalls were painted upon the surface of those eyes in simple obedience to the laws of optics and according to their angle of incidence as happens with those two sections of external reality to which knowing that they do not possess any soul however rudimentary that can be considered as analogous to our own we should think ourselves mad if we addressed a smile or a glance of recognition namely minerals and people to whom we have not been introduced beyond this boundary withdrawing from the limit of their domain the radiant daughters of the sea kept turning at every moment to smile up at the bearded tritons who clung to the anfractuosities of the cliff or towards some aquatic demigod whose head was a polished stone to which the tides had borne a smooth covering of seaweed and his gaze a disc of rock crystal they leaned towards these creatures offering them sweetmeats sometimes the flood parted to admit a fresh nereid who belated smiling apologetic had just floated into blossom out of the shadowy depths then the act ended having no further hope of hearing the melodious sounds of earth which had drawn them to the surface plunging back all in a moment the several sisters vanished into the night but of all these retreats to the thresholds of which their mild desire to behold the works of man brought the curious goddesses who let none approach them the most famous was the cube of semidarkness known to the world as the stage box of the princesse de guermantes

   like a mighty goddess who presides from far aloft over the sports of lesser deities the princess had deliberately remained a little way back on a sofa placed sideways in the box red as a reef of coral beside a big glassy splash of reflexion which was probably a mirror and made one think of the section cut by a ray of sunlight vertical clear liquid through the flashing crystal of the sea at once plume and blossom like certain subaqueous growths a great white flower downy as the wing of a bird fell from the brow of the princess along one of her cheeks the curve of which it followed with a pliancy coquettish amorous alive and seemed almost to enfold it like a rosy egg in the softness of a halcyon’s nest over her hair reaching in front to her eyebrows and caught back lower down at the level of her throat was spread a net upon which those little white shells which are gathered on some shore of the south seas alternated with pearls a marine mosaic barely emerging from the waves and at every moment plunged back again into a darkness in the depths of which even then a human presence was revealed by the ubiquitous flashing of the princess’s eyes the beauty which set her far above all the other fabulous daughters of the dusk was not altogether materially and comprehensively inscribed on her neck her shoulders her arms her figure but the exquisite unfinished line of the last was the exact starting point the inevitable focus of invisible lines which the eye could not help prolonging marvellous lines springing into life round the woman like the spectrum of an ideal form projected upon the screen of darkness

    “that’s the princesse de guermantes” said my neighbour to the gentleman beside her taking care to begin the word ‘princesse’ with a string of p’s to shew that a title like that was absurd “she hasn’t been sparing with her pearls i’m sure if i had as many as that i wouldn’t make such a display of them it doesn’t look at all well not to my mind”

   and yet when they caught sight of the princess all those who were looking round to see who was in the audience felt springing up for her in their hearts the rightful throne of beauty indeed with the duchesse de luxembourg with mme de morienval with mme de sainteuverte and any number of others what enabled one to identify their faces would be the juxtaposition of a big red nose to a harelip or of a pair of wrinkled cheeks to a faint moustache these features were nevertheless sufficient in themselves to attract the eye since having merely the conventional value of a written document they gave one to read a famous and impressive name but also they gave one cumulatively the idea that ugliness had about it something aristocratic and that it was unnecessary that the face of a great lady provided it was distinguished should be beautiful as well but like certain artists who instead of the letters of their names set at the foot of their canvas a form that is beautiful in itself a butterfly a lizard a flower so it was the form of a delicious face and figure that the princess had put in the corner of her box thereby shewing that beauty can be the noblest of signatures for the presence there of mme de guermantesbavière who brought to the theatre only such persons as at other times formed part of her intimate circle was in the eyes of specialists in aristocracy the best possible certificate of the authenticity of the picture which her box presented a sort of evocation of a scene in the ordinary private life of the princess in her palaces in munich and in paris

   our imagination being like a barrel organ out of order which always plays some other tune than that shewn on its card every time that i had heard any mention of the princesse de guermantesbavière a recollection of certain sixteenthcentury masterpieces had begun singing in my brain i was obliged to rid myself quickly of this association now that i saw her engaged in offering crystallised fruit to a stout gentleman in a swallowtail coat certainly i was very far from the conclusion that she and her guests were mere human beings like the rest of the audience i understood that what they were doing there was all only a game and that as a prelude to the acts of their real life of which presumably this was not where they spent the important part they had arranged in obedience to a ritual unknown to me they were feigning to offer and decline sweetmeats a gesture robbed of its ordinary significance and regulated beforehand like the step of a dancer who alternately raises herself on her toes and circles about an upheld scarf for all i knew perhaps at the moment of offering him her sweetmeats the goddess was saying with that note of irony in her voice for i saw her smile “do have one won’t you” what mattered that to me i should have found a delicious refinement in the deliberate dryness in the style of mérimée or meilhac of such words addressed by a goddess to a demigod who conscious himself what were the sublime thoughts which they both had in their minds in reserve doubtless until the moment when they would begin again to live their true life consenting to join in the game was answering with the same mysterious bitterness “thanks i should like a cherry” and i should have listened to this dialogue with the same avidity as to a scene from le mari de la débutante where the absence of poetry of lofty thoughts things so familiar to me which i suppose meilhac could easily had he chosen have put into it a thousand times over seemed to me in itself a refinement a conventional refinement and therefore all the more mysterious and instructive

    “that fat fellow is the marquis de ganançay” came in a knowing tone from the man next to me who had not quite caught the name whispered in the row behind

   the marquis de palancy his face bent downwards at the end of his long neck his round bulging eye glued to the glass of his monocle was moving with a leisurely displacement through the transparent shade and appeared no more to see the public in the stalls than a fish that drifts past unconscious of the press of curious gazers behind the glass wall of an aquarium now and again he paused a venerable wheezing monument and the audience could not have told whether he was in pain asleep swimming about to spawn or merely taking breath no one else aroused in me so much envy as he on account of his apparent familiarity with this box and the indifference with which he allowed the princess to hold out to him her box of sweetmeats throwing him at the same time a glance from her fine eyes cut in a pair of diamonds which at such moments wit and friendliness seemed to liquefy whereas when they were at rest reduced to their purely material beauty to their mineral brilliance alone if the least reflected flash disturbed them ever so slightly they set the darkness ablaze with inhuman horizontal splendid fires but now because the act ofphèdre in which berma was playing was due to start the princess came to the front of the box whereupon as if she herself were a theatrical production in the zone of light which she traversed i saw not only the colour but the material of her adornments change and in the box dry now emerging a part no longer of the watery realm the princess ceasing to be a nereid appeared turbanned in white and blue like some marvellous tragic actress dressed for the part of zaïre or perhaps of orosmane finally when she had taken her place in the front row i saw that the soft halcyon’s nest which tenderly shielded the rosy nacre of her cheeks was — downy dazzling velvety an immense bird of paradise

   but now my gaze was diverted from the princesse de guermantes’s box by a little woman who came in illdressed plain her eyes ablaze with indignation followed by two young men and sat down a few places from me at length the curtain went up i could not help being saddened by the reflexion that there remained now no trace of my old disposition at the period when so as to miss nothing of the extraordinary phenomenon which i would have gone to the ends of the earth to see i kept my mind prepared like the sensitive plates which astronomers take out to africa to the west indies to make and record an exact observation of a comet or an eclipse when i trembled for fear lest some cloud a fit of ill humour on the artist’s part or an incident in the audience should prevent the spectacle from presenting itself with the maximum of intensity when i should not have believed that i was watching it in the most perfect conditions had i not gone to the very theatre which was consecrated to it like an altar in which i then felt to be still a part of it though an accessory part only the officials with their white carnations appointed by her the vaulted balcony covering a pit filled with a shabbily dressed crowd the women selling programmes that had her photograph the chestnut trees in the square outside all those companions those confidants of my impressions of those days which seemed to me to be inseparable from them phèdre the ‘declaration scene’ berma had had then for me a sort of absolute existence standing aloof from the world of current experience they existed by themselves i must go to meet them i should penetrate what i could of them and if i opened my eyes and soul to their fullest extent i should still absorb but a very little of them but how pleasant life seemed to me the triviality of the form of it that i myself was leading mattered nothing no more than the time we spend on dressing on getting ready to go out since transcending it there existed in an absolute form good and difficult to approach impossible to possess in their entirety those more solid realities  phèdre and the way in which berma spoke her part steeped in these dreams of perfection in the dramatic art a strong dose of which anyone who had at that time subjected my mind to analysis at any moment of the day or even the night would have been able to prepare from it i was like a battery that accumulates and stores up electricity and a time had come when ill as i was even if i had believed that i should die of it i should still have been compelled to go and hear berma but now like a hill which from a distance seems a patch of azure sky but as we draw nearer returns to its place in our ordinary field of vision all this had left the world of the absolute and was no more than a thing like other things of which i took cognisance because i was there the actors were people of the same substance as the people i knew trying to speak in the best possible way these lines of phèdre which themselves no longer formed a sublime and individual essence distinct from everything else but were simply more or less effective lines ready to slip back into the vast corpus of french poetry of which they were merely a part i felt a discouragement that was all the more profound in that if the object of my headstrong and active desire no longer existed the same tendencies on the other hand to indulge in a perpetual dream which varied from year to year but led me always to sudden impulses regardless of danger still persisted the day on which i rose from my bed of sickness and set out to see in some country house or other a picture by elstir or a mediaeval tapestry was so like the day on which i ought to have started for venice or that on which i did go to hear berma or start for balbec that i felt before going that the immediate object of my sacrifice would after a little while leave me cold that then i might pass close by the place without stopping even to look at that picture those tapestries for which i would at this moment risk so many sleepless nights so many hours of pain i discerned in the instability of its object the vanity of my effort and at the same time its vastness which i had not before noticed like a neurasthenic whose exhaustion we double by pointing out to him that he is exhausted in the meantime my musings gave a distinction to everything that had any connexion with them and even in my most carnal desires magnetised always in a certain direction concentrated about a single dream i might have recognised as their primary motive an idea an idea for which i would have laid down my life at the innermost core of which as in my day dreams while i sat reading all afternoon in the garden at combray lay the thought of perfection

   i no longer felt the same indulgence as on the former occasion towards the deliberate expressions of affection or anger which i had then remarked in the delivery and gestures of aricie ismène and hippolyte it was not that the players — they were the same by the way — did not still seek with the same intelligent application to impart now a caressing inflexion or a calculated ambiguity to their voices now a tragic amplitude or a suppliant meekness to their movements their intonations bade the voice “be gentle sing like a nightingale caress and woo” or else “now wax furious” and then hurled themselves upon it trying to carry it off with them in their frenzied rush but it mutinous independent of their diction remained unalterably their natural voice with its material defects or charms its everyday vulgarity or affectation and thus presented a sumtotal of acoustic or social phenomena which the sentiment contained in the lines they were repeating was powerless to alter

   similarly the gestures of the players said to their arms to their garments “be majestic” but each of these unsubmissive members allowed to flaunt itself between shoulder and elbow a biceps which knew nothing of the part they continued to express the triviality of everyday life and to bring into prominence instead of fine shades of racinian meaning mere muscular attachments and the draperies which they held up fell back again along vertical lines in which the natural law that governs falling bodies was challenged only by an insipid textile pliancy at this point the little woman who was sitting near me exclaimed

    “not a hand did you ever see such a getup she’s too old she can’t play the part she ought to have retired ages ago”

   amid a sibilant protest from their neighbours the two young men with her succeeded in making her keep quiet and her fury raged now only in her eyes this fury could moreover be prompted only by the thought of success of fame for berma who had earned so much money was overwhelmed with debts since she was always making business or social appointments which she was prevented from keeping she had messengers flying with apologies along every street in paris and what with rooms in hotels which she would never occupy engaged in advance oceans of scent to bathe her dogs heavy penalties for breaches of contract with all her managers failing any more serious expense and being not so voluptuous as cleopatra she would have found the means of squandering on telegrams and jobmasters provinces and kingdoms but the little woman was an actress who had never tasted success and had vowed a deadly hatred against berma the latter had just corne on to the stage and then — oh the miracle — like those lessons which we laboured in vain to learn overnight and find intact got by heart on waking up next morning like too those faces of dead friends which the impassioned efforts of our memory pursue without recapturing them and which when we are no longer thinking of them are there before our eyes just as they were in life — the talent of berma which had evaded me when i sought so greedily to seize its essential quality now after these years of oblivion in this hour of indifference imposed itself with all the force of a thing directly seen on my admiration formerly in my attempts to isolate the talent i deducted so to speak from what i heard the part itself a part common to all the actresses who appeared as phèdre which i had myself studied beforehand so that i might be capable of subtracting it of receiving in the strained residue only the talent of mme berma but this talent which i sought to discover outside the part itself was indissolubly one with it so with a great musician it appears that this was the case with vinteuil when he played the piano his playing is that of so fine a pianist that one cannot even be certain whether the performer is a pianist at all since not interposing all that mechanism of muscular effort crowned here and there with brilliant effects all that spattering shower of notes in which at least the listener who does not quite know where he is thinks that he can discern talent in its material tangible objectivity his playing is become so transparent so full of what he is interpreting that himself one no longer sees and he is nothing now but a window opening upon a great work of art the intentions which surrounded like a majestic or delicate border the voice and mimicry of aricie ismène or hippolyte i had been able to distinguish but phèdre had taken hers into herself and my mind had not succeeded in wresting from her diction and attitudes in apprehending in the miserly simplicity of their unbroken surfaces those treasures those effects of which no sign emerged so completely had they been absorbed berma’s voice in which not one atom of lifeless matter refractory to the mind remained undissolved did not allow any sign to be discernible around it of that overflow of tears which one could feel because they had not been able to absorb it in themselves trickling over the marble voice of aricie or ismène but had been brought to an exquisite perfection in each of its tiniest cells like the instrument of a master violinist in whom one means when one says that his music has a fine sound to praise not a physical peculiarity but a superiority of soul and as in the classical landscape where in the place of a vanished nymph there is an inanimate waterspring a clear and concrete intention had been transformed into a certain quality of tone strangely appropriately coldly limpid berma’s arms which the lines themselves by the same dynamic force that made the words issue from her lips seemed to raise on to her bosom like leaves disturbed by a gush oî water her attitude on the stage which she had gradually built up which she was to modify yet further and which was based upon reasonings of a different profundity from those of which traces might be seen in the gestures of her fellowactors but of reasonings that had lost their original deliberation and had melted into a sort of radiance in which they sent throbbing round the person of the heroine elements rich and complex but which the fascinated spectator took not as an artistic triumph but as a natural gift those white veils themselves which tenuous and clinging seemed to be of a living substance and to have been woven by the suffering halfpagan halfjansenist around which they drew close like a frail shrinking chrysalis all of them voice attitude gestures veils were nothing more round this embodiment of an idea which a line of poetry is an embodiment that unlike our human bodies covers the soul not with an opaque screen which prevents us from seeing it but with a purified a quickened garment through which the soul is diffused and we discover it than additional envelopes which instead of concealing shewed up in greater splendour the soul that had assimilated them to itself and had spread itself through them than layers of different substances grown translucent the interpolation of which has the effect only of causing a richer refraction of the imprisoned central ray that pierces through them and of making more extensive more precious and more fair the matter purified by fire in which it is enshrined so berma’s interpretation was around racine’s work a second work quickened also by the breath of genius

   my own impression to tell the truth though more pleasant than on the earlier occasion was not really different only i no longer put it to the test of a preexistent abstract and false idea of dramatic genius and i understood now that dramatic genius was precisely this it had just occurred to me that if i had not derived any pleasure from my first hearing of berma it was because as earlier still when i used to meet gilberte in the champselysées i had come to her with too strong a desire between my two disappointments there was perhaps not only this resemblance but another more profound the impression given us by a person or a work or a rendering for that matter of marked individuality is peculiar to that person or work we have brought to it the ideas of ‘beauty’ ‘breadth of style’ ‘pathos’ and so forth which we might failing anything better have had the illusion of discovering in the commonplace show of a ‘correct’ face or talent but our critical spirit has before it the insistent challenge of a form of which it possesses no intellectual equivalent in which it must detect and isolate the unknown element it hears a shrill sound an oddly interrogative intonation it asks itself “is that good is what i am feeling just now admiration is that richness of colouring nobility strength” and what answers it again is a shrill voice a curiously questioning tone the despotic impression caused by a person whom one does not know wholly material in which there is no room left for ‘breadth of interpretation’ and for this reason it is the really beautiful works that if we listen to them with sincerity must disappoint us most keenly because in the storehouse of our ideas there is none that corresponds to an individual impression

   this was precisely what berma’s acting shewed me this was what was meant by nobility by intelligence of diction now i could appreciate the worth of a broad poetical powerful interpretation or rather it was to this that those epithets were conventionally applied but only as we give the names of mars venus saturn to planets which have no place in classical mythology we feel in one world we think we give names to things in another between the two we can establish a certain correspondence but not bridge the interval it was quite narrow this interval this fault that i had had to cross when that afternoon on which i went first to bear berma having strained my ears to catch every word i had found some difficulty in correlating my ideas of ‘nobility of interpretation’ of ‘originality’ and had broken out in applause only after a moment of unconsciousness and as if my applause sprang not from my actual impression but was connected in some way with my preconceived ideas with the pleasure that i found in saying to myself “at last i am listening to berma” and the difference that there is between a person or a work of art which is markedly individual and the idea of beauty exists just as much between what they make us feel and the idea of love or of admiration wherefore we fail to recognise them i had found no pleasure in listening to berma any more than earlier still in seeing gilberte i had said to myself “well i do not admire this” but then i was thinking only of mastering the secret of berma’s acting i was preoccupied with that alone i was trying to open my mind as wide as possible to receive all that her acting contained i understood now that all this amounted to nothing more nor less than admiration

   this genius of which berma’s rendering of the part was only the revelation was it indeed the genius of racine and nothing more

   i thought so at first i was soon to be undeceived when the curtain fell on the act from phèdre amid enthusiastic recalls from the audience through which the old actress beside herself with rage drawing her little body up to its full height turning sideways in her seat stiffened the muscles of her face and folded her arms on her bosom to shew that she was not joining the others in their applause and to make more noticeable a protest which to her appeared sensational though it passed unperceived the piece that followed was one of those novelties which at one time i had expected since they were not famous to be inevitably trivial and of no general application devoid as they were of any existence outside the performance that was being given of them at the moment but i had not with them as with a classic the disappointment of seeing the infinity and eternity of a masterpiece occupy no more space or time than the width of the footlights and the length of a performance which would finish it as effectively as a piece written for the occasion besides at every fresh passage which i felt had appealed to the audience and would onc day be famous in place of the fame which it was prevented from having won in the past i added that which it would enjoy in the future by a mental process the converse of that which consists in imagining masterpieces on the day of their first thin performance when it seemed inconceivable that a title which no one had ever heard before could one day be set bathed in the same mellow light beside those of the author’s other works and this part would be set one day in the list of her finest impersonations next to that of phèdre not that in itself it was not destitute of all literary merit but berma was as sublime in one as in the other i realised then that the work of the playwright was for the actress no more than the material the nature of which was comparatively unimportant for the creation of her masterpiece of interpretation just as the great painter whom i had met at balbec elstir had found the inspiration for two pictures of equal merit in a school building without any character and a cathedral which was in itself a work of art and as the painter dissolves houses carts people in some broad effect of light which makes them all alike so berma spread out great sheets of terror or tenderness over words that were all melted together in a common mould lowered or raised to one level which a lesser artist would have carefully detached from one another no doubt each of them had an inflexion of its own and berma’s diction did not prevent one from catching the rhythm of the verse is it not already a first element of ordered complexity of beauty when on hearing a rhyme that is to say something which is at once similar to and different from the preceding rhyme which was prompted by it but introduces the variety of a new idea one is conscious of two systems overlapping each other one intellectual the other prosodie but berma at the same time made her words her lines her whole speeches even flow into lakes of sound vaster than themselves at the margins of which it was a joy to see them obliged to stop to break off thus it is that a poet takes pleasure in making hesitate for a moment at the rhyming point the word which is about to spring forth and a composer in merging the various words of his libretto in a single rhythm which contradicts captures and controls them thus into the prose sentences of the modern playwright as into the poetry of racine berma managed to introduce those vast images of grief nobility passion which were the masterpieces of her own personal art and in which she could be recognised as in the portraits which he has made of different sitters we recognise a painter

   i had no longer any desire as on the former occasion to be able to arrest and perpetuate berma’s attitudes the fine colour effect which she gave for a moment only in a beam of limelight which at once faded never to reappear nor to make her repeat a single line a hundred times over i realised that my original desire had been more exacting than the intentions of the poet the actress the great decorative artist who supervised her productions and that that charm which floated over a line as it was spoken those unstable poses perpetually transformed into others those successive pictures were the transient result the momentary object the changing masterpiece which the art of the theatre undertook to create and which would perish were an attempt made to fix it for all time by a too much enraptured listener i did not even make a resolution to come back another day and hear berma again i was satisfied with her it was when i admired too keenly not to be disappointed by the object of my admiration whether that object were gilberte or berma that i demanded in advance of the impression to be received on the morrow the pleasure that yesterday’s impression had refused to afford me without seeking to analyse the joy which i had begun now to feel and might perhaps have been turning to some more profitable use i said to myself as in the old days i might have said to one of my schoolfellows “certainly i put berma first” not without a confused feeling that berma’s genius was not perhaps very accurately represented by this affirmation of my preference or this award to her of a ‘first’ place whatever the peace of mind that it might incidentally restore to me

   just as the curtain was rising on this second play i looked up at mme de guermantes’s box the princess was in the act — by a movement that called into being an exquisite line which my mind pursued into the void — of turning her head towards the back of the box her party were all standing and also turning towards the back and between the double hedge which they thus formed with all the assurance the grandeur of the goddess that she was but with a strange meekness which so late an arrival making every one else get up in the middle of the performance blended with the white muslin in which she was attired just as an adroitly compounded air of simplicity shyness and confusion tempered her triumphant smile the duchesse de guermantes who had at that moment entered the box came towards her cousin made a profound obeisance to a young man with fair hair who was seated in the front row and turning again towards the amphibian monsters who were floating in the recesses of the cavern gave to these demigods of the jockey club — who at that moment and among them all m de palancy in particular were the men whom i should most have liked to be — the familiar ‘good evening’ of an old and intimate friend an allusion to the daily sequence of her relations with them during the last fifteen years i felt the mystery but could not solve the riddle of that smiling gaze which she addressed to her friends in the azure brilliance with which it glowed while she surrendered her hand to one and then to another a gaze which could i have broken up its prism analysed its crystallisation might perhaps have revealed to me the essential quality of the unknown form of life which became apparent in it at that moment the duc de guermantes followed his wife the flash of his monocle the gleam of his teeth the whiteness of his carnation or of his pleated shirtfront scattering to make room for their light the darkness of his eyebrows lips and coat with a wave of his outstretched hand which he let drop on to their shoulders vertically without moving his head he commanded the inferior monsters who were making way for him to resume their seats and made a profound bow to the fair young man one would have said that the duchess had guessed that her cousin of whom it was rumoured she was inclined to make fun for what she called her ‘exaggerations’ a name which from her own point of view so typically french and restrained would naturally be applied to the poetry and enthusiasm of the teuton would be wearing this evening one of those costumes in which the duchess thought of her as ‘dressed up’ and that she had decided to give her a lesson in good taste instead of the wonderful downy plumage which from the crown of the princess’s head fell and swept her throat instead of her net of shells and pearls the duchess wore in her hair only a simple aigrette which rising above her arched nose and level eyes reminded one of the crest on the head of a bird her neck and shoulders emerged from a drift of snowwhite muslin against which fluttered a swansdown fan but below this her gown the bodice of which had for its sole ornament innumerable spangles either little sticks and beads of metal or possibly brilliants moulded her figure with a precision that was positively british but different as their two costumes were after the princess had given her cousin the chair in which she herself had previously been sitting they could be seen turning to gaze at one another in mutual appreciation

   possibly a smile would curve the lips of mme de guermantes when next day she referred to the headdress a little too complicated which the princess had worn but certainly she would declare that it had been all the same quite lovely and marvellously arranged and the princess whose own tastes found something a little cold a little austere a little ‘tailormade’ in her cousin’s way of dressing would discover in this rigid sobriety an exquisite refinement moreover the harmony that existed between them the universal and preestablished gravitation exercised by their upbringing neutralised the contrasts not only in their apparel but in their attitude by those invisible magnetic longitudes which the refinement of their manners traced between them the expansive nature of the princess was stopped short while on the other side the formal correctness of the duchess allowed itself to be attracted and relaxed turned to sweetness and charm as in the play which was now being performed to realise how much personal poetry berma extracted from it one had only to entrust the part which she was playing which she alone could play to no matter what other actress so the spectator who should raise his eyes to the balcony might see in two smaller boxes there how an ‘arrangement’ supposed to suggest that of the princesse de guermantes simply made the baronne de morienval appear eccentric pretentious and illbred while an effort as painstaking as it must have been costly to imitate the clothes and style of the duchesse de guermantes only made mme de cambremer look like some provincial schoolgirl mounted on wires rigid erect dry angular with a plume of raven’s feathers stuck vertically in her hair perhaps the proper place for this lady was not a theatre in which it was only with the brightest stars of the season that the boxes even those in the highest tier which from below seemed like great hampers brimming with human flowers and fastened to the gallery on which they stood by the red cords of their plushcovered partitions composed a panorama which deaths scandals illnesses quarrels would soon alter but which this evening was held motionless by attention heat giddiness dust smartness or boredom in that so to speak everlasting moment of unconscious waiting and calm torpor which in retrospect seems always to have preceded the explosion of a bomb or the first flicker of a fire

   the explanation of mme de cambremer’s presence on this occasion was that the princesse de parme devoid of snobbishness as are most truly royal personages and to make up for this devoured by a pride in and passion for charity which held an equal place in her heart with her taste for what she believed to be the arts had bestowed a few boxes here and there upon women like mme de cambremer who were not numbered among the highest aristocratic society but with whom she was connected in various charitable undertakings mme de cambremer never took her eyes off the duchesse and princesse de guermantes which was all the simpler for her since not being actually acquainted with either she could not be suspected of angling for recognition inclusion in the visiting lists of these two great ladies was nevertheless the goal towards which she had been marching for the last ten years with untiring patience she had calculated that she might reach it possibly in five years more but having been smitten by a relentless malady the inexorable character of which — for she prided herself upon her medical knowledge — she thought she knew she was afraid that she might not live so long this evening she was happy at least in the thought that all these women whom she barely knew would see in her company a man who was one of their own set the young marquis de beausergent mme d’argencourt’s brother who moved impartially in both worlds and with whom the women of the second were greatly delighted to bedizen themselves before the eyes of those of the first he was seated behind mme de cambremer on a chair placed at an angle so that he might rake the other boxes with his glasses he knew everyone in the house and to greet his friends with the irresistible charm of his beautifully curved figure and fine fair head he half rose from his seat stiffening his body a smile brightening his blue eyes with a blend of deference and detachment a picture delicately engraved in its rectangular frame and placed at an angle to the wall like one of those old prints which portray a great nobleman in his courtly pride he often accepted these invitations to go with mme de cambremer to the play in the theatre itself and on their way out in the lobby he stood gallantly by her side in the thick of the throng of more brilliant friends whom he saw about him and to whom he refrained from speaking to avoid any awkwardness just as though he had been in doubtful company if at such moments there swept by him the princesse de guermantes lightfoot and fair as diana letting trail behind her the folds of an incomparable cloak turning after her every head and followed by every eye and most of all by mme de cambremer’s m de beausergent would become absorbed in conversation with his companion acknowledging the friendly and dazzling smile of the princess only with constraint under compulsion and with the wellbred reserve the considerate coldness of a person whose friendliness might at the moment have been inconvenient

   had not mme de cambremer known already that the box belonged to the princess she could still have told that the duchesse de guermantes was the guest from the air of keener interest with which she was surveying the spectacle of stage and stalls out of politeness to her hostess but simultaneously with this centrifugal force an equal and opposite force generated by the same desire to be sociable drew her attention back to her own attire her plume her necklace her bodice and also to that of the princess whose subject whose slave her cousin seemed thus to proclaim herself come thither solely to see her ready to follow her elsewhere should it have taken the fancy of the official occupant of the box to rise and leave and regarding as composed merely of strangers worth looking at simply as curiosities the rest of the house in which nevertheless she numbered many friends to whose boxes she regularly repaired on other evenings and with regard to whom she never failed on those occasions to demonstrate a similar loyalism exclusive conditional and hebdomadary mme de cambremer was surprised to see her there that evening she knew that the duchess was staying on very late at guermantes and had supposed her to be there still but she had been told also that sometimes when there was some special function in paris which she considered it worth her while to attend mme de guermantes would order one of her carriages to be brought round as soon as she had taken tea with the guns and as the sun was setting start out at a spanking pace through the gathering darkness of the forest then over the high road to join the train at combray and so be in paris the same evening “perhaps she has come up from guermantes on purpose to hear berma” thought mme de cambremer and marvelled at the thought and she remembered having heard swann say in that ambiguous jargon which he used in common with m de charlus “the duchess is one of the noblest souls in paris the cream of the most refined the choicest society” for myself who derived from the names guermantes bavaria and condé what i imagined to be the life the thoughts of the two cousins i could no longer so ascribe their faces having seen them i would rather have had their opinion of phèdre than that of the greatest critic in the world for in his i should have found merely intellect an intellect superior to my own but similar in kind but what the duchesse and princesse de guermantes might think an opinion which would have furnished me with an invaluable clue to the nature of these two poetic creatures i imagined with the aid of their names i endowed with an irrational charm and with the thirst the longing of a feverstricken wretch what i demanded that their opinion of phèdre should yield to me was the charm of the summer afternoons that i had spent in wandering along the guermantes way

   mme de cambremer was trying to make out how exactly the cousins were dressed for my own part i never doubted that their garments were peculiar to themselves not merely in the sense in which the livery with red collar or blue facings had belonged once exclusively to the houses of guermantes and condé but rather as is peculiar to a bird the plumage which as well as being a heightening of its beauty is an extension of its body the toilet of these two ladies seemed to me like a materialisation snowwhite or patterned with colour of their internal activity and like the gestures which i had seen the princesse de guermantes make with no doubt in my own mind that they corresponded to some idea latent in hers the plumes which swept downward from her brow and her cousin’s glittering spangled bodice seemed each to have a special meaning to be to one or the other lady an attribute which was hers and hers alone the significance of which i would eagerly have learned the bird of paradise seemed inseparable from its wearer as her peacock is from juno and i did not believe that any other woman could usurp that spangled bodice any more than the fringed and flashing aegis of minerva and when i turned my eyes to their box far more than on the ceiling of the theatre painted with cold and lifeless allegories it was as though i had seen thanks to a miraculous rending of the clouds that ordinarily veiled it the assembly of the gods in the act of contemplating the spectacle of mankind beneath a crimsor canopy in a clear lighted space between two pillars of heaven i gazed on this brief transfiguration with a disturbance which was partly soothed by the feeling that i myself was unknown to these immortals the duchess had indeed seen me once with her husband but could surely have kept no memory of that and it gave me no pain that she found herself owing to the place that she occupied in the box in a position to gaze down upon the nameless collective madrepores of the public in the stalls for i had the happy sense that my own personality had been dissolved in theirs when at the moment in which by the force of certain optical laws there must i suppose have come to paint itself on the impassive current of those blue eyes the blurred outline of the protozoon devoid of any individual existence which was myself i saw a ray illumine them the duchess goddess turned woman and appearing in that moment a thousand times more lovely raised pointed in my direction the whitegloved hand which had been resting on the balustrade of the box waved it at me in token of friendship my gaze felt itself trapped in the spontaneous incandescence of the flashing eyes of the princess who had unconsciously set them ablaze merely by turning her head to see who it might be that her cousin was thus greeting while the duchess who had remembered me showered upon me the sparkling and celestial torrent of her smile

   and now every morning long before the hour at which she would appear i went by a devious course to post myself at the corner of the street along which she generally came and when the moment of her arrival seemed imminent strolled homewards with an air of being absorbed in something else looking the other way and raising my eyes to her face as i drew level with her but as though i had not in the least expected to see her indeed for the first few mornings so as to be sure of not missing her i waited opposite the house and every time that the carriage gate opened letting out one after another so many people who were none of them she for whom i was waiting its grinding rattle continued in my heart in a series of oscillations which it took me a long time to subdue for never was devotee of a famous actress whom he did not know posting himself and patrolling the pavement outside the stage door never was angry or idolatrous crowd gathered to insult or to carry in triumph through the streets the condemned assassin or the national hero whom it believes to be on the point of coming whenever a sound is heard from the inside of the prison or the palace never were these so stirred by their emotion as i was awaiting the emergence of this great lady who in her simple attire was able by the grace of her movements quite different from the gait she affected on entering a drawingroom or a box to make of her morning walk — and for me there was no one in the world but herself out walking — a whole poem of elegant refinement and the finest ornament the most curious flower of the season but after the third day so that the porter should not discover my stratagem i betook myself much farther afield to some point upon the duchess’s usual route often before that evening at the theatre i had made similar little excursions before luncheon when the weather was fine if it had been raining at the first gleam of sunshine i would hasten downstairs to take a turn and if suddenly coming towards me on the still wet pavement changed by the sun into a golden lacquer in the transformation scene of a crossroads dusty with a grey mist which the sun tanned and gilded i caught sight of a schoolgirl followed by her governess or of a dairymaid with her white sleeves i stood motionless my hand pressed to my heart which was already leaping towards an unexplored form of life i tried to bear in mind the street the time the number of the door through which the girl whom i followed sometimes had vanished and failed to reappear fortunately the fleeting nature of these cherished images which i promised myself that i would make an effort to see again prevented them from fixing themselves with any vividness in my memory no matter i was less sad now at the thought of my own ill health of my never having summoned up courage to set to work to begin a book the world appeared to me now a pleasanter place to live in life a more interesting experience now that i had learned that the streets of paris like the roads round balbec were aflower with those unknown beauties whom i had so often sought to evoke from the woods of méséglise each one of whom aroused a sensual longing which she alone appeared capable of assuaging

   on coming home from the opéracomique i had added for next morning to the list of those which for some days past i had been hoping to meet again the form of mme de guermantes tall with her highpiled crown of silky golden hair with the kindness promised me in the smile which she had directed at me from her cousin’s box i would follow the course which françoise had told me that the duchess generally took and i would try at the same time in the hope of meeting two girls whom i had seen a few days earlier not to miss the breakup of their respective class and catechism but in the mean time ever and again the scintillating smile of mme de guermantes the pleasant sensation it had given me returned and without exactly knowing what i was doing i tried to find a place for them as a woman studies the possible effect on her dress of some set of jewelled buttons that have just been given her beside the romantic ideas which i had long held and which albertine’s coldness gisèle’s premature departure ana before them my deliberate and too long sustained separation from gilberte had set free the idea for instance of being loved by a woman of having a life in common with her next it had been the image of one or other of the two girls seen in the street that i brought into relation with those ideas to which immediately afterwards i was trying to adapt my memory of the duchess compared with those ideas my memory of mme de guermantes at the opéracomique was a very little thing a tiny star twinkling beside the long tail of a blazing comet moreover i had been quite familiar with the ideas long before i came to know mme de guermantes my memory of her on the contrary i possessed but imperfectly every now and then it escaped me it was during the hours when from floating vaguely in my mind in the same way as the images of various other pretty women it passed gradually into a unique and definite association — exclusive of every other feminine form — with those romantic ideas of so much longer standing than itself it was during those few hours in which i remembered it most clearly that i ought to have taken steps to find out exactly what it was but i did not then know the importance which it was to assume for me it was pleasant merely as a first private meeting with mme de guermantes inside myself it was the first the only accurate sketch the only one taken from life the only one that was really mme de guermantes during the few hours in which i was fortunate enough to retain it without having the sense to pay it any attention it must all the same have been charming that memory since it was always to it and quite freely moreover to that moment without haste without strain without the slightest compulsion or anxiety that my ideas of love returned then as gradually those ideas fixed it more definitely it acquired from them a proportionately greater strength but itself became more vague presently i could no longer recapture it and in my dreams i probably altered it completely for whenever i saw mme de guermantes i realised the difference — never twice as it happened the same — between what i had imagined and what i saw and now every morning certainly at the moment when mme de guermantes emerged from her gateway at the top of the street i saw again her tall figure her face with its bright eyes and crown of silken hair — all the things for which i was there waiting but on the other hand a minute or two later when having first turned my eyes away so as to appear not to be waiting for this encounter which i had come out to seek i raised them to look at the duchess at the moment in which we converged what i saw then were red patches as to which i knew not whether they were due to the fresh air or to a faulty complexion on a sullen face which with the curtest of nods a long way removed from the affability of the phèdre evening acknowledged my salute which i addressed to her daily with an air of surprise and which did not seem to please her and yet after a few days during which the memory of the two girls fought against heavy odds for the mastery of my amorous feelings against that of mme de guermantes it was in the end the latter which as though of its own accord generally prevailed while its competitors withdrew it was to it that i finally found myself deliberately moreover and as though by preference and for my own pleasure to have transferred all my thoughts of love i had ceased to dream of the little girls coming from their catechism or of a certain dairymaid and yet i had also lost all hope of encountering in the street what i had come out to seek either the affection promised to me at the theatre in a smile or the profile the bright face beneath its pile of golden hair which were so only when seen from afar now i should not even have been able to say what mme de guermantes was like by what i recognised her for every day in the picture which she presented as a whole the face was different as were the dress and the hat

   why did i one morning when i saw bearing down on me beneath a violet hood a sweet smooth face whose charms were symmetrically arranged about a pair of blue eyes a face in which the curve of the nose seemed to have been absorbed gauge from a joyous commotion in my bosom that i was not going to return home without having caught a glimpse of mme de guermantes and on the next feel the same disturbance affect the same indifference turn away my eyes in the same careless manner as on the day before on the apparition seen in profile as she crossed from a side street and crowned by a navyblue toque of a beaklike nose bounding a flushed cheek chequered with a piercing eye like some egyptian deity once it was not merely a woman with a bird’s beak that i saw but almost the bird itself the outer garments even the toque of mme de guermantes were of fur and since she thus left no cloth visible she seemed naturally furred like certain vultures whose thick smooth dusky downy plumage suggests rather the skin of a wild beast from the midst of this natural plumage the tiny head arched out its beak and the two eyes on its surface were piercingkeen and blue

   one day i had been pacing up and down the street for hours on end without a vestige of mme de guermantes when suddenly inside a pastrycook’s shop tucked in between two of the mansions of this aristocratic and plebeian quarter there appeared took shape the vague and unfamiliar face of a fashionably dressed woman who was asking to see some little cakes and before i had had time to make her out there shot forth at me like a lightning flash reaching me sooner than its accompaniment of thunder the glance of the duchess another time having failed to meet her and hearing twelve strike i realised that it was not worth my while to wait for her any longer i was sorrowfully making my way homewards and absorbed in my own disappointment looking absently after and not seeing a carriage that had overtaken me i realised suddenly that the movement of her head which i saw a lady make through the carriage window was meant for me and that this lady whose features relaxed and pale or it might equally be tense and vivid composed beneath a round hat which nestled at the foot of a towering plume the face of a stranger whom i had supposed that i did not know was mme de guermantes by whom i had let myself be greeted without so much as acknowledging her bow and sometimes i came upon her as i entered the gate standing outside the lodge where the detestable porter whose scrutinous eye i loathed and dreaded was in the act of making her a profound obeisance and also no doubt his daily report for the entire staff of the guermantes household hidden behind the window curtains were trembling as they watched a conversation which they were unable to overhear but which meant as they very well knew that one or other of them would certainly have his ‘day out’ stopped by the duchess to whom this cerberus was betraying him in view of the whole series of different faces which mme guermantes displayed thus one after another faces that occupied a relative and varying extent contracted one day vast the next in her person and attire as a whole my love was not attached to any one of those changeable and everchanging elements of flesh and fabric which replaced one another as day followed day and which she could modify could almost entirely reconstruct without altering my disturbance because beneath them beneath the new collar and the strange cheek i felt that it was still mme de guermantes what i loved was the invisible person who set all this outward show in motion her whose hostility so distressed me whose approach set me trembling whose life i would fain have made my own and driven out of it her friends she might flaunt a blue feather or shew a fiery cheek without her actions’ losing their importance for me

   i should not myself have felt that mme de guermantes was tired of meeting me day after day had i not learned it indirectly by reading it on the face stiff with coldness disapproval and pity which françoise shewed when she was helping me to get ready for these morning walks the moment i asked her for my outdoor things i felt a contrary wind arise in her worn and battered features i made no attempt to win her confidence for i knew that i should not succeed she had for at once discovering any unpleasant thing that might have happened to my parents or myself a power the nature of which i have never been able to fathom perhaps it was not supernatural but was to be explained by sourees of information that were open to her alone as it may happen that the news which often reaches a savage tribe several days before the post has brought it to the european colony has really been transmitted to them not by telepathy but from hilltop to hilltop by a chain of beacon fires so in the particular instance of my morning walks possibly mme de guermantes’s servants had heard their mistress say how tired she was of running into me every day without fail wherever she went and had repeated her remarks to françoise my parents might it is true have attached some servant other than françoise to my person still i should have been no better off françoise was in a sense less of a servant than the others in her way of feeling things of being kind and pitiful hard and distant superior and narrow of combining a white skin with red hands she was still the village maiden whose parents had had ‘a place of their own’ but having come to grief had been obliged to put her into service her presence in our household was the country air the social life of a farm of fifty years ago wafted to us by a sort of reversal of the normal order of travel whereby it is the place that comes to visit the person as the glass cases in a local museum are filled with specimens of the curious handiwork which the peasants still carve or embroider or whatever it may be in certain parts of the country so our flat in paris was decorated with the words of françoise inspired by a traditional local sentiment and governed by extremely ancient laws and she could in paris find her way back as though by clues of coloured thread to the songbirds and cherry trees of her childhood to her mother’s deathbed which she still vividly saw but in spite of all this wealth of background once she had come to paris and had entered our service she had acquired — as obviously anyone else coming there in her place would have acquired — the ideas the system of interpretation used by the servants on the other floors compensating for the respect which she was obliged to shew to us by repeating the rude words that the cook on the fourth floor had used to her mistress with a servile gratification so intense that for the first time in our lives feeling a sort of solidarity between ourselves and the detestable occupant of the fourth floor flat we said to ourselves that possibly we too were ‘employers’ after all this alteration in françoise’» character was perhaps inevitable certain forms of existence are so abnormal that they are bound to produce certain characteristic faults such was the life led by the king at versailles among his courtiers a life as strange as that of a pharaoh or a doge — and far more even than his the life of his courtiers the life led by our servants is probably of an even more monstrous abnormality which only its familiarity can prevent us from seeing but it was actually in details more intimate still that i should have been obliged if i had dismissed françoise to keep the same servant for various others might in years to come enter my service already furnished with the defects common to all servants they underwent nevertheless a rapid transformation with me as in the rules of tactics an attack in one sector compels a counterattack in another so as not to be hurt by the asperities of my nature all of them effected in their own an identical resilience always at the same points and to make up for this took advantage of the gaps in my line to thrust out advanced posts of these gaps i knew nothing any more than of the salients to which they gave rise precisely because they were gaps but my servants by gradually becoming spoiled taught me of their existence it was from the defects which they invariably acquired that i learned what were my own natural and invariable shortcomings their character offered me a sort of negative plate of my own we had always laughed my mother and i at mme sazerat who used in speaking of her servants expressions like ‘the lower orders’ or ‘the servant class’ but i am bound to admit that what made it useless to think of replacing françoise by anyone else was that her successor would inevitably have belonged just as much to the race of servants in general and to the class of my servants in particular

   to return to françoise i never in my life experienced any humiliation without having seen beforehand on her face a store of condolences prepared and waiting and if then in my anger at the thought of being pitied by her i tried to pretend that on the contrary i had scored a distinct success my lies broke feebly on the wall of her respectful but obvious unbelief and the consciousness that she enjoyed of her own infallibility for she knew the truth she refrained from uttering it and made only a slight movement with her lips as if she still bad her mouth full and was finishing a tasty morsel she refrained from uttering it or so at least i long believed for at that time i still supposed that it was by means of words that one communicated the truth to others indeed the words that people used to me recorded their meaning so unalterably on the sensitive plate of my mind that i could no more believe it to be possible that anyone who had professed to love me did not love me than françoise herself could have doubted when she had read it in a newspaper that some clergyman or gentleman was prepared on receipt of a stamped envelope to furnish us free of charge with an infallible remedy for every known complaint or with the means of multiplying our income an hundredfold if on the other hand our doctor were to prescribe for her the simplest ointment to cure a cold in the head she so stubborn to endure the keenest suffering would complain bitterly of what she had been made to sniff insisting that it tickled her nose and that life was not worth living but she was the first person to prove to me by her example which i was not to understand until long afterwards when it was given me afresh and to my greater discomfort as will be found in the later volumes of this work by a person who was dearer to me than françoise that the truth has no need to be uttered to be made apparent and that one may perhaps gather it with more certainty without waiting for words without even bothering one’s head about them from a thousand outward signs even from certain invisible phenomena analogous in the sphere of human character to what in nature are atmospheric changes i might perhaps have suspected this since to myself at that time it frequently occurred that i said things in which there was no vestige of truth while i made the real truth plain by all manner of involuntary confidences expressed by my body and in my actions which were at once interpreted by françoise i ought perhaps to have suspected it but to do so i should first have had to be conscious that i myself was occasionally untruthful and dishonest now untruthfulness and dishonesty were with me as with most people called into being in so immediate so contingent a fashion and in selfdefence by some particular interest that my mind fixed on some lofty ideal allowed my character in the darkness below to set about those urgent sordid tasks and did net look down to observe them when françoise in the evening was polite to me and asked my permission before sitting down in my room it seemed as though her face became transparent and i could see the goodness and honesty that lay beneath but jupien who had lapses into indiscretion of which i learned only later revealed afterwards that she had told him that i was not worth the price of a rope to hang me and that i had tried to insult her in every possible way these words of jupien set up at once before my eyes in new and strange colours a print of the picture of my relations with françoise so different from that on which i used to like letting my eyes rest and in which without the least possibility of doubt françoise adored me and lost no opportunity of singing my praises that i realised that it is not only the material world that is different from the aspect in which we see it that all reality is perhaps equally dissimilar from what we think ourselves to be directly perceiving that the trees the sun and the sky would not be the same as what we see if they were apprehended by creatures having eyes differently constituted from ours or better still endowed for that purpose with organs other than eyes which would furnish trees and sky and sun with equivalents though not visual however that might be this sudden outlet which jupien threw open for me upon the real world appalled me so far it was only françoise that was revealed and of her i barely thought was it the same with all one’s social relations and in what depths of despair might this not some day plunge me if it were the same with love that was the future’s secret for the present only françoise was concerned did she sincerely believe what she had said to jupien had she said it to embroil jupien with me possibly so that we should not appoint jupien’s girl as her successor at any rate i realised the impossibility of obtaining any direct and certain knowledge of whether françoise loved or lothed me and thus it was she who first gave me the idea that a person does not as i had imagined stand motionless and clear before our eyes with his merits his defects his plans his intentions with regard to ourself exposed on his surface like a garden at which with all its borders spread out before us we gaze through a railing but is a shadow which we can never succeed in penetrating of which there can be no such thing as direct knowledge with respect to which we form countless beliefs based upon his words and sometimes upon his actions though neither words nor actions can give us anything but inadequate and as it proves contradictory information — a shadow behind which we can alternately imagine with equal justification that there burns the flame of hatred and of love

   i was genuinely in love with mme de guermantes the greatest happiness that i could have asked of god would have been that he should overwhelm her under every imaginable calamity and that ruined despised stripped of all the privileges that divided her from me having no longer any home of her own or people who would condescend to speak to her she should come to me for refuge i imagined her doing so and indeed on those evenings when some change in the atmosphere or in my own condition brought to the surface of my consciousness some forgotten scroll on which were recorded impressions of other days instead of profiting by the refreshing strength that had been generated in me instead of employing it to decipher in my own mind thoughts which as a rule escaped me instead of setting myself at last to work i preferred to relate aloud to plan out in the third person with a flow of invention as useless as was my declamation of it a whole novel crammed with adventure in which the duchess fallen upon misfortune came to implore assistance from me — me who had become by a converse change of circumstances rich and powerful and when i had let myself thus for hours on end imagine the circumstances rehearse the sentences with which i should welcome the duchess beneath my roof the situation remained unaltered i had alas in reality chosen to love the very woman who in her own person combined perhaps the greatest possible number of different advantages in whose eyes accordingly i could not hope myself ever to cut any figure for she was as rich as the richest commoner — and noble also without reckoning that personal charm which set her at the pinnacle of fashion made her among the rest a sort of queen

   i felt that i was annoying her by crossing her path in this way every morning but even if i had had the courage to refrain for two or three days consecutively from doing so perhaps that abstention which would have represented so great a sacrifice on my part mme de guermantes would not have noticed or would have set it down to some obstacle beyond my control and indeed i could not have succeeded in making myself cease to track her down except by arranging that it should be impossible for me to do so for the need incessantly reviving in me to meet her to be for a moment the object of her attention the person to whom her bow was addressed was stronger than my fear of arousing her displeasure i should have had to go away for some time and for that i had not the heart i did think of it more than once i would then tell françoise to pack my boxes and immediately afterwards to unpack them and as the spirit of imitation the desire not to appear behind the times alters the most natural and most positive form of oneself françoise borrowing the expression from her daughter’s vocabulary used to remark that i was ‘dippy’ she did not approve of this she said that i was always ‘balancing’ for she made use when she was not aspiring to rival the moderns of the language of saintsimon it is true that she liked it still less when i spoke to her as master to servant she knew that this was not natural to me and did not suit me a condition which she rendered in words as ‘where there isn’t a will’ i should never have had the heart to leave paris except in a direction that would bring me closer to mme de guermantes this was by no means an impossibility should i not indeed find myself nearer to her than i was in the morning in the street solitary abashed feeling that not a single one of the thoughts which i should have liked to convey to her ever reached her in that weary patrolling up and down of walks which might be continued day after day for ever without the slightest advantage to myself if i were to go miles away from mme de guermantes but go to some one of her acquaintance some one whom she knew to be particular in the choice of his friends and who would appreciate my good qualities would be able to speak to her about me and if not to obtain it from her at least to make her know what i wanted some one by means of whom in any event simply because i should discuss with him whether or not it would be possible for him to convey this or that message to her i should give to my solitary and silent meditations a new form spoken active which would seem an advance almost a realisation what she did during the mysterious daily life of the ‘guermantes’ that she was — this was the constant object of my thoughts and to break through the mystery even by indirect means as with a lever by employing the services of a person to whom were not forbidden the town house of the duchess her parties unrestricted conversation with her would not that be a contact more distant but at the same time more effective than my contemplation of her every morning in the street

   the friendship the admiration that saintloup felt for me seemed to me undeserved and had hitherto left me unmoved all at once i attached a value to them i would have liked him to disclose them to mme de guermantes i was quite prepared even to ask him to do so for when we are in love all the trifling little privileges that we enjoy we would like to be able to divulge to the woman we love as people who have been disinherited and bores of other kinds do to us in everyday life we are distressed by her ignorance of them we seek consolation in the thought that just because they are never visible she has perhaps added to the opinion which she already had of us this possibility of further advantages that must remain unknown

   saintloup had not for a long time been able to come to paris whether as he himself explained on account of his military duties or as was more likely on account of the trouble that he was having with his mistress with whom he had twice now been on the point of breaking off relations he had often told me what a pleasure it would be to him if i came to visit him at that garrison town the name of which a couple of days after his leaving balbec had caused me so much joy when i had read it on the envelope of the first letter i received from my friend it was not so far from balbec as its wholly inland surroundings might have led one to think one of those little fortified towns aristocratic and military set in a broad expanse of country over which on fine days there floats so often into the distance a sort of intermittent haze of sound which — as a screen of poplars by its sinuosities outlines the course of a river which one cannot see — indicates the movements of a regiment on parade so that the very atmosphere of its streets avenues and squares has been gradually tuned to a sort of perpetual vibration musical and martial while the most ordinary note of cartwheel or tramway is prolonged in vague trumpet calls indefinitely repeated to the hallucinated ear by the silence it was not too far away from paris for me to be able if i took the express to return join my mother and grandmother and sleep in my own bed as soon as i realised this troubled by a painful longing i had too little will power to decide not to return to paris but rather to stay in this town but also too little to prevent a porter from carrying my luggage to a cab and not to adopt as i walked behind him the unburdened mind of a traveller who is looking after his luggage and for whom no grandmother is waiting anywhere at home to get into the carriage with the complete detachment of a person who having ceased to think of what it is that he wants has the air of knowing what he wants and to give the driver the address of the cavalry barracks i thought that saintloup might come to sleep that night at the hotel at which i should be staying so as to make less painful for me the first shock of contact with this strange town one of the guard went to find him and i waited at the barrack gate before that huge ship of stone booming with the november wind out of which every moment for it was now six o’clock men were emerging in pairs into the street staggering as if they were coming ashore in some foreign port in which they found themselves temporarily anchored

   saintloup appeared moving like a whirlwind his eyeglass spinning in the air before him i had not given my name i was eager to enjoy his surprise and delight “oh what a bore” he exclaimed suddenly catching sight of me and blushing to the tips of his ears “i have just had a week’s leave and i shan’t be off duty again for another week”

   and preoccupied by the thought of my having to spend this first night alone for he knew better than anyone my bedtime agonies which he had often remarked and soothed at balbec he broke off his lamentation to turn and look at me coax me with little smiles with tender though unsymmetrical glances half of them coming directly from his eye the other half through his eyeglass but both sorts alike an allusion to the emotion that he felt on seeing me again an allusion also to that important matter which i did not always understand but which concerned me now vitally our friendship

    “i say where are you going to sleep really i can’t recommend the hotel where we mess it is next to the exhibition ground where there’s a show just starting you’ll find it beastly crowded no you’d better go to the hôtel de flandre it is a little eighteenthcentury palace with old tapestries it ‘makes’ quite an ‘oldworld residence’”

   saintloup employed in every connexion the word ‘makes’ for ‘has the air of’ because the spoken language like the written feels from time to time the need of these alterations in the meanings of words these refinements of expression and just as journalists often have not the least idea from what school of literature come the ‘turns of speech’ that they borrow so the vocabulary the very diction of saintloup were formed in imitation of three different aesthetes none of whom he knew personally but whose way of speaking had been indirectly instilled into him “besides” he concluded “the hotel i mean is more or less adapted to your supersensitiveness of hearing you will have no neighbours i quite see that it is a slender advantage and as after all another visitor may arrive tomorrow it would not be worth your while to choose that particular hotel with so precarious an object in view no it is for its appeal to the eye that i recommend it the rooms are quite attractive all the furniture is old and comfortable there is something reassuring about that” but to me less of an artist than saintloup the pleasure that an attractive house could give was superficial almost nonexistent and could not calm my growing anguish as painful as that which i used to feel long ago at combray when my mother did not come upstairs to say good night or that which i felt on the evening of my arrival at balbec in the room with the unnaturally high ceiling which smelt of flowering grasses saintloup read all this in my fixed gaze

    “a lot you care though about this charming palace my poor fellow you’re quite pale and here am i like a great brute talking to you about tapestries which you won’t have the heart to look at even i know the room they’ll put you in personally i find it most enlivening but i can quite understand that it won’t have the same effect on you with your sensitive nature you mustn’t think i don’t understand i don’t feel the same myself but i can put myself in your place”

   at that moment a serjeant who was exercising a horse on the square entirely absorbed in making the animal jump disregarding the salutes of passing troopers but hurling volleys of oaths at such as got in his way turned with a smile to saintloup and seeing that he had a friend with him saluted us but his horse at once reared saintloup flung himself at its head caught it by the bridle succeeded in quieting it and returned to my side

    “yes” he resumed “i assure you that i fully understand i feel for you as keenly as you do yourself i am wretched” he went on laying his hand lovingly on my shoulder “when i think that if i could have stayed with you tonight i might have been able if we talked till morning to relieve you of a little of your unhappiness i can lend you any number of books but you won’t want to read if you’re feeling like that and i shan’t be able to get anyone else to take my duty here i’ve been off now twice running because my girl came down to see me”

   and he knitted his brows partly with vexation and also in the effort to decide like a doctor what remedy he might best apply to my disease

    “run along and light the fire in my quarters” he called to a trooper who passed us “hurry up get a move on”

   after which he turned once more to me and his eyeglass and his peering myopic gaze hinted an allusion to our great friendship

    “no to see you here in these barracks where i have spent so much time thinking about you i can scarcely believe my eyes i must be dreaming and how are you better i hope you must tell me all about yourself presently we’ll go up to my room we mustn’t hang about too long on the square there’s the devil of a draught i don’t feel it now myself but you aren’t accustomed to it i’m afraid of your catching cold and what about your work have you started yet no you are a quaint fellow if i had your talent i’m sure i should be writing morning noon and night it amuses you more to do nothing what a pity it is that it’s the useless fellows like me who are always ready to work and the ones who could if they wanted to won’t there and i’ve clean forgotten to ask you how your grandmother is her proudhons are in safe keeping i never part from them”

   an officer tall handsome majestic emerged with slow and solemn gait from the foot of a staircase saintloup saluted him and arrested the perpetual instability of his body for the moment occupied in holding his hand against the peak of his cap but he had flung himself into the action with so much force straightening himself with so sharp a movement and the salute ended let his hand fall with so abrupt a relaxation altering all the positions of shoulder leg and eyeglass that this moment was one not so much of immobility as of a throbbing tension in which were neutralised the excessive movements which he had just made and those on which he was about to embark meanwhile the officer without coming any nearer us calm benevolent dignified imperial representing in short the direct opposite of saintloup himself also but without haste raised his hand to the peak of his cap

    “i must just say a word to the captain” whispered saintloup “be a good fellow and go and wait for me in my room it’s the second on the right on the third floor i’ll be with you in a minute”

   and setting off at the double preceded by his eyeglass which fluttered in every direction he made straight for the slow and stately captain whose horse had just been brought round and who before preparing to mount was giving orders with a studied nobility of gesture as in some historical painting and as though he were setting forth to take part in some battle of the first empire whereas he was simply going to ride home to the house which he had taken for the period of his service at doncières and which stood in a square that was named as though in an ironical anticipation of the arrival of this napoleonid place de la république i started to climb the staircase nearly slipping on each of its nailstudded steps catching glimpses of barrackrooms their bare walls edged with a double line of beds and kits i was shewn saintloup’s room i stood for a moment outside its closed door for i could hear some one stirring he moved something let fall something else i felt that the room was not empty that there must be somebody there but it was only the freshly lighted fire beginning to burn it could not keep quiet it kept shifting its faggots about and very clumsily i entered the room it let one roll into the fender and set another smoking and even when it was not moving like an illbred person it made noises all the time which from the moment i saw the flames rising revealed themselves to me as noises made by a fire although if i had been on the other side of a wall i should have thought that they came from some one who was blowing his nose and walking about i sat down in the room and waited liberty hangings and old german stuffs of the eighteenth century managed to rid it of the smell that was exhaled by the rest of the building a coarse insipid mouldy smell like that of stale toast it was here in this banning room that i could have dined and slept with a calm and happy mind saintloup seemed almost to be present by reason of the textbooks which littered his table between his photographs among which i could make out my own and that of the duchesse de guermantes by the light of the fire which had at length grown accustomed to the grate and like an animal crouching in an ardent noiseless faithful watchfulness let fall only now and then a smouldering log which crumbled into sparks or licked with a tongue of flame the sides of the chimney i heard the tick of saintloup’s watch which could not be far away this tick changed its place every moment ‘for i could not see the watch it seemed to come from behind from in front of me from my right from my left sometimes to die away as though at a great distance suddenly i caught sight of the watch on the table then i heard the tick in a fixed place from which it did not move again that is to say i thought i heard it at this place i did not hear it there i saw it there for sounds have no position in space or rather we associate them with movements and in that way they serve the purpose of warning us of those movements of appearing to make them necessary and natural certainly it happens commonly enough that a sick man whose ears have been stopped with cottonwool ceases to hear the noise of a fire such as was crackling at that moment in saintloup’s fireplace labouring at the formation of brands and cinders which it then lets fall into the fender nor would he hear the passage of the tramwaycars whose music took its flight at regular intervals over the grand’place of doncières let the sick man then read a book and the pages will turn silently before him as though they were moved by the fingers of a god the dull thunder of a bath which is being filled becomes thin faint and distant as the twittering of birds in the sky the withdrawal of sound its dilution take from it all its power to hurt us driven mad a moment ago by hammerblows which seemed to be shattering the ceiling above our head it is with a quiet delight that we now gather in their sound light caressing distant like the murmur of leaves playing by the roadside with the passing breeze we play games of patience with cards which we do not hear until we imagine that we have not touched them that they are moving of their own accord and anticipating our desire to play with them have begun to play with us and in this connexion we may ask ourselves whether in the case of love to which indeed we may add the love of life and the love of fame since there are it appears persons who are acquainted with these latter sentiments we ought not to act like those who when a noise disturbs them instead of praying that it may cease stop their ears and with them for our pattern bring our attention our defensive strength to bear on ourselves give ourselves as an objective to capture not the ‘other person’ with whom we are in love but our capacity for suffering at that person’s hands

   to return to the problem of sounds we have only to thicken the wads which close the aural passages and they confine to a pianissimo the girl who has just been playing a boisterous tune overhead if we go farther and steep the wad in grease at once the whole household must obey its despotic rule its laws extend even beyond our portals pianissimo is not enough the wad instantly orders the piano to be shut and the music lesson is abruptly ended the gentleman who was walking up and down in the room above breaks off in the middle of his beat the movement of carriages and tramways is interrupted as though a sovereign were expected to pass and indeed this attenuation of sounds sometimes disturbs our slumbers instead of guarding them only yesterday the incessant noise in our ears by describing to us in a continuous narrative all that was happening in the street and in the house succeeded at length in making us sleep like l boring book tonight through the sheet of silence that is spread over our sleep a shock louder than the rest manages to make itself heard gentle as a sigh unrelated to any other sound mysterious and the call for an explanation which it emits is sufficient to awaken us take away for a moment from the sick man the cottonwool that has been stopping his ears and in a flash the full daylight the sun of sound dawns afresh dazzling him is born again in his universe in all haste returns the multitude of exiled sounds we are present as though it were the chanting of choirs of angels at the resurrection of the voice the empty streets are filled for a moment with the whirr of the swift consecutive wings of the singing tramwaycars in the bedroom itself the sick man has created not like prometheus fire but the sound of fire and when we increase or reduce the wads of cottonwool it is as though we were pressing alternately one and the other of the two pedals with which we have extended the resonant compass of the outer world

   only there are also suppressions of sound which are not temporary the man who has grown completely deaf cannot even heat a pan of milk by his bedside but he must keep an eye open to watch on the tilted lid for the white arctic reflexion like that of a coming snowstorm which is the warning sign which he is wise to obey by cutting off as our lord bade the waves be still the electric current for already the swelling jerkily climbing egg of boiling milkfilm is reaching its climax in a series of sidelong movements has filled and set bellying the drooping sails with which the cream has skimmed its surface sends in a sudden storm a scud of pearly substance flying overboard — sails which the cutting off of the current if the electric storm is hushed in time will fold back upon themselves and let fall with the ebbing tide changed now to magnolia petals but if the sick man should not be quick enough in taking the necessary precautions presently when his drowned books and watch are seen barely emerging from the milky tide he will be obliged to call the old nurse who though he be himself an eminent statesman or a famous writer will tell him that he has no more sense than a child of five at other times in the magic chamber between us and the closed door a person who was not there a moment ago makes his appearance it is a visitor whom we did not hear coming in and who merely gesticulates like a figure in one of those little puppet theatres so restful for those who have taken a dislike to the spoken tongue and for this totally deaf man since the loss of a sense adds as much beauty to the world as its acquisition it is with ecstasy that he walks now upon an earth grown almost an eden in which sound has not yet been created the highest waterfalls unfold for his eyes alone their ribbons of crystal stiller than the glassy sea like the cascades of paradise as sound was for him before his deafness the perceptible form in which the cause of a movement was draped objects moved without sound seemed to be being moved also without cause deprived of all resonant quality they shew a spontaneous activity seem to be alive they move halt become alight of their own accord of their own accord they vanish in the air like the winged monsters of prehistoric days in the solitary and unneighboured home of the deaf man the service which before his infirmity was complete was already shewing an increased discretion was being carried on in silence is now assured him with a sort of surreptitious deftness by mutes as at the court of a fairytale king and as upon the stage the building on which the deaf man looks from his window — be it barracks church or town hall — is only so much scenery if one day it should fall to the ground it may emit a cloud of dust and leave visible ruins but less material even than a palace on the stage though it has not the same exiguity it will subside in the magic universe without letting the fall of its heavy blocks of stone tarnish with anything so vulgar as sound the chastity of the prevailing silence

   the silence though only relative which reigned in the little barrackroom where i sat waiting was now broken the door opened and saintloup dropping his eyeglass dashed in

    “ah my dear robert you make yourself very comfortable here” i said to him “how jolly it would be if one were allowed to dine and sleep here”

   and to be sure had it not been against the regulations what repose untinged by sadness i could have tasted there guarded by that atmosphere of tranquillity vigilance and gaiety which was maintained by a thousand wills controlled and free from care a thousand heedless spirits in that great community called a barracks where time having taken the form of action the sad bell that tolled the hours outside was replaced by the same joyous clarion of those martial calls the ringing memory of which was kept perpetually alive in the paved streets of the town like the dust that floats in a sunbeam — a voice sure of being heard and musical because it was the command not only of authority to obedience but of wisdom to happiness

    “so you’d rather stay with me and sleep here would you than to go the hotel by yourself” saintloup asked me smiling

    “oh robert it is cruel of you to be sarcastic about it” i pleaded “you know it’s not possible and you know how wretched i shall be over there”

    “good you flatter me” he replied “it occurred to me just now that you would rather stay here tonight and that is precisely what i stopped to ask the captain”

    “and he has given you leave” i cried

    “he hadn’t the slightest objection”

    “oh i adore him”

    “no that would be going too far but now let me just get hold of my batman and tell him to see about our dinner” he went on while i turned away so as to hide my tears

   we were several times interrupted by one or other of saintloup’s friends’ coming in he drove them all out again

    “get out of here buzz off”

   i begged him to let them stay

    “no really they would bore you stiff they are absolutely uncultured all they can talk about is racing or stables shop besides i don’t want them here either they would spoil these precious moments i’ve been looking forward to but you mustn’t think when i tell you that these fellows are brainless that everything military is devoid of intellectuality far from it we have a major here who is a splendid chap he’s given us a course in which military history is treated like a demonstration like a problem in algebra even from the aesthetic point of view there is a curious beauty alternately inductive and deductive about it which you couldn’t fail to appreciate”

    “that’s not the officer who’s given me leave to stay here tonight”

    “no thank god the man you ‘adore’ for so very trifling a service is the biggest fool that ever walked the face of the earth he is perfect at looking after messing and at kit inspections he spends hours with the serjeant major and the master tailor there you have his mentality apart from that he has a vast contempt like everyone here for the excellent major i was telling you about no one will speak to him because he’s a freemason and doesn’t go to confession the prince de borodino would never have an outsider like that in his house which is pretty fair cheek when all’s said and done from a man whose greatgrandfather was a small farmer and who would probably be a small farmer himself if it hadn’t been for the napoleonic wars not that he hasn’t a lurking sense of his own rather ambiguous position in society where he’s neither flesh nor fowl he hardly ever shews his face at the jockey it makes him feel so deuced awkward this socalled prince” added robert who having been led by the same spirit of imitation to adopt the social theories of his teachers and the worldly prejudices of his relatives had unconsciously wedded the democratic love of humanity to a contempt for the nobility of the empire

   i was looking at the photograph of his aunt and the thought that since saintloup had this photograph in his possession he might perhaps give it to me made me feel all the fonder of him and hope to do him a thousand services which seemed to me a very small exchange for it for this photograph was like one encounter more added to all those that i had already had with mme de guermantes better still a prolonged encounter as if by some sudden stride forward in our relations she had stopped beside me in a garden hat and had allowed me for the first time to gaze at my leisure at that plump cheek that arched neck that tapering eyebrow veiled from me hitherto by the swiftness of her passage the bewilderment of my impressions the imperfection of memory and the contemplation of them as well as of the bare bosom and arms of a woman whom i had never seen save in a highnecked and longsleeved bodice was to me a voluptuous discovery a priceless favour those lines which had seemed to me almost a forbidden spectacle i could study there as in a textbook of the only geometry that had any value for me later on when i looked at robert i noticed that he too was a little like the photograph of his aunt and by a mysterious process which i found almost as moving since if his face had not been directly created by hers the two had nevertheless a common origin the features of the duchesse de guermantes which were pinned to my vision of combray the nose like a falcon’s beak the piercing eyes seemed to have served also as a pattern for the cutting out — in another copy analogous and slender with too delicate a skin — of robert’s face which might almost be superimposed upon his aunt’s i saw in him with a keen longing those features characteristic of the guermantes of that race which had remained so individual in the midst of a world with which it was not confounded in which it remained isolated in the glory of an ornithomorphic divinity for it seemed to have been the issue in the age of mythology of the union of a goddess with a bird

   robert without being aware of its cause was touched by my evident affection this was moreover increased by the sense of comfort inspired in me by the heat of the fire and by the champagne which bedewed at the same time my brow with beads of sweat and my cheeks with tears it washed down the partridges i ate mine with the dumb wonder of a profane mortal of any sort when he finds in a form of life with which he is not familiar what he has supposed that form of life to exclude — the wonder for instance of an atheist who sits down to an exquisitely cooked dinner in a presbytery and next morning when i awoke i rose and went to cast from saintloup’s window which being at a great height overlooked the whole countryside a curious scrutiny to make the acquaintance of my new neighbour the landscape which i had not been able to distinguish the day before having arrived too late at an hour when it was already sleeping beneath the outspread cloak of night and yet early as it had awoken from its sleep i could see the ground when i opened the window and looked out only as one sees it from the window of a country house overlooking the lake shrouded still in its soft white morning gown of mist which scarcely allowed me to make out anything at all but i knew that before the troopers who were busy with their horses in the square had finished grooming them it would have cast its gown aside in the meantime i could see only a meagre hill rearing close up against the side of the barracks a back already swept clear of darkness rough and wrinkled through the transparent curtain of frost i could not take my eyes from this stranger who too was looking at me for the first time but when i had formed the habit of coming to the barracks my consciousness that the hill was there more real consequently even when i did not see it than the hotel at balbec than our house in paris of which i thought as of absent — or dead — friends that is to say without any strong belief in their existence brought it about that even although i was not aware of it myself its reflected shape outlined itself on the slightest impressions that i formed at doncières and among them to begin with this first morning on the pleasing impression of warmth given me by the cup of chocolate prepared by saintloup’s batman in this comfortable room which had the effect of being an optical centre from which to look out at the hill — the idea of there being anything else to do but just gaze at it the idea of actually climbing it being rendered impossible by this same mist imbibing the shape of the hill associated with the taste of hot chocolate and with the whole web of my fancies at that particular time this mist without my having thought at all about it succeeded in moistening all my subsequent thoughts about that period just as a massive and unmelting lump of gold had remained allied to my impressions of balbec or as the proximity of the outside stairs of blackish sandstone gave a grey background to my impressions of combray it did not however persist late into the day the sun began by hurling at it in vain a few darts which sprinkled it with brilliants before they finally overcame it the hill might expose its grizzled rump to the sun’s rays which an hour later when i went down to the town gave to the russet tints of the autumn leaves to the reds and blues of the election posters pasted on the walls an exaltation which raised my spirits also and made me stamp singing as i went on the pavements from which i could hardly keep myself from jumping in the air for joy

   but after that first night i had to sleep at the hotel and i knew beforehand that i was doomed to find sorrow there it was like an unbreathable aroma which all my life long had been exhaled for me by every new bedroom that is to say by every bedroom in the one which i usually occupied i was not present my mind remained elsewhere and in its place sent only the sense of familiarity but i could not employ this servant less sensitive than myself to look after things for me in a new place where i preceded him where i arrived by myself where i must bring into contact with its environment that ‘self’ which i rediscovered only at yearlong intervals but always the same having not grown at all since combray since my first arrival at balbec weeping without any possibility of consolation on the edge of an unpacked trunk

   as it happened i was mistaken i had no time to be sad for i was not left alone for an instant the fact of the matter was that there remained of the old palace a superfluous refinement of structure and decoration out of place in a modern hotel which released from the service of any practical purpose had in its long spell of leisure acquired a sort of life passages winding about in all directions which one was continually crossing in their aimless wanderings lobbies as long as corridors and as ornate as drawingrooms which had the air rather of being dwellers there themselves than of forming part of a dwelling which could not be induced to enter and settle down in any of the rooms but wandered about outside mine and came up at once to offer me their company — neighbours of a sort idle but never noisy menial ghosts of the past who had been granted the privilege of staying provided they kept quiet by the doors of the rooms which were let to visitors and who every time that i came across them greeted me with a silent deference in short the idea of a lodging of simply a case for our existence from day to day which shields us only from the cold and from being overlooked by other people was absolutely inapplicable to this house an assembly of rooms as real as a colony of people living it was true in silence but things which one was obliged to meet to avoid to appreciate as one came in one tried not to disturb them and one could not look without respect at the great drawingroom which had formed far back in the eighteenth century the habit of stretching itself at its ease among its hangings of old gold and beneath the clouds of its painted ceiling and one was seized with a more personal curiosity as to the smaller rooms which without any regard for symmetry ran all round it innumerable startled fleeing in disorder as far as the garden to which they had so easy an access down three broken steps

   if i wished to go out or to come in without taking the lift or being seen from the main staircase a smaller private staircase no longer in use offered me its steps so skilfully arranged one close above another that there seemed to exist in their gradation a perfect proportion of the same kind as those which in colours scents savours often arouse in us a peculiar sensuous pleasure but the pleasure to be found in going up and downstairs i had had to come here to learn as once before to a health resort in the alps to find that the act — as a rule not noticed — of drawing breath could be a perpetual delight i received that dispensation from effort which is granted to us only by the things to which long use has accustomed us when i set my feet for the first time on those steps familiar before ever i knew them as if they possessed deposited on them perhaps embodied in them by the masters of long ago whom they used to welcome every day the prospective charm of habits which i had not yet contracted and which indeed could only grow weaker once they had become my own i looked into a room the double doors closed themselves behind me the hangings let in a silence in which i felt myself invested with a sort of exhilarating royalty a marble mantelpiece with ornaments of wrought brass — of which one would have been wrong to think that its sole idea was to represent the art of the directory — offered me a fire and a little easy chair on short legs helped me to warm myself as comfortably as if i had been sitting on the hearthrug the walls held the room in à close embrace separating it from the rest of the world and to let in to enclose what made it complete parted to make way for the bookcase reserved a place for the bed on either side of which a column airily upheld the raised ceiling of the alcove and the room was prolonged in depth by two closets as large as itself the latter of which had hanging from its wall to scent the occasion on which one had recourse to it a voluptuous rosary of orrisroots the doors if i left them open when i withdrew into this innermost retreat were not content with tripling its dimensions without its ceasing to be wellproportioned and not only allowed my eyes to enjoy the delights of extension after those of concentration but added further to the pleasure of my solitude which while still inviolable was no longer shut in the sense of liberty this closet looked out upon a courtyard a fair solitary stranger whom i was glad to have for a neighbour when next morning my eyes fell on her a captive between her high walls in which no other window opened with nothing but two yellowing trees which were enough to give a pinkish softness to the pure sky above

   before going to bed i decided to leave the room in order to explore the whole of my fairy kingdom i walked down a long gallery which did me homage successively with all that it had to offer me if i could not sleep an armchair placed waiting in a corner a spinet on a table against the wall a bowl of blue crockery filled with cinerarias and in an old frame the phantom of a lady of long ago whose powdered hair was starred with blue flowers holding in her hand a bunch of carnations when i came to the end the bare wall in which no door opened said to me simply “now you must turn and go back but you see you are at home here the house is yours” while the soft carpet not to be left out added that if i did not sleep that night i could easily come in barefoot and’ the unshuttered windows looking out over the oper country assured me that they would hold a sleepless vigil and that at whatever hour i chose to come in i need not be afraid of disturbing anyone and behind a hanging curtain i surprised only a little closet which stopped by the wall and unable to escape any farther had hidden itself there with a guilty conscience and gave me a frightened stare from its little round window glowing blue in the moonlight i went to bed but the presence of the eiderdown quilt of the pillars of the neat fireplace by straining my attention to a pitch beyond that of paris prevented me from letting myself go upon my habitual train of fancies and as it is this particular state of strained attention that enfolds our slumbers acts upon them modifies them brings them into line with this or that series of past impressions the images that filled my dreams that first night were borrowed from a memory entirely distinct from that on which i was in the habit of drawing if i had been tempted while asleep to let myself be swept back upon my ordinary current of remembrance the bed to which i was not accustomed the comfortable attention which i was obliged to pay to the position of my various limbs when i turned over were sufficient to correct my error to disentangle and to keep running the new thread of my dreams it is the same with sleep as with our perception of the external world it needs only a modification in our habits to make it poetic it is enough that while undressing we should have dozed off unconsciously upon the bed for the dimensions of our dreamworld to be altered and its beauty felt we awake look at our watch see ‘four o’clock’ it is only four o’clock in the morning but we imagine that the whole day has gone by so vividly does this nap of a few minutes unsought by us appear to have come down to us from the skies by virtue of some divine right fullbodied vast like an emperor’s orb of gold in the morning while worrying over the thought that my grandfather was ready and was waiting for me to start on our walk along the méséglise way i was awakened by the blare of a regimental band which passed every day beneath my windows but on several occasions — and i mention these because one cannot properly describe human life unless one shews it soaked in the sleep in which it plunges which night after night sweeps round it as a promontory is encircled by the sea — the intervening layer of sleep was strong enough to bear the shock of the music and i heard nothing on the other mornings it gave way for a moment but still velvety with the refreshment of having slept my consciousness like those organs by which after a local anaesthetic a cauterisation not perceived at first is felt only at the very end and then as a faint burning smart was touched only gently by the shrill points of the fifes which caressed it with a vague cool matutinal warbling and after this brief interruption in which the silence had turned to music it relapsed into my slumber before even the dragoons had finished passing depriving me of the latest opening buds of the sparkling clangorous nosegay and the zone of my consciousness which its springing stems had brushed was so narrow so circumscribed with sleep that later on when saintloup asked me whether i had heard the band i was no longer ertain that the sound of its brasses had not been as imaginary as that which i heard during the day echo after the slightest noise from the paved streets of the town perhaps i had heard it only in a dream prompted by my fear of being awakened or else of not being awakened and so not seeing the regiment march past for often when i was still asleep at the moment when on the contrary i had supposed that the noise would awaken me for the next hour i imagined that i was awake while still drowsing and i enacted to myself with tenuous shadowshapes on the screen of my slumber the various scenes of which it deprived me but at which i had the illusion of looking on

   what one has meant to do during the day as it turns out sleep intervening one accomplishes only in one’s dreams that is to say after it has been distorted by sleep into following another line than one would have chosen when awake the same story branches off and has a different ending when all is said the world in which we live when we are asleep is so different that people who have difficulty in going to sleep seek first of all to escape from the waking world after having desperately for hours on end with shut eyes revolved in their minds thoughts similar to those which they would have had with their eyes open they take heart again on noticing that the last minute has been crawling under the weight of an argument in formal contradiction of the laws of thought and their realisation of this and the brief ‘absence’ to which it points indicate that the door is now open through which they will perhaps be able presently to escape from the perception of the real to advance to a restingplace more or less remote on the other side which will mean their having a more or less ‘good’ night but already a great stride has been made when we turn our back on the real when we reach the cave in which ‘autosuggestions’ prepare — like witches — the hellbroth of imaginary maladies or of the recurrence of nervous disorders and watch for the hour at which the storm that has been gathering during our unconscious sleep will break with sufficient force to make sleep cease

   not far thence is the secret garden in which grow like strange flowers the kinds of sleep so different one from another the sleep induced by datura by the multiple extracts of ether the sleep of belladonna of opium of valerian flowers whose petals remain shut until the day when the predestined visitor shall come and touching them bid them open and for long hours inhale the aroma of their peculiar dreams into a marvelling and bewildered being at the end of the garden stands the convent with open windows through which we hear voices repeating the lessons learned before we went to sleep which we shall know only at the moment of awakening while a presage of that moment sounds the resonant tick of that inward alarum which our preoccupation has so effectively regulated that when our housekeeper comes in with the warning “it is seven o’clock” she will find us awake and ready on the dim walls of that chamber which opens upon our dreams within which toils without ceasing that oblivion of the sorrows of love whose task interrupted and brought to nought at times by a nightmare big with reminiscence is ever speedily resumed hang even after we are awake the memories of our dreams but so overshadowed that otten we catch sight of them for the first time only in the broad light of the afternoon when the ray of a similar idea happens by chance to strike them some of them brilliant and harmonious while we slept but already so distorted that having failed to recognise them we can but hasten to lay them in the earth like dead bodies too quickly decomposed or relics so seriously damaged so nearly crumbling into dust that the most skilful restorer could not bring them back to their true form or make anything of them near the gate is the quarry to which our heavier slumbers repair in search of substances which coat the brain with so unbreakable a glaze that to awaken the sleeper his own will is obliged even on a golden morning to smite him with mighty blows like a young siegfried beyond this again are the nightmares of which the doctors foolishly assert that they tire us more than does insomnia whereas on the contrary they enable the thinker to escape from the strain of thought those nightmares with their fantastic picturebooks in which our relatives who are dead are shewn meeting with a serious accident which at the same time does not preclude their speedy recovery until then we keep them in a little ratcage in which they are smaller than white mice and covered with big red spots out of each of which a feather sprouts engage us in ciceronian dialogues next to this picturebook is the revolving disc of awakening by virtue of which we submit for a moment to the tedium of having to return at once to a house which was pulled down fifty years ago the memory of which is gradually effaced as sleep grows more distant by a number of others until we arrive at that memory which the disc presents only when it has ceased to revolve and which coincides with what we shall see with opened eyes

   sometimes i had heard nothing being in one of those slumbers into which we fall as into a pit from which we are heartily glad to be drawn up a little later heavy overfed digesting all that has been brought to us as by the nymphs who fed the infant hercules by those agile vegetative powers whose activity is doubled while we sleep

   that kind of sleep is called ‘sleeping like lead’ and it seems as though one has become oneself and remains for a few moments after such a sleep is ended simply a leaden image one is no longer a person how then seeking for one’s mind one’s personality as one seeks for a thing that is lost does one recover one’s own self rather than any other why when one begins again to think is it not another personality than yesterday’s that is incarnate in one one fails to see what can dictate the choice or why among the millions of human beings any one of whom one might be it is on him who one was overnight that unerringly one lays one’s hand what is it that guides us when there has been an actual interruption — whether it be that our unconsciousness has been complete or our dreams entirely different from ourselves there has indeed been death as when the heart has ceased to beat and a rhythmical friction of the tongue revives us no doubt the room even if we have seen it only once before awakens memories to which other older memories cling or were some memories also asleep in us of which we now become conscious the resurrection at our awakening — after that healing attack of mental alienation which is sleep — must after all be similar to what occurs when we recapture a name a line a refrain that we had forgotten and perhaps the resurrection of the soul after death is to be conceived as a phenomenon of memory

   when i had finished sleeping tempted by the sunlit sky — but discouraged by the chill — of those last autumn mornings so luminous and so cold in which winter begins to get up and look at the trees on which the leaves were indicated now only by a few strokes golden or rosy which seemed to have been left in the air on an invisible web i raised my head from the pillow and stretched my neck keeping my body still hidden beneath the bedclothes like a chrysalis in the process of change i was a dual creature with the different parts of which a single environment did not agree for my eyes colour was sufficient without warmth my chest on the other hand was anxious for warmth and not for colour i rose only after my fire had been lighted and studied the picture so delicate and transparent of the pink and golden morning to which i had now added by artificial means the element of warmth that it lacked poking my fire which burned and smoked like a good pipe and gave me as a pipe would have given me a pleasure at once coarse because it was based upon a material comfort and delicate because beyond it was printed a pure vision the walls of my dressingroom were covered with a paper on which a violent red background was patterned with black and white flowers to which it seemed that i should have some difficulty in growing accustomed but they succeeded only in striking me as novel in forcing me to enter not into conflict but into contact with them in modulating the gaiety the songs of my morning toilet they succeeded only in imprisoning me in the heart of a sort of poppy out of which to look at a world which i saw quite differently from in paris from the gay screen which was this new dwellingplace of a different aspect from the house of my parents and into which flowed a purer air on certain days i was agitated by the desire to see my grandmother again or by the fear that she might be ill or else it was the memory of some undertaking which i had left halffinished in paris and which seemed to have made no progress sometimes again it was some difficulty in which even here i had managed to become involved one or other of these anxieties had kept me from sleeping and i was without strength to face my sorrow which in a moment grew to fill the whole of my existence then from the hotel i sent a messenger to the barracks with a line to saintloup i told him that should it be materially possible — i knew that it was extremely difficult for him — i should be most grateful if he would look in for a minute an hour later he arrived and on hearing his ring at the door i felt myself liberated from my obsessions i knew that if they were stronger than i he was stronger than they and my attention was diverted from them and concentrated on him who would have to settle them he had come into the room and already he had enveloped me in the gust of fresh air in which from before dawn he had been displaying so much activity a vital atmosphere very different from that of my room to which i at once adapted myself by appropriate reactions

    “i hope you weren’t angry with me for bothering you there is something that is worrying me as you probably guessed”

    “not at all i just supposed you wanted to see me and i thought it very nice of you i was delighted that you should have sent for me but what is the trouble things not going well what can i do to help”

   he listened to my explanations and gave careful answers but before he had uttered a word he had transformed me to his own likeness compared with the important occupations which kept him so busy so alert so happy the worries which a moment ago i had been unable to endure for another instant seemed to me as to him negligible i was like a man who not having been able to open his eyes for some days sends for a doctor who neatly and gently raises his eyelid removes from beneath it and shews him a grain of sand the sufferer is healed and comforted all my cares resolved themselves into a telegram which saintloup undertook to dispatch life seemed to me so different so delightful i was flooded with such a surfeit of strength that i longed for action

    “what are you doing now” i asked him

    “i must leave you i’m afraid we’re going on a route march in three quarters of an hour and i have to be on parade”

    “then it’s been a great bother to you coming here”

    “no no bother at all the captain was very good about it he told me that if it was for you i must go at once but you understand i don’t like to seem to be abusing the privilege”

    “but if i got up and dressed quickly and went by myself to the place where you’ll be training it would interest me immensely and i could perhaps talk to you during the breaks”

    “i shouldn’t advise you to do that you have been lying awake racking your brains over a thing which i assure you is not of the slightest importance but now that it has ceased to worry you lay your head down on the pillow and go to sleep which you will find an excellent antidote to the déminéralisation of your nervecells only you mustn’t go to sleep too soon because our bandboys will be coming along under your windows but as soon as they’ve passed i think you’ll be left in peace and we shall meet again this evening at dinner”

   but soon i was constantly going to see the regiment being trained in field operations when i began to take an interest in the military theories which saintloup’s friends used to expound over the dinnertable and when it had become the chief desire of my life to see at close quarters their various leaders just as a person who makes music his principal study and spends his life in the concert halls finds pleasure in frequenting the cafés in which one mingles with the life of the members of the orchestra to reach the training ground i used to have to take tremendously long walks in the evening after dinner the longing for sleep made my head drop every now and then as in a swoon next morning i realised that i had no more heard the band than at balbec after the evenings on which saintloup had taken me to dinner at rivebelle i used to hear the concert on the beach and at the moment when i wished to rise i had a delicious feeling of incapacity i felt myself fastened to a deep invisible ground by the articulations of which my tiredness made me conscious of muscular and nutritious roots i felt myself full of strength life seemed to extend more amply before me this was because i had reverted to the good tiredness of my childhood at combray on the mornings following days on which we had taken the guermantes walk poets make out that we recapture for a moment the self that we were long ago when we enter some house or garden in which we used to live in our youth but these are most hazardous pilgrimages which end as often in disappointment as in success the fixed places contemporary with different years it is in ourselves that we should rather seek to find them this is where the advantage comes in to a certain extent of great exhaustion followed by a good night’s rest good nights to make us descend into the most subterranean galleries of sleep where no reflexion from overnight no gleam of memory comes to lighten the inward monologue if so be that it cease not also turn so effectively the soil and break through the surface stone of our body that we discover there where our muscles dive down and throw out their twisted roots and breathe the air of the new life the garden in which as a child we used to play there is no need to travel in order to see it again we must dig down inwardly to discover it what once covered the earth is no longer upon it but beneath a mere excursion does not suffice for a visit to the dead city excavation is necessary also but we shall see how certain impressions fugitive and fortuitous carry us back even more effectively to the past with a more delicate precision with a flight more lightwinged more immaterial more headlong more unerring more immortal than these organic dislocations

   sometimes my exhaustion was greater still i had without any opportunity of going to bed been following the operations for several days on end how blessed then was my return to the hotel as i got into bed i seemed to have escaped at last from the hands of enchanters sorcerers like those who people the ‘romances’ beloved of our forebears in the seventeenth century my sleep that night and the lazy morning that followed it were no more than a charming fairy tale charming beneficent perhaps also i reminded myself that the keenest sufferings have their place of sanctuary that one can always when all else fails find repose these thoughts carried me far

   on days when although there was no parade saintloup had to stay in barracks i used often to go and visit him there it was a long way i had to leave the town and cross the viaduct from either side of which i had an immense view a strong breeze blew almost always over this high ground and filled all the buildings erected on three sides of the barracksquare which howled incessantly like a cave of the winds while i waited for robert — he being engaged on some duty or other — outside the door of his room or in the mess talking to some of his friends to whom he had introduced me and whom later on i came now and then to see even when he was not to be there looking down from the window three hundred feet to the country below bare now except where recently sown fields often still soaked with rain and glittering in the sun shewed a few stripes of green of the brilliance and translucent limpidity of enamel i could hear him discussed by the others and i soon learned what a popular favourite he was among many of the volunteers belonging to other squadrons sons of rich business or professional men who looked at the higher aristocratic society only from outside and without penetrating its enclosure the attraction which they naturally felt towards what they knew of saintloup’s character was reinforced by the distinction that attached in their eyes to the young man whom on saturday evenings when they went on pass to paris they had seen supping in the café de la paix with the duc d’uzès and the prince d’orléans and on that account into his handsome face his casual way of walking and saluting officers the perpetual dance of his eyeglass the affectation shewn in the cut of his service dress — the caps always too high the breeches of too fine a cloth and too pink a shade — they had introduced the idea of a ‘tone’ which they were positive was lacking in the best turnedout officers in the regiment even the majestic captain to whom i had been indebted for the privilege of sleeping in barracks who seemed in comparison too pompous and almost common

   one of them said that the captain had bought a new horse “he can buy as many horses as he likes i passed saintloup on sunday morning in the allée des acacias now he’s got some style on a horse” replied his companion and knew what he was talking about for these young fellows belonged to a class which if it does not frequent the same houses and know the same people yet thanks to money and leisure does not differ from the nobility in its experience of all those refinements of life which money can procure at any rate their refinement had in the matter of clothes for instance something about it more studied more impeccable than that free and easy negligence which had so delighted my grandmother in saintloup it gave quite a thrill to these sons of big stockbrokers or bankers as they sat eating oysters after the theatre to see at an adjoining table serjeant saintloup and what a tale there was to tell in barracks on monday night after a weekend leave by one of them who was in robert’s squadron and to whom he had said how d’ye do ‘most civilly’ while another who was not in the same squadron was quite positive that in spite of this saintloup had recognised him for two or three times he had put up his eyeglass and stared in the speaker’s direction

    “yes my brother saw him at the paix” said another who had been spending the day with his mistress “my brother says his dress coat was cut too loose and didn’t fit him”

    “what was the waistcoat like”

    “he wasn’t wearing a white waistcoat it was purple with sort of palms on it stunning”

   to the ‘old soldiers’ sons of the soil who had never heard of the jockey club and simply put saintloup in the category of ultrarich noncommissioned officers in which they included all those who whether bankrupt or not lived in a certain style whose income or debts ran into several figures and who were generous towards their men the gait the eyeglass the breeches the caps of saintloup even if they saw in them nothing particularly aristocratic furnished nevertheless just as much interest and meaning they recognised in these peculiarities the character the style which they had assigned once and for all time to this most popular of the ‘stripes’ in the regiment manners like no one’s else scornful indifference to what his superior officers might think which seemed to them the natural corollary of his goodness to his subordinates the morning cup of coffee in the canteen the afternoon ‘laydown’ in the barrackroom seemed pleasanter somehow when some old soldier fed the hungering lazy section with some savoury titbit as to a cap in which saintloup had appeared on parade

    “it was the height of my pack”

    “come off it old chap you don’t expect us to believe that it couldn’t have been the height of your pack” interrupted a young college graduate who hoped by using these slang terms not to appear a ‘learned beggar’ and by venturing on this contradiction to obtain confirmation of a fact the thought of which enchanted him

    “oh so it wasn’t the height of my pack wasn’t it you measured it i suppose i tell you this much the c o glared at it as if he’d have liked to put him in clink but you needn’t think the great saintloup felt squashed no he went and he came and down with his head and up with his head and that blinking glass screwed in his eye all the time we’ll see what the ‘capstan’ has to say when he hears oh very likely he’ll say nothing but you may be sure he won’t be pleased but there’s nothing so wonderful about that cap i hear he’s got thirty of ’em and more at home at his house in town”

    “where did you hear that old man from our blasted corporaldog” asked the young graduate pedantically displaying the new forms of speech which he had only recently acquired and with which he took a pride in garnishing his conversation

    “where did i hear it from his batman what d’you think”

    “ah now you’re talking that’s a chap who knows when he’s well off”

    “i should say so he’s got more in his pocket than i have certain sure and besides he gives him all his own things and everything he wasn’t getting his grub properly he says along comes de saintloup and gives cooky hell ‘i want him to be properly fed d’you hear’ he says ‘and i don’t care what it costs’”

   the old soldier made up for the triviality of the words quoted by the emphasis of his tone in a feeble imitation of the speaker which had an immense success

   on leaving the barracks i would take a stroll and then to fill up the time before i went as i did every evening to dine with saintloup at the hotel in which he and his friends had established their mess i made for my own as soon as the sun had set so as to have a couple of hours in which to rest and read in the square the evening light bedecked the pepperpot turrets of the castle with little pink clouds which matched the colour of the bricks and completed the harmony by softening the tone of the latter where it bathed them so strong a current of vitality coursed through my nerves that no amount of movement on my part could exhaust it each step i took after touching a stone of the pavement rebounded off it i seemed to have growing on my heels the wings of mercury one of the fountains was filled with a ruddy glow while in the other the moonlight had already begun to turn the water opalescent between them were children at play uttering shrill cries wheeling in circles obeying some necessity of the hour like swifts or bats next door to the hotel the old national courts and the louis xvi orangery in which were installed now the savingsbank and the army corps headquarters were lighted from within by the palely gilded globes of their gasjets which seen in the still clear daylight outside suited those vast tall eighteenthcentury windows from which the last rays of the setting sun had not yet departed as would have suited a complexion heightened with rouge a headdress of yellow tortoiseshell and persuaded me to seek out my fireside and the lamp which alone in the shadowy front of my hotel was striving to resist the gathering darkness and for the sake of which i went indoors before it was quite dark for pleasure as to an appetising meal i kept when i was in my room the same fulness of sensation that i had felt outside it gave such an apparent convexity of surface to things which as a rule seem flat and empty to the yellow flame of the fire the coarse blue paper on the ceiling on which the setting sun had scribbled corkscrews and whirligigs like a schoolboy with a piece of red chalk the curiously patterned cloth on the round table on which a ream of essay paper and an inkpot lay in readiness for me with one of bergotte’s novels that ever since then these things have continued to seem to me to be enriched with a whole form of existence which i feel that i should be able to extract from them if it were granted me to set eyes on them again i thought with joy of the barracks that i had just left and of their weathercock turning with every wind that blew like a diver breathing through a pipe which rises above the surface of the water i felt that i was in a sense maintaining contact with a healthy openair life when i kept as a baitingplace those barracks that towering observatory dominating a countryside furrowed with canals of green enamel into whose various buildings i esteemed as a priceless privilege which i hoped would last my freedom to go whenever i chose always certain of a welcome

   at seven o’clock i dressed myself and went out again to dine with saintloup at the hotel where he took his meals i liked to go there on foot it was by now pitch dark and after the third day of my visit there began to blow as soon as night had fallen an icy wind which seemed a harbinger of snow as i walked i ought not strictly speaking to have ceased for a moment to think of mme de guermantes it was only in the attempt to draw nearer to her that i had come to visit robert’s garrison but a memory a grief are fleeting things there are days when they remove so far that we are barely conscious of them we think that they have gone for ever then we pay attention to other things and the streets of this town had not yet become for me what streets are in the place where one is accustomed to live simply means of communication between one part and another the life led by the inhabitants of this unknown world must it seemed to me be a marvellous thing and often the lighted windows of some dwellinghouse kept me standing for a long while motionless in the darkness by laying before my eyes the actual and mysterious scenes of an existence into which i might not penetrate here the firespirit displayed to me in purple colouring the booth of a chestnut seller in which a couple of serjeants their belts slung over the backs of chairs were playing cards never dreaming that a magician’s wand was making them emerge from the night like a transparency on the stage and presenting them in their true lineaments at that very moment to the eyes of an arrested passerby whom they could not see in a little curiosity shop a candle burned almost to its socket projecting its warm glow over an engraving reprinted it in sanguine while battling against the darkness the light of the big lamp tanned a scrap of leather inlaid a dagger with fiery spangles on pictures which were only bad copies spread a priceless film of gold like the patina of time or the varnish used by a master made in fact of the whole hovel in which there was nothing but pinchbeck rubbish a marvellous composition by rembrandt sometimes i lifted my gaze to some huge old dwellinghouse on which the shutters had not been closed and in which amphibious men and women floated slowly to and fro in the rich liquid that after nightfall rose incessantly from the wells of the lamps to fill the rooms to the very brink of the outer walls of stone and glass the movement of their bodies sending through it long unctuous golden ripples i proceeded on my way and often in the dark alley that ran past the cathedral as long ago on the road to méséglise the force of my desire caught and held me it seemed that a woman must be on the point of appearing to satisfy it if in the darkness i felt suddenly brush past me a skirt the violence of the pleasure which i then felt made it impossible for me to believe that the contact was accidental and i attempted to seize in my arms a terrified stranger this gothic alley meant for me something so real that if i had been successful in raising and enjoying a woman there it would have been impossible for me not to believe that it was the ancient charm of the place that was bringing us together and even though she were no more than a common streetwalker stationed there every evening still the wintry night the strange place the darkness the mediaeval atmosphere would have lent her their mysterious glamour i thought of what might be in store for me to try to forget mme de guermantes seemed to me a dreadful thing but reasonable and for the first time possible easy perhaps even in the absolute quiet of this neighbourhood i could hear ahead of me shouted words and laughter which must come from tipsy revellers staggering home i waited to see them i stood peering in the direction from which i had heard the sound but i was obliged to wait for some time for the surrounding silence was so intense that it allowed to travel with the utmost clearness and strength sounds that were still a long way off finally the revellers did appear not as i had supposed in front of me but ever so far behind whether the intersection of sidestreets the interposition of buildings had by reverberation brought about this acoustic error or because it is very difficult to locate a sound when the place from which it comes is not known i had been as far wrong over direction as over distance

   the wind grew stronger it was thick and bristling with coming snow i returned to the main street and jumped on board the little tramwaycar on which from its platform an officer without apparently seeing them was acknowledging the salutes of the loutish soldiers who trudged past along the pavement their faces daubed crimson by the cold reminding me in this little town which the sudden leap from autumn into early winter seemed to have transported farther north of the rubicund faces which breughel gives to his merry junketing frostbound peasants

   and sure enough at the hotel where i was to meet saintloup and his friends and to which the fair now beginning had attracted a number of people from near and far i found as i hurried across the courtyard with its glimpses of glowing kitchens in which chickens were turning on spits pigs were roasting lobsters being flung alive into what the landlord called the ‘everlasting fire’ an influx worthy of some numbering of the people before bethlehem such as the old flemish masters used to paint of new arrivals who assembled there in groups asking the landlord or one of his staff who if he did not like the look of them would recommend lodgings elsewhere in the town whether they could have dinner and beds while a scullion hurried past holding a struggling fowl by the neck and similarly in the big diningroom which i crossed the first day before coming to the smaller room in which my friend was waiting for me it was of some feast in the gospels portrayed with a mediaeval simplicity and an exaggeration typically flemish that one was reminded by the quantity of fish pullets grouse woodcock pigeons brought in dressed and garnished and piping hot by breathless waiters who slid over the polished floor to gain speed and set them down on the huge carving table where they were at once cut up but where — for most of the people had nearly finished dinner when i arrived — they accumulated untouched as though their profusion and the haste of those who brought them in were due not so much to the requirements of the diners as to respect for the sacred text scrupulously followed in the letter but quaintly illustrated by real details borrowed from local custom and to an aesthetic and religious scruple for making evident to the eye the solemnity of the feast by the profusion of the victuals and the assiduity of the servers one of these stood lost in thought at the far end of the room by a sideboard and to find out from him who alone appeared calm enough to be capable of answering me in which room our table had been laid making my way forward among the chafingdishes that had been lighted here and there to keep the late comers’ plates from growing cold which did not however prevent the dessert in the centre of the room from being piled on the outstretched hands of a huge mannikin sometimes supported on the wings of a duck apparently of crystal but really of ice carved afresh every day with a hot iron by a sculptorcook quite in the flemish manner i went straight — at the risk of being knocked down by his colleagues — towards this servitor in whom i felt that i recognised a character who is traditionally present in all these sacred subjects for he reproduced with scrupulous accuracy the blunt features fatuous and illdrawn the musing expression already half aware of the miracle of a divine presence which the others have not yet begun to suspect i should add that in view probably of the coming fair this presentation was strengthened by a celestial contingent recruited in mass of cherubim and seraphim a young angel musician whose fair hair enclosed a fourteenyearold face was not it was true playing on any instrument but stood musing before a gong or a pile of plates while other less infantile angels flew swiftly across the boundless expanse of the room beating the air with the ceaseless fluttering of the napkins which fell along the lines of their bodies like the wings in ‘primitive’ paintings with pointed ends fleeing those illdefined regions screened by a hedge of palms through which the angelic servitors looked from a distance as though they had floated down out of the empyrean i explored my way to the smaller room in which saintloup’s table was laid i found there several of his friends who dined with him regularly nobles except for one or two commoners in whom the young nobles had in their school days detected likely friends and with whom they readily associated proving thereby that they were not on principle hostile to the middle class even though it were republican provided it had clean hands and went to mass on the first of these evenings before we sat down to dinner i drew saintloup into a corner and in front of all the rest but so that they should not hear me said to him

    “robert this is hardly the time or the place for what i am going to say but i shan’t be a second i keep on forgetting to ask you when i’m in the barracks isn’t that mme de guermantes’s photograph that you have on your table”

    “why yes my good aunt”

    “of course she is what a fool i am you told me before that she was i’d forgotten all about her being your aunt i say your friends will be getting impatient we must be quick they’re looking at us another time will do it isn’t at all important”

    “that’s all right go on as long as you like they can wait”

    “no no i do want to be polite to them they’re so nice besides it doesn’t really matter in the least i assure you”

    “do you know that worthy oriane then”

   this ‘worthy oriane’ as he might have said ‘that good oriane’ did not imply that saintloup regarded mme de guermantes as especially good in this instance the words ‘good’ ‘excellent’ ‘worthy’ are mere reinforcements of the demonstrative ‘that’ indicating a person who is known to both parties and of whom the speaker does not quite know what to say to someone outside the intimate circle the word ‘good’ does duty as a stopgap and keeps the conversation going for a moment until the speaker has hit upon “do you see much of her” or “i haven’t set eyes on her for months” or “i shall be seeing her on tuesday” or “she must be getting on now you know”

    “i can’t tell you how funny it is that it should be her photograph because we’re living in her house now in paris and i’ve been hearing the most astounding things” i should have been hard put to it to say what “about her which have made me immensely interested in her only from a literary point of view don’t you know from a — how shall i put it — from a balzacian point of view but you’re so clever you can see what i mean i don’t need to explain things to you but we must hurry up what on earth will your friends think of my manners”

    “they will think absolutely nothing i have told them that you are sublime and they are a great deal more alarmed than you are”

    “you are too kind but listen what i want to say is this i suppose mme de guermantes hasn’t any idea that i know you has she”

    “i can’t say i haven’t seen her since the summer because i haven’t had any leave since she’s been in town”

    “what i was going to say is this i’ve been told that she looks on me as an absolute idiot”

    “that i do not believe oriane is not exactly an eagle but all the same she’s by no means stupid”

    “you know that as a rule i don’t care about your advertising the good opinion you’re kind enough to hold of me i’m not conceited that’s why i’m sorry you should have said flattering things about me to your friends here we will go back to them in two seconds but mme de guermantes is different if you could let her know — if you would even exaggerate a trifle — what you think of me you would give me great pleasure”

    “why of course i will if that’s all you want me to do it’s not very difficult but what difference can it possibly make to you what she thinks of you i suppose you think her no end of a joke really anyhow if that’s all you want we can discuss it in front of the others or when we are by ourselves i’m afraid of your tiring yourself if you stand talking and it’s so inconvenient too when we have heaps of opportunities of being alone together”

   it was precisely this inconvenience that had given me courage to approach robert the presence of the others was for me a pretext that justified my giving my remarks a curt and incoherent form under cover of which i could more easily dissemble the falsehood of my saying to my friend that i had forgotten his connexion with the duchess and also did not give him time to frame — with regard to my reasons for wishing that mme de guermantes should know that i was his friend was clever and so forth — questions which would have been all the more disturbing in that i should not have been able to answer them

    “robert i’m surprised that a man of your intelligence should fail to understand that one doesn’t discuss the things that will give one’s friends pleasure one does them now i if you were to ask me no matter what and indeed i only wish you would ask me to do something for you i can assure you i shouldn’t want any explanations i may ask you for more than i really want i have no desire to know mme de guermantes but just to test you i ought to have said that i was anxious to dine with mme de guermantes i am sure you would never have done it”

    “not only should i have done it i will do it”

    “when”

    “next time i’m in paris three weeks from now i expect”

    “we shall see i dare say she won’t want to see me though i can’t tell you how grateful i am”

    “not at all it’s nothing”

    “don’t say that it’s everything in the world because now i can see what sort of friend you are whether what i ask you to do is important or not disagreeable or not whether i am really keen about it or ask you only as a test it makes no difference you say you will do it and there you shew the fmeness of your mind and heart a stupid friend would have started a discussion”

   which was exactly what he had just been doing but perhaps i wanted to flatter his selfesteem perhaps also i was sincere the sole touchstone of merit seeming to me to be the extent to which a friend could be useful in respect of the one thing that seemed to me to have any importance namely my love then i went on perhaps from cunning possibly from a genuine increase of affection inspired by gratitude expectancy and the copy of mme de guermantes’s very features which nature had made in producing her nephew robert “but i say we mustn’t keep them waiting any longer and i’ve mentioned only one of the two things i wanted to ask you the less important the other is more important to me but i’m afraid you will never consent would it bore you if we were to call each other tu”

    “bore me my dear fellow joy tears of joy undreamedof happiness”

    “thank you — tu i mean you begin first — ever so much it is such a pleasure to me that you needn’t do anything about mme de guermantes if you’d rather not this is quite enough for me”

    “i can do both”

    “i say robert listen to me a minute” i said to him later while we were at dinner “oh it’s really too absurd the way our conversation is always being interrupted i can’t think why — you remember the lady i was speaking to you about just now”

    “yes”

    “you’re quite sure you know who’ i mean”

    “why what do you take me for a village idiot”

    “you wouldn’t care to give me her photograph i suppose”

   had meant to ask him only for the loan of it but when the time came to speak i felt shy i decided that the request was indiscreet and in order to hide my confusion i put the question more bluntly and increased my demand as if it had been quite natural

    “no i should have to ask her permission first” was his answer

   he blushed as he spoke i could see that he had a reservation in his mind that he credited me also with one that he would give only a partial service to my love under the restraint of certain moral principles and for this i hated him

   at the same time i was touched to see how differently saintloup behaved towards me now that i was no longer alone with him and that his friends formed an audience his increased affability would have left me cold had i thought that it was deliberately assumed but i could feel that it was spontaneous and consisted only of all that he had to say about me in my absence and refrained as a rule from saying when we were together by ourselves in our private conversations i might certainly suspect the pleasure that he found in talking to me but that pleasure he almost always left unexpressed now at the same remarks from me which as a rule he enjoyed without shewing it he watched from the corner of his eye to see whether they produced on his friends the effect on which he had counted an effect corresponding to what he had promised them beforehand the mother of a girl in her first season could be no more unrelaxing in her attention to her daughter’s responses and to the attitude of the public if i had made some remark at which alone in my company he would merely have smiled he was afraid that the others might not have seen the point and put in a “what’s that” to make me repeat what i had said to attract attention and turning at once to his friends and making himself automatically by facing them with a hearty laugh the fugleman of their laughter presented me for the first time with the opinion that he actually held of me and must often have expressed to them so that i caught sight of myself suddenly from without like a person who reads his name in a newspaper or sees himself in a mirror

   it occurred to me one of these evenings to tell a mildly amusing story about mme blandais but i stopped at once remembering that saintloup knew it already and that when i had tried to tell him it on the day following my arrival he had interrupted me with “you told me that before at balbec” i was surprised therefore to find him begging me to go on and assuring me that he did not know the story and that it would amuse him immensely “you’ve forgotten it for the moment” i said to him “but you’ll remember as i go on” “no really i swear you’re mistaken you’ve never told me do go on” and throughout the story he fixed a feverish and enraptured gaze alternately on myself and on his friends i realised only after i had finished amid general laughter that it had struck him that this story would give his friends a good idea of my wit and that it was for this reason that he had pretended not to know it such is the stuff of friendship

   on the third evening one of his friends to whom i had not had an opportunity before of speaking conversed with me at great length and i overheard him telling saintloup how much he had been enjoying himself and indeed we sat talking together almost all evening leaving our glasses of sauterne untouched on the table before us isolated sheltered from the others by the sumptuous curtains of one of those intuitive sympathies between man and man which when they are not based upon any physical attraction are the only kind that is altogether mysterious of such an enigmatic nature had seemed to me at balbec that feeling which saintloup had for me which was not to be confused with the interest of our conversations a feeling free from any material association invisible intangible and yet a thing of the presence of which in himself like a sort of inflammatory gas he had been so far conscious as to refer to it with a smile and yet there was perhaps something more surprising still in this sympathy born here in a single evening like a flower that had budded and opened in a few minutes in the warmth of this little room i could not help asking robert when he spoke to me about balbec whether it were really settled that he was to marry mlle d’ambresac he assured me that not only was it not settled but there had never been any thought of such a match he had never seen her he did not know who she was if at that moment i had happened to see any of the social gossipers who had told me of this coming event they would promptly have announced the betrothal of mlle d’ambresac to some one who was not saintloup and that of saintloup to some one who was not mlle d’ambresac i should have surprised them greatly had i reminded them of their incompatible and still so recent predictions in order that this little game may continue and multiply false reports by attaching the greatest possible number to every name in turn nature has furnished those who play it with a memory as short as their credulity is long

   saintloup had spoken to me of another of his friends who was present also one with whom he was on particularly good terms just then since they were the only two advocates in their mess of the retrial of dreyfus

   just as a brother of this friend of saintloup who had been trained at the schola cantorum thought about every new musical work not at all what his father his mother his cousins his club friends thought but exactly what the other students thought at the schola so this noncommissioned nobleman of whom bloch formed an extraordinary opinion when i told him about him because touched to hear that he belonged to the same party as himself he nevertheless imagined him on account of his aristocratic birth and religious and military upbringing to be as different as possible endowed with the same romantic attraction as a native of a distant country had a ‘mentality’ as people were now beginning to say analogous to that of the whole body of dreyfusards in general and of bloch in particular on which the traditions of his family and the interests of his career could retain no hold whatever similarly one of saintloup’s cousins had married a young eastern princess who was said to write poetry quite as fine as victor hugo’s or alfred de vigny’s and in spite of this was supposed to have a different type of mind from what one would naturally expect the mind of an eastern princess immured in an arabian nights palace for the writers who had the privilege of meeting her was reserved the disappointment or rather the joy of listening to conversation which gave the impression not of scheherazade but of a person of genius of the type of alfred de vigny or victor hugo

    “that fellow oh he’s not like saintloup he’s a regular devil” my new friend informed me “he’s not even straight about it at first he used to say ‘just wait a little there’s a man i know well a clever kindhearted fellow general de boisdeffre you need have no hesitation in accepting his decision’ but as soon as he heard that boisdeffre had pronounced dreyfus guilty boisdeffre ceased to count clericalism staff prejudices prevented his forming a candid opinion although there is no one in the world or was rather before this dreyfus business half so clerical as our friend next he told us that now we were sure to get the truth the case had been put in the hands of saussier and he a soldier of the republic our friend coming of an ultramonarchist family if you please was a man of bronze a stern unyielding conscience but when saussier pronounced esterhazy innocent he found fresh reasons to account for the decision reasons damaging not to dreyfus but to general saussier it was the militarist spirit that blinded saussier and i must explain to you that our friend is just as much militarist as clerical or at least he was i don’t know what to think of him now his family are all brokenhearted at seeing him possessed by such ideas”

    “don’t you think” i suggested turning half towards saintloup so as not to appear to be cutting myself off from him as well as towards his friend and so that we might all three join in the conversation “that the influence we ascribe to environment is particularly true of intellectual environment one is the man of one’s idea there are far fewer ideas than men therefore all men with similar ideas are alike as there is nothing material in an idea so the people who are only materially neighbours of the man with an idea can do nothing to alter it”

   at this point i was interrupted by saintloup because another of the young men had leaned across to him with a smile and pointing to me exclaimed “duroc duroc all over” i had no idea what this might mean but i felt the expression on the shy young face to be more than friendly while i was speaking the approbation of the party seemed to saintloup superfluous he insisted on silence and just as a conductor stops his orchestra with a rap from his baton because some one in the audience has made a noise so he rebuked the author of this disturbance “gibergue you must keep your mouth shut when people are speaking you can tell us about it afterwards” and to me “please go on”

   i gave a sigh of relief for i had been afraid that he was going to make me begin all over again

    “and as an idea” i went on “is a thing that cannot participate in human interests and would be incapable of deriving any benefit from them the men who are governed by an idea are not influenced by material considerations”

   when i had finished “that’s one in the eye for you my boys” exclaimed saintloup who had been following me with his gaze with the same anxious solicitude as if i had been walking upon a tightrope “what were you going to say gibergue”

    “i was just saying that your friend reminded me of major duroc i seemed to hear him speaking”

    “why i’ve often thought so myself” replied saintloup “they have several points in common but you’ll find there are a thousand things in this fellow that duroc hasn’t got”

   saintloup was not satisfied with this comparison in an ecstasy of joy into which there no doubt entered the joy that he felt in making me shine before his friends with extreme volubility stroking me as though he were rubbing down a horse that had just come first past the post he reiterated “you’re the cleverest man i know do you hear” he corrected himself and added “you and elstir — you don’t mind my bracketing him with you i hope you understand — punctiliousness it’s like this i say it to you as one might have said to balzac ‘you are the greatest novelist of the century — you and stendhal’ excessive punctiliousness don’t you know and at heart an immense admiration no you don’t admit stendhal” he went on with an ingenuous confidence in my judgment which found expression in a charming smiling almost childish glance of interrogation from his green eyes “oh good i see you’re on my side bloch can’t stand stendhal i think it’s idiotic of him the chartreuse is after all an immense work don’t you think i am so glad you agree with me what is it you like best in thechartreuse answer me” he appealed to me with a boyish impetuosity and the menace of his physical strength made the question almost terrifying “mosca fabrice” i answered timidly that mosca reminded me a little of m de norpois whereupon peals of laughter from the young siegfried saintloup and while i was going on to explain “but mosca is far more intelligent not so pedantic” i heard robert cry “bravo” actually clapping his hands and helpless with laughter gasp “oh perfect admirable you really are astounding”

   i took a particular pleasure in talking to this young man as for that matter to all robert’s friends and to robert himself about their barracks the officers of the garrison and the army in general thanks to the immensely enlarged scale on which we see the things however petty they may be in the midst of which we eat and talk and lead our real life thanks to that formidable enlargement which they undergo and the effect of which is that the rest of the world not being present cannot compete with them and assumes in comparison the unsubstantiality of a dream i had begun to take an interest in the various personalities of the barracks in the officers whom i saw in the square when i went to visit saintloup or if i was awake then when the regiment passed beneath my windows i should have liked to know more about the major whom saintloup so greatly admired and about the course of military history which would have appealed to me “even from an aesthetic point of view” i knew that with robert the spoken word was only too often a trifle hollow but at other times implied the assimilation of valuable ideas which he was fully capable of grasping unfortunately from the military point of view robert was exclusively preoccupied at this time with the case of dreyfus he spoke little about it since he alone of the party at table was a dreyfusard the others were violently opposed to the idea of a fresh trial except my other neighbour my new friend and his opinions appeared to be somewhat vague a firm admirer of the colonel who was regarded as an exceptionally competent officer and had denounced the current agitation against the army in several of his regimental orders which won him the reputation of being an antidreyfusard my neighbour had heard that his commanding officer had let fall certain remarks which had led to the supposition that he had his doubts as to the guilt of dreyfus and retained his admiration for picquart in the latter respect at any rate the rumour of dreyfusism as applied to the colonel was as illfounded as are all the rumours springing from none knows where which float around any great scandal for shortly afterwards this colonel having been detailed to interrogate the former chief of the intelligence branch had treated him with a brutality and contempt the like of which had never been known before however this might be and naturally he had not taken the liberty of going direct to the colonel for his information my neighbour had paid saintloup the compliment of telling him — in the tone in which a catholic lady might tell a jewish lady that her parish priest denounced the pogroms in russia and might openly admire the generosity of certain israelites — that their colonel was not with regard to dreyfusism — to a certain kind of dreyfusism at least — the fanatical narrow opponent that he had been made out to be

    “i am not surprised” was saintloup’s comment “for he’s a sensible man but in spite of that he is blinded by the prejudices of his caste and above all by his clericalism now” he turned to me “major duroc the lecturer on military history i was telling you about there’s a man who is wholeheartedly in support of our views or so i’m told and i should have been surprised to hear that he wasn’t for he’s not only a brilliantly clever man but a radicalsocialist and a freemason”

   partly out of courtesy to his friends whom these expressions of saintloup’s faith in dreyfus made uncomfortable and also because the subject was of more interest to myself i asked my neighbour if it were true that this major gave a demonstration of military history which had a genuine aesthetic beauty “it is absolutely true”

    “but what do you mean by that”

    “well all that you read let us say in the narrative of a military historian the smallest facts the most trivial happenings are only the outward signs of an idea which has to be analysed and which often brings to light other ideas like a palimpsest so that you have a field for study as intellectual as any science you care to name or any art and one that is satisfying to the mind”

    “give me an example or two if you don’t mind”

    “it is not very easy to explain” saintloup broke in “you read let us say that this or that corps has tried    but before we go any further the serial number of the corps its order of battle are not without their significance if it is not the first time that the operation has been attempted and if for the same operation we find a different corps being brought up it is perhaps a sign that the previous corps have been wiped out or have suffered heavy casualties in the said operation that they are no longer in a fit state to carry it through successfully next we must ask ourselves what was this corps which is now out of action if it was composed of shock troops held in reserve for big attacks a fresh corps of inferior quality will have little chance of succeeding where the first has failed furthermore if we are not at the start of a campaign this fresh corps may itself be a composite formation of odds and ends withdrawn from other corps which throws a light on the strength of the forces the belligerent still has at his disposal and the proximity of the moment when his forces shall be definitely inferior to the enemy’s which gives to the operation on which this corps is about to engage a different meaning because if it is no longer in a condition to make good its losses its successes even will only help mathematically to bring it nearer to its ultimate destruction and then the serial number of the corps that it has facing it is of no less significance if for instance it is a much weaker unit which has already accounted for several important units of the attacking force the whole nature of the operation is changed since even if it should end in the loss of the position which the defending force has been holding simply to have held it for any length of time may be a great success if a very small defending force has been sufficient to disable highly important forces on the other side you can understand that if in the analysis of the corps engaged on both sides there are all these points of importance the study of the position itself of the roads of the railways which it commands of the lines of communication which it protects is of the very highest one must study what i may call the whole geographical context” he added with a laugh and indeed he was so delighted with this expression that every time he employed it even months afterwards it was always accompanied by the same laugh “while the operation is being prepared by one of the belligerents if you read that one of his patrols has been wiped out in the neighbourhood of the position by the other belligerent one of the conclusions which you are entitled to draw is that one side was attempting to reconnoitre the defensive works with which the other intended to resist his attack an exceptional burst of activity at a given point may indicate the desire to capture that point but equally well the desire to hold the enemy in check there not to retaliate at the point at which he has attacked you or it may indeed be only a feint intended to cover by an increased activity the relief of troops in that sector which was a classic feint in napoleon’s wars on the other hand to appreciate the significance of any movement its probable object and as a corollary the other movements by which it will be accompanied or followed it is not immaterial to consult not so much the announcements issued by the higher command which may be intended to deceive the enemy to mask a possible check as the manual of field operations in use in the country in question we are always entitled to assume that the manoeuvre which an army has attempted to carry out is that prescribed by the rules that are applicable to the circumstances if for instance the rule lays down that a frontal attack should be accompanied by a flank attack if after the flank attack has failed the higher command makes out that it had no connexion with the main attack and was merely a diversion there is a strong likelihood that the truth will be found by consulting the rules and not the reports issued from headquarters and there are not only the regulations governing each army to be considered but their traditions their habits their doctrines the study of diplomatic activities with their perpetual action or reaction upon military activities must not be neglected either incidents apparently insignificant which at the time are not understood will explain to you how the enemy counting upon a support which these incidents shew to have been withheld was able to carry out only a part of his strategic plan so that if you can read between the lines of military history what is a confused jumble for the ordinary reader becomes a chain of reasoning as straightforward as a picture is for the picturelover who can see what the person portrayed is wearing and has in his hands while the visitor hurrying through the gallery is bewildered by a blur of colour which gives him a headache but just as with certain pictures in which it is not enough to observe that the figure is holding a chalice but one must know why the painter chose to place a chalice in his hands what it is intended to symbolise so these military operations apart from their immediate object are quite regularly traced in the mind of the general responsible for the campaign from the plans of earlier battles which we may call the past experience the literature the learning the etymology the aristocracy whichever you like of the battles of today observe that i am not speaking for the moment of the local the what shall i call it spatial identity of battles that exists also a battlefield has never been and never will be throughout the centuries simply the ground upon which a particular battle has been fought if it has been a battlefield that was because it combined certain conditions of geographical position of geological formation drawbacks even of a kind that would obstruct the enemy a river for instance cutting his force in two which made it a good field of battle and so what it has been it will continue to be a painter doesn’t make a studio out of any old room so you don’t make a battlefield out of any old piece of ground there are places set apart for the purpose but once again this is not what i was telling you about it was the type of battle which one follows in a sort of strategic tracing a tactical imitation if you like battles like ulm lodi leipzig cannae i can’t say whether there is ever going to be another war or what nations are going to fight in it but if a war does come you may be sure that it will include and deliberately on the commander’s part a cannae an austerlitz a rosbach a waterloo some of our people say quite openly that marshal von schieffer and general falkenhausen have prepared a battle of cannae against france in the hannibal style pinning their enemy down along his whole front and advancing on both flanks especially through belgium while bernhardi prefers the oblique order of frederick the great lenthen rather than cannae others expound their views less crudely but i can tell you one thing my boy that beauconseil the squadron commander i introduced you to the other day who is an officer with a very great future before him has swotted up a little pratzen attack of his own he knows it inside out he is keeping it up his sleeve and if he ever has an opportunity to put it into practice he will make a clean job of it and let us have it on a big scale the break through in the centre at rivoli too that’s a thing that will crop up if there’s ever another war it’s no more obsolete than the iliad i must add that we are practically condemned to make frontal attacks because we can’t afford to repeat the mistake we made in seventy we must assume the offensive and nothing else the only thing that troubles me is that if i see only the slower more antiquated minds among us opposing this splendid doctrine still one of the youngest of my masters who is a genius i mean mangin would like us to leave room provisionally of course for the defensive it is not very easy to answer him when he cites the example of austerlitz where the defence was merely a prelude to attack and victory”

   the enunciation of these theories by saintloup made me happy they gave me to hope that perhaps i was not being led astray in my life at doncières with regard to these officers whom i used to hear being discussed while i sat sipping a sauterne which bathed them in its charming golden glint by the same magnifying power which had swollen to such enormous proportions in my eyes while i was at balbec the king and queen of the south sea island the little group of the four epicures the young gambler legrandin’s brotherinlaw now shrunken so in my view as to appear nonexistent what gave me pleasure today would not perhaps leave me indifferent tomorrow as had always happened hitherto the creature that i still was at this moment was not perhaps doomed to immediate destruction since to the ardent and fugitive passion which i had felt on these few evenings for everything connected with military life saintloup by what he had just been saying to me touching the art of war added an intellectual foundation of a permanent character capable of attaching me to itself so strongly that i might without any attempt to deceive myself feel assured that after i had left doncières i should continue to take an interest in the work of my friends there and should not be long in coming to pay them another visit at the same time so as to make quite sure that this art of war was indeed an art in the true sense of the word

    “you interest me — i beg your pardon tu interest me enormously” i said to saintloup “but tell me there is one point that puzzles me i feel that i could be keenly thrilled by the art of strategy but if so i must first be sure that it is not so very different from the other arts that knowing the rules is not everything you tell me that plans of battles are copied i do find something aesthetic just as you said in seeing beneath a modern battle the plan of an older one i can’t tell you how attractive it sounds but then does the genius of the commander count for nothing does he really do no more than apply the rules or in point of science are there great generals as there are great surgeons who when the symptoms exhibited by two states of illhealth are identical to the outward eye nevertheless feel for some infinitesimal reason founded perhaps on their experience but interpreted afresh that in one case they ought to do one thing in another case another that in one case it is better to operate in another to wait”

    “i should just say so you will find napoleon not attacking when all the rules ordered him to attack but some obscure divination warned him not to for instance look at austerlitz or in 1806 take his instructions to lannes but you will find certain generals slavishly imitating one of napoleon’s movements and arriving at a diametrically opposite result there are a dozen examples of that in 1870 but even for the interpretation of what the enemy may do what he actually does is only a symptom which may mean any number of different things each of them has an equal chance of being the right thing if one looks only to reasoning and science just as in certain difficult cases all the medical science in the world will be powerless to decide whether the invisible tumour is malignant or not whether or not the operation ought to be performed it is his instinct his divination — like mme de thèbes you follow me— which decides in the great general as in the great doctor thus i’ve been telling you to take one instance what might be meant by a reconnaissance on the eve of a battle but it may mean a dozen other things also such as to make the enemy think you are going to attack him at one point whereas you intend to attack him at another to put out a screen which will prevent him from seeing the preparations for your real operation to force him to bring up fresh troops to hold them to immobilise them in a different place from where they are needed to form an estimate of the forces at his disposal to feel him to force him to shew his hand sometimes indeed the fact that you employ an immense number of troops in an operation is by no means a proof that that is your true objective for you may be justified in carrying it out even if it is only a feint so that your feint may have a better chance of deceiving the enemy if i had time now to go through the napoleonic wars from this point of view i assure you that these simple classic movements which we study here and which you will come and see us practising in the field just for the pleasure of a walk you young rascal — no i know you’re not well i apologise — well in a war when you feel behind you the vigilance the judgment the profound study of the higher command you are as much moved by them as by the simple lamps of a lighthouse only a material combustion but an emanation of the spirit sweeping through space to warn ships of danger i may have been wrong perhaps in speaking to you only of the literature of war in reality as the formation of the soil the direction of wind and light tell us which way a tree will grow so the conditions in which a campaign is fought the features of the country through which you march prescribe to a certain extent and limit the number of the plans among which the general has to choose which means that along a mountain range through a system of valleys over certain plains it is almost with the inevitability and the tremendous beauty of an avalanche that you can forecast the line of an army on the march”

    “now you deny me that freedom of choice in the commander that power of divination in the enemy who is trying to discover his plan which you allowed me a moment ago”

    “not at all you remember that book of philosophy we read together at balbec the richness of the world of possibilities compared with the real world very well it is the same again with the art of strategy in a given situation there will be four plans that offer themselves one of which the general has to choose as a disease may pass through various phases for which the doctor has to watch and here again the weakness and greatness of the human elements are fresh causes of uncertainty for of these four plans let us assume that contingent reasons such as the attainment of minor objects or time which may be pressing or the smallness of his effective strength and shortage of rations lead the general to prefer the first which is less perfect but less costly also to carry out is more rapid and has for its terrain a richer country for feeding his troops he may after having begun with this plan which the enemy uncertain at first will soon detect find that success lies beyond his grasp the difficulties being too great that is what i call the element of human weakness abandon it and try the second or third or fourth but it may equally be that he has tried the first plan and this is what i call human greatness merely as a feint to pin down the enemy so as to surprise him later at a point where he has not been expecting an attack thus at ulm mack who expected the enemy to advance from the west was surrounded from the north where he thought he was perfectly safe my example is not a very good one as a matter of fact and ulm is a better type of enveloping battle which the future will see reproduced because it is not only a classic example from which generals will seek inspiration but a form that is to some extent necessary one of several necessities which leaves room for choice for variety like a type of crystallisation but it doesn’t much matter really because these conditions are after all artificial to go back to our philosophy book it is like the rules of logic or scientific laws reality does conform to it more or less but bear in mind that the great mathematician poincaré is by no means certain that mathematics are strictly accurate as to the rules themselves which i mentioned to you they are of secondary importance really and besides they are altered from time to time we cavalrymen for instance have to go by the field service of 1895 which you may say is out of date since it is based on the old and obsolete doctrine which maintains that cavalry warfare has little more than a moral effect in the panic that the charge creates in the enemy whereas the more intelligent of our teachers all the best brains in the cavalry and particularly the major i was telling you about anticipate on the contrary that the decisive victory will be obtained by a real handtohand encounter in which our weapons will be sabre and lance and the side that can hold out longer will win not simply morally and by creating panic but materially”

    “saintloup is quite right and it is probable that the next field service will shew signs of this evolution” put in my other neighbour

    “i am not ungrateful for your support for your opinions seem to make more impression upon my friend than mine” said saintloup with a smile whether because the growing attraction between his comrade and myself annoyed him slightly or because he thought it graceful to solemnise it with this official confirmation “perhaps i may have underestimated the importance of the rules i don’t know they do change that must be admitted but in the meantime they control the military situation the plans of campaign and concentration if they reflect a false conception of strategy they may be the principal cause of defeat all this is a little too technical for you” he remarked to me “after all you may say that what does most to accelerate the evolution of the art of war is wars themselves in the course of a campaign if it is at all long you will see one belligerent profiting by the lessons furnished him by the successes and mistakes perfecting the methods of the other who will improve on him in turn but all that is a thing of the past with the terrible advance of artillery the wars of the future if there are to be any more wars will be so short that before we have had time to think of putting our lessons into practice peace will have been signed”

    “don’t be so touchy” i told saintloup reverting to the first words ol this speech “i was listening to you quite eagerly”

    “if you will kindly not fly into a passion and will allow me to speak” his friend went on “i shall add to what you have just been saying that if battles copy and coincide with one another it is not merely due to the mind of the commander it may happen that a mistake on his part for instance his failure to appreciate the strength of the enemy will lead him to call upon his men for extravagant sacrifices sacrifices which certain units will make with an abnegation so sublime that their part in the battle will be analogous to that played by some other unit in some other battle and these will be quoted in history as interchangeable examples to stick to 1870 we have the prussian guard at saintprivat and the turcos at froeschviller and wissembourg”

    “ah interchangeable very neat excellent the lad has brains” was saintloup’s comment

   i was not unmoved by these last examples as always when beneath the particular instance i was afforded a glimpse of the general law still the genius of the commander that was what interested me i was anxious to discover in what it consisted what steps in given circumstances when the commander who lacked genius could not withstand the enemy the inspired leader would take to reestablish his jeopardised position which according to saintloup was quite possible and had been done by napoleon more than once and to understand what military worth meant i asked for comparisons between the various generals whom i knew by name which of them had most markedly the character of a leader the gifts of a tactician at the risk of boring my new friends who however shewed no signs of boredom but continued to answer me with an inexhaustible good nature

   i felt myself isolated not only from the great freezing night which extended far around us and in which we heard from time to time the whistle of a train which only rendered more keen the pleasure of being where we were or the chime of an hour which happily was still a long way short of that at which these young men would have to buckle on their sabres and go but also from all my external obsessions almost from the memory of mme de guermantes by the hospitality of saintloup to which that of his friends reinforcing it gave so to speak a greater solidity by the warmth also of this little diningroom by the savour of the wellchosen dishes that were set before us they gave as much pleasure to my imagination as to my appetite sometimes the little piece of still life from which they had been taken the rugged holy water stoup of the oyster in which lingered a few drops of brackish water or the knotted stem the yellow leaves of a bunch of grapes still enveloped them inedible poetic and remote as a landscape and producing at different points in the course of the meal the impressions of rest in the shade of a vine and of an excursion out to sea on other evenings it was the cook alone who threw into relief these original properties of our food which he presented in its natural setting like a work of art and a fish cooked in wine was brought in on a long earthenware dish on which as it stood out in relief on a bed of bluish herbs unbreakable now but still contorted from having been dropped alive into boiling water surrounded by a circle of satellite creatures in their shells crabs shrimps and mussels it had the appearance of being part of a ceramic design by bernard palissy

    “i am jealous furious” saintloup attacked me half smiling half in earnest alluding to the interminable conversations aside which i had been having with his friend “is it because you find him more intelligent than me do you like him better than me well i suppose he’s everything now and no one else is to have a look in” men who are enormously in love with a woman who live in the society of womanlovers allow themselves pleasantries on which others who would see less innocence in them would never venture

   when the conversation became general they avoided any reference to dreyfus for fear of offending saintloup the following week however two of his friends were remarking what a curious thing it was that living in so military an atmosphere he was so keen a dreyfusard almost an antimilitarist “the reason is” i suggested not wishing to enter into details “that the influence of environment is not so important as people think    ” i intended of course to stop at this point and not to reiterate the observations which i had made to saintloup a few days earlier since however i had repeated these words almost textually i proceeded to excuse myself by adding “as in fact i was saying the other day    ” but i had reckoned without the reverse side of robert’s polite admiration of myself and certain other persons that admiration reached its fulfilment in so entire an assimilation of their ideas that in the course of a day or two he would have completely forgotten that those ideas were not his own and so in the matter of my modest theory saintloup for all the world as though it had always dwelt in his own brain and as though i were merely poaching on his preserves felt it incumbent upon him to greet my discovery with warm approval

    “why yes environment is of no importance”

   and with as much vehemence as if he were afraid of my interrupting or failing to understand him

    “the real influence is that of one’s intellectual environment one is the man of one’s idea”

   he stopped for a moment with the satisfied smile of one who has digested his dinner dropped his eyeglass and fixing me with a gimletlike stare

    “all men with similar ideas are alike” he informed me with a challenging air probably he had completely forgotten that i myself had said to him only a few days earlier what on the other hand he remembered so well

   i did not arrive at saintloup’s restaurant every evening in the same state of mind if a memory a sorrow that weigh on us are able to leave us so effectively that we are no longer aware of them they can also return and sometimes remain with us for a long time there were evenings when as i passed through the town on my way to the restaurant i felt so keen a longing for mme de guermantes that i could scarcely breathe you might have said that part of my breast had been cut open by a skilled anatomist taken out and replaced by an equal part of immaterial suffering by an equivalent load of longing and love and however neatly the wound may have been stitched together there is not much comfort in life when regret for the loss of another person is substituted for one’s entrails it seems to be occupying more room than they one feels it perpetually and besides what a contradiction in terms to be obliged to think a part of one’s body only it seems that we are worth more somehow at the whisper of a breeze we sigh from oppression but from weariness also i would look up at the sky if it were clear i would say to myself “perhaps she is in the country she is looking at the same stars and for all i know when i arrive at the restaurant robert may say to me ‘good news i have just heard from my aunt she wants to meet you she is coming down here’” it was not in the firmament alone that i enshrined the thought of mme de guermantes a passing breath of air more fragrant than the rest seemed to bring me a message from her as long ago from gilberte in the cornfields of méséglise we do not change we introduce into the feeling with which we regard a person many slumbering elements which that feeling revives but which are foreign to it besides with these feelings for particular people there is always something in us that is trying to bring them nearer to the truth that is to say to absorb them in a more general feeling common to the whole of humanity with which people and the suffering that they cause us are merely a means to enable us to communicate what brought a certain pleasure into my grief was that i knew it to be a tiny fragment of the universal love simply because i thought that i recognised sorrows which i had felt on gilberte’s account or else when in the evenings at combray mamma would not stay in any room and also the memory of certain pages of bergotte in the agony i now felt to which mme de guermantes her coldness her absence were not clearly linked as cause is to effect in the mind of a philosopher i did not conclude that mme de guermantes was not the cause of that agony is there not such a thing as a diffused bodily pain extending radiating out into other parts which however it leaves to vanish altogether if the practitioner lays his finger on the precise spot from which it springs and yet until that moment its extension gave it for us so vague so fatal a semblance that powerless to explain or even to locate it we imagined that there was no possibility of its being healed as i made my way to the restaurant i said to myself “a fortnight already since i last saw mme de guermantes” a fortnight which did not appear so enormous an interval save to me who when mme de guermantes was concerned reckoned time by minutes for me it was no longer the stars and the breeze merely but the arithmetical divisions of time that assumed a dolorous and poetic aspect each day now was like the loose crest of a crumbling mountain down one side of which i felt that i could descend into oblivion but down the other was borne by the necessity of seeing the duchess again and i was continually inclining one way or the other having no stable equilibrium one day i said to myself “perhaps there will be a letter tonight” and on entering the diningroom i found courage to ask saintloup

    “you don’t happen to have had any news from paris”

    “yes” he replied gloomily “bad news”

   i breathed a sigh of relief when i realised that it was only he who was unhappy and that the news came from his mistress but i soon saw that one of its consequences would be to prevent robert for ever so long from taking me to see his aunt

   i learned that a quarrel had broken out between him and his mistress through the post presumably unless she had come down to pay him a flying visit between trains and the quarrels even when relatively slight which they had previously had had always seemed as though they must prove insoluble for she was a girl of violent temper who would stamp her foot and burst into tears for reasons as incomprehensible as those that make children shut themselves into dark cupboards not come out for dinner refuse to give any explanation and only redouble their sobs when our patience exhausted we visit them with a whipping to say that saintloup suffered terribly from this estrangement would be an understatement of the truth which would give the reader a false impression of his grief when he found himself alone the only picture in his mind being that of his mistress parting from him with the respect which she had felt for him at the sight of his energy the anxieties which he had had at first gave way before the irreparable and the cessation of an anxiety is so pleasant a thing that the rupture once it was certain assumed for him something of the same kind of charm as a reconciliation what he began to suffer from a little later was a secondary and accidental grief the tide of which flowed incessantly from his own heart at the idea that perhaps she would be glad to make it up that it was not inconceivable that she was waiting for a word from him that in the mean time to be avenged on him she would perhaps on a certain evening in a certain place do a certain thing and that he had only to telegraph to her that he was coming for it not to happen that others perhaps were taking advantage of the time which he was letting slip and that in a few days it would be too late to recapture her for she would be already bespoke among all these possibilities he was certain of nothing his mistress preserved a silence which wrought him up to such a frenzy of grief that he began to ask himself whether she might not be in hiding at doncières or have sailed for the indies

   it has been said that silence is a force in another and widely different sense it is a tremendous force in the hands of those who are loved it increases the anxiety of the lover who has to wait nothing so tempts us to approach another person as what is keeping us apart and what barrier is there so insurmountable as silence it has been said also that silence is a torture capable of goading to madness him who is condemned to it in a prison cell but what a torture — keener than that of having to keep silence — to have to endure the silence of the person one loves robert asked himself “what can she be doing never to send me a single word like this she hates me perhaps and will always go on hating me” and he reproached himself thus her silence did indeed drive him mad with jealousy and remorse besides more cruel than the silence of prisons that kind of silence is in itself a prison an immaterial enclosure i admit but impenetrable this interposed slice of empty atmosphere through which despite its emptiness the visual rays of the abandoned lover cannot pass is there a more terrible illumination than that of silence which shews us not one absent love but a thousand and shews us each of them in the act of indulging in some fresh betrayal sometimes in an abrupt relaxation of his strain robert would imagine that this period of silence was just coming to an end that the long expected letter was on its way he saw it it arrived he started at every sound his thirst was already quenched he murmured “the letter the letter” after this glimpse of a phantom oasis of affection he found himself once more toiling across the real desert of a silence without end

   he suffered in anticipation without a single omission all the griefs and pains of a rupture which at other moments he fancied he might somehow contrive to avoid like people who put all their affairs in order with a view to a migration abroad which they never make whose minds no longer certain where they will find themselves living next day flutter helplessly for the time being detached from them like a heart that is taken out of a dying man and continues to beat though disjoined from the rest of his body anyhow this hope that his mistress would return gave him courage to persevere in the rupture as the belief that one will return alive from the battle helps one to face death and inasmuch as habit is of all the plants of human growth the one that has least need of nutritious soil in order to live and is the first to appear upon what is apparently the most barren rock perhaps had he begun by effecting their rupture as a feint he would in the end have grown genuinely accustomed to it but his uncertainty kept him in a state of emotion which linked with the memory of the woman herself was akin to love he forced himself nevertheless not to write to her thinking perhaps that it was a less cruel torment to live without his mistress than with her in certain conditions or else that after the way in which they had parted it was necessary to wait for excuses from her if she was to keep what he believed her to feel for him in the way if not of love at any rate of esteem and regard he contented himself with going to the telephone which had recently been installed at doncières and asking for news from or giving instructions to a lady’s maid whom he had procured and placed with his friend these communications were as it turned out complicated and took up much of his time since influenced by what her literary friends preached to her about the ugliness of the capital but principally for the sake of her animals her dogs her monkey her canaries and her parrokeet whose incessant din her paris landlord had declined to tolerate for another moment robert’s mistress had now taken a little house in the neighbourhood of versailles meanwhile he down at doncières no longer slept a wink all night once in my room overcome by exhaustion he dozed off for a little but suddenly he began to talk tried to get up and run to stop something from happening said “i hear her you shan’t    you shan’t    ” he awoke he had been dreaming he explained to me that he was in the country with the serjeantmajor his host had tried to keep him away from a certain part of the house saintloup had discovered that the serjeantmajor had staying with him a subaltern extremely rich and extremely vicious whom he knew to have a violent passion for his mistress and suddenly in his dream he had distinctly heard the spasmodic regular cries which his mistress was in the habit of uttering at the moment of gratification he had tried to force the serjeantmajor to take him to the room in which she was and the other had held him back to keep him from going there with an air of annoyance at such a want of discretion in a guest which robert said he would never be able to forget

    “it was an idiotic dream” he concluded still quite breathless

   all the same i could see that during the hour that followed he was more than once on the point of telephoning to his mistress to beg for a reconciliation my father had now had the telephone for some time at home but i doubt whether that would have been of much use to saintloup besides it hardly seemed to me quite proper to make my parents or even a mechanical instrument installed in their house play pander between saintloup and his mistress ladylike and highminded as the latter might be his bad dream began to fade from his memory with a fixed and absent stare he came to see me on each of those cruel days which traced in my mind as they followed one after the other the splendid sweep of a staircase forged in hard metal on which robert stood asking himself what decision his friend was going to take

   at length she wrote to ask whether he would consent to forgive her as soon as he realised that a definite rupture had been avoided he saw all the disadvantages of a reconciliation besides he had already begun to suffer less acutely and had almost accepted a grief the sharp tooth of which he would have in a few months perhaps to feel again if their intimacy were to be resumed he did not hesitate for long and perhaps he hesitated only because he was now certain of being able to recapture his mistress of being able to do it and therefore of doing it only she asked him so that she might have time to recover her equanimity not to come to paris at the new year now he had not the heart to go to paris without seeing her on the other hand she had declared her willingness to go abroad with him bot for that he would need to make a formal application for leave which captain de borodino was unwilling to grant

    “i’m sorry about it because of your meeting with my aunt which will have to be put off i dare say i shall be in paris at easter”

    “we shan’t be able to call on mme de guermantes then because i shall have gone to balbec but really it doesn’t matter in the least i assure you”

    “to balbec but you didn’t go there till august”

    “i know but next year they’re making me go there earlier for my health”

   all that he feared was that i might form a bad impression of his mistress after what he had told me “she is violent simply because she is too frank too thorough in her feelings but she is a sublime creature you can’t imagine what exquisite poetry there is in her she goes every year to spend all souls’ day at bruges ‘nice’ of her don’t you think if you ever do meet her you’ll see what i mean she has a greatness    ” and as he was infected with certain of the mannerisms used in the literary circles in which the lady moved “there is something sidereal about her in fact something bardic you know what i mean the poet merging into the priest”

   i was searching all through dinner for a pretext which would enable saintloup to ask his aunt to see me without my having to wait until he came to paris now such a pretext was furnished by the desire that i had to see some more pictures by elstir the famous painter whom saintloup and i had met at balbec a pretext behind which there was moreover an element of truth for if on my visits to elstir what i had asked of his painting had been that it should lead me to the comprehension and love of things better than itself a real thaw an authentic square in a country town live women on a beach all the more would i have commissioned from it the portraits of the realities which i had not been able to fathom such as a lane of hawthornblossoms not so much that it might perpetuate their beauty for me as that it might reveal that beauty to me now on the other hand it was the originality the seductive attraction of those paintings that aroused my desire and what i wanted above anything else was to look at other pictures by elstir

   it seemed to me also that the least of his pictures were something quite different from the masterpieces even of greater painters than himself his work was like a realm apart whose frontiers were not to be passed matchless in substance eagerly collecting the infrequent periodicals in which articles on him and his work had appeared i had learned that it was only recently that he had begun to paint landscapes and still life and that he had started with mythological subjects i had seen photographs of two of these in his studio and had then been for long under the influence of japanese art

   several of the works most characteristic of his various manners were scattered about the provinces a certain house at les andelys in which there was one of his finest landscapes seemed to me as precious gave me as keen a desire to go there and see it as did a village in the chartres district among whose millstone walls was enshrined a glorious painted window and towards the possessor of this treasure towards the man who inside his ugly house on the main street closeted like an astrologer sat questioning one of those mirrors of the world which elstir’s pictures were and who had perhaps bought it for many thousands of francs i felt myself borne by that instinctive sympathy which joins the very hearts the inmost natures of those who think alike upon a vital subject now three important works by my favourite painter were described in one of these articles as belonging to mme de guermantes so that it was after all quite sincerely that on the evening on which saintloup told me of his lady’s projected visit to bruges i was able during dinner in front of his friends to let fall as though on the spur of the moment

    “listen if you don’t mind just one last word on the subject of the lady we were speaking about you remember elstir the painter i met at balbec”

    “why of course i do”

    “you remember how much i admired his work”

    “i do quite well and the letter we sent him”

    “very well one of the reasons — not one of the chief reasons a subordinate reason — why i should like to meet the said lady — you do know who’ i mean don’t you”

    “of course i do how involved you’re getting”

    “is that she has in her house one very fine picture at least by elstir”

    “i say i never knew that”

    “elstir will probably be at balbec at easter you know he stays down there now all the year round practically i should very much like to have seen this picture before i leave paris i don’t know whether you’re on sufficiently intimate terms with your aunt but couldn’t you manage somehow to give her so good an impression of me that she won’t refuse and then ask her if she’ll let me come and see the picture without you since you won’t be there”

    “that’s all right i’ll answer for her i’ll make a special point of it”

    “oh robert you are an angel i do love you”

    “it’s very nice of you to love me but it would be equally nice if you were to call me tu as you promised and as you began to do”

    “i hope it’s not your departure that you two are plotting together” one of robert’s friends said to me “you know if saintloup does go on leave it needn’t make any difference we shall still be here it will be less amusing for you perhaps but we’ll do all we can to make you forget his absence” as a matter of fact just as we had decided that robert’s mistress would have to go to bruges by herself the news came that captain de borodino obdurate hitherto in his refusal had given authority for serjeant saintloup to proceed on long leave to bruges what had happened was this the prince extremely proud of his luxuriant head of hair was an assiduous customer of the principal hairdresser in the town who had started life as a boy under napoleon iii’s barber captain de borodino was on the best of terms with the hairdresser being in spite of his air of majesty quite simple in his dealings with his inferiors but the hairdresser through whose books the prince’s account had been running without payment for at least five years swollen no less by bottles of portugal and eau des souverains irons razors and strops than by the ordinary charges for shampooing haircutting and the like had a greater respect for saintloup who always paid on the nail and kept several carriages and saddlehorses having learned of saintloup’s vexation at not being able to go with his mistress he had spoken strongly about it to the prince at a moment when he was trussed up in a white surplice with his head held firmly over the back of the chair and his throat menaced by a razor this narrative of a young man’s gallant adventures won from the princely captain a smile of bonapartish indulgence it is hardly probable that he thought of his unpaid bill but the barber’s recommendation tended to put him in as good a humour as one from a duke would have put him in a bad while his chin was still smothered in soap the leave was promised and the warrant was signed that evening as for the hairdresser who was in the habit of boasting all day long of his own exploits and in order to do so claimed for himself shewing an astonishing faculty for lying distinctions that were pure fabrications having for once rendered this signal service to saintloup not only did he refrain from publishing it broadcast but as if vanity were obliged to lie and when there was no scope for lying gave place to modesty he never mentioned the matter to robert again

   all his friends assured me that as long as i stayed at doncières or if i should come there again at any time even although robert were away their horses their quarters their time would be at my disposal and i felt that it was with the greatest cordiality that these young men put their comfort and youth and strength at the service of my weakness

    “why on earth” they went on after insisting that i should stay “don’t you come down here every year you see how our quiet life appeals to you besides you’re so keen about everything that goes on in the regiment quite the old soldier”

   for i continued my eager demands that they would classify the different officers whose names i knew according to the degree of admiration which they seemed to deserve just as in my schooldays i used to make the other boys classify the actors of the théâtrefrançais if in the place of one of the generals whom i had always heard mentioned at the head of the list such as galliffet or négrier one of saintloup’s friends with a contemptuous “but négrier is one of the feeblest of our general officers” put the new intact appetising name of pau or geslin de bourgogne i felt the same joyful surprise as long ago when the outworn name of thiron or febvre was sent flying by the sudden explosion of the unfamiliar name of amaury “better even than négrier but in what respect give me an example” i should have liked there to exist profound differences even among the junior officers of the regiment and i hoped in the reason for these differences to seize the essential quality of what constituted military superiority the one whom i should have been most interested to hear discussed because he was the one whom i had most often seen was the prince de borodino but neither saintloup nor his friends if they did justice to the fine officer who kept his squadron up to the supreme pitch of efficiency liked the man without speaking of him naturally in the same tone as of certain other officers rankers and freemasons who did not associate much with the rest and had in comparison an uncouth barrackroom manner they seemed not to include m de borodino among the officers of noble birth from whom it must be admitted he differed considerably in his attitude even towards saintloup the others taking advantage of the fact that robert was only an nco and that therefore his influential relatives might be grateful were he invited to the houses of superior officers on whom ordinarily they would have looked down lost no opportunity of having him to dine when any bigwig was expected who might be of use to a young cavalry serjeant captain de borodino alone confined himself to his official relations which for that matter were always excellent with robert the fact was that the prince whose grandfather had been made a marshal and a princeduke by the emperor with whose family he had subsequently allied himself by marriage while his father had married a cousin of napoleon iii and had twice been a minister after the coup d’etat felt that in spite of all this he did not count for much with saintloup and the guermantes connexion who in turn since he did not look at things from the same point of view as they counted for very little with him he suspected that for saintloup he himself was — he a kinsman of the hohenzollern — not a true noble but the grandson of a farmer but at the same time he regarded saintloup as the son of a man whose countship had been confirmed by the emperor — one of what were known in the faubourg saintgermain as ‘touchedup’ counts — and who had besought him first for a prefecture then for some other post a long way down the list of subordinates to his highness the prince de borodino minister of state who was styled on his letters ‘monseigneur’ and was a nephew of the sovereign

   something more than a nephew possibly the first princesse de borodino was reputed to have bestowed her favours on napoleon i whom she followed to the isle of elba and the second hers on napoleon iii and if in the captain’s placid countenance one caught a trace of napoleon i— if not in his natural features at least in the studied majesty of the mask — the officer had particularly in his melancholy and kindly gaze in his drooping moustache something that reminded one also of napoleon iii and this in so striking a fashion that having asked leave after sedan to join the emperor in captivity and having been sent away by bismarck before whom he had been brought the latter happening to look up at the young man who was preparing to leave the room was at once impressed by the likeness and reconsidering his decision recalled him and gave him the authorisation which he in common with every one else had just been refused

   if the prince de borodino was not prepared to make overtures to saintloup nor to the other representatives of faubourg saintgermain society that there were in the regiment while he frequently invited two subalterns of plebeian origin who were pleasant companions it was because looking down upon them all from the height of his imperial grandeur he drew between these two classes of inferiors the distinction that one set consisted of inferiors who knew themselves to be such and with whom he was delighted to spend his time being beneath his outward majesty of a simple jovial humour and the other of inferiors who thought themselves his superiors a claim which he could not allow and so while all the other officers of the regiment made much of saintloup the prince de borodino to whose care the young man had been recommended by marshal x— — confined himself to being obliging with regard to the military duties which saintloup always performed in the most exemplary fashion but never had him to his house except on one special occasion when he found himself practically compelled to invite him and when as this occurred during my stay at doncières he asked him to bring me to dinner also i had no difficulty that evening as i watched saintloup sitting at his captain’s table in distinguishing in their respective manners and refinements the difference that existed between the two aristocracies the old nobility and that of the empire the offspring of a caste the faults of which even if he repudiated them with all the force of his intellect had been absorbed into his blood a caste which having ceased to exert any real authority for at least a century saw nothing more now in the protective affability which formed part of its regular course of education than an exercise like horsemanship or fencing cultivated without any serious purpose as a sport on meeting representatives of that middle class on which the old nobility so far looked down as to believe that they were nattered by its intimacy and would be honoured by the informality of its tone saintloup would take the hand of no matter who might be introduced to him though he had failed perhaps to catch the stranger’s name in a friendly grip and as he talked to him crossing and uncrossing his legs all the time flinging himself back in his chair in an attitude of absolute unconstraint one foot in the palm of his hand call him ‘my dear fellow’ belonging o the other hand to a nobility whose titles still preserved their original meaning provided that their holders still possessed the splendid emoluments given in reward for glorious services and bringing to mind the record of high offices in which one is in command of numberless men and must know how to deal with men the prince de borodino — not perhaps very distinctly or with any clear personal sense of superiority but at any rate in his body which revealed it by its attitudes and behaviour generally — regarded his own rank as a prerogative that was still effective those same commoners whom saintloup would have slapped on the shoulder and taken by the arm he addressed with a majestic affability in which a reserve instinct with grandeur tempered the smiling goodfellowship that came naturally to him in a tone marked at once by a genuine kindliness and a stiffness deliberately assumed this was due no doubt to his being not so far removed from the great embassies and the court itself at which his father had held the highest posts whereas the manners of saintloup the elbow on the table the foot in the hand would not have been well received there but principally it was due to the fact that he looked down less upon the middle classes because they were the inexhaustible source from which the first emperor had chosen his marshals and his nobles and in which the second had found a rouher and a fould

   son doubtless or grandson of an emperor who had nothing more important to do than to command a squadron the preoccupations of his putative father and grandfather could not for want of an object on which to fasten themselves survive in any real sense in the mind of m de borodino but as the spirit of an artist continues to model for many years after he is dead the statue which he carved so they had taken shape in him were materialised incarnate in him it was they that his face reflected it was with in his voice the vivacity of the first emperor that he worded a reprimand to a corporal with the dreamy melancholy of the second that he puffed out the smoke of a cigarette when he passed in plain clothes through the streets of doncières a certain sparkle in his eyes escaping from under the brim of the bowler hat sent radiating round this captain of cavalry a regal incognito people trembled when he strode into the serjeantmajor’s office followed by the adjutant and the quartermaster as though by berthier and masséna when he chose the cloth for his squadron’s breeches he fastened on the mastertailor a gaze capable of baffling talleyrand and deceiving alexander and at times in the middle of an inspection he would stop let his handsome blue eyes cloud with dreams twist his moustache with the air of one building up a new prussia and a new italy but a moment later reverting from napoleon iii to napoleon i he would point out that the equipment was not properly polished and would insist on tasting the men’s rations and at home in his private life it was for the wives of middle class officers provided that their husbands were not freemasons that he would bring out not only a dinner service of royal blue sèvres fit for an ambassador which had been given to his father by napoleon and appeared even more priceless in the commonplace house on a provincial street in which he was living like those rare porcelains which tourists admire with a special delight in the rustic chinacupboard of some old manor that has been converted into a comfortable and prosperous farmhouse but other gifts of the emperor also those noble and charming manners which too would have won admiration in some diplomatic post abroad if for some men it did not mean a lifelong condemnation to the most unjust form of ostracism merely to be well born his easy gestures his kindness his grace and embedding beneath an enamel that was of royal blue also glorious images the mysterious illuminated living reliquary of his gaze and in treating of the social relations with the middle classes which the prince had at doncières it may be as well to add these few words the lieutenantcolonel played the piano beautifully the senior medical officer’s wife sang like a conservatoire medallist this latter couple as well as the lieutenantcolonel and his wife used to dine every week with m de borodino they were flattered unquestionably knowing that when the prince went to paris on leave he dined with mme de pourtalès and the murats and people like that “but” they said to themselves “he’s just a captain after all he’s only too glad to get us to come still he’s a real friend you know” but when m de borodino who had long been pulling every possible wire to secure an appointment for himself nearer paris was posted to beauvais he packed up and went and forgot as completely the two musical couples as he forgot the doncières theatre and the little restaurant to which he used often to send out for his luncheon and to their great indignation neither the lieutenantcolonel nor the senior medical officer who had so often sat at his table ever had so much as a single word from him for the rest of their lives one morning saintloup confessed to me that he had written to my grandmother to give her news of me with the suggestion that since there was telephonic connexion between paris and doncières she might make use of it to speak to me in short that very day she was to give me a call and he advised me to be at the post office at about a quarter to four the telephone was not yet at that date as commonly in use as it is today and yet habit requires so short a time to divest of their mystery the sacred forces with which we are in contact that not having had my call at once the only thought in my mind was that it was very slow and badly managed and i almost decided to lodge a complaint like all of us nowadays i found not rapid enough for my liking in its abrupt changes the admirable sorcery for which a few moments are enough to bring before us invisible but present the person to whom we have been wishing to speak and who while still sitting at his table in the town in which he lives in my grandmother’s case paris under another sky than ours in weather that is not necessarily the same in the midst of circumstances and worries of which we know nothing but of which he is going to inform us finds himself suddenly transported hundreds of miles he and all the surroundings in which he remains immured within reach of our ear at the precise moment which our fancy has ordained and we are like the person in the fairytale to whom a sorceress on his uttering the wish makes appear with supernatural clearness his grandmother or his betrothed in the act of turning over a book of shedding tears of gathering flowers quite close to the spectator and yet ever so remote in the place in which she actually is at the moment we need only so that the miracle may be accomplished apply our lips to the magic orifice and invoke — occasionally for rather longer than seems to us necessary i admit — the vigilant virgins to whose voices we listen every day without ever coming to know their faces and who are our guardian angels in the dizzy realm of darkness whose portals they so jealously keep the all powerful by whose intervention the absent rise up at our side without our being permitted to set eyes on them the danaids of the unseen who without ceasing empty fill transmit the urns of sound the ironic furies who just as we were murmuring a confidence to a friend in the hope that no one was listening cry brutally “i hear you” the ever infuriated servants of the mystery the umbrageous priestesses of the invisible the young ladies of the telephone

   and the moment our call has sounded in the night filled with phantoms to which our ears alone are unsealed a tiny sound an abstract sound — the sound of distance overcome — and the voice of the dear one speaks to us

   it is she it is her voice that is speaking that is there but how remote it is how often have i been unable to listen without anguish as though confronted by the impossibility of seeing except after long hours of journeying her whose voice has been so close to my ear i felt more clearly the sham and illusion of meetings apparently most pleasant and at what a distance we may be from the people we love at the moment when it seems that we have only to stretch out our hand to seize and hold them a real presence indeed that voice so near — in actual separation but a premonition also of an eternal separation over and again as i listened in this way without seeing her who spoke to me from so far away it has seemed to me that the voice was crying to me from depths out of which one does not rise again and i have known the anxiety that was one day to wring my heart when a voice should thus return alone and attached no longer to a body which i was never more to see to murmur in my ear words i would fain have kissed as they issued from lips for ever turned to dust

   this afternoon alas at doncières the miracle did not occur when i reached the post office my grandmother’s call had already been received i stepped into the box the line was engaged some one was talking who probably did not realise that there was nobody to answer him for when i raised the receiver to my ear the lifeless block began squeaking like punchinello i silenced it as one silences a puppet by putting it back on its hook but like punchinello as soon as i took it again in my hand it resumed its gabbling at length giving it up as hopeless by hanging up the receiver once and for all i stifled the convulsions of this vociferous stump which kept up its chatter until the last moment and went in search of the operator who told me to wait a little then i spoke and after a few seconds of silence suddenly i heard that voice which i supposed myself mistakenly to know so well for always until then every time that my grandmother had talked to me i had been accustomed to follow what she was saying on the open score of her face in which the eyes figured so largely but her voice itself i was hearing this afternoon for the first time and because that voice appeared to me to have altered in its proportions from the moment that it was a whole and reached me in this way alone and without the accompaniment of her face and features i discovered for the first time how sweet that voice was perhaps too it had never oeen so sweet for my grandmother knowing me to be alone and unhappy felt that she might let herself go in the outpouring of an affection which on her principle of education she usually restrained and kept hidden it was sweet but also how sad it was first of all on account of its very sweetness a sweetness drained almost — more than any but a few human voices can ever have been — of every element of resistance to others of all selfishness fragile by reason of its delicacy it seemed at every moment ready to break to expire in a pure flow of tears then too having it alone beside me seen without the mask of her face i noticed for the first time the sorrows that had scarred it in the course of a lifetime

   was it however solely the voice that because it was alone gave me this new impression which tore my heart not at all it was rather that this isolation of the voice was like a symbol a presentation a direct consequence of another isolation that of my grandmother separated for the first time in my life from myself the orders or prohibitions which she addressed to me at every moment in the ordinary course of my life the tedium of obedience or the fire of rebellion which neutralised the affection that i felt for her were at this moment eliminated and indeed might be eliminated for ever since my grandmother no longer insisted on having me with her under her control was in the act of expressing her hope that i would stay at doncières altogether or would at any rate extend my visit for as long as possible seeing that both my health and my work seemed likely to benefit by the change also what i held compressed in this little bell that was ringing in my ear was freed from the conflicting pressures which had every day hitherto given it a counterpoise and from this moment irresistible carrying me altogether away our mutual affection my grandmother by telling me to stay filled me with an anxious an insensate longing to return this freedom of action which for the future she allowed me and to which i had never dreamed that she would consent appeared to me suddenly as sad as might be my freedom of action after her death when i should still love her and she would for ever have abandoned me “granny” i cried to her “granny” and would fain have kissed her but i had beside me only that voice a phantom as impalpable as that which would come perhaps to revisit me when my grandmother was dead “speak to me” but then it happened that left more solitary still i ceased to catch the sound of her voice my grandmother could no longer hear me she was no longer in communication with me we had ceased to stand face to face to be audible to one another i continued to call her sounding the empty night in which i felt that her appeals also must be straying i was shaken by the same anguish which in the distant past i had felt once before one day when a little child in a crowd i had lost her an anguish due less to my not finding her than to the thought that she must be searching for me must be saying to herself that i was searching for her an anguish comparable to that which i was to feel on the day when we speak to those who can no longer reply and whom we would so love to have hear all the things that we have not told them and our assurance that we are not unhappy it seemed as though it were already a beloved ghost that i had allowed to lose herself in the ghostly world and standing alone before the instrument i went on vainly repeating “granny granny” as orpheus left alone repeats the name of his dead wife is decided to leave the post office to go and find robert at his restaurant in order to tell him that as i was half expecting a telegram which would oblige me to return to paris i wished at all costs to find out at what times the trains left and yet before reaching this decision i felt i must make one attempt more to invoke the daughters of the night the messengers of the word the deities without form or feature but the capricious guardians had not deigned once again to unclose the miraculous portals or more probably had not been able in vain might they untiringly appeal as was their custom to the venerable inventor of printing and the young prince collector of impressionist paintings and driver of motorcars who was captain de borodino’s nephew gutenberg and wagram left their supplications unanswered and i came away feeling that the invisible would continue to turn a deaf ear

   when i came among robert and his friends i withheld the confession that my heart was no longer with them that my departure was now irrevocably fixed saintloup appeared to believe me but i learned afterwards that he had from the first moment realised that my uncertainty was feigned and that he would not see me again next day and while letting their plates grow cold his friends joined him in searching through the timetable for a train which would take me to paris and while we heard in the cold starry night the whistling of the engines on the line i certainly felt no longer the same peace of mind which on all these last evenings i had derived from the friendship of the former and the latter’s distant passage and yet they did not fail me this evening performing the same office in a different way my departure overpowered me less when i was no longer obliged to think of it by myself when i felt that there was concentrated on what was to be done the more normal more wholesome activity of my strenuous friends robert’s brothers in arms and of those other strong creatures the trains whose going and coming night and morning between doncières and paris broke up in retrospect what had been too compact and insupportable in my long isolation from my grandmother into daily possibilities of return

    “i don’t doubt the truth of what you’re saying or that you aren’t thinking of leaving us just yet” said saintloup smiling “but pretend you are going and come and say goodbye to me tomorrow morning early otherwise there’s a risk of my not seeing you i’m going out to luncheon i’ve got leave from the captain i shall have to be back in barracks by two as we are to be on the march all afternoon i suppose the man to whose house i’m going a couple of miles out will manage to get me back in time”

   scarcely had he uttered these words when a messenger came for me from my hotel the telephone operator had sent to find me i ran to the post office for it was nearly closing time the word ‘trunks’ recurred incessantly in the answers given me by the officiais i was in a fever of anxiety for it was my grandmother who had asked for me the office was closing for the night finally i got my connexion “is that you granny” a woman’s voice with a strong english accent answered “yes but i don’t know your voice” neither did i recognise the voice that was speaking to me besides my grandmother called me tu and not vous and then all was explained the young man for whom his grandmother had called on the telephone had a name almost identical with my own and was staying in an annex of my hotel this call coming on the very day on which i had been telephoning to my grandmother i had never for a moment doubted that it was she who was asking for me whereas it was by pure coincidence that the post office and the hotel had combined to make a twofold error

   the following morning i rose late and failed to catch saintloup who had already started for the country house where he was invited to luncheon about half past one i had decided to go in any case to the barracks so as to be there before he arrived when as i was crossing one of the avenues on the way there i noticed coming behind me in the same direction as myself a tilbury which as it overtook me obliged me to jump out of its way an nco was driving it wearing an eyeglass it was saintloup by his side was the friend whose guest he had been at luncheon and whom i had met once before at the hotel where we dined i did not dare shout to robert since he was not alone but in the hope that he would stop and pick me up i attracted his attention by a sweeping wave of my hat which might be regarded as due to the presence of a stranger i knew that robert was shortsighted still i should have supposed that provided he saw me at all he could not fail to recognise me he did indeed see my salute and returned it but without stopping driving on at full speed without a smile without moving a muscle of his face he confined himself to keeping his hand raised for a minute to the peak of his cap as though he were acknowledging the salute of a trooper whom he did not know personally i ran to the barracks but it was a long way when i arrived the regiment was parading on the square on which i was not allowed to stand and i was heartbroken at not having been able to say goodbye to saintloup i went up to his room but he had gone i was reduced to questioning a group of sick details recruits who had been excused routemarches the young graduate one of the ‘old soldiers’ who were watching the regiment parade

    “you haven’t seen serjeant saintloup have you by any chance” i asked

    “he’s gone on parade sir” said the old soldier

    “i never saw him” said the graduate

    “you never saw him” exclaimed the old soldier losing all interest in me “you never saw our famous saintloup the figure he’s cutting with his new breeches when the capstan sees that officer’s cloth my word”

    “oh you’re a wonder you are officer’s cloth” replied the young graduate who reported ‘sick in quarters’ was excused marching and tried not without some misgivings to be on easy terms with the veterans “this officer’s cloth you speak of is cloth like that is it”

    “sir” asked the old soldier angrily

   he was indignant that the young graduate should throw doubt on the breeches’ being made of officer’s cloth but being a breton coming from a village that went by the name of penguernstereden having learned french with as much difficulty as if it had been english or german whenever he felt himself overcome by emotion he would go on saying ‘sir’ to give himself time to find words then after this preparation let loose his eloquence confining himself to the repetition of certain words which he knew better than others but without haste taking every precaution to gloss over his unfamiliarity with the pronunciation

    “ah it is cloth like that” he broke out with a fury the intensity of which increased as the speed of his utterance diminished “ah it is cloth like that when i tell you that it is officer’s cloth whenitellyouathing ifitellyouathing it’s because i know i should think”

    “very well then” replied the young graduate overcome by the force of this argument “keep your hair on old boy”

    “there look there’s the capstan coming along no but just look at saintloup the way he throws his leg out and his head would you call that a noncom and his eyeglass oh he’s hot stuff he is”

   i asked these troopers who did not seem at all embarrassed by my presence whether i too might look out of the window they neither objected to my doing so nor moved to make room for me i saw captain de borodino go majestically by putting his horse into a trot and apparently under the illusion that he was taking part in the battle of austerlitz a few loiterers had stopped by the gate to see the regiment file out erect on his charger his face inclined to plumpness his cheeks of an imperial fulness his eye lucid the prince must have been the victim of some hallucination as i was myself whenever after the tramwaycar had passed the silence that followed its rumble seemed to me to throb and echo with a vaguely musical palpitation i was wretched at not having said goodbye to saintloup but i went nevertheless for my one anxiety was to return to my grandmother always until then in this little country town when i thought of what my grandmother must be doing by herself i had pictured her as she was when with me suppressing my own personality but without taking into account the effects of such a suppression now i had to free myself at the first possible moment in her arms from the phantom hitherto unsuspected and suddenly called into being by her voice of a grandmother really separated from me resigned having what i had never yet thought of her as having a definite age who had just received a letter from me in an empty house as i had once before imagined mamma in a house by herself when i had left her to go to balbec

   alas this phantom was just what i did see when entering the drawingroom before my grandmother had been told of my return i found her there reading i was in the room or rather i was not yet in the room since she was not aware of my presence and like a woman whom one surprises at a piece of work which she will lay aside if anyone comes in she had abandoned herself to a train of thoughts which she had never allowed to be visible by me of myself — thanks to that privilege which does not last but which one enjoys during the brief moment of return the faculty of being a spectator so to speak of one’s own absence — there was present only the witness the observer with a hat and travelling coat the stranger who does not belong to the house the photographer who has called to take a photograph of places which one will never see again the process that mechanically occurred in my eyes when i caught sight of my grandmother was indeed a photograph we never see the people who are dear to us save in the animated system the perpetual motion of our incessant love for them which before allowing the images that their faces present to reach us catches them in its vortex flings them back upon the idea that we have always had of them makes them adhere to it coincide with it how since into the forehead the cheeks of my grandmother i had been accustomed to read all the most delicate the most permanent qualities of her mind how since every casual glance is an act of necromancy each face that we love a mirror of the past how could i have failed to overlook what in her had become dulled and changed seeing that in the most trivial spectacles of our daily life our eye charged with thought neglects as would a classical tragedy every image that does not assist the action of the play and retains only those that may help to make its purpose intelligible but if in place of our eye it should be a purely material object a photographic plate that has watched the action then what we shall see in the courtyard of the institute for example will be instead of the dignified emergence of an academician who is going to hail a cab his staggering gait his precautions to avoid tumbling upon his back the parabola of his fall as though he were drunk or the ground frozen over so is it when some casual sport of chance prevents our intelligent and pious affection from coming forward in time to hide from our eyes what they ought never to behold when it is forestalled by our eyes and they arising first in the field and having it to themselves set to work mechanically like films and shew us in place of the loved friend who has long ago ceased to exist but whose death our affection has always hitherto kept concealed from us the new person whom a hundred times daily that affection has clothed with a dear and cheating likeness and as a sick man who for long has not looked at his own reflexion and has kept his memory of the face that he never sees refreshed from the ideal image of himself that he carries in his mind recoils on catching sight in the glass in the midst of an arid waste of cheek of the sloping red structure of a nose as huge as one of the pyramids of egypt i for whom my grandmother was still myself i who had never seen her save in my own soul always at the same place in the past through the transparent sheets of contiguous overlapping memories suddenly in our drawingroom which formed part of a new world that of time that in which dwell the strangers of whom we say “he’s begun to age a good deal” for the first time and for a moment only since she vanished at once i saw sitting on the sofa beneath the lamp redfaced heavy and common sick lost in thought following the lines of a book with eyes that seemed hardly sane a dejected old woman whom i did not know

   my request to be allowed to inspect the elstirs in mme de guermantes’s collection had been met by saintloup with “i will answer for her” and indeed as ill luck would have it it was he and he alone who did answer we answer readily enough for other people when setting our mental stage with the little puppets that represent them we manipulate these to suit our fancy no doubt even then we take into account the difficulties due to another person’s nature being different from our own and we do not fail to have recourse to some plan of action likely to influence that nature an appeal to his material interest persuasion the rousing of emotion which will neutralise contrary tendencies on his part but these differences from our own nature it is still our own nature that is imagining them these difficulties it is we that are raising them these compelling motives it is we that are applying them and so with the actions which before our mind’s eye we have made the other person rehearse and which make him act as we choose when we wish to see him perform them in real life the case is altered we come up against unseen resistances which may prove insuperable one of the strongest is doubtless that which may be developed in a woman who is not in love with him by the disgust inspired in her a fetid insurmountable loathing by the man who is in love with her during the long weeks in which saintloup still did not come to paris his aunt to whom i had no doubt of his having written begging her to do so never once asked me to call at her house to see the elstirs

   i perceived signs of coldness on the part of another occupant of the building this was jupien did he consider that i ought to have gone in and said how d’ye do to him on my return from doncières before even going upstairs to our own flat my mother said no that there was nothing unusual about it françoise had told her that he was like that subject to sudden fits of ill humour without any cause these invariably passed off after a little time

   meanwhile the winter was drawing to an end one morning after several weeks of showers and storms i heard in my chimney — instead of the wind formless elastic sombre which convulsed me with a longing to go to the sea — the cooing of the pigeons that were nesting in the wall outside shimmering unexpected like a first hyacinth gently tearing open its fostering heart that there might shoot forth purple and satinsoft its flower of sound letting in like an opened window into my bedroom still shuttered and dark the heat the dazzling brightness the fatigue of a first fine day that morning i was surprised to find myself humming a musichall tune which had never entered my head since the year in which i had been going to florence and venice so profoundly does the atmosphere as good days and bad recur act on our organism and draw from dim shelves where we had forgotten them the melodies written there which our memory rould not decipher presently a more conscious dreamer accompanied this musician to whom i was listening inside myself without having recognised at first what he was playing

   i quite realised that it was not for any reason peculiar to balbec that on my arrival there i had failed to find in its church the charm which it had had for me before i knew it that at florence or parma or venice my imagination could no more take the place of my eyes when i looked at the sights there i realised this similarly one new year’s afternoon as night fell standing before a column of playbills i had discovered the illusion that lies in our thinking that certain solemn holidays differ essentially from the other days in the calendar and yet i could not prevent my memory of the time during which i had looked forward to spending easter in florence from continuing to make that festival the atmosphere so to speak of the city of flowers to give at once to easter day something florentine and to florence something paschal easter was still a long way off but in the range of days that stretched out before me the days of holy week stood out more clearly at the end of those that merely came between touched by a farflung ray like certain houses in a village which one sees from a distance when the rest are in shadow they had caught and kept all the sun

   the weather had now become milder and my parents themselves by urging me to take more exercise gave me an excuse for resuming my morning walks i had meant to give them up since they meant my meeting mme de guermantes but it was for this very reason that i kept thinking all the time of those walks which led to my finding every moment a fresh reason for taking them a reason that had no connexion with mme de guermantes and no difficulty in convincing me that had she never existed i should still have taken a walk without fail at that hour every morning

   alas if to me meeting any person other than herself would not have mattered i felt that to her meeting anyone in the world except myself would have been endurable it happened that in the course of her morning walks she received the salutations of plenty of fools whom she regarded as such but the appearance of these in her path seemed to her if not to hold out any promise of pleasure to be at any rate the result of mere accident and she stopped them at times for there are moments in which one wants to escape from oneself to accept the hospitality offered by the soul of another person provided always that the other however modest and plain it may be is a different soul whereas in my heart she was exasperated to feel that what she would have found was herself and so even when i had for taking the same way as she another reason than my desire to see her i trembled like a guilty man as she came past and sometimes so as to neutralise anything extravagant that there might seem to have been in my overtures i would barely acknowledge her bow or would fasten my eyes on her face without raising my hat and succeed only in making her angrier than ever and begin to regard me as insolent and illbred besides

   she was now wearing lighter or at any rate brighter clothes and would come strolling down the street in which already as though it were spring in front of the narrow shops that were squeezed in between the huge fronts of the old aristocratic mansions over the booths of the butterwoman and the fruitwoman and the vegetablewoman awnings were spread to protect them from the sun i said to myself that the woman whom i could see far off walking opening her sunshade crossing the street was in the opinion of those best qualified to judge the greatest living exponent of the art of performing those movements and of making out of them something exquisitely lovely meanwhile she was advancing towards me unconscious of this widespread reputation her narrow stubborn body which had absorbed none of it was bent stiffly forward under a scarf of violet silk her clear sullen eyes looked absently in front of her and had perhaps caught sight of me she was biting her lip i saw her straighten her muff give alms to a beggar buy a bunch of violets from a flowerseller with the same curiosity that i should have felt in watching the strokes of a great painter’s brush and when as she reached me she gave me a bow that was accompanied sometimes by a faint smile it was as though she had sketched in colour for me adding a personal inscription to myself a drawing that was a masterpiece of art each of her gowns seemed to me her natural necessary surroundings like the projection around her of a particular aspect of her soul on one of these lenten mornings when she was on her way out to luncheon i met her wearing a gown of bright red velvet cut slightly open at the throat the face of mme de guermantes appeared to be dreaming beneath its pile of fair hair i was less sad than usual because the melancholy of her expression the sort of claustration which the startling hue of her gown set between her and the rest of the world made her seem somehow lonely and unhappy and this comforted me the gown struck me as being the materialisation round about her of the scarlet rays of a heart which i did not recognise as hers and might have been able perhaps to console sheltered in the mystical light of the garment with its gently flowing folds she made me think of some saint of the early ages of christianity after which i felt ashamed of afflicting with the sight of myself this holy martyr “but after all the streets are public”

   the streets are public i reminded myself giving a different meaning to the words and marvelling that indeed in the crowded thoroughfare often soaked with rain which made it beautiful and precious as a street sometimes is in the old towns of italy the duchesse de guermantes mingled with the public life of the world moments of her own secret life shewing herself thus to all and sundry jostled by every passerby with the splendid gratuitousness of the greatest works of art as i had been out in the morning after staying awake all night in the afternoon my parents would tell me to lie down for a little and try to sleep there is no need when one is trying to find sleep to give much thought to the quest but habit is very useful and even freedom from thought but in these afternoon hours both were lacking before going to sleep i devoted so much time to thinking that i should not be able to sleep that even after i was asleep a little of my thought remained it was no more than a glimmer in the almost total darkness but it was bright enough to cast a reflexion in my sleep first of the idea that i could not sleep and then a reflexion of this reflexion that it was in my sleep that i had had the idea that i was not asleep then by a further refraction my awakening    to a fresh doze in which i was trying to tell some friends who had come into my room that a moment earlier when i was asleep i had imagined that i was not asleep these shades were barely distinguishable it would have required a keen — and quite useless — delicacy of perception to seize them all similarly in later years at venice long after the sun had set when it seemed to be quite dark i have seen thanks to the echo itself imperceptible of a last note of light held indefinitely on the surface of the canals as though some optical pedal were being pressed the reflexion of the palaces unfurled as though for all time in a darker velvet on the crepuscular greyness of the water one of my dreams was the synthesis of what my imagination had often sought to depict in my waking hours of a certain seagirt place and its mediaeval past in my sleep i saw a gothic fortress rising from a sea whose waves were stilled as in a painted window an arm of the sea cut the town in two the green water stretched to my feet it bathed on the opposite shore the foundations of an oriental church and beyond it houses which existed already in the fourteenth century so that to go across to them would have been to ascend the stream of time this dream in which nature had learned from art in which the sea had turned gothic this dream in which i longed to attain in which i believed that i was attaining to the impossible it seemed to me that i had often dreamed it before but as it is the property of what we imagine in our sleep to multiply itself in the past and to appear even when novel familiar i supposed that i was mistaken i noticed however that i did frequently have this dream

   the limitations too that are common to all sleep were reflected in mine but in a symbolical manner i could not in the darkness make out the faces of the friends who were in the room for we sleep with our eyes shut i who could carry on endless arguments with myself while i dreamed as soon as i tried to speak to these friends felt the words stick in my throat for we do not speak distinctly in our sleep i wanted to go to them and i could not move my limbs for we do not walk when we are asleep either and suddenly i was ashamed to be seen by them for we sleep without our clothes so my eyes blinded my lips sealed my limbs fettered my body naked the figure of sleep which my sleep itself projected had the appearance of those great allegorical figures in one of which giotto has portrayed envy with a serpent in her mouth of which swann had given me photographs

   saintloup came to paris for a few hours only he came with assurances that he had had no opportunity of mentioning me to his aunt “she’s not being at all nice just now oriane isn’t” he explained with innocent selfbetrayal “she’s not my old oriane any longer they’ve gone and changed her i assure you it’s not worth while bothering your head about her you pay her far too great a compliment you wouldn’t care to meet my cousin poictiers” he went on without stopping to reflect that this could not possibly give me any pleasure “quite an intelligent young woman she is you’d like her she’s married to my cousin the duc de poictiers who is a good fellow but a bit slow for her i’ve told her about you she said i was to bring you to see her she’s much better looking than oriane and younger too really a nice person don’t you know really a good sort” these were expressions recently — and all the more ardently — taken up by robert which meant that the person in question had a delicate nature “i don’t go so far as to say she’s a dreyfusard you must remember the sort of people she lives among still she did say to me ‘if he is innocent how ghastly for him to be shut up on the devil’s isle’ you see what i mean don’t you and then she’s the sort of woman who does a tremendous lot for her old governesses she’s given orders that they’re never to be sent in by the servants’ stair when they come to the house she’s a very good sort i assure you the real reason why oriane doesn’t like her is that she feels she’s the cleverer of the two”

   although completely absorbed in the pity which she felt for one of the guermantes footmen — who had no chance of going to see his girl even when the duchess was out for it would immediately have been reported to her from the lodge — françoise was heartbroken at not having been in the house at the moment of saintloup’s visit but this was because now she herself paid visits also she never failed to go out on the days when i most wanted her it was always to see her brother her niece and more particularly her own daughter who had recently come to live in paris the intimate nature of these visits itself increased the irritation that i felt at being deprived of her services for i had a foreboding that she would speak of them as being among those duties from which there was no dispensation according to the laws laid down at saintandrédeschamps

   and so i never listened to her excuses without an ill humour which was highly unjust to her and was brought to a climax by the way françoise had of saying not “i have been to see my brother” or “i have been to see my niece” but “i have been to see the brother” “i just looked in as i passed to bid good day to the niece” or “to my niece the butcheress” as for her daughter françoise would have been glad to see her return to combray but this recent parisian making use like a woman of fashion of abbreviations though hers were of a vulgar kind protested that the week she was going shortly to spend at combray would seem quite long enough without so much as a sight of “the intran” she was still less willing to go to franchise’s sister who lived in a mountainous country for “mountains” said the daughter giving to the adjective a new and terrible meaning “aren’t really interesting” she could not make up her mind to go back to méséglise where “the people are so stupid” where in the market the gossips at their stalls would call cousins with her and say “why it’s never poor bazireau’s daughter” she would sooner die than go back and bury herself down there now that she had “tasted the life of paris” and françoise traditionalist as she was smiled complacently nevertheless at the spirit of innovation that was incarnate in this new parisian when she said “very well mother if you don’t get your day out you have only to send me a pneu”

   the weather had turned chilly again “go out what for to catch your death” said françoise who preferred to remain in the house during the week which her daughter and brother and the butcherniece had gone to spend at combray being moreover the last surviving adherent of the sect in whom persisted obscurely the doctrine of my aunt léonie — a natural philosopher — françoise would add speaking of this unseasonable weather “it is the remnant of the wrath of god” but i responded to her complaints only in a languid smile all the more indifferent to these predictions in that whatever befell it would be fine for me already i could see the morning sun shine on the slope of fiesole i warmed myself in its rays their strength obliged me to half open half shut my eyelids smiling the while and my eyelids like alabaster lamps were filled with a rosy glow it was not only the bells that came from italy italy had come with them my faithful hands would not lack flowers to honour the anniversary of the pilgrimage which i ought to have made long ago for since here in paris the weather had turned cold again as in another year at the time of our preparations for departure at the end of lent in the liquid freezing air which bathed the chestnuts and planes on the boulevards the tree in the courtyard of our house there were already opening their petals as in a bowl of pure water the narcissi the jonquils the anemones of the ponte vecchio

   my father had informed us that he now knew from his friend a j where m de norpois was going when he met him about the place

    “it’s to see mme de villeparisis they are great friends i never knew anything about it it seems she’s a delightful person a most superior woman you ought to go and call on her” he told me “another thing that surprised me very much he spoke to me of m de guermantes as quite a distinguished man i had always taken him for a boor it seems he knows an enormous amount and has perfect taste only he’s very proud of his name and his connexions but for that matter according to norpois he has a tremendous position not only here but all over europe it appears the austrian emperor and the tsar treat him just like one of themselves old norpois told me that mme de villeparisis had taken quite a fancy to you and that you would meet all sorts of interesting people in her house he paid a great tribute to you you will see him if you go there and he may have some good advice for you even if you are going to be a writer for you’re not likely to do anything else i can see that it might turn out quite a good career it’s not what i should have chosen for you myself but you’ll be a man in no time now we shan’t always be here to look after you and we mustn’t prevent you from following your vocation”

   if only i had been able to start writing but whatever the conditions in which i approached the task as too alas the undertakings not to touch alcohol to go to bed early to sleep to keep fit whether it were with enthusiasm with method with pleasure in depriving myself of a walk or postponing my walk and keeping it in reserve as a reward of industry taking advantage of an hour of good health utilising the inactivity forced on me by a day of illness what always emerged in the end from all my effort was a virgin page undefiled by any writing ineluctable as that forced card which in certain tricks one invariably is made to draw however carefully one may first have shuffled the pack i was merely the instrument of habits of not working of not going to bed of not sleeping which must find expression somehow cost what it might if i offered them no resistance if i contented myself with the pretext they seized from the first opportunity that the day afforded them of acting as they chose i escaped without serious injury i slept for a few hours after all towards morning i read a little i did not overexert myself but if i attempted to thwart them if i pretended to go to bed early to drink only water to work they grew restive they adopted strong measures they made me really ill i was obliged to double my dose of alcohol did not lie down in bed for two days and nights on end could not even read and i vowed that another time i would be more reasonable that is to say less wise like the victim of an assault who allows himself to be robbed for fear should he offer resistance of being murdered

   my father in the meantime had met m de guermantes once or twice and now that m de norpois had told him that the duke was a remarkable man had begun to pay more attention to what he said as it happened they met in the courtyard and discussed mme de villeparisis “he tells me she’s his aunt ‘viparisi’ he pronounces it he tells me too she’s an extraordinarily able woman in fact he said she kept a school of wit” my father announced to us impressed by the vagueness of this expression which he had indeed come across now and then in volumes of memoirs but without attaching to it any definite meaning my mother so great was her respect for him when she saw that he did not dismiss as of no importance the fact that mme de villeparisis kept a school of wit decided that this must be of some consequence albeit from my grandmother she had known all the time the exact amount of the marquise’s intellectual worth it was immediately enhanced in her eyes my grandmother who was not very well just then was not in favour at first of the suggested visit and afterwards lost interest in the matter since we had moved into our new flat mme de villeparisis had several times asked my grandmother to call upon her and invariably my grandmother had replied that she was not going out just at present in one of those letters which by a new habit of hers which we did not understand she no longer sealed herself but employed françoise to lick the envelopes for her as for myself without any very clear picture in my mind of this school of wit i should not have been greatly surprised to find the old lady from balbec installed behind a desk as for that matter i eventually did

   my father would have been glad to know into the bargain whether the ambassador’s support would be worth many votes to him at the institute for which he had thoughts of standing as an independent candidate to tell the truth while he did not venture to doubt that he would have m de norpois’s support he was by no means certain of it he had thought it merely malicious gossip when they assured him at the ministry that m de norpois wishing to be himself the only representative there of the institute would put every possible obstacle in the way of my father’s candidature which besides would be particularly awkward for him at that moment since he was supporting another candidate already and yet when m leroybeaulieu had first advised him to stand and had reckoned up his chances my father had been struck by the fact that among the colleagues upon whom he could count for support the eminent economist had not mentioned m de norpois he dared not ask the ambassador pointblank but hoped that i should return from my call on mme de villeparisis with his election as good as secured this call was now imminent that m de norpois would carry on propaganda calculated to assure my father the votes of at least two thirds of the academy seemed to him all the more probable since the ambassador’s willingness to oblige was proverbial those who liked him least admitting that no one else took such pleasure in being of service and besides at the ministry his protective influence was extended over my father far more markedly than over any other official

   my father had also another encounter about this time but one at which his extreme surprise ended in equal indignation in the street one day he ran into mme sazerat whose life in paris her comparative poverty restricted to occasional visits to a friend there was no one who bored my father quite so intensely as did mme sazerat so much so that mamma was obliged once a year to intercede with him in sweet and suppliant tones “my dear i really must invite mme sazerat to the house just once she won’t stay long” and even “listen dear i am going to ask you to make a great sacrifice do go and call upon mme sazerat you know i hate bothering you but it would be so nice of you” he would laugh raise various objections and go to pay the call and so for all that mme sazerat did not appeal to him on catching sight of her in the street my father went towards her hat in hand but to his profound astonishment mme sazerat confined her greeting to the frigid bow enforced by politeness towards a person who is guilty of some disgraceful action or has been condemned to live for the future in another hemisphere my father had come home speechless with rage next day my mother met mme sazerat in some one’s house she did not offer my mother her hand but only smiled at her with a vague and melancholy air as one smiles at a person with whom one used to play as a child but with whom one has since severed all one’s relations because she has led an abandoned life has married a convict or what is worse still a corespondent now from all time my parents had accorded to mme sazerat and inspired in her the most profound respect but and of this my mother was ignorant mme sazerat alone of her kind at combray was a dreyfusard my father a friend of m méline was convinced that dreyfus was guilty he had flatly refused to listen to some of his colleagues who had asked him to sign a petition demanding a fresh trial he never spoke to me for a week after learning that i had chosen to take a different line his opinions were well known he came near to being looked upon as a nationalist as for my grandmother in whom alone of the family a generous doubt was likely to be kindled whenever anyone spoke to her of the possible innocence of dreyfus she gave a shake of her head the meaning of which we did not at the time understand but which was like the gesture of a person who has been interrupted while thinking of more serious things my mother torn between her love for my father and her hope that i might turn out to have brains preserved an impartiality which she expressed by silence finally my grandfather who adored the army albeit his duties with the national guard had been the bugbear of his riper years could never at combray see a regiment go by the garden railings without baring his head as the colonel and the colours passed all this was quite enough to make mme sazerat who knew every incident of the disinterested and honourable careers of my father and grandfather regard them as pillars of injustice we pardon the crimes of individuals but not their participation in a collective crime as soon as she knew my father to be an antidreyfusard she set between him and herself continents and centuries which explains why across such an interval of time and space her bow had been imperceptible to my father and why it had not occurred to her to hold out her hand or to say a few words which would never have carried across the worlds that lay between

   saintloup who was coming anyhow to paris had promised to take me to mme de villeparisis’s where i hoped though i had not said so to him that we might meet mme de guermantes he invited me to luncheon in a restaurant with his mistress whom we were afterwards to accompany to a rehearsal we were to go out in the morning and call for her at her home on the outskirts of paris

   i had asked saintloup that the restaurant to which we went for luncheon in the lives of young noblemen with money to spend the restaurant plays as important a part as do bales of merchandise in arabian stories might if possible be that to which aimé had told me that he would be going as head waiter until the balbec season started it was a great attraction to me who dreamed of so many expeditions and made so few to see again some one who formed part not merely of my memories of balbec but of balbec itself who went there year after year who when ill health or my studies compelled me to stay in paris would be watching just the same through the long july afternoons while he waited for the guests to come in to dinner the sun creep down the sky and set in the sea through the glass panels of the great diningroom behind which at the hour when the light died the motionless wings of vessels smoky blue in the distance looked like exotic and nocturnal moths in a showcase himself magnetised by his contact with the strong lodestone of balbec this head waiter became in turn a magnet attracting me i hoped by talking to him to get at once into communication with balbec to have realised here in paris something of the delights of travel

   i left the house early with françoise complaining bitterly because the footman who was engaged to be married had once again been prevented the evening before from going to see his girl françoise had found him in tears he had been itching to go and strike the porter but had restrained himself for he valued his place

   before reaching saintloup’s where he was to be waiting for me at the door i ran into legrandin of whom we had lost sight since our combray days and who though now grown quite grey had preserved his air of youthful candour seeing me he stopped

    “ah so it’s you” he exclaimed “a man of fashion and in a frock coat too that is a livery in which my independent spirit would be ill at ease it is true that you are a man of the world i suppose and go out paying calls to go and dream as i do before some half ruined tomb my flowing tie and jacket are not out of place you know how i admire the charming quality of your soul that is why i tell you how deeply i regret that you should go forth and deny it among the gentiles by being capable of remaining for a moment in the nauseating atmosphere — which i am unable to breathe — of a drawingroom you pronounce on your own future the condemnation the damnation of the prophet i can see it all you frequent the ‘light hearts’ the houses of the great that is the vice of our middle class today ah those aristocrats the terror was greatly to blame for not cutting the heads off every one of them they are all sinister debauchees when they are not simply dreary idiots still my poor boy if that sort of thing amuses you while you are on your way to your teaparty your old friend will be more fortunate than you for alone in an outlying suburb he will be watching the pink moon rise in a violet sky the truth is that i scarcely belong to this earth upon which i feel myself such an exile it takes all the force of the law of gravity to hold me here to keep nie from escaping into another sphere i belong to a different planet goodbye do not take amiss the oldtime frankness of the peasant of the vivonne who has also remained a peasant of the danube to prove to you that i am your sincere wellwisher i am going to send you my last novel but you will not care for it it is not deliquescent enough not fin de siècle enough for you it is too frank too honest what you want is bergotte you have confessed it high game for the jaded palates of pleasureseeking epicures i suppose i am looked upon in your set as an old campaigner i do wrong to put my heart into what i write that is no longer done besides the life of the people is not distinguished enough to interest your little snobbicules go get you gone try to recall at times the words of christ ‘do this and ye shall live’ farewell friend”

   it was not with any particular resentment against legrandin that i parted from him certain memories are like friends in common they can bring about reconciliations set down amid fields starred with buttercups upon which were piled the ruins of feudal greatness the little wooden bridge still joined us legrandin and me as it joined the two banks of the vivonne

   after coming out of a paris in which although spring had begun the trees on the boulevards had hardly put on their first leaves it was a marvel to saintloup and myself when the circle train had set us down at the suburban village in which his mistress was living to see every cottage garden gay with huge festal altars of fruit trees in blossom it was like one of those peculiar poetical ephemeral local festivals which people travel long distances to attend on certain fixed occasions only this one was held by nature the bloom of the cherry tree is stuck so close to its branches like a white sheath that from a distance among the other trees that shewed as yet scarcely a flower or leaf one might have taken it on this day of sunshine that was still so cold for snow melted everywhere else which still clung to the bushes but the tall pear trees enveloped each house each modest courtyard in a whiteness more vast more uniform more dazzling as if all the dwellings all the enclosed spaces in the village were on their way to make on one solemn date their first communion

   it had been a country village and had kept its old mayor’s office sunburned and brown in front of which in the place of maypoles and streamers three tall pear trees were as though for some civic and local festival gallantly beflagged with white satin these villages in the environs of paris still have at their gates parks of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which were the ‘follies’ of the stewards and favourites of the great a fruitgrower had utilised one of these which was sunk below the road for his trees or had simply perhaps preserved the plan of an immense orchard of former days laid out in quincunxes these pear trees less crowded and not so far on as those that i had seen formed great quadrilaterals — separated by low walls — of snowy blossom on each side of which the light fell differently so that all these airy roofless chambers seemed to belong to a palace of the sun such as one might unearth in crete or somewhere and made one think also of the different ponds of a reservoir or of those parts of the sea which man for some fishery or to plant oysterbeds has subdivided when one saw varying with the orientation of the boughs the light fall and play upon their trained arms as upon water warm with spring and coax into unfolding here and there gleaming amid the open azurepanelled trellis of the branches the foaming whiteness of a creamy sunlit flower

   never had robert spoken to me so tenderly of his friend as he did during this walk she alone had taken root in his heart his future career in the army his position in society his family he was not of course indifferent altogether to these but they were of no account compared with the veriest trifle that concerned his mistress that alone had any importance in his eyes infinitely more importance than the guermantes and all the kings of the earth put together i do not know whether he had formulated the doctrine that she was of a superior quality to anyone else but i do know that he considered took trouble only about what affected her through her and for her he was capable of suffering of being happy perhaps of doing murder there was really nothing that interested that could excite him except what his mistress wished was going to do what was going on discernible at most in fleeting changes of expression in the narrow expanse of her face and behind her privileged brow so niceminded in all else he looked forward to the prospect of a brilliant marriage solely in order to be able to continue to maintain her to keep her always if one had asked oneself what was the value that he set on her i doubt whether one could ever have imagined a figure high enough if he did not marry her it was because a practical instinct warned him that as soon as she had nothing more to expect from him she would leave him or would at least live as she chose and that he must retain his hold on her by keeping her in suspense from day to day for he admitted the possibility that she did not love him no doubt the general affection called love must have forced him — as it forces all men — to believe at times that she did but in his heart of hearts he felt that this love which she felt for him did not exhaust the possibility of her remaining with him only on account of his money and that on the day when she had nothing more to expect from him she would make haste the dupe of her friends and their literary theories and loving him all the time really — he thought to leave him “if she is nice to me today” he confided to me “i am going to give her something that she’ll like it’s a necklace she saw at boucheron’s it’s rather too much for me just at present — thirty thousand francs but poor puss she gets so little pleasure out of life she will be jolly pleased with it i know she mentioned it to me and told me she knew somebody who would perhaps give it to her i don t believe that is true really but i wasn’t taking any risks so i’ve arranged with boucheron who is our family jeweller to keep it for me i am glad to think that you’re going to meet her she’s nothing so very wonderful to look at you know” i could see that he thought just the opposite and had said this only so as to make me when i did see her admire her all the more “what she has got is a marvellous judgment she’ll perhaps be afraid to talk much before you but by jove the things she’ll say to me about you afterwards you know she says things one can go on thinking about for hours there’s really something about her that’s quite pythian”

   on our way to her house we passed by a row of little gardens and i was obliged to stop for they were all aflower with pear and cherry blossoms as empty no doubt and lifeless only yesterday as a house that no tenant has taken they were suddenly peopled and adorned by these newcomers arrived during the night whose lovely white garments we could see through the railings along the garden paths

    “listen i can see you’d rather stop and look at that stuff and grow poetical about it” said robert “so just wait for me here will you my friend’s house is quite close i will go and fetch her”

   while i waited i strolled up and down the road past these modest gardens if i raised my head i could see now and then girls sitting in the windows but outside in the open air and at the height of a halflanding here and there light and pliant in their fresh pink gowns hanging among the leaves young lilacclusters were letting themselves be swung by the breeze without heeding the passerby who was turning his eyes towards their green mansions i recognised in them the platoons in violet uniform posted at the entrance to m swann’s park past the little white fence in the warm afternoons of spring like an enchanting rustic tapestry i took a path which led me into a meadow a cold wind blew keenly along it as at combray but from the midst of the rich moist country soil which might have been on the bank of the vivonne there had nevertheless arisen punctual at the trysting place like all its band of brothers a great white pear tree which waved smilingly in the sun’s face like a curtain of light materialised and made palpable its flowers shaken by the breeze but polished and frosted with silver by the sun’s rays

   suddenly saintloup appeared accompanied by his mistress and then in this woman who was for him all the love every possible delight in life whose personality mysteriously enshrined in a body as in a tabernacle was the object that still occupied incessantly the toiling imagination of my friend whom he felt that he would never really know as to whom he was perpetually asking himself what could be her secret self behind the veil of eyes and flesh in this woman i recognised at once ‘rachel when from the lord’ her who but a few years since — women change their position so rapidly in that world when they do change — used to say to the procuress “tomorrow evening then if you want me for anyone you will send round won’t you”

   and when they had ‘come round’ for her and she found herself alone in the room with the ‘anyone’ she had known so well what was required of her that after locking the door as a prudent woman’s precaution or a ritual gesture she would begin to take off all her things as one does before the doctor who is going to sound one’s chest never stopping in the process unless the ‘some one’ not caring for nudity told her that she might keep on her shift as specialists do sometimes who having an extremely fine ear and being afraid of their patient’s catching a chill are satisfied with listening to his breathing and the beating of his heart through his shirt on this woman whose whole life all her thoughts all her past all the men who at one time or another had had her were to me so utterly unimportant that if she had begun to tell me about them i should have listened to her only out of politeness and should barely have heard what she said i felt that the anxiety the torment the love of saintloup had been concentrated in such a way as to make — out of what was for me a mechanical toy nothing more — the cause of endless suffering the very object and reward of existence seeing these two elements separately because i had known ‘rachel when from the lord’ in a house of ill fame i realised that many women for the sake of whom men live suffer take their lives may be in themselves or for other people what rachel was for me the idea that any one could be tormented by curiosity with regard to her life stupefied me i could have told robert of any number of her unchastities which seemed to me the most uninteresting things in the world and how they would have pained him and what had he not given to learn them without avail

   i realised also then all that the human imagination can put behind a little scrap of face such as this girl’s face was if it is the imagination that was the first to know it and conversely into what wretched elements crudely material and utterly without value might be decomposed what had been the inspiration of countless dreams if on the contrary it should be so to speak controverted by the slightest actual acquaintance i saw that what had appeared to me to be not worth twenty francs when it had been offered to me for twenty francs in the house of ill fame where it was then for me simply a woman desirous of earning twenty francs might be worth more than a million more than one’s family more than all the most coveted positions in life if one had begun by imagining her to embody a strange creature interesting to know difficult to seize and to hold no doubt it was the same thin and narrow face that we saw robert and i but we had arrived at it by two opposite ways between which there was no communication and we should never both see it from the same side that face with its stares its smiles the movements of its lips i had known from outside as being simply that of a woman of the sort who for twenty francs would do anything that i asked and so her stares her smiles the movements of her lips had seemed to me significant merely of the general actions of a class without any distinctive quality and beneath them i should not have had the curiosity to look for a person but what to me had in a sense been offered at the start that consenting face had been for robert an ultimate goal towards which he had made his way through endless hopes and doubts suspicions dreams he gave more than a million francs in order to have for himself in order that there might not be offered to others what had been offered to me as to all and sundry for a score that he too should not have enjoyed it at the lower price may have been due to the chance of a moment the instant in which she who seemed ready to yield herself makes off having perhaps an assignation elsewhere some reason which makes her more difficult of access that day should the man be a sentimentalist then even if she has not observed it but infinitely more if she has the direst game begins unable to swallow his disappointment to make himself forget about the woman he starts afresh in pursuit she flies him until a mere smile for which he no longer ventured to hope is bought at a thousand times what should have been the price of the last the most intimate favours it happens even at times in such a case when one has been led by a mixture of simplicity in one’s judgment and cowardice in the face of suffering to commit the crowning folly of making an inaccessible idol of a girl that these last favours or even the first kiss one is fated never to obtain one no longer even ventures to ask for them for fear of destroying one’s chances of platonic love and it is then a bitter anguish to leave the world without having ever known what were the embraces of the woman one has most passionately loved as for rachel’s favours however saintloup had by mere accident succeeded in winning them all certainly if he had now learned that they had been offered to all the world for a louis he would have suffered of course acutely but would still have given a million francs for the right to keep them for nothing that he might have learned could have made him emerge — since that is beyond human control and can be brought to pass only in spite of it by the action of some great natural law — from the path he was treading from which that face could appear to him only through the web of the dreams that he had already spun the immobility of that thin face like that of a sheet of paper subjected to the colossal pressure of two atmospheres seemed to me to be being maintained by two infinities which abutted on her without meeting for she held them apart and indeed when robert and i were both looking at her we did not both see her from the same side of the mystery

   it was not ‘rachel when from the lord’— who seemed to me a small matter — it was the power of the human imagination the illusion on which were based the pains of love these i felt to be vast robert noticed that i appeared moved i turned my eyes to the pear and cherry trees of the garden opposite so that he might think that it was their beauty that had touched me and it did touch me in somewhat the same way it also brought close to me things of the kind which we not only see with our eyes but feel also in our hearts these trees that i had seen in the garden likening them in my mind to strange deities had not my mistake been like the magdalene’s when in another garden she saw a human form and ‘thought it was the gardener’ treasurers of our memories of the age of gold keepers of the promise that reality is not what we suppose that the splendour of poetry the wonderful radiance of innocence may shine in it and may be the recompense which we strive to earn these great white creatures bowed in a marvellous fashion above the shade propitious for rest for angling or for reading were they not rather angels i exchanged a few words with saintloup’s mistress we cut across the village its houses were sordid but by each of the most wretched of those that looked as though they had been scorched and branded by a rain of brimstone a mysterious traveller halting for a day in the accursed city a resplendent angel stood erect extending broadly over it the dazzling protection of the wings of flowering innocence it was a pear tree saintloup drew me a little way in front to explain

    “i should have liked it if you and i could have been alone together in fact i would much rather have had luncheon just with you and stayed with you until it was time to go to my aunt’s but this poor girl of mine here it is such a pleasure to her and she is so decent to me don’t you know i hadn’t the heart to refuse her you’ll like her however she’s literary you know a most sensitive nature and besides it’s such a pleasure to be with her in a restaurant she is so charming so simple always delighted with every thing”

   i fancy nevertheless that on this same morning and then probably for the first and last time robert did detach himself for a moment from the woman whom out of successive layers of affection he had gradually created and beheld suddenly at some distance from himself another rachel outwardly the double of his but entirely different who was nothing more or less than a little light of love we had left the blossoming orchard and were making for the train which was to take us to paris when at the station rachel who was walking by herself was recognised and accosted by a pair of common little ‘tarts’ like herself who first of all thinking that she was alone called out “hello rachel you come with us lucienne and germaine are in the train and there’s room for one more come on we’re all going to the rink” and were just going to introduce to her two counterjumpers their lovers who were escorting them when noticing that she seemed a little uneasy they looked up and beyond her caught sight of us and with apologies bade her a goodbye to which she responded in a somewhat embarrassed but still friendly tone they were two poor little ‘tarts’ with collars of sham otter skin looking more or less as rachel must have looked when saintloup first met her he did not know them or their names even and seeing that they appeared to be extremely intimate with his mistress he could not help wondering whether she too might not once have had had not still perhaps her place in a life of which he had never dreamed utterly different from the life she led with him a life in which one had women for a louis apiece whereas he was giving more than a hundred thousand francs a year to rachel he caught only a fleeting glimpse of that life but saw also in the thick of it a rachel other than her whom he knew a rachel like the two little ‘tarts’ in the train a twentyfranc rachel in short rachel had for the moment duplicated herself in his eyes he had seen at some distance from his own rachel the little ‘tart’ rachel the real rachel assuming that rachel the ‘tart’ was more real than the other it may then have occurred to robert that from the hell in which he was living with the prospect of a rich marriage of the sale of his name to enable him to go on giving rachel a hundred thousand francs every year he might easily perhaps have escaped and have enjoyed the favours of his mistress as the two counterjumpers enjoyed those of their girls for next to nothing but how was it to be done she had done nothing to forfeit his regard less generously rewarded she would be less kind to him would stop saying and writing the things that so deeply moved him things which he would quote with a touch of ostentation to his friends taking care to point out how nice it was of her to say them but omitting to mention that he was maintaining her in the most lavish fashion or even that he ever gave her anything at all that these inscriptions on photographs or greetings at the end of telegrams were but the conversion into the most exiguous the most precious of currencies of a hundred thousand francs if he took care not to admit that these rare kindnesses on rachel’s part were handsomely paid for by himself it would be wrong to say — and yet by a crude piece of reasoning we do say it absurdly of every lover who pays in cash for his pleasure and of a great many husbands — that this was from selfesteem or vanity saintloup had enough sense to perceive that all the pleasures which appeal to vanity he could have found easily and without cost to himself in society on the strength of his historic name and handsome face and that his connexion with rachel had rather if anything tended to ostracise him led to his being less sought after no this selfesteem which seeks to appear to be receiving gratuitously the outward signs of the affection of her whom one loves is simply a consequence of love the need to figure in one’s own eyes and in other people’s as loved in return by the person whom one loves so well rachel rejoined us leaving the two ‘tarts’ to get into their compartment but no less than their sham otter skins and the selfconscious appearance of their young men the names lucienne and germaine kept the new rachel alive for a moment longer for a moment robert imagined a place pigalle existence with unknown associates sordid love affairs afternoons spent in simple amusements excursions or pleasureparties in that paris in which the sunny brightness of the streets from the boulevard de clichy onwards did not seem the same as the solar radiance in which he himself strolled with his mistress but must be something different for love and suffering which is one with love have like intoxication the power to alter for us inanimate things it was almost an unknown paris in the heart of paris itself that he suspected his connexion appeared to him like the exploration of a strange form of life for if when with him rachel was somewhat similar to himself it was nevertheless a part of her real life that she lived with him indeed the most precious part in view of his reckless expenditure on her the part that made her so greatly envied by her friends and would enable her one day to retire to the country or to establish herself in the leading theatres when she had made her pile robert longed to ask her who lucienne and germaine were what they would have said to her if she had joined them in their compartment how they would all have spent a day which would have perhaps ended as a supreme diversion after the pleasures of the rink at the olympia tavern if robert and i had not been there for a moment the purlieus of the olympia which until then had seemed to him merely deadly dull aroused curiosity in him and pain and the sunshine of this spring day beating upon the rue caumartin where possibly if she had not known robert rachel might have gone in the course of the evening and nave earned a louis filled him with a vague longing but what use was it to ply rachel with questions when he already knew that her answer would be merely silence or a lie or something extremely painful for him to hear which would yet explain nothing the porters were shutting the doors we jumped into a firstclass carriage rachel’s magnificent pearls reminded robert that she was a woman of great price he caressed her restored her to her place in his heart where he could contemplate her internalised as he had always done hitherto — save during this brief instant in which he had seen her in the place pigalle of an impressionist painter — and the train began to move

   it was by the way quite true that she was ‘literary’ she never stopped talking to me about books new art and tolstoyism except to rebuke saintloup for drinking so much wine

    “ah if you could live with me for a year we’d see a fine change i should keep you on water and you’d be ever so much better”

    “right you are let’s begin now”

    “but you know quite well i have to work all day” for she took her art very seriously “besides what would your people say”

   and she began to abuse his family to me in terms which for that matter seemed to me highly reasonable and with which saintloup while disobeying her orders in the matter of champagne entirely concurred i who was so much afraid of the effect of wine on him and felt the good influence of his mistress was quite prepared to advise him to let his family go hang tears sprang to the young woman’s eyes i had been rash enough to refer to dreyfus

    “the poor martyr” she almost sobbed “it will be the death of him in that dreadful place”

    “don’t upset yourself zézette he will come back he will be acquitted all right they will admit they’ve made a mistake”

    “but long before then he’ll be dead oh well at any rate his children will bear a stainless name but just think of the agony he must be going through that’s what makes my heart bleed and would you believe that robert’s mother a pious woman says that he ought to be left on the devil’s isle even if he is innocent isn’t it appalling”

    “yes it’s absolutely true she does say that” robert assured me “she’s my mother i’ve no fault to find with her but it’s quite clear she hasn’t got a sensitive nature like zézette”

   as a matter of fact these luncheons which were said to be ‘such a pleasure’ always ended in trouble for as soon as saintloup found himself in a public place with his mistress he would imagine that she was looking at every other man in the room and his brow would darken she would remark his illhumour which she may have thought it amusing to encourage or as was more probable by a foolish piece of conceit preferred feeling wounded by his tone not to appear to be seeking to disarm and would make a show of being unable to take her eyes off some man or other not that this was always a mere pretence in fact the gentleman who in theatre or café happened to sit next to them or to go no farther the driver of the cab they had engaged need only have something attractive about him no matter what and robert his perception quickened by jealousy would have noticed it before his mistress he would see in him immediately one of those foul creatures whom he had denounced to me at balbec who corrupted and dishonoured women for their own amusement would beg his mistress to take her eyes off the man thereby drawing her attention to him and sometimes she found that robert had shewn such good judgment in his suspicion that after a little she even left off teasing him in order that he might calm down and consent to go off by himself on some errand which would give her time to begin conversation with the stranger often to make an assignation sometimes even to bring matters quickly to a head i could see as soon as we entered the restaurant that robert was looking troubled the fact of the matter was that he had at once remarked what had escaped our notice at balbec namely that standing among his coarser colleagues aimé with a modest brilliance emitted quite unconsciously of course that air of romance which emanates until a certain period in life from fine hair and a grecian nose features thanks to which he was distinguishable among the crowd of waiters the others almost all of them well on in years presented a series of types extraordinarily ugly and criminal of hypocritical priests sanctimonious confessors more numerously of comic actors of the old school whose sugarloaf foreheads are scarcely to be seen nowadays outside the collections of portraits that hang in the humbly historic greenrooms of little out of date theatres where they are represented in the parts of servants or high priests though this restaurant seemed thanks to a selective method of recruiting and perhaps to some system of hereditary nomination to have preserved their solemn type in a sort of college of augurs as ill luck would have it aimé having recognised us it was he who came to take our order while the procession of operatic high priests swept past us to other tables aimé inquired after my grandmother’s health i asked for news of his wife and children he gave it with emotion being a family man he had an intelligent vigorous but respectful air robert’s mistress began to gaze at him with a strange attentiveness but aimé‘s sunken eyes in which a slight shortsightedness gave one the impression of veiled depths shewed no sign of consciousness in his still face in the provincial hotel in which he had served for many years before coming to balbec the charming sketch now a trifle discoloured and faded which was his face and which for all those years like some engraved portrait of prince eugène had been visible always at the same place at the far end of a diningroom that was almost always empty could not have attracted any very curious gaze he had thus for long remained doubtless for want of sympathetic admirers in ignorance of the artistic value of his face and but little inclined for that matter to draw attention to it for he was temperamentally cold at the most some passing parisian stopping for some reason in the town had raised her eyes to his had asked him perhaps to bring something to her in her room before she left for the station and in the pellucid monotonous deep void of this existence of a faithful husband and servant in a country town had hidden the secret of a caprice without sequel which no one would ever bring to light and yet aimé must have been conscious of the insistent emphasis with which the eyes of the young actress were fastened upon him now anyhow it did not escape robert beneath whose skin i saw gathering a flush not vivid like that which burned his cheeks when he felt any sudden emotion but faint diffused

    “anything specially interesting about that waiter zézette” he inquired after sharply dismissing aimé “one would think you were studying the part”

    “there you are beginning again i knew it was coming”

    “beginning what again my dear girl i may have been mistaken i haven’t said anything i’m sure but i have at least the right to warn you against the fellow seeing that i knew him at balbec otherwise i shouldn’t give a damn and a bigger scoundrel doesn’t walk the face of the earth”

   she seemed anxious to pacify robert and began to engage me in a literary conversation in which he joined i found that it did not bore me to talk to her for she had a thorough knowledge of the books that i most admired and her opinion of them agreed more or less with my own but as i had heard mme de villeparisis declare that she had no talent i attached but little importance to this evidence of culture she discoursed wittily on all manner of topics and would have been genuinely entertaining had she not affected to an irritating extent the jargon of the sets and studios she applied this moreover to everything under the sun for instance having acquired the habit of saying of a picture if it were impressionist or an opera if wagnerian “ah that is good” one day when a young man had kissed her on the ear and touched by her pretence of being thrilled had affected modesty she said “yes as a sensation i call it distinctly good” but what more surprised me was that the expressions peculiar to robert which moreover had come to him perhaps from literary men whom she knew were used by her to him and by him to her as though they had been a necessary form of speech and without any conception of the pointlessness of an originality that is universal

   in eating she managed her hands so clumsily that one assumed that she must appear extremely awkward upon the stage she recovered her dexterity only when making love with that touching prescience latent in women who love the male body so intensely that they immediately guess what will give most pleasure to that body which is yet so different from their own

   i ceased to take part in the conversation when it turned upon the theatre for on that topic rachel was too malicious for my liking she did it was true take up in a tone of commiseration — against saintloup which proved that he was accustomed to hearing rachel attack her — the defence of berma saying “oh no she’s a wonderful person really of course the things she does no longer appeal to us they don’t correspond quite to what we are looking for but one must think of her at the period to which she belongs we owe her a great deal she has done good work you know and besides she’s such a fine woman she has such a good heart naturally she doesn’t care about the things that interest us but she has had in her time with a rather impressive face a charming quality of mind” our ringers by the way do not play the same accompaniment to all our aesthetic judgments if it is a picture that is under discussion to shew that it is a fine work with plenty of paint it is enough to stick out one’s thumb but the ‘charming quality of mind’ is more exacting it requires two fingers or rather two fingernails as though one were trying to flick off a particle of dust but with this single exception saintloup’s mistress referred to the bestknown actresses in a tone of ironical superiority which annoyed me because i believed — quite mistakenly as it happened — that it was she who was inferior to them she was clearly aware that i must regard her as an indifferent actress and on the other hand have a great regard for those she despised but she shewed no resentment because there is in all great talent while it is still as hers was then unrecognised however sure it may be of itself a vein of humility and because we make the consideration that we expect from others proportionate not to our latent powers but to the position to which we have attained i was an hour or so later at the theatre to see saintloup’s mistress shew great deference towards those very artists against whom she was now bringing so harsh a judgment to bear and so in however little doubt my silence may have left her she insisted nevertheless on our dining together that evening assuring me that never had anyone’s conversation delighted her so much as mine if we were not yet in the theatre to which we were to go after luncheon we had the sense of being in a greenroom hung with portraits of old members of the company so markedly were the waiters’ faces those which one thought had perished with a whole generation of obscure actors of the palaisroyal they had a look also of academicians stopping before a side table one of them was examining a dish of pears with the expression of detached curiosity that m de jussieu might have worn others on either side of him were casting about the room that gaze instinct with curiosity and coldness which members of the institute who have arrived early throw at the public while they exchange a few murmured words which one fails to catch they were faces well known to all the regular guests one of them however was being pointed out a newcomer with distended nostrils and a smug upper lip who looked like a cleric he was entering upon his duties there for the first time and everyone gazed with interest at this newly elected candidate but presently perhaps to drive robert away so that she might be alone with aimé rachel began to make eyes at a young student who was feeding with another man at a neighbouring table

    “zézette let me beg you not to look at that young man like that” said saintloup on whose face the hesitating flush of a moment ago had been gathered now into a scarlet tide which dilated and darkened his swollen features “if you must make a scene here i shall simply finish eating by myself and join you at the theatre afterwards”

   at this point a messenger came up to tell aimé that he was wanted to speak to a gentleman in a carriage outside saintloup ever uneasy and afraid now that it might be some message of an amorous nature that was to be conveyed to his mistress looked out of the window and saw there sitting up in his brougham his hands tightly buttoned in white gloves with black seams a flower in his buttonhole m de charlus

    “there you see” he said to me in a low voice “my family hunt me down even here will you please — i can’t very well do it myself but you can as you know the head waiter so well and he’s certain to give us away — ask him not to go to the carriage he can ahvays send some other waiter who doesn’t know me i know my uncle if they tell him that i’m not known here he’ll never come inside to look for me he loathes this sort of place really it’s pretty disgusting that an old petticoatchaser like him who is still at it too should be perpetually lecturing me and coming to spy on me”

   aimé on receiving my instructions sent one of his underlings to explain that he was busy and could not come out at the moment and should the gentleman ask for the marquis de saintloup that they did not know any such person but saintloup’s mistress who had failed to catch our whispered conversation and thought that it was still about the young man at whom robert had been finding fault with her for making eyes broke out in a torrent of rage

    “oh indeed so it’s the young man over there now is it thank you for telling me it’s a real pleasure to have this sort of thing with one’s meals don’t listen to him please he’s rather cross today and you know” she went on turning to me “he just says it because he thinks it smart that it’s the gentlemanly thing to appear jealous always”

   and she began with feet and fingers to shew signs of nervous irritation

    “but zézette it is i who find it unpleasant you are making us all ridiculous before that gentleman who will begin to imagine you’re making overtures to him and an impossible bounder he looks too”

    “oh no i think he’s charming for one thing he’s got the most adorable eyes and a way of looking at women — you can feel he must love them”

    “you can at least keep quiet until i’ve left the room if you have lost your senses” cried robert “waiter my things”

   i did not know whether i was expected to follow him

    “no i want to be alone” he told me in the same tone in which he had just been addressing his mistress and as if he were quite furious with me his anger was like a single musical phrase to which in an opera several lines are sung which are entirely different from one another if one studies the words in meaning and character but which the music assimilates by a common sentiment when robert had gone his mistress called aimé and asked him various questions she then wanted to know what i thought of him

    “an amusing expression hasn’t he do you know what i should like it would be to know what he really thinks about things to have him wait on me often to take him travelling but that would be all if we were expected to love all the people who attract us life would be pretty ghastly wouldn’t it it’s silly of robert to get ideas like that all that sort of thing it’s only just what comes into my head that’s all robert has nothing to worry about” she was still gazing at aimé “do look what dark eyes he has i should love to know what there is behind them”

   presently came a message that robert was waiting for her in a private room to which he had gone to finish his luncheon by another door without having to pass through the restaurant again i thus found myself alone until i too was summoned by robert i found his mistress stretched out on a sofa laughing under the kisses and caresses that he was showering on her they were drinking champagne “hallo you” she cried to him having recently picked up this formula which seemed to her the last word in playfulness and wit i had fed badly i was extremely uncomfortable and albeit legrandin’s words had had no effect on me i was sorry to think that i was beginning in a back room of a restaurant and should be finishing in the wings of a theatre this first afternoon of spring looking first at the time to see that she was not making herself late she offered me a glass of champagne handed me one of her turkish cigarettes and unpinned a rose for me from her bodice whereupon i said to myself “i have nothing much to regret after all these hours spent in this young woman’s company are not wasted since i have had from her charming gifts which could not be bought too dear a rose a scented cigarette and a glass of champagne” i told myself this because i felt that it endowed with an aesthetic character and thereby justified saved these hours of boredom i ought perhaps to have reflected that the very need which i felt of a reason that would console me for my boredom was sufficient to prove that i was experiencing no aesthetic sensation as for robert and his mistress they appeared to have no recollection of the quarrel which had been raging between them a few minutes earlier or of my having been a witness to it they made no allusion to it sought no excuse for it any more than for the contrast with it which their present conduct formed by dint of drinking champagne with them i began to feel a little of the intoxication that used to come over me at rivebelle though probably not quite the same not only every kind of intoxication from that which the sun or travelling gives us to that which we get from exhaustion or wine but every degree of intoxication — and each must have a different figure like the numbers of fathoms on a chart — lays bare in us exactly at the depth to which it reaches a different kind of man the room which saintloup had taken was small but the mirror which was its sole ornament was of such a kind that it seemed to reflect thirty others in an endless vista and the electric bulb placed at the top of the frame must at night when the light was on followed by the procession of thirty flashes similar to its own give to the drinker even when alone the idea that the surrounding space was multiplying itself simultaneously with his sensations heightened by intoxication and that shut up by himself in this little cell he was reigning nevertheless over something far more extensive in its indefinite luminous curve than a passage in the jardin de paris being then myself at this moment the said drinker suddenly looking for him in the glass i caught sight of him hideous a stranger who was staring at me the joy of intoxication was stronger than my disgust from gaiety or bravado i smiled at him and simultaneously ne smiled back at me and i felt myself so much under the ephemeral and potent sway of the minute in which our sensations are so strong that i am not sure whether my sole regret was not at the thought that this hideous self of whom i had just caught sight in the glass was perhaps there for the last time on earth and that i should never meet the stranger again in the whole course of my life

   robert was annoyed only because i was not being more brilliant before his mistress

    “what about that fellow you met this morning who combines snobbery with astronomy tell her about him i’ve forgotten the story” and he watched her furtively

    “but my dear boy there’s nothing more than what you’ve just said”

    “what a bore you are then tell her about françoise in the champselysées she’ll enjoy that”

    “oh do bobby is always talking about françoise” and taking saintloup by the chin she repeated for want of anything more original drawing the said chin nearer to the light “hallo you”

   since actors had ceased to be for me exclusively the depositaries in their diction and playing of an artistic truth they had begun to interest me in themselves i amused myself pretending that what i saw before me were the characters in some old humorous novel by watching struck by the fresh face of the young man who had just come into the stalls the heroine listen distractedly to the declaration of love which the juvenile lead in the piece was addressing to her while he through the fiery torrent of his impassioned speech still kept a burning gaze fixed on an old lady seated in a stage box whose magnificent pearls had caught his eye and thus thanks especially to the information that saintloup gave me as to the private lives of the players i saw another drama mute but expressive enacted beneath the words of the spoken drama which in itself although of no merit interested me also for i could feel in it that there were budding and opening for an hour in the glare of the footlights created out of the agglutination on the face of an actor of another face of grease paint and pasteboard on his own human soul the words of a part

   these ephemeral vivid personalities which the characters are in a play that is entertaining also whom one loves admires pities whom one would like to see again after one has left the theatre but who by that time are already disintegrated into a comedian who is no longer in the position which he occupied in the play a text which no longer shews one the comedian’s face a coloured powder which a handkerchief wipes off who have returned in short to elements that contain nothing of them since their dissolution effected so soon after the end of the show make us — like the dissolution of a dear friend — begin to doubt the reality of our ego and meditate on the mystery of death

   one number in the programme i found extremely trying a young woman whom rachel and some of her friends disliked was with a set of old songs to make a first appearance on which she had based all her hopes for the future of herself and her family this young woman was blessed with unduly almost grotesquely prominent hips and a pretty but too slight voice weakened still farther by her excitement and in marked contrast to her muscular development rachel had posted among the audience a certain number of friends male and female whose business it was by their sarcastic comments to put the novice who was known to be timid out of countenance to make her lose her head so that her turn should prove a complete failure after which the manager would refuse to give her a contract at the first notes uttered by the wretched woman several of the male audience recruited for that purpose began pointing to her backward profile with jocular comments several of the women also in the plot laughed out loud each flutelike note from the stage increased the deliberate hilarity which grew to a public scandal the unhappy woman sweating with anguish through her greasepaint tried for a little longer to hold out then stopped and looked round the audience with an appealing gaze of misery and anger which succeeded only in increasing the uproar the instinct to imitate others the desire to shew their own wit and daring added to the party several pretty actresses who had not been forewarned but now threw at the others glances charged with malicious connivance and sat convulsed with laughter which rang out in such violent peals that at the end of the second song although there were still five more on the programme the stage manager rang down the curtain i tried to make myself pay no more heed to the incident than i had paid to my grandmother’s sufferings when my greataunt to tease her used to give my grandfather brandy the idea of deliberate wickedness being too painful for me to bear and yet just as our pity for misfortune is perhaps not very exact since in our imagination we recreate a whole world of grief by which the unfortunate who has to struggle against it has no time to think of being moved to selfpity so wickedness has probably not in the mind of the wicked man that pure and voluptuous cruelty which it so pains us to imagine hatred inspires him anger gives him an ardour an activity in which there is no great joy he must be a sadist to extract any pleasure from it ordinarily the wicked man supposes himself to be punishing the wickedness of his victim rachel imagined certainly that the actress whom she was making suffer was far from being of interest to any one and that anyhow in having her hissed off the stage she was herself avenging an outrage on good taste and teaching an unworthy comrade a lesson nevertheless i preferred not to speak of this incident since i had had neither the courage nor the power to prevent it and it would have been too painful for me by saying any good of their victim to approximate to a gratification of the lust for cruelty the sentiments which animated the tormentors who had strangled this career in its infancy

   but the opening scene of this afternoon’s performance interested me in quite another way it made me realise in part the nature of the illusion of which saintloup was a victim with regard to rachel and which had set a gulf between the images that he and i respectively had in mind of his mistress when we beheld her that morning among the blossoming pear trees rachel was playing a part which involved barely more than her walking on in the little play but seen thus she was another woman she had one of those faces to which distance — and not necessarily that between stalls and stage the world being in this respect only a larger theatre — gives form and outline and which seen close at hand dissolve back into dust standing beside her one saw only a nebula a milky way of freckles of tiny spots nothing more at a proper distance all this ceased to be visible and from cheeks that withdrew were reabsorbed into her face rose like a crescent moon a nose so fine so pure that one would have liked to be object of rachel’s attention to see her again as often as one chose to her close to one provided that one had not already seen her differently and at close range this was not my case but it had been saintloup’s when he first saw her on the stage then he had asked himself how he might approach her how come to know her there had opened in him a whole fairy realm — that in which she lived — from which emanated an exquisite radiance but into which he might not penetrate he had left the theatre telling himself that it would be madness to write to her that she would not answer his letter quite prepared to give his fortune and his name for the creature who was living in him in a world so vastly superior to those too familiar realities a world made beautiful by desire and dreams of happiness when at the back of the theatre a little old building which had itself the air of being a piece of scenery from the stage door he saw debouch the gay and daintily hatted band of actresses who had just been playing young men who knew them were waiting for them outside the number of pawns on the human chessboard being less than the number of combinations that they are capable of forming in a theatre from which are absent all the people we know and might have expected to find there turns up one whom we never imagined that we should see again and who appears so opportunely that the coincidence seems to us providential although no doubt some other coincidence would have occurred in its stead had we been not in that place but in some other where other desires would have been aroused and we should have met some other old acquaintance to help us to satisfy them the golden portals of the world of dreams had closed again upon rachel before saintloup saw her emerge from the theatre so that the freckles and spots were of little importance they vexed him nevertheless especially as being no longer alone he had not now the same opportunity to dream as in the theatre but she for all that he could no longer see her continued to dictate his actions like those stars which govern us by their attraction even during the hours in which they are not visible to our eyes and so his desire for the actress with the fine features which had no place now even in robert’s memory had the result that dashing towards the old friend whom chance had brought to the spot he insisted upon an introduction to the person with no features and with freckles since she was the same person telling himself that later on he would take care to find out which of the two this same person really was she was in a hurry she did not on this occasion say a single word to saintloup and it was only some days later that he finally contrived by inducing her to leave her companions to escort her home he loved her already the need for dreams the desire to be made happy by her of whom one has dreamed bring it about that not much time is required before one entrusts all one’s chances of happiness to her who a few days since was but a fortuitous apparition unknown unmeaning upon the boards of the theatre

   when the curtain having fallen we moved on to the stage alarmed at finding myself there for the first time i felt the need to begin a spirited conversation with saintloup in this way my attitude as i did not know what one ought to adopt in a setting that was strange to me would be entirely dominated by our talk and people would think that i was so absorbed in it so unobservant of my surroundings that it was quite natural that i should not shew the facial expressions proper to a place in which to judge by what i appeared to be saying i was barely conscious of standing and seizing to make a beginning upon the first topic that came to my mind

    “you know” i said “i did come to say goodbye to you the day i left doncières i’ve not had an opportunity to mention it i waved to you in the street”

    “don’t speak about it” he replied “i was so sorry i passed you just outside the barracks but i couldn’t stop because i was late already i assure you i felt quite wretched about it”

   so he had recognised me i saw again in my mind the wholly impersonal salute which he had given me raising his hand to his cap without a glance to indicate that he knew me without a gesture to shew that he was sorry he could not stop evidently this fiction which he had adopted at that moment of not knowing me must have simplified matters for him greatly but i was amazed to find that he had been able to compose himself to it so swiftly and without any instinctive movement to betray his original impression i had already observed at balbec that side by side with that childlike sincerity of his face the skin of which by its transparence rendered visible the sudden tide of certain emotions his body had been admirably trained to perform a certain number of wellbred dissimulations and that like a consummate actor he could in his regimental and in his social life play alternately quite different parts in one of his parts he loved me tenderly he acted towards me almost as if he had been my brother my brother he had been he was now again but for a moment that day he had been another person who did not know me and who holding the reins his glass screwed to his eye without a look or a smile had lifted his disengaged hand to the peak of his cap to give me correctly the military salute

   the stage scenery still in its place among which i was passing seen thus at close range and without the advantage of any of those effects of lighting and distance on which the eminent artist whose brush had painted it had calculated was a depressing sight and rachel when i came near her was subjected to a no less destructive force the curves of her charming nose had stood out in perspective between stalls and stage like the relief of the scenery it was no longer herself i recognised her only thanks to her eyes in which her identity had taken refuge the form the radiance of this young star so brilliant a moment ago had vanished on the other hand — as though we came close to the moon and it ceased to present the appearance of a disk of rosy gold — on this face so smooth a surface until now i could distinguish only protuberances discolourations cavities despite the incoherence into which were resolved at close range not only the feminine features but the painted canvas i was glad to be there to wander among the scenery all that setting which at one time my love of nature had prompted me to dismiss as tedious and artificial until the description of it by goethe in wilhelm meister had given it a sort of beauty in my eyes and i had already observed with delight in the thick of a crowd of journalists or men of friends of the actresses who were greeting one another talking smoking as though in a public thoroughfare a young man in a black velvet cap and hortensiacoloured skirt his cheeks chalked in red like a page from a watteau album who with his smiling lips his eyes raised to the ceiling as he sprang lightly into the air seemed so entirely of another species than the rational folk in everyday clothes in the midst of whom he was pursuing like a madman the course of his ecstatic dream so alien to the preoccupations of their life so anterior to the habits of their civilisation so enfranchised from all the laws of nature that it was as restful and as fresh a spectacle as watching a butterfly straying along a crowded street to follow with one’s eyes between the strips of canvas the natural arabesques traced by his winged capricious painted oscillations but at that moment saintloup conceived the idea that his mistress was paying undue attention to this dancer who was engaged now in practising for the last time the figure of fun with which he was going to take the stage and his face darkened

    “you might look the other way” he warned her gloomily “you know that none of those dancerfellows is worth the rope they can at least fall off and break their necks and they’re the sort of people who go about afterwards boasting that you’ve taken notice of them besides you know very well you’ve been told to go to your dressingroom and change you’ll be missing your call again”

   a group of men — journalists — noticing the look of fury on saintloup’s face came nearer amused to listen to what we were saying and as the stagehands had just set up some scenery on our other side we were forced into close contact with them

    “oh but i know him he’s a friend of mine” cried saintloup’s mistress her eyes still fixed on the dancer “look how well made he is do watch those little hands of his dancing away by themselves like his whole body”

   the dancer turned his head towards her and his human person appeared beneath the sylph that he was endeavouring to be the clear grey jelly of his eyes trembled and sparkled between eyelids stiff with paint and a smile extended the corners of his mouth into cheeks plastered with rouge then to amuse the girl like a singer who hums to oblige us the air of the song in which we have told her that we admired her singing he began to repeat the movement of his hands counterfeiting himself with the fineness of a parodist and the good humour of a child

    “oh that’s too lovely the way he copies himself” she cried clapping her hands

    “i implore you my dearest girl” saintloup broke in in a tone of utter misery “do not make a scene here i can’t stand it i swear if you say another word i won’t go with you to your room i shall walk straight out come don’t be so naughty    you oughtn’t to stand about in the cigar smoke like that it’ll make you ill” he went on to me with the solicitude he had shewn for me in our balbec days

    “oh what a good thing it would be if you did go”

    “i warn you if i do i shan’t come back”

    “that’s more than i should venture to hope”

    “listen you know i promised you the necklace if you behaved nicely to me but the moment you treat me like this    ”

    “ah well that doesn’t surprise me in the least you gave me your promise i ought to have known you’d never keep it you want the whole world to know you’re made of money but i’m not a moneygrubber like you you can keep your blasted necklace i know some one else who’ll give it to me”

    “no one else can possibly give it to you i’ve told boucheron he’s to keep it for me and i have his promise not to let anyone else have it”

    “there you are trying to blackmail me you’ve arranged everything i see that’s what they mean by marsantes mater semita it smells of the race” retorted rachel quoting an etymology which was founded on a wild misinterpretation for semita means ‘path’ and not ‘semite’ but one which the nationalists applied to saintloup on account of the dreyfusard views for which so far as that went he was indebted to the actress she was less entitled than anyone to apply the word ‘jew’ to mme de marsantes in whom the ethnologists of society could succeed in finding no trace of judaism apart from her connexion with the lévymirepoix family “but this isn’t the last of it i can tell you an agreement like that isn’t binding you have acted treacherously towards me boucheron shall be told of it and he’ll be paid twice as much for his necklace you’ll hear from me before long don’t you worry”

   robert was in the right a hundred times over but circumstances are always so entangled that the man who is in the right a hundred times may have been once in the wrong and i could not help recalling that unpleasant and yet quite innocent expression which he had used at balbec “in that way i keep a hold over her”

    “you don’t understand what i mean about the necklace i made no formal promise once you start doing everything you possibly can to make me leave you it’s only natural surely that i shouldn’t give it to you i fail to understand what treachery you can see in that or what my ulterior motive is supposed to be you can’t seriously maintain that i brag about my money i’m always telling you that i’m only a poor devil without a cent to my name it’s foolish of you take it in that way my dear what possible interest can i have in hurting you you know very well that my one interest in life is yourself”

    “oh yes yes please go on” she retorted ironically with the sweeping gesture of a barber wielding his razor and turning to watch the dancer

    “isn’t he too wonderful with his hands a woman like me couldn’t do the things he’s doing now” she went closer to him and pointing to robert’s furious face “look he’s hurt” she murmured in the momentary elation of a sadic impulse to cruelty totally out of keeping with the genuine feelings of affection for saintloup

    “listen for the last time i swear to you it doesn’t matter what you do — in a week you’ll be giving anything to get me back — i shan’t come it’s a clean cut do you hear it’s irrevocable you will be sorry one day when it’s too late”

   perhaps he was sincere in saying this and the torture of leaving his mistress may have seemed to him less cruel than that of remaining with her in certain circumstances

    “but my dear boy” he went on to me “you oughtn’t to stand about here i tell you it will make you cough”

   i pointed to the scenery which barred my way he touched his hat and said to one of the journalists

    “would you mind sir throwing away your cigar the smoke is bad for my friend”

   his mistress had not waited for him to accompany her on her way to her dressingroom she turned round and

    “do they do those tricks with women too those nice little hands” she flung to the dancer from the back of the stage in an artificially melodious tone of girlish innocence “you look just like one yourself i’m sure i could have a wonderful time with you and a girl i know”

    “there’s no rule against smoking that i know of if people aren’t well they have only to stay at home” said the journalist

   the dancer smiled mysteriously back at the actress

    “oh do stop you’ll make me quite mad” she cried to him “then there will be trouble”

    “in any case sir you are not very civil” observed saintloup to the journalist still with a courteous suavity in the deliberate manner of a man judging retrospectively the rights and wrongs of an incident that is already closed

   at that moment i saw saintloup raise his arm vertically above his head as if he had been making a signal to some one whom i could not see or like the conductor of an orchestra and indeed — without any greater transition than when at a simple wave of the baton in a symphony or a ballet violent rhythms succeed a graceful andante — after the courteous words that he had just uttered he brought down his hand with a resounding smack upon the journalist’s cheek

   now that to the measured conversations of the diplomats to the smiling arts of peace had succeeded the furious onthrust of war since blows lead to blows i should not have been surprised to see the combatants swimming in one another’s blood but what i could not understand like people who feel that it is not according to the rules when a war breaks out between two countries after some question merely of the rectification of a frontier or when a sick man dies after nothing more serious than a swelling of the liver was how saintloup had contrived to follow up those words which implied a distinct shade of friendliness with an action which in no way arose out of them which they had not so to speak announced that action of an arm raised in defiance not only of the rights of man but of the law of cause and effect that action created ex nihilo fortunately the journalist who staggering back from the violence of the blow had turned pale and hesitated for a moment did not retaliate as for his friends one of them had promptly turned away his head and was looking fixedly into the wings for some one who evidently was not there the second pretended that a speck of dust had got into his eye and began rubbing and squeezing his eyelid with every sign of being in pain while the third had rushed off exclaiming “good heavens i believe the curtain’s going up we shan’t get into our seats”

   i wanted to speak to saintloup but he was so full of his indignation with the dancer that it adhered exactly to the surface of his eyeballs like a subcutaneous structure it distended his cheeks with the result that his internal agitation expressing itself externally in an entire immobility he had not even the power of relaxation the ‘play’ necessary to take in a word from me and to answer it the journalist’s friends seeing that the incident was at an end gathered round him again still trembling but ashamed of having deserted him they were absolutely determined that be should be made to suppose that they had noticed nothing and so they dilated one upon the speck of dust in his eye one upon his false alarm when he had thought that the curtain was going up the third upon the astonishing resemblance between a man who had just gone by and the speaker’s brother indeed they seemed quite to resent their friend’s not having shared their several emotions

    “what didn’t it strike you you must be going blind”

    “what i say is that you’re a pack of curs” growled the journalist whom saintloup had punished

   forgetting the poses they had adopted to be consistent with which they ought — but they did not think of it — to have pretended not to understand what he meant they fell back on certain expressions traditional in the circumstances “what’s all the excitement keep your hair on old chap don’t take the bit in your teeth”

   i had realised that morning beneath the pear blossom how illusory were the grounds upon which robert’s love for ‘rachel when from the lord’ was based i was bound now to admit how very real were the sufferings to which that love gave rise gradually the feeling that had obsessed him for the last hour without a break began to diminish receded into him an unoccupied pliable zone appeared in his eyes i had stopped for a moment at a corner of the avenue gabriel from which i had often in the past seen gilberte appear i tried for a few seconds to recall those distant impressions and was hurrying at a ‘gymnastic’ pace to overtake saintloup when i saw that a gentleman somewhat shabbily attired appeared to be talking to him confidentially i concluded that this was a personal friend of robert at the same time they seemed to be drawing even closer to one another suddenly as a meteor flashes through the sky i saw a number of ovoid bodies assume with a giddy swiftness all the positions necessary for them to form before saintloup’s face and body a flickering constellation flung out like stones from a catapult they seemed to me to be at the very least seven in number they were merely however saintloup’s pair of fists multiplied by the speed with which they were changing their places in this — to all appearance ideal and decorative — arrangement but this elaborate display was nothing more than a pummelling which saintloup was administering the true character of which aggressive rather than aesthetic was first revealed to me by the aspect of the shabbily dressed gentleman who appeared to be losing at once his selfpossession his lower jaw and a quantity of blood he gave fictitious explanations to the people who came up to question him turned his head and seeing that saintloup had made off and was hastening to rejoin me stood gazing after him with an offended crushed but by no means furious expression on his face saintloup on the other hand was furious although he himself had received no blow and his eyes were still blazing with anger when he reached me the incident was in no way connected as i had supposed with the assault in the theatre it was an impassioned loiterer who seeing the fine looking young soldier that saintloup was had made overtures to him my friend could not get over the audacity of this ‘clique’ who no longer even waited for the shades of night to cover their operations and spoke of the suggestion that had been made to him with the same indignation as the newspapers use in reporting an armed assault and robbery in broad daylight in the centre of paris and yet the recipient of his blow was excusable in one respect for the trend of the downward slope brings desire so rapidly to the point of enjoyment that beauty by itself appears to imply consent now that saintloup was beautiful was beyond dispute castigation such as he had just administered has this value for men of the type that had accosted him that it makes them think seriously of their conduct though never for long enough to enable them to amend their ways and thus escape correction at the hands of the law and so although saintloup’s arm had shot out instinctively without any preliminary thought all such punishments even when they reinforce the law are powerless to bring about any uniformity in morals

   these incidents particularly the one that was weighing most on his mind seemed to have prompted in robert a desire to be left alone for a while after a moment’s silence he asked me to leave him and to go by myself to call on mme de villeparisis he would join me there but preferred that we should not enter the room together so that he might appear to have only just arrived in paris instead of having spent half the day already with me

   as i had supposed before making the acquaintance of mme de villeparisis at balbec there was a vast difference between the world in which she lived and that of mme de guermantes mme de villeparisis was one of those women who born of a famous house entering by marriage into another no less famous do not for all that enjoy any great position in the social world and apart from a few duchesses who are their nieces or sistersinlaw perhaps even a crowned head or two old family friends see their drawingrooms filled only by thirdrate people drawn from the middle classes or from a nobility either provincial or tainted in some way whose presence there has long since driven away all such smart and snobbish folk as are not obliged to come to the house by ties of blood or the claims of a friendship too old to be ignored certainly i had no difficulty after the first few minutes in understanding how mme de villeparisis at balbec had come to be so well informed better than ourselves even as to the smallest details of the tour through spain which my father was then making with m de norpois even this however did not make it possible to rest content with the theory that the intimacy — of more than twenty years’ standing — between mme de villeparisis and the ambassador could have been responsible for the lady’s loss of caste in a world where the smartest women boasted the attachment of lovers far less respectable than he not to mention that it was probably years since he had been anything more to the marquise than just an old friend had mme de villeparisis then had other adventures in days gone by being then of a more passionate temperament than now in a calm and religious old age which nevertheless owed some of its mellow colouring to those ardent vanished years had she somehow failed in the country neighbourhood where she had lived for so long to avoid certain scandals unknown to the younger generation who simply took note of their effect in the unequal and defective composition of a visiting list bound otherwise to have been among the purest of any taint of mediocrity that ‘sharp tongue’ which her nephew ascribed to her had it in those faroff days made her enemies had it driven her into taking advantage of certain successes with men so as to avenge herself upon women all this was possible nor could the exquisitely sensitive way in which — giving so delicate a shade not merely to her words but to her intonation — mme de villeparisis spoke of modesty or generosity be held to invalidate this supposition for the people who not only speak with approval of certain virtues but actually feel their charm and shew a marvellous comprehension of them people in fact who will when they come to write their memoirs present a worthy picture of those virtues are often sprung from but not actually part of the silent simple artless generation which practised them that generation is reflected in them but is not continued instead of the character which it possessed we find a sensibility an intelligence which are not conducive to action and whether or not there had been in the life of mme de villeparisis any of those scandals which if there had the lustre of her name would have blotted out it was this intellect resembling rather that of a writer of the second order than that of a woman of position that was undoubtedly the cause of her social degradation

   it is true that they were not specially elevating the qualities such as balance and restraint which mme de villeparisis chiefly extolled but to speak of restraint in a manner that shall be entirely adequate the word ‘restraint’ is not enough we require some of the qualities of authorship which presuppose a quite unrestrained exaltation i had remarked at balbec that the genius of certain great artists was completely unintelligible to mme de villeparisis and that all she could do was to make delicate fun of them and to express her incomprehension in a graceful and witty form but this wit and grace at the point to which she carried them became themselves — on another plane and even although they were employed to belittle the noblest masterpieces — true artistic qualities now the effect of such qualities on any social position is a morbid activity of the kind which doctors call elective and so disintegrating that the most firmly established pillars of society are hard put to it to hold out for any length of time what artists call intellect seems pure presumption to the fashionable world which unable to place itself at the sole point of view from which they the artists look at and judge things incapable of understanding the particular attraction to which they yield when they choose an expression or start a friendship feel in their company an exhaustion an irritation from which antipathy very shortly springs and yet in her conversation and the same may be said of the memoirs which she afterwards published mme de villeparisis shewed nothing but a sort of grace that was eminently social having passed by great works without mastering sometimes without even noticing them she had preserved from the period in which she had lived and which moreover she described with great aptness and charm little more than the most frivolous of the gifts that they had had to offer her but a narrative of this sort even when it treats exclusively of subjects that are not intellectual is still a work of the intellect and to give in a book or in conversation which is almost the same thing a deliberate impression of frivolity a serious touch is required which a purely frivolous person would be incapable of supplying in a certain book of reminiscences written by a woman and regarded as a masterpiece the phrase that people quote as a model of airy grace has always made me suspect that in order to arrive at such a pitch of lightness the author must originally have had a rather stodgy education a boring culture and that as a girl she probably appeared to her friends an insufferable prig and between certain literary qualities and social failure the connexion is so inevitable that when we open mme de villeparisis’s memoirs today on any page a fitting epithet a sequence of metaphors will suffice to enable the reader to reconstruct the deep but icy bow which must have been bestowed on the old marquise on the staircases of the embassies by a snob like mme leroi who perhaps may have left a card on her when she went to call on the guermantes but never set foot in her house for fear of losing caste among all the doctors’ or solicitors’ wives whom she would find there a bluestocking mme de villeparisis had perhaps been in her earliest youth and intoxicated with the ferment of her own knowledge had perhaps failed to realise the importance of not applying to people in society less intelligent and less educated than herself those cutting strokes which the injured party never forgets

   moreover talent is not a separate appendage which one artificially attaches to those qualities which make for social success in order to create from the whole what people in society call a ‘complete woman’ it is the living product of a certain moral complexion from which as a rule many moral qualities are lacking and in which there predominates a sensibility of which other manifestations such as we do not notice in a book may make themselves quite distinctly felt in the course of a life certain curiosities for instance certain whims the desire to go to this place or that for one’s own amusement and not with a view to the extension the maintenance or even the mere exercise of one’s social relations i had seen at balbec mme de villeparisis hemmed in by a bodyguard of her own servants without even a glance as she passed at the people sitting in the hall of the hotel but i had had a presentiment that this abstention was due not to indifference and it seemed that she had not always confined herself to it she would get a sudden craze to know some one or other because she had seen him and thought him goodlooking or merely because she had been told that he was amusing or because he had struck her as different from the people she knew who at this period when she had not yet begun to appreciate them because she imagined that they would never fail her belonged all of them to the purest cream of the faubourg saintgermain to the bohemian the humble middleclass gentleman whom she had marked out with her favour she was obliged to address invitations the importance of which he was unable to appreciate with an insistence which began gradually to depreciate her in the eyes of the snobs who were in the habit of estimating the smartness of a house by the people whom its mistress excluded rather than by those whom she entertained certainly if at a given moment in her youth mme de villeparisis surfeited with the satisfaction of belonging to the fine flower of the aristocracy had found a sort of amusement in scandalising the people among whom she lived and in deliberately impairing her own position in society she had begun to attach its full importance to that position once it was definitely lost she had wished to shew the duchesses that she was better than they by saying and doing all the things that they dared not say or do but now that they all save such as were closely related to her had ceased to call she felt herself diminished and sought once more to reign but with another sceptre than that of wit she would have liked to attract to her house all those women whom she had taken such pains to drive away how many women’s lives lives of which little enough is known for we all live in different worlds according to our ages and the discretion of their elders prevents the young from forming any clear idea of the past and so completing the cycle have been divided in this way into contrasted periods the last being entirely devoted to the reconquest of what in the second has been so lightheartedly flung on the wind flung on the wind in what way the young people are all the less capable of imagining it since they see before them an elderly and respectable marquise de villeparisis and have no idea that the grave diarist of the present day so dignified beneath her pile of snowy hair can ever have been a gay midnightreveller who was perhaps the delight in those days devoured the fortunes perhaps of men now sleeping in their graves that she should also have set to work with a persevering and natural industry to destroy the position which she owed to her high birth does not in the least imply that even at that remote period mme de villeparisis did not attach great importance to her position in the same way the web of isolation of inactivity in which a neurasthenic lives may be woven by him from morning to night without therefore seeming endurable and while he is hastening to add another mesh to the net which holds him captive it is possible that he is dreaming only of dancing sport and travel we are at work every moment upon giving its form to our life but we do so by copying unintentionally like the example in a book the features of the person that we are and not of him who we should like to be the disdainful bow of mme leroi might to some extent be expressive of the true nature of mme de villeparisis it in no way corresponded to her ambition

   no doubt at the same moment at which mme leroi was — to use an expression beloved of mme swann —‘cutting’ the marquise the latter could seek consolation in remembering how queen marieamélie had once said to her “you are just like a daughter to me” but such marks of royal friendship secret and unknown to the world existed for the marquise alone dusty as the diploma of an old conservatoire medalist the only true social advantages are those that create life that can disappear without the person who has benefited by them needing to try to keep them or to make them public because on the same day a hundred others will take their place and for all that she could remember the queen’s using those words to her she would nevertheless have bartered them gladly for the permanent faculty of being asked everywhere which mme leroi possessed as in a restaurant a great but unknown artist whose genius is written neither in the lines of his bashful face nor in the antiquated cut of his threadbare coat would willingly be even the young stockjobber of the lowest grade of society who is sitting with a couple of actresses at a neighbouring table to which in an obsequious and incessant chain come hurrying manager head waiter pages and even the scullions who file out of the kitchen to salute him as in the fairytales while the wine waiter advances dustcovered like his bottles limping and dazed as if on his way up from the cellar he had twisted his foot before emerging into the light of day

   it must be remarked however that in mme de villeparisis’s drawingroom the absence of mme leroi if it distressed the lady of the house passed unperceived by the majority of her guests they were entirely ignorant of the peculiar position which mme leroi occupied a position known only to the fashionable world and never doubted that mme de villeparisis’s receptions were as the readers of her memoirs today are convinced that they must have been the most brilliant in paris

   on the occasion of this first call which after leaving saintloup i went to pay on mme villeparisis following the advice given by m de norpois to my father i found her in her drawingroom hung with yellow silk against which the sofas and the admirable armchairs upholstered in beauvais tapestry stood out with the almost purple redness of ripe raspberries side by side with the guermantes and villeparisis portraits one saw those — gifts from the sitters themselves — of queen marieamélie the queen of the belgians the prince de joinville and the empress of austria mme de villeparisis herself capped with an oldfashioned bonnet of black lace which she preserved with the same instinctive sense of local or historical colour as a breton innkeeper who however parisian his customers may have become feels it more in keeping to make his maids dress in coifs and wide sleeves was seated at a little desk on which in front of her as well as her brushes her palette and an unfinished flowerpiece in watercolours were arranged in glasses in saucers in cups mossroses zinnias maidenhair ferns which on account of the sudden influx of callers she had just left off painting and which had the effect of being piled on a florist’s counter in some eighteenthcentury mezzotint in this drawingroom which had been slightly heated on purpose because the marquise had caught cold on the journey from her house in the country there were already when i arrived a librarian with whom mme de villeparisis had spent the morning in selecting the autograph letters to herself from various historical personages which were to figure in facsimile as documentary evidence in the memoirs which she was preparing for the press and a historian solemn and tonguetied who hearing that she had inherited and still possessed a portrait of the duchesse de montmorency had come to ask her permission to reproduce it as a plate in his work on the fronde a party strengthened presently by the addition of my old friend bloch now a rising dramatist upon whom she counted to secure the gratuitous services of actors and actresses at her next series of afternoon parties it was true that the social kaleidoscope was in the act of turning and that the dreyfus case was shortly to hurl the jews down to the lowest rung of the social ladder but for one thing the antidreyfus cyclone might rage as it would it is not in the first hour of a storm that the waves are highest in the second place mme de villeparisis leaving a whole section of her family to fulminate against the jews had hitherto kept herself entirely aloof from the case and never gave it a thought lastly a young man like bloch whom no one knew might pass unperceived whereas leading jews representatives of their party were already threatened he had his chin pointed now by a goatbeard wore double glasses and a long frock coat and carried a glove like a roll of papyrus in his hand the rumanians the egyptians the turks may hate the jews but in a french drawingroom the differences between those peoples are not so apparent and an israelite making his entry as though he were emerging from the heart of the desert his body crouching like a hyaena’s his neck thrust obliquely forward spreading himself in profound ‘salaams’ completely satisfies a certain taste for the oriental only it is essential that the jew should not be actually ‘in’ society otherwise he will readily assume the aspect of a lord and his manners become so gallicised that on his face a rebellious nose growing like a nasturtium in any but the right direction will make one think rather of mascarille’s nose than of solomon’s but bloch not having been rendered supple by the gymnastics of the faubourg nor ennobled by a crossing with england or spain remained for a lover of the exotic as strange and savoury a spectacle in spite of his european costume as one of decamps’s jews marvellous racial power which from the dawn of time thrusts to the surface even in modern paris on the stage of our theatres behind the pigeonholes of our public offices at a funeral in the street a solid phalanx setting their mark upon our modern ways of hairdressing absorbing making us forget disciplining the frock coat which on them remains not at all unlike the garment in which assyrian scribes are depicted in ceremonial attire on the frieze of a monument at susa before the gates of the palace of darius later in the afternoon bloch might have imagined that it was out of antisemitic malice that m de charlus inquired whether his first name was jewish whereas it was simply from aesthetic interest and love of local colour but to revert for a moment when we speak of racial persistence we do not accurately convey the impression we receive from jews greeks persians all those peoples whom it is better to leave with their differences we know from classical paintings the faces of the ancient greeks we have seen assyrians on the walls of a palace at susa and so we feel on encountering in a paris drawingroom orientals belonging to one or another group that we are in the presence of creatures whom the forces of necromancy must have called to life we knew hitherto only a superficial image behold it has gained depth it extends into three dimensions it moves the young greek lady daughter of a rich banker and the latest favourite of society looks exactly like one of those dancers who in the chorus of a ballet at once historical and aesthetic symbolise in flesh and blood the art of hellas and yet in the theatre the setting makes these images somehow trite the spectacle on the other hand to which the entry into a drawingroom of a turkish lady or a jewish gentleman admits us by animating their features makes them appear stranger still as if they really were creatures evoked by the effort of a medium it is the soul or rather the pigmy thing to which — up to the present at any rate — the soul is reduced in this sort of materialisation it is the soul of which we have caught glimpses hitherto in museums alone the soul of the ancient greeks of the ancient hebrews torn from a life at once insignificant and transcendental which seems to be enacting before our eyes this disconcerting pantomime in the young greek lady who is leaving the room what we seek in vain to embrace is the figure admired long ago on the side of a vase i felt that if i had in the light of mme de villeparisis’s drawingroom taken photographs of bloch they would have furnished of israel the same image — so disturbing because it does not appear to emanate from humanity so deceiving because all the same it is so strangely like humanity — which we find in spirit photographs there is nothing to speak more generally not even the insignificance of the remarks made by the people among whom we spend our lives that does not give us a sense of the supernatural in our everyday world where even a man of genius from whom we expect gathered as though around a turningtable to learn the secret of the infinite utters only these words — the same that had just issued from the lips of bloch “take care of my top hat”

    “oh ministers my dear sir” mme de villeparisis was saying addressing herself specially to my friend and picking up the thread of a conversation which had been broken by my arrival “nobody ever wanted to see them i was only a child at the time but i can remember so well the king begging my grandfather to invite m decazes to a rout at which my father was to dance with the duchesse de berry ‘it will give me pleasure florimond’ said the king my grandfather who was a little deaf thought he had said m de castries which seemed a perfectly natural thing to ask when he understood that it was m decazes he was furious at first but he gave in and wrote a note the same evening to m decazes begging him to pay my grandfather the compliment and give him the honour of his presence at the ball which he was giving the following week for we were polite sir in those days and no hostess would have dreamed of simply sending her card and writing on it ‘tea’ or ‘dancing’ or ‘music’ but if we understood politeness we were not incapable of impertinence either m decazes accepted but the day before the ball it was given out that my grandfather felt indisposed and had cancelled his invitations he had obeyed the king but he had not had m decazes at his ball    yes sir i remember m mole very well he was a clever man — he shewed that in his reception of m de vigny at the academy — but he was very pompous and i can see him now coming downstairs to dinner in his own house with his tall hat in his hand”

    “ah that is typically suggestive of what must have been a pretty perniciously philistine epoch for it was no doubt a universal habit to carry one’s hat in one’s hand in one’s own house” observed bloch anxious to make the most of so rare an opportunity of learning from an eyewitness details of the aristocratic life of another day while the librarian who was a sort of intermittent secretary to the marquise gazed at her tenderly as though he were saying to the rest of us “there you see what she’s like she knows everything she has met everybody you can ask her anything you like she’s quite amazing”

    “oh dear no” replied mme de villeparisis drawing nearer to her as she spoke the glass containing the maidenhair which presently she would begin again to paint “it was a habit m mole had that was all i never saw my father carry his hat in the house except of course when the king came because the king being at home wherever he is the master of the house is only a visitor then in his own drawingroom”

    “aristotle tells us in the second chapter of    ” ventured m pierre the historian of the fronde but so timidly that no one paid any attention having been suffering for some weeks from a nervous insomnia which resisted every attempt at treatment he had given up going to bed and halfdead with exhaustion went out only whenever his work made it imperative incapable of repeating at all often these expeditions which simple enough for other people cost him as much effort as if to make them he was obliged to come down from the moon he was surprised to be brought up so frequently against the fact that other people’s lives were not organised on a constant and permanent basis so as to furnish the maximum utility to the sudden outbursts of his own he sometimes found the doors shut of a library which he had reached only after setting himself artificially on his feet and in a frock coat like some automaton in a story by mr wells fortunately he had found mme de villeparisis at home and was going to be shewn the portrait

   meanwhile he was cut short by bloch “indeed” the latter remarked referring to what mme de villeparisis had said as to the etiquette for royal visits “do you know i never knew that” as though it were strange that he should not have known it always

    “talking of that sort of visit you heard the stupid joke my nephew basin played on me yesterday morning” mme de villeparisis asked the librarian “he told my people instead of announcing him to say that it was the queen of sweden who had called to see me”

    “what he made them tell you just like that i say he must have a nerve” exclaimed bloch with a shout of laughter while the historian smiled with a stately timidity

    “i was quite surprised because i had only been back from the country a few days i had specially arranged just to be left in peace for a little that no one was to be told that i was in paris and i asked myself how the queen of sweden could have heard so soon” went on mme de villeparisis leaving her guests amazed to find that a visit from the queen of sweden was in itself nothing out of the common to their hostess

   earlier in the day mme de villeparisis might have been collaborating with the librarian in arranging the illustrations to her memoirs now she was quite unconsciously trying their effect on an average public typical of that from which she would eventually have to enlist her readers hers might be different in many ways from a really fashionable drawingroom in which you would have been struck by the absence of a number of middle dass ladies to whom mme de villeparisis was ‘at home’ and would have noticed instead such brilliant leaders of fashion as mme leroi had in course of time managed to secure but this distinction is not perceptible in her memoirs from which certain unimportant friendships of the author have disappeared because there is never any occasion to refer to them while the absence of those who did not come to see her leaves no gap because in the necessarily restricted space at the author’s disposal only a few persons can appear and if these persons are royal personages historic personalities then the utmost impression of distinction which any volume of memoirs can convey to the public is achieved in the opinion of mme leroi mme de villeparisis’s parties were thirdrate and mme de villeparisis felt the sting of mme leroi’s opinion but hardly anyone today remembers who mme leroi was her opinions have vanished into thin air and it is the drawingroom of mme de villeparisis frequented as it was by the queen of sweden and as it had been by the due d’aumale the duc de broglie thiers montalembert mgr dupanloup which will be looked upon as one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century by that posterity which has not changed since the days of homer and pindar and for which the enviable things are exalted birth royal or quasiroyal and the friendship of kings the leaders of the people and other eminent men

   now of all this mme de villeparisis had her share in the people who still came to her house and in the memories — sometimes slightly ‘touched up’— by means of which she extended her social activity into the past and then there was m de norpois who while unable to restore his friend to any substantial position in society did indeed bring to her house such foreign or french statesmen as might have need of his services and knew that the only effective method of securing them was to pay court to mme de villeparisis possibly mme leroi also knew these european celebrities but as a wellmannered woman who avoids anything that suggests the bluestocking she would as little have thought of mentioning the eastern question to her prime ministers as of discussing the nature of love with her novelists and philosophers “love” she had once replied to a pushing lady who had asked her “what are your views on love”—“love i make it constantly but i never talk about it” when she had any of these literary or political lions in her house she contented herself as did the duchesse de guermantes with setting them down to play poker they often preferred this to the serious conversations on general ideas in which mme de villeparisis forced them to engage but these conversations ridiculous as in the social sense they may have been have furnished the memoirs of mme de villeparisis with those admirable passages those dissertations on politics which read so well in volumes of autobiography as they do in corneille’s tragedies furthermore the parties of the villeparisis of this world are alone destined to be handed down to posterity because the rerois of this world cannot write and if they could would not have the time and if the literary bent of the villeparisis is the cause of the lerois’ disdain the disdain of the lerois does in its turn a singular service to the literary bent of the villeparisis by affording the bluestockings that leisure which the career of letters requires god whose will it is that there should be a few books in the world well written breathes with that purpose such disdain into the hearts of the lerois for he knows that if these should invite the villeparisis to dinner the latter would at once rise from their writing tables and order their carriages to be round at eight

   presently there came into the room with slow and solemn step an oid lady of tall stature who beneath the raised brim of her straw hat revealed a monumental pile of snowy hair in the style of marieantoinette i did not then know that she was one of three women who were still to be seen in parisian society and who like mme de villeparisis while all of the noblest birth had been reduced for reasons which were ikjw lost in the night of time and could have been told us only by some old gallant of their period to entertaining only certain of the dregs of society who were not sought after elsewhere each of these ladies had her own ‘duchesse de guermantes’ the brilliant niece who came regularly to pay her respects but none of them could have succeeded in attracting to her house the ‘duchesse de guermantes’ of either of the others mme de villeparisis was on the best of terms with these three ladies but she did not like them perhaps the similarity between their social position and her own gave her an impression of them which was not pleasing besides soured bluestockings as they were seeking by the number and frequency of the drawingroom comedies which they arranged in their houses to give themselves the illusion of a regular salon there had grown up among them a rivalry which the decay of her fortune in the course of a somewhat tempestuous existence reduced for each of them when it was a question of securing the kind assistance of a professional actor or actress into a sort of struggle for life furthermore the lady with the markantoinette hair whenever she set eyes on mme de villeparisis could not help being reminded of the fact that the duchesse de guermantes did not come to her fridays her consolation was that at these same fridays she could always count on having blood being thicker than water the princesse de poix who was her own personal guermantes and who never went near mme de villeparisis albeit mme de poix was an intimate friend of the duchess

   nevertheless from the mansion on the quai malaquais to the drawingrooms of the rue de tournon the rue de la chaise and the faubourg sainthonoré a bond as compelling as it was hateful united the three fallen goddesses as to whom i would fain have learned by searching in some dictionary of social mythology through what gallant adventure what sacrilegious presumption they had incurred their punishment their common brilliance of origin the common decay of their present state entered largely no doubt into the necessity which compelled them while hating one another to frequent one another’s society besides each of them found in the others a convenient way of being polite to her own guests how should these fail to suppose that they had scaled the most inaccessible peak of the faubourg when they were introduced to a lady with a string of titles whose sister was married to a duc de sagan or a prince de ligne especially as there was infinitely more in the newspapers about these sham salons than about the genuine ones indeed these old ladies’ ‘men about town’ nephews — and saintloup the foremost of them — when asked by a friend to introduce him to people would answer at once “i will take you to see my aunt villeparisis” or whichever it was “you meet interesting people there” they knew very well that this would mean less trouble for themselves than trying to get the said friends invited by the smart nieces or sistersinlaw of these ladies certain very old men and young women who had heard it from those men told me that if these ladies were no longer received in society it was because of the extraordinary irregularity of their conduct which when i objected that irregular conduct was not necessarily a barrier to social success was represented to me as having gone far beyond anything that we know today the misconduct of these solemn dames who held themselves so erect assumed on the lips of those who hinted at it something that i was incapable of imagining proportionate to the magnitude of prehistoric days to the age of the mammoth in a word these three parcae with their white or blue or red locks had spun the fatal threads of an incalculable number of gentlemen i felt that the people of today exaggerated the vices of those fabulous times like the greeks who created icarus theseus heracles out of men who had been but little different from those who long afterwards deified them but one does not tabulate the sum of a person’s vices until he has almost ceased to be in a fit state to practise them when from the magnitude of his social punishment which is then nearing the completion of its term and which alone one can estimate one measures one imagines one exaggerates that of the crime that has been committed in that gallery of symbolical figures which is ‘society’ the really light women the true messalinas invariably present the solemn aspect of a lady of at least seventy with an air of lofty distinction who entertains everyone she can but not everyone she would like to have to whose house women will never consent to go whose own conduct falls in any way short of perfection to whom the pope regularly sends his golden rose and who as often as not has written — on the early days of lamartine — an essay that has been crowned by the french academy “how d’ye do alix” mme de villeparisis greeted the marieantoinette lady which lady cast a searching glance round the assembly to see whether there was not in this drawingroom any item that might be a valuable addition to her own in which case she would have to discover it for herself for mme de villeparisis she was sure would be spiteful enough to try to keep it from her thus mme de villeparisis took good care not to introduce bloch to the old lady for fear of his being asked to produce the same play that he was arranging for her in the drawingroom of the quai malaquais besides it was only tit for tat for the evening before the old lady had had mme ristori who had recited and had taken care that mme de villeparisis from whom she had filched the italian artist should not hear of this function until it was over so that she should not read it first in the newspapers and feel annoyed the old lady had come ill nerson to tell her about it shewing no sense of guilt mme de villeparisis considering that an introduction of myself was not likely to have the same awkward results as that of bloch made me known to the marieantoinette of the quai malaquais the latter who sought by making the fewest possible movements to preserve in her old age those lines as of a coysevox goddess which had years ago charmed the young men of fashion and which spurious poets still celebrated in rhymed charades — and had acquired the habit of a lofty and compensating stiffness common to all those whom a personal degradation obliges to be continually making advances — just perceptibly lowered her head with a frigid majesty and turning the other way took no more notice of me than if i had not existed by this crafty attitude she seemed to be assuring mme de villeparisis “you see i’m nowhere near him please understand that i’m not interested — in any sense of the word you old cat — in little boys” but when twenty minutes later she left the room taking advantage of the general conversation she slipped into my ear an invitation to come to her box the following friday with another of the three whose highsounding name — she had been born a choiseul moreover — had a prodigious effect on me

    “i understand sir that you are thinkin’ of writin’ somethin’ about mme la duchesse de montmorency” said mme de villeparisis to the historian of the fronde in that grudging tone which she allowed quite unconsciously to spoil the effect of her great and genuine kindness a tone due to the shrivelling crossness the sense of grievance that is a physiological accompaniment of age as well as to the affectation of imitating the almost rustic speech of the old nobility “i’m goin’ to let you see her portrait the original of the copy they have in the louvre”

   she rose laying down her brushes beside the flowers and the little apron which then came into sight at her waist and which she wore so as not to stain her dress with paints added still further to the impression of an old peasant given by her bonnet and her big spectacles and offered a sharp contrast to the luxury of her appointments the butler who had brought in the tea and cakes the liveried footman for whom she now rang to light up the portrait of the duchesse de montmorency abbess of one of the most famous chapters in the east of france everyone had risen “what is rather amusin’” said our hostess “is that in these chapters where our greataunts were so often made abbesses the daughters of the king of france would not have been admitted they were very close corporations” “not admit the king’s daughters” cried bloch in amazement “why ever not” “why because the house of france had not enough quartering after that low marriage” bloch’s bewilderment increased “a low marriage the house of france when was that” “why when they married into the medicis” replied mme de villeparisis in the most natural manner “it’s a fine picture ain’t it and in a perfect state of preservation” she added

    ‘my dear” put in the marieantoinette lady “surely you remember that when i brought liszt to see you he said that it was this one that was the copy”

    “i should bow to any opinion of liszt on music but not on painthe besides he was quite off his head then and i don’t remember his ever saying anything of the sort but it wasn’t you that brought him here i had met him any number of times at dinner at princess saynwittgenstein’s”

   alix’s shot had missed fire she stood silent erect and motionless plastered with layers of powder her face had the appearance of a face of stone and as the profile was noble she seemed on a triangular and mossgrown pedestal hidden by her cape the timeworn stucco goddess of a park

    “ah i see another fine portrait” began the historian

   the door opened and the duchesse de guermantes entered the room

    “well how are you” mme de villeparisis greeted her without moving her head taking from her apronpocket a hand which she held out to the newcomer and then ceasing at once to take any notice of her niece in order to return to the historian “that is the portrait of the duchesse de la rochefoucauld    ”

   a young servant with a bold manner and a charming face but so finely chiselled to ensure its perfection that the nose was a little red and the rest of the skin slightly flushed as though they were still smarting from the recent and sculptural incision came in bearing a card on a salver

    “it is that gentleman who has been several times to see mme la marquise”

    “did you tell him i was at home”

    “he heard the voices”

    “oh very well then shew him in it’s a man who was introduced to me” she explained “he told me he was very anxious to come to the house i certainly never said he might but here he’s taken the trouble to call five times now it doesn’t do to hurt people’s feelings sir” she went on to me “and you sir” to the historian of the fronde “let me introduce my niece the duchesse de guermantes”

   the historian made a low bow as i did also and since he seemed to suppose that some friendly remark ought to follow this salute his eyes brightened and he was preparing to open his mouth when he was once more frozen by the sight of mme de guermantes who had taken advantage of the independence of her torso to throw it forward with an exaggerated politeness and bring it neatly back to a position of rest without letting face or eyes appear to have noticed that anyone was standing before them after breathing a gentle sigh she contented herself with manifesting the nullity of the impression that had been made on her by the sight of the historian and myself by performing certain movements of her nostrils with a precision that testified to the absolute inertia of her unoccupied attention

   the importunate visitor entered the room making straight for mme de villeparisis with an ingenuous fervent air it was legrandin

    “thank you so very much for letting me come and see you” he began laying stress on the word ‘very’ “it is a pleasure of a quality altogether rare and subtle that you confer on an old solitary i assure you that its repercussion    ” he stopped short on catching sight of me

    “i was just shewing this gentleman a fine portrait of the duchesse de la rochefoucauld the wife of the author of the maxims it’s a family picture”

   mme de guermantes meanwhile had greeted alix with apologies for not having been able that year as in every previous year to go and see her “i hear all about you from madeleine” she added

    “she was at luncheon with me today” said the marquise of the quai malaquais with the satisfying reflexion that mme de villeparisis could never say that

   meanwhile i had been talking to bloch and fearing from what i had been told of his father’s change of attitude towards him that he might be envying my life i said to him that his must be the happier of the two my remark was prompted solely by my desire to be friendly but such friendliness readily convinces those who cherish a high opinion of themselves of their own good fortune or gives them a desire to convince other people “yes i do lead a delightful existence” bloch assured me with a beatified smile “i have three great friends i do not wish for one more an adorable mistress i am infinitely happy rare is the mortal to whom father zeus accords so much felicity” i fancy that he was anxious principally to extol himself and to make me envious perhaps too there was some desire to shew originality in his optimism it was evident that he did not wish to reply in the commonplace phraseology that everybody uses “oh it was nothing really” and so forth when to my question “was it a good show” put with regard to an afternoon dance at his house to which i had been prevented from going he replied in a level careless tone as if the dance had been given by some one else “why yes it was quite a good show couldn’t have been better it was really charming”

    “what you have just told us interests me enormously” said legrandin to mme de villeparisis “for i was saying to myself only the other day that you shewed a marked likeness to him in the clearcut turn of your speech in a quality which i will venture to describe by two contradictory terms monumental rapidity and immortal instantaneousness i should have liked this afternoon to take down all the things you say but i shall remember them they are in a phrase which comes i think from joubert friends of the memery you have never read joubert oh he would have admired you so i will take the liberty this evening of sending you a set of him it is a privilege to make you a present of his mind he had not your strength but he had a great deal of charm all the same”

   i would have gone up to legrandin at once and spoken to him but he kept as far away from me as he could no doubt in the hope that i might not overhear the stream of flattery which with a remarkable felicity of expression he kept pouring out whatever the topic to mme de villeparisis

   she shrugged her shoulders smiling as though he had been trying to make fun of her and turned to the historian

    “and this is the famous marie de rohan duchesse de chevreuse who was married first of all to m de luynes”

    “my dear speaking of mme de luynes reminds me of yolande she came to me yesterday evening and if i had known that you weren’t engaged i’d have sent round to ask you to come mme ristori turned up quite by chance and recited some poems by queen carmen sylva in the author’s presence it was too beautiful”

    “what treachery” thought mme de villeparisis “of course that was what she was whispering about the other day to mme de beaulaincourt and mme de chaponay i had no engagement” she replied “but i should not have come i heard ristori in her great days she’s a mere wreck now besides i detest carmen sylva’s poetry ristori came here once the duchess of aosta brought her to recite a canto of the inferno by dante in that sort of thing she’s incomparable”

   alix bore the blow without flinching she remained marble her gaze was piercing and blank her nose proudly arched but the surface of one cheek was scaling a faint strange vegetation green and pink was invading her chin perhaps another winter would level her with the dust

    “now sir if you are fond of painting look at the portrait of mme de montmorency” mme de villeparisis said to legrandin to stop the flow of compliments which was beginning again

   seizing her opportunity while his back was turned mme de guermantes pointed to him with an ironical questioning look at her aunt

    “it’s m legrandin” murmured mme de villeparisis “he has a sister called mme de cambremer not that that conveys any more to you than it does to me”

    “what oh but i know her quite well” exclaimed mme de guermantes and put her hand over her lips “that is to say i don’t know her but for some reason or other basin who meets the husband heaven knows where took it into his head to tell the wretched woman she might call on me and she did i can’t tell you what it was like she informed me that she had been to london and gave me a complete catalogue of all the things in the british museum and this very day the moment i leave your house i’m going just as you see me now to drop a card on the monster and don’t for a moment suppose that it’s an easy thing to do on the pretence that she’s dying of some disease she’s always at home it doesn’t matter whether you arrive at seven at night or nine in the morning she’s ready for you with a dish of strawberry tarts

    “no but seriously you know she is a monstrosity” mme de guermantes replied to a questioning glance from her aunt “she’s an impossible person she talks about ‘plumitives’ and things like that” “what does ‘plumitive’ mean” asked mme de villeparisis “i haven’t the slightest idea” cried the duchess in mock indignation “i don’t want to know i don’t speak that sort of language” and seeing that her aunt really did not know what a plumitive was to give herself the satisfaction of shewing that she was a scholar as well as a purist and to make fun of her aunt now after making fun of mme de cambremer “why of course” she said with a halflaugh which the last traces of her pretended ill humour kept in check “everybody knows what it means a plumitive is a writer a person who holds a pen but it’s a dreadful word it’s enough to make your wisdom teeth drop out nothing will ever make me use words like that

    “and so that’s the brother is it i hadn’t realized that yet but after all it’s not inconceivable she has the same doormat docility and the same mass of information like a circulating library she’s just as much of a flatterer as he is and just as boring yes i’m beginning to see the family likeness now quite plainly”

    “sit down we’re just going to take a dish of tea” said mme de villeparisis to her niece “help yourself you don’t want to look at the pictures of your greatgrandmothers you know them as well as i do”

   presently mme de villeparisis sat down again at her desk and went on with her painting the rest of the party gathered round her and i took the opportunity to go up to legrandin and seeing no harm myself in his presence in mme de villeparisis’s drawingroom and never dreaming how much my words would at once hurt him and make him believe that i had deliberately intended to hurt him say “well sir i am almost excused for coming to a teaparty when i find you here too” m legrandin concluded from this speech at least this was the opinion which he expressed of me a few days later that i was a thoroughly spiteful little wretch who delighted only in doing mischief

    “you might at least have the civility to begin by saying how d’ye do to me” he replied without offering me his hand and in a coarse and angry voice which i had never suspected him of possessing a voice which bearing no traceable relation to what he ordinarily said did bear another more immediate and striking relation to something that he was feeling at the moment what happens is that since we are determined always to keep our feelings to ourselves we have never given any thought to the manner in which we should express them and suddenly there is within us a strange and obscene animal making its voice heard the tones of which may inspire as much terror in the listener who receives the involuntary elliptical irresistible communication of our defect or vice as would the sudden avowal indirectly and uncouthly proffered by a criminal who can no longer refrain from confessing a murder of which one had never imagined him to be guilty i knew of course that idealism even subjective idealism did not prevent great philosophers from still having hearty appetites or from presenting themselves with untiring perseverance for election to the academy but really legrandin had no occasion to remind people so often that he belonged to another planet when all his convulsive movements of anger or affability were governed by the desire to occupy a good position on this

    “naturally when people pester me twenty times on end to go anywhere” he went on in lower tones “although i am perfectly free to do what i choose still i can’t behave like an absolute boor”

   mme de guermantes had sat down her name accompanied as it was by her title added to her corporeal dimensions the duchy which projected itself round about her and brought the shadowy sunsplashed coolness of the woods of guermantes into this drawingroom to surround the tuffet on which she was sitting i felt surprised only that the likeness of those woods was not more discernible on the face of the duchess about which there was nothing suggestive of vegetation and at the most the ruddy discolouration of her cheeks — which ought rather surely to have been emblazoned with the name guermantes — was the effect but did not furnish a picture of long gallops in the open air later on when she had ceased to interest me i came to know many of the duchess’s peculiarities notably to speak for the moment only of that one of which i already at this time felt the charm though without yet being able to discover what it was her eyes in which was held captive as in a picture the blue sky of an afternoon in france broadly expansive bathed in light even when no sun shone and a voice which one would have thought from its first hoarse sounds to be almost plebeian through which there trailed as over the steps of the church at combray or the pastrycook’s in the square the rich and lazy gold of a country sun but on this first day i discerned nothing the warmth of my attention volatilised at once the little that i might otherwise have been able to extract from her in which i should have found some indication of the name guermantes in any case i told myself that it was indeed she who was designated for all the world by the title duchesse de guermantes the inconceivable life which that name signified this body did indeed contain it had just introduced that life into a crowd of different creatures in this room which enclosed it on every side and on which it produced so violent a reaction that i thought i could see where the extent of that mysterious life ceased a fringe of effervescence outline its frontiers round the circumference of the circle traced on the carpet by the balloon of her blue pekin skirt and in the bright eyes of the duchess at the point of intersection of the preoccupations the memories the incomprehensible scornful amused and curious thoughts which filled them from within and the outside images that were reflected on their surface perhaps i should have been not quite so deeply stirred had i met her at mme de villeparisis’s at an evening party instead of seeing her thus on one of the marquise’s ‘days’ at one of those teaparties which are for women no more than a brief halt in the course of their afternoon’s outing when keeping on the hats in which they have been driving through the streets they waft into the close atmosphere of a drawingroom the quality of the fresh air outside and give one a better view of paris in the late afternoon than do the tall open windows through which one can hear the bowling wheels of their victorias mme de guermantes wore a boatinghat trimmed with cornflowers and what they recalled to me was not among the tilled fields round combray where i had so often gathered those flowers on the slope adjoining the tansonville hedge the suns of bygone years it was the scent and dust of twilight as they had been an hour ago when mme de guermantes drove through them in the rue de la paix with a smiling disdainful vague air and a grimace on her pursed lips with the point of her sunshade as with the extreme tip of an antenna of her mysterious life she was tracing circles on the carpet then with that indifferent attention which begins by eliminating every point of contact with what one is actually studying her gaze fastened upon each of us in turn then inspected the sofas and armchairs but softened this time by that human sympathy which is aroused by the presence however insignificant of a thing one knows a thing that is almost a person these pieces of furniture were not like us they belonged vaguely to her world they were bound up with the life of her aunt then from the beauvais furniture her gaze was carried back to the person sitting on it and resumed then the same air of perspicacity and that same disapproval which the respect that mme de guermantes felt for her aunt would have prevented her from expressing in words but which she would obviously have felt had she discovered on the chairs instead of our presence that of a spot of grease or a layer of dust

   that admirable writer g——entered the room he had come to pay a call on mme de villeparisis which he regarded as a tiresome duty the duchess although delighted to see him again gave him no sign of welcome but instinctively he made straight for her the charm that she possessed her tact her simplicity making him look upon her as a woman of exceptional intelligence he was bound moreover in common politeness to go and talk to her for since he was a pleasant and a distinguished man mme de guermantes frequently invited him to luncheon even when there were only her husband and herself besides or in the autumn to guermantes making use of this intimacy to have him to dinner occasionally with royalties who were curious to meet him for the duchess liked to entertain certain eminent men on condition always that they were bachelors a condition which even when married they invariably fulfilled for her for as their wives who were bound to be more or less common would have been a blot on a drawingroom in which there were never any but the most fashionable beauties in paris it was always without them that their husbands were invited and the duke to avoid hurting any possible susceptibility used to explain to these involuntary widowers that the duchess never had women in the house could not endure feminine society almost as though this had been under doctor’s orders and as be might have said that she could not stay in a room in which there were smells or eat salt food or travel with her back to the engine or wear stays it was true that these eminent men used to see at the guermantes’ the princesse de parme the princesse de sagan whom françoise hearing her constantly mentioned had taken to calling in the belief that this feminine ending was required by the laws of accidence ‘the sagante’ and plenty more but their presence was accounted for by the explanation that they were relatives or such very old friends that it was impossible to exclude them whether or not they were convinced by the explanations which the due de guermantes had given of the singular malady that made it impossible for the duchess to associate with other women the great men duly transmitted them to their wives some of these thought that this malady was only an excuse to cloak her jealousy because the duchess wished to reign alone over a court of worshippers others more simple still thought that perhaps the duchess had some peculiar habit a scandalous past it might be that women did not care to go to her house and that she gave the name of a whim to what was stern necessity the better among them hearing their husbands expatiate on the duchess’s marvellous brain assumed that she must be so far superior to the rest of womankind that she found their society boring since they could not talk intelligently about anything and it was true that the duchess was bored by other women if their princely rank did not render them specially interesting but the excluded wives were mistaken when they imagined that she chose to entertain men alone in order to be free to discuss with them literature science and philosophy for she never referred to these at least with the great intellectuals if by virtue of a family tradition such as makes the daughters of great soldiers preserve in the midst of their most frivolous distractions a respect for military matters she the granddaughter of women who had been on terms of friendship with thiers mérimée and augier felt that a place must always be kept in her drawingroom for men of intellect she had on the other hand derived from the manner at once condescending and intimate in which those famous men had been received at guermantes the foible of looking on men of talent as family friends whose talent does not dazzle one to whom one does not speak of their work and who would not be at all interested if one did moreover the type of mind illustrated by mérimée and meilhac and halévy which was hers also led her by reaction from the verbal sentimentality of an earlier generation to a style in conversation that rejects everything to do with fine language and the expression of lofty thoughts so that she made it a sort of element of good breeding when she was with a poet or a musician to talk only of the food that they were eating or the game of cards to which they would afterwards sit down this abstention had on a third person not conversant with her ways a disturbing effect which amounted to mystification mme de guermantes having asked him whether it would amuse him to come to luncheon to meet this or that famous poet devoured by curiosity he would arrive at the appointed hour the duchess was talking to the poet about the weather they sat down to luncheon “do you like this way of doing eggs” she asked the poet on hearing his approval which she shared for everything in her own house appeared to her exquisite including a horrible cider which she imported from guermantes “give monsieur some more eggs” she would tell the butler while the anxious fellowguest sat waiting for what must surely have been the object of the party since they had arranged to meet in spite of every sort of difficulty before the duchess the poet and he himself left paris but the meal went on one after another the courses were cleared away not without having first provided mme de guermantes with opportunities for clever witticisms or apt stories meanwhile the poet went on eating and neither duke nor duchess shewed any sign of remembering that he was a poet and presently the luncheon came to an end and the party broke up without a word having been said about the poetry which for all that everyone admired but to which by a reserve analogous to that of which swann had given me a foretaste no one might refer this reserve was simply a matter of good form but for the fellowguest if he thought at all about the matter there was something strangely melancholy about it all and these meals in the guermantes household made him think of the hours which timid lovers often spend together in talking trivialities until it is time to part without — whether from shyness from audacity or from awkwardness — the great secret which they would have been happier had they confessed ever succeeding in passing from their hearts to their lips it must however be added that this silence with regard to the serious matters which one was always waiting in vain to see approached if it might pass as characteristic of the duchess was by no means constant with her mme de guermantes had spent her girlhood in a society somewhat different equally aristocratic but less brilliant and above all less futile than that in which she now lived and one of wide culture it had left beneath her present frivolity a sort of bedrock of greater solidity invisibly nutritious to which indeed the duchess would repair in search very rarely though for she detested pedantry of some quotation from victor hugo or lamartine which extremely appropriate uttered with a look of true feeling from her fine eyes never failed to surprise and charm her audience sometimes even without any pretence of authority pertinently and quite simply she would give some dramatist and academician a piece of sage advice would make him modify a situation or alter an ending

   if in the drawingroom of mme de villeparisis just as in the church at combray on the day of mlle percepied’s wedding i had difficulty in discovering in the handsome too human face of mme de guermantes the unknown element of her name i at least thought that when she spoke her conversation profound mysterious would have a strangeness as of a mediaeval tapestry or a gothic window but in order that i should not be disappointed by the words which i should hear uttered by a person who called herself mme de guermantes even if i had not been in love with her it would not have sufficed that those words were fine beautiful and profound they would have had to reflect that amaranthine colour of the closing syllable of her name that colour which i had on my first sight of her been disappointed not to find in her person and had driven to take refuge in her mind of course i had already heard mme de villeparisis saintloup people whose intelligence was in no way extraordinary pronounce without any precaution this name guermantes simply as that of a person who was coming to see them or with whom they had promised to dine without seeming to feel that there were latent in her name the glow of yellowing woods in autumn and a whole mysterious tract of country but this must have been an affectation on their part as when the classic poets give us no warning of the profound purpose which they had all the same in writing an affectation which i myself also strove to imitate saying in the most natural tone “the duchesse de guermantes” as though it were a name that was just like other names and then everybody assured me that she was a highly intelligent woman a clever talker that she was one of a little group of most interesting people words which became accomplices of my dream for when they spoke of an intelligent group of clever talk it was not at all the sort of intelligence that i knew that i imagined not even that of the greatest minds it was not at all with men like bergotte that i peopled this group no by intelligence i understood an ineffable faculty gilded by the sun impregnated with a sylvan coolness indeed had she made the most intelligent remarks in the sense in which i understood the word when it was used of a philosopher or critic mme de guermantes would perhaps have disappointed even more keenly my expectation of so special a faculty than if in the course of a trivial conversation she had confined herself to discussing kitchen recipes or the furnishing of a country house to mentioning the names of neighbours and relatives of her own which would have given me a picture of her life

    “i thought i should find basin here he was meaning to come and see you today” said mme de guermantes to her aunt

    “i haven’t set eyes on your husband for some days” replied mme de villeparisis in a somewhat nettled tone “in fact i haven’t seen him’ well i have seen him once perhaps — since that charming joke he played on me of making my servants announce him as the queen of sweden”

   mme de guermantes formed a smile by contracting the corners of her mouth as though she were biting her veil

    “we met her at dinner last night at blanche leroi’s you wouldn’t know her now she’s positively enormous i’m sure she must have something the matter with her”

    “i was just telling these gentlemen that you said she looked like a frog”

   mme de guermantes uttered a sort of raucous sound intended to signify that she acknowledged the compliment

    “i don’t remember making such a charming comparison but if she was one before now she’s the frog that has succeeded in swelling to the size of the ox or rather it isn’t quite that because all her swelling is concentrated in front of her waist she’s more like a frog in an interesting condition”

    “ah that is quite clever” said mme de villeparisis secretly proud that her guests should be witnessing this display of her niece’s wit

    “it is purely arbitrary though” answered mme de guermantes ironically detaching this selected epithet as swann would have done “for i must admit i never saw a frog in the family way anyhow the frog in question who by the way is not asking for a king for i never saw her so skittish as she’s been since her husband died is coming to dine with us one day next week i promised i’d let you know in good time”

   mme de villeparisis gave vent to a confused growl from which emerged “i know she was dining with the mecklenburgs the night before last hannibal de bréauté was there he came and told me about it and was quite amusing i must say”

    “there was a man there who’s a great deal wittier than babal” said mme de guermantes who in view of her close friendship wih m de bréàutéconsalvi felt that she must advertise their intimacy by the use of this abbreviation “i mean m bergotte”

   i had never imagined that bergotte could be regarded as witty in fact i thought of him always as mingling with the intellectual section of humanity that is to say infinitely remote from that mysterious realm of which i had caught a glimpse through the purple hangings of a theatre box behind which making the duchess smile m de bréauté was holding with her in the language of the gods that unimaginable thing a conversation between people of the faubourg saintgermain i was stupefied to see the balance upset and bergotte rise above m de bréauté but above all i was dismayed to think that i had avoided bergotte on the evening of phèdre that i had not gone up and spoken to him when i heard mme de guermantes say to mme de villeparisis

    “he is the only person i have any wish to know” went on the duchess in whom one could always as at the turn of a mental tide see the flow of curiosity with regard to wellknown intellectuals sweep over the ebb of her aristocratic snobbishness “it would be such a pleasure”

   the presence of bergotte by my side which it would have been so easy for we to secure but which i had thought liable to give mme de guermantes a bad impression of myself would no doubt on the contrary have had the result that she would have signalled to me to join her in her box and would have invited me to bring the eminent writer one day to luncheon

    “i gather that he didn’t behave very well he was presented to m de cobourg and never uttered a word to him” said mme de guermantes dwelling on this odd characteristic as she might have recounted that a chinaman had blown his nose on a sheet of paper “he never once said ‘monseigneur’ to him” she added with an air of amusement at this detail as important to her mind as the refusal of a protestant during an audience with the pope to go on his knees before his holiness

   interested by these idiosyncrasies of bergotte she did not however appear to consider them reprehensible and seemed rather to find a certain merit in them though she would have been put to it to say of what sort despite this unusual mode of appreciating bergotte’s originality it was a fact which i was later oh not to regard as wholly negligible that mme de guermantes greatly to the surprise of many of her friends did consider bergotte more witty than m de bréauté thus it is that such judgments subversive isolated and yet after all just are delivered in the world of fashion by those rare minds that are superior to the rest and they sketch then the first rough outlines of the hierarchy of values as the next generation will establish it instead of abiding eternally by the old standards

   the comte d’argencourt chargé d’affaires at the belgian legation and a remote connexion of mme de villeparisis came limping in followed presently by two young men the baron de guermantes and h h the due de châtellerault whom mme de guermantes greeted with “how d’ye do young châtellerault” in a careless tone and without moving from her tuffet for she was a great friend of the young duke’s mother which had given him a deep and lifelong respect for her tall slender with golden hair and sunny complexions thoroughly of the guermantes type these two young men looked like a condensation of the light of the spring evening which was flooding the spacious room following a custom which was the fashion at that time they laid their silk hats on the floor by their feet the historian of the fronde thought that they were embarrassed like a peasant coming into the mayor’s office and not knowing what to do with his hat feeling that he ought in charity to come to the rescue of the awkwardness and timidity which he ascribed to them

    “no no” he said “don’t leave them on the floor they’ll be trodden on”

   a glance from the baron de guermantes tilting the plane of his pupils shot suddenly from them a wave of pure and piercing azure which froze the wellmeaning historian

    “what is that person’s name” i was asked by the baron who had just been introduced to me by mme de villeparisis

    “m pierre” i whispered

    “pierre what”

    “pierre it’s his name he’s a historian a most distinguished man”

    “really you don’t say so”

    “no it’s a new fashion with these young men to put their hats on the floor” mme de villeparisis explained “i’m like you i can never get used to it still it’s better than my nephew robert who always leaves his in the hall i tell him when i see him come in that he looks just like a clockmaker and i ask him if he’s come to wind the clocks”

    “you were speaking just now madame la marquise of m mole’s hat we shall soon be able like aristotle to compile a chapter on hats” said the historian of the fronde somewhat reassured by mme de villeparisis’s intervention but in so faint a voice that no one but myself overheard him

    “she really is astonishing the little duchess” said m d’argencourt pointing to mme de guermantes who was talking to g—— “whenever there’s a famous man in the room you’re sure to find him sitting with her evidently that must be the lion of the party over there it can’t always be m de borelli of course or m schlumberger or m d’avenel but then it’s bound to be m pierre loti or m edmond rostand yesterday evening at the doudeauvilles’ where by the way she was looking splendid in her emerald tiara and a pink dress with a long train she had m deschanel on one side and the german ambassador on the other she was holding forth to them about china the general public at a respectful distance where they couldn’t hear what was being said were wondering whether there wasn’t going to be war really you’d have said she was a queen holding her circle”

   everyone had gathered round mme de villeparisis to watch her painting

    “those flowers are a truly celestial pink” said legrandin “i should say skypink for there is such a thing as skypink just as there is skyblue but” he lowered his voice in the hope that he would not be heard by anyone but the marquise “i think i shall still give my vote to the silky living flesh tint of your rendering of them you leave pisanello and van huysun a long way behind with their laborious dead herbals”

   an artist however modest is always willing to hear himself preferred to his rivals and tries only to see that justice is done them

    “what makes you think that is that they painted the flowers of their period which we don’t have now but they did it with great skill”

    “ah the flowers of their period that is a most ingenious theory” exclaimed legrandin

    “i see you’re painting some fine cherry blossoms — or are they mayflowers” began the historian of the fronde not without hesitation as to the flower but with a note of confidence in his voice for he was beginning to forget the incident of the hats

    “no they’re apple blossom” said the duchesse de guermantes addressing her aunt

    “ah i see you’re a good countrywoman like me you can tell one flower from another”

    “why yes so they are but i thought the season for apple blossom was over now” said the historian seeking wildly to cover his mistake

    “oh dear no far from it it’s not out yet the trees won’t be in blossom for another fortnight not for three weeks perhaps” said the librarian who since he helped with the management of mme de villeparisis’s estates was better informed upon country matters

    “at least three weeks” put in the duchess “even round paris where they’re very far forward down in normandy don’t you know at his father’s place” she went on pointing to the young duc de châtellerault “where they have some splendid apple trees close to the seashore like a japanese screen they’re never really pink until after the twentieth of may”

    “i never see them” said the young duke “because they give me hay fever such a bore”

    “hay fever i never heard of that before” said the historian

    “it’s the fashionable complaint just now” the librarian informed him

    “that all depends you won’t get it at all probably if it’s a good year for apples you know le normand’s saying ‘when it’s a good year for apples    ’” put in m d’argencourt who not being really french was always trying to give himself a parisian air

    “you’re quite right” mme de villeparisis told her niece “these are from the south it was a florist who sent them round and asked me to accept them as a present you’re surprised i dare say monsieur valmère” she turned to the librarian “that a florist should make me a present of apple blossom well i may be an old woman but i’m not quite on the shelf yet i have still a few friends” she went on with a smile that might have been taken as a sign of her simple nature but meant rather i could not help feeling that she thought it effective to pride herself on the friendship of a mere florist when she moved in such distinguished circles

   bloch rose and went over to look at the flowers which mme de villeparisis was painting

    “never mind marquise” said the historian sitting down again “even though we should have another of those revolutions which have stained so many pages of our history with blood — and upon my soul in these days one can never tell” he added with a circular and circumspect glance as though to make sure that there was no ‘disaffected’ person in the room though he had not the least suspicion that there actually was “with a talent like yours and your five languages you would be certain to get on all right” the historian of the fronde was feeling quite refreshed for he had forgotten his insomnia but he suddenly remembered that he had not slept for the last six nights whereupon a crushing weariness born of his mind paralysed his limbs made him bow his shoulders and his melancholy face began to droop like an old man’s

   bloch tried to express his admiration in an appropriate gesture but only succeeded in knocking over with his elbow the glass containing the spray of apple blossom and all the water was spilled on the carpet

    “really you have the fingers of a fairy” went on to the marquise the historian who having his back turned to me at that moment had not noticed bloch’s clumsiness

   but bloch took this for a sneer at himself and to cover his shame in insolence retorted “it’s not of the slightest importance i’m not wet”

   mme de villeparisis rang the bell and a footman came to wipe the carpet and pick up the fragments of glass she invited the two young men to her theatricals and also mme de guermantes with the injunction

    “remember to tell gisèle and berthe” the duchesses d’auberjon and de portefin “to be here a little before two to help me” as she might have told the hired waiters to come early to arrange the tables

   she treated her princely relatives as she treated m de norpois without any of the little courtesies which she shewed to the historian cottard bloch and myself and they seemed to have no interest for her beyond the possibility of serving them up as food for our social curiosity this was because she knew that she need not put herself out to entertain people for whom she was not a more or less brilliant woman but the touchy old sister — who needed and received tactful handling — of their father or uncle there would have been no object in her trying to shine before them she could never have deceived them as to the strength and weakness of her position for they knew none so well her whole history and respected the illustrious race from which she sprang but above all they had ceased to be anything more for her than a dead stock which would not bear fruit again they would not let her know their new friends or share their pleasures she could obtain from them only their occasional presence or the possibility of speaking of them at her five o’clock teaparties as later on in her memoirs of which these parties were only a sort of rehearsal a preliminary reading aloud of the manuscript before a selected audience and the society which all these noble kinsmen and kinswomen served to interest to dazzle to enthral the society of the cottards of the blochs of the dramatists who were in the public eye at the moment of the historians of the fronde and such matters it was in this society that there existed for mme de villeparisis — failing that section of the fashionable world which did not call upon her — the movement the novelty all the entertainment of life it was from people like these that she was able to derive social benefits which made it well worth her while to let them meet now and then though without ever coming to know her the duchesse de guermantes dinners with remarkable men whose work had interested her a light opera or a pantomime staged complete by its author in her drawingroom boxes for interesting shows bloch got up to go he had said aloud that the incident of the broken flowerglass was of no importance but what he said to himself was different more different still what he thought “if people can’t train their servants to put flowers where they won’t be knocked over and wet their guests and probably cut their hands it’s much better not to go in for such luxuries” he muttered angrily he was one of those susceptible highly strung persons who cannot bear to think of themselves as having made a blunder which though they do not admit even to themselves that they have made it is enough to spoil their whole day in a black rage he was just making up his mind never to go into society again he had reached the point at which some distraction was imperative fortunately in another minute mme de villeparisis was to press him to stay either because she was aware of the general feeling among her friends and had noticed the tide of antisemitism that was beginning to rise or simply from carelessness she had not introduced him to any of the people in the room he however being little used to society felt bound before leaving the room to take leave of them all to shew his manners but without any friendliness he lowered his head several times buried his bearded chin in his collar scrutinised each of the party in turn through his glasses with a cold dissatisfied glare but mme de villeparisis stopped him she had still to discuss with him the little play which was to be performed in her house and also she did not wish him to leave before he had had the pleasure of meeting m de norpois whose failure to appear puzzled her although as an inducement to bloch this introduction was quite superfluous he having already decided to persuade the two actresses whose names he had mentioned to her to come and sing for nothing in the marquise’s drawingroom to enhance their own reputations at one of those parties to which all that was best and noblest in europe thronged he had even offered her in addition a tragic actress ‘with pure eyes fair as hera’ who would recite lyrical prose with a sense of plastic beauty but on hearing this lady’s name mme de villeparisis had declined for it was that of saintloup’s mistress

    “i have better news” she murmured in my ear “i really believe he’s quite cooled off now and that before very long they’ll be parted — in spite of an officer who has played an abominable part in the whole business” she added for robert’s family were beginning to look with a deadly hatred on m de borodino who had given him leave at the hairdresser’s instance to go to bruges and accused him of giving countenance to an infamous intrigue “it’s really too bad of him” said mme de villeparisis with that virtuous accent common to all the guermantes even the most depraved “too too bad” she repeated giving the word a trio of t’s one felt that she had no doubt of the prince’s being present at all their orgies but as kindness of heart was the old lady’s dominant quality her expression of frowning severity towards the horrible captain whose name she articulated with an ironical emphasis “the prince de borodino”— speaking as a woman for whom the empire simply did not count melted into a gentle smile at myself with a mechanical twitch of the eyelid indicating a vague understanding between us

    “i have a great admiration for de saintloupenbray” said bloch “dirty dog as he is because he’s so extremely wellbred i have a great admiration not for him but for wellbred people they’re so rare” he went on without thinking since he was himself so extremely illbred what offence his words were giving “i will give you an example which i consider most striking of his perfect breeding i met him once with a young gentleman just as he was about to spring into his wheeled chariot after he himself had buckled their splendid harness on a pair of steeds whose mangers were heaped with oats and barley who had no need of the flashing whip to urge them on he introduced us but i did not catch the gentleman’s name one never does catch people’s names when one’s introduced to them” he explained with a laugh this being one of his father’s witticisms “de saintloupenbray was perfectly calm made no fuss about the young gentleman seemed absolutely at his ease well i found out by pure chance a day or two later that the young gentleman was the son of sir rufus israels”

   the end of this story sounded less shocking than its preface for it remained quite incomprehensible to everyone in the room the fact was that sir rufus israels who seemed to bloch and his father an almost royal personage before whom saintloup ought to tremble was in the eyes of the guermantes world a foreign upstart tolerated in society on whose friendship nobody would ever have dreamed of priding himself far from it

    “i learned this” bloch informed us “from the person who holds sir rufus’s power of attorney he is a friend of my father and quite an extraordinary man oh an absolutely wonderful individual” he assured us with that affirmative energy that note of enthusiasm which one puts only into those convictions that did not originate with oneself

    “tell me” bloch went on lowering his voice to myself “how much do you suppose saintloup has not that it matters to me in the least you quite understand don’t you i’m interested from the balzacian point of view you don’t happen to know what it’s in french stocks foreign stocks or land or what”

   i could give him no information whatsoever suddenly raising his voice bloch asked if he might open the windows and without waiting for an answer went across the room to do so mme de villeparisis protested that he must not that she had a cold “of course if it’s bad for you” bloch was downcast “but you can’t say it’s not hot in here” and breaking into a laugh he put into the gaze with which he swept the room an appeal for support against mme de villeparisis he received none from these wellbred people his blazing eyes having failed to seduce any of the guests from their allegiance faded with resignation to their normal gravity of expression he acknowledged his defeat with “what’s the temperature seventytwo at least i should say i’m not surprised i’m simply dripping and i have not like the sage antenor son of the river aipheus the power to plunge myself in the paternal wave to stanch my sweat before laying my body in a bath of polished marble and anointing my limbs with fragrant oils” and with that need which people feel to outline for the use of others medical theories the application of which would be beneficial to their own health “well if you believe it’s good for you i must say i think you’re quite wrong it’s exactly what gives you your cold”

   bloch was overjoyed at the idea of meeting m de norpois he would like he told us to get him to talk about the dreyfus case “there’s a mentality at work there which i don’t altogether understand and it would be quite sensational to get an interview out of this eminent diplomat” he said in a tone of sarcasm so as not to appear to be rating himself below the ambassador

   mme de villeparisis was sorry that he had said this so loud but minded less when she saw that the librarian whose strong nationalist views kept her so to speak on leash was too far off to have overheard she was more shocked to hear bloch led on by that demon of illbreeding which made him permanently blind to the consequences of what he said inquiring with a laugh at the paternal pleasantry “haven’t i read a learned treatise by him in which he sets forth a string of irrefutable arguments to prove that the japanese war was bound to end in a russian victory and a japanese defeat he’s fairly paralytic now isn’t he i’m sure he’s the old boy i’ve seen taking aim at his chair before sliding across the room to it as if he was on wheels”

    “oh dear no not in the least like that just wait a minute” the marquise went on “i don’t know what he can be doing”

   she rang the bell and when the servant had appeared as she made no secret and indeed liked to advertise the fact that her old friend spent the greater part of his time in her house “go and tell m de norpois to come in” she ordered him “he is sorting some papers in my library he said he would be twenty minutes and i’ve been waiting now for an hour and threequarters he will tell you about the dreyfus case anything you want to know” she said gruffly to bloch “he doesn’t approve much of the way things are going”

   for m de norpois was not on good terms with the government of the day and mme de villeparisis although he had never taken the liberty of bringing any actual ministers to her house she still preserved all the unapproachable dignity of a great lady and remained outside and above the political relations which he was obliged to cultivate was kept well informed by him of everything that went on then too the politicians of the day would never have dared to ask m de norpois to introduce them to mme de villeparisis but several of them had gone down to see him at her house in the country when they needed his advice or help at critical conjectures one knew the address one went to the house one did not see its mistress but at dinner that evening she would say

    “i hear they’ve been down here bothering you i trust things are going better”

    “you are not in a hurry” she now asked bloch

    “no not at all i wanted to go because i am not very well in fact there is some talk of my taking a cure at vichy for my biliary ducts” he explained articulating the last words with a fiendish irony

    “why that’s where my nephew châtellerault’s got to go you must fix it up together is he still in the room he’s a nice boy you know” said mme de villeparisis and may quite well have meant what she said feeling that two people whom she knew had no reason not to be friends with each other

    “oh i dare say he wouldn’t care about that — i don’t really know him — at least i barely know him he is sitting over there” stammered bloch in ecstasy of confusion

   the butler could not have delivered his mistress’s message properly for m de norpois to make believe that he had just come in from the street and had not yet seen his hostess had picked up the first hat that he had found in the hall and came forward to kiss mme de villeparisis’s hand with great ceremony asking after her health with all the interest that people shew after a long separation he was not aware that the marquise had already destroyed any semblance of reality in this charade which she cut short by taking m de norpois and bloch into an adjoining room bloch who had observed all the courtesy that was being shewn to a person whom he had not yet discovered to be m de norpois had said to me trying to seem at his ease “who is that old idiot” perhaps too all this bowing and scraping by m de norpois had really shocked the better element in bloch’s nature the freer and more straightforward manners of a younger generation and he was partly sincere in condemning it as absurd however that might be it ceased to appear absurd and indeed delighted him the moment it was himself bloch to whom the salutations were addressed

    “monsieur l’ambassadeur” said mme de villeparisis “i should like you to know this gentleman monsieur bloch monsieur le marquis de norpois” she made a point despite her casual usage of m de norpois of addressing him always as “monsieur l’ambassadeur” as a social convention as well as from an exaggerated respect for his ambassadorial rank a respect which the marquis had inculcated in her and also with an instinctive application to him of the special manner less familiar and more ceremonious in relation to one particular man — which in the house of a distinguished woman in contrast to the liberties that she takes with her other guests marks that man out instantly as her lover

   m de norpois drowned his azure gaze in his white beard bent his tall body deep down as though he were bowing before all the famous and to him imposing connotations of the name bloch and murmured “i am delighted    ” whereat his young listener moved but feeling that the illustrious diplomat was going too far hastened to correct him saying “not at all on the contrary it is i who am delighted” but this ceremony which m de norpois in his friendship for mme de villeparisis repeated for the benefit of every fresh person that his old friend introduced to him did not seem to her adequate to the deserts of bloch to whom she said

    “just ask him anything you want to know take him into the other room if it’s more convenient he will be delighted to talk to you i think you wished to speak to him about the dreyfus case” she went on no more considering whether this would suit m de norpois than she would have thought of asking leave of the duchesse de montmorency’s portrait before having it lighted up for the historian or of the tea before pouring it into a cup

    “you must speak loud” she warned bloch “he’s a little deaf but he will tell you anything you want to know he knew bismarck very well and cavour that is so isn’t it” she raised her voice “you knew bismarck well”

    “have you got anything on the stocks” m de norpois asked me with a knowing air as he shook my hand warmly i took the opportunity to relieve him politely of the hat which he had felt obliged to bring ceremonially into the room for i saw that it was my own which he had inadvertently taken “you shewed me a somewhat laboured little thing in which you went in for a good deal of hairsplitting i gave you my opinion quite frankly what you had written was literally not worth the trouble of putting it on paper are you thinking of letting us have anything else you were greatly smitten with bergotte if i remember rightly” “you’re not to say anything against bergotte” put in the duchess “i don’t dispute his talent as a painter no one would duchess he understands all about etching if not brushwork on a large scale like m cherbuliez but it seems to me that in these days we have a tendency to confuse the arts and forget that the novelist’s business is rather to weave a plot and edify his readers than to fiddle away at producing a frontispiece or tailpiece in drypoint i shall be seeing your father on sunday at our good friend a j‘s” he went on turning again to myself

   i had hoped for a moment when i saw him talking to mme de guermantes that he would perhaps afford me for getting myself asked to her house the help he had refused me for getting to mme swann’s “another of my great favourites” i told him “is elstir it seems the duchesse de guermantes has some wonderful examples of his work particularly that admirable bunch of radishes which i remember at the exhibition and should so much like to see again what a masterpiece that is” and indeed if i had been a prominent person and had been asked to state what picture i liked best i should have named this bunch of radishes “a masterpiece” cried m de norpois with a surprised and reproachful air “it makes no pretence of being even a picture it is merely a sketch” he was right “if you label a clever little thing of that sort ‘masterpiece’ what have you got to say about hébert’s virgin or dagnanbouveret”

    “i heard you refusing to let him bring robert’s woman” said mme de guermantes to her aunt after bloch had taken the ambassador aside “i don’t think you’ll miss much she’s a perfect horror as you know without a vestige of talent and besides she’s grotesquely ugly”

    “do you mean to say you know her duchess” asked m d’argencourt

    “yes didn’t you know that she performed in my house before the whole of paris not that that’s anything for me to be proud of” explained mme de guermantes with a laugh glad nevertheless since the actress was under discussion to let it be known that she herself had had the first fruits of her foolishness “hallo i suppose i ought to be going now” she added without moving

   she had just seen her husband enter the room and these words were an allusion to the absurdity of their appearing to be paying a call together like a newly married couple rather than to the often strained relations that existed between her and the enormous fellow she had married who despite his increasing years still led the life of a gay bachelor ranging over the considerable party that was gathered round the teatable the genial cynical gaze — dazzled a little by the brightness of the setting sun — of the little round pupils lodged in the exact centre of his eyes like the ‘bulls’ which ‘the excellent marksman that he was could always hit with such perfect aim and precision the duke came forward with a bewildered cautious slowness as though alarmed by so brilliant a gathering he was afraid of treading on ladies’ skirts and interrupting conversations a permanent smile — suggesting a ‘good king of yvetot’— slightly pompous a halfopen hand floating like a shark’s fin by his side which he allowed to be vaguely clasped by his old friends and by the strangers who were introduced to him enabled him without his having to make a single movement or to interrupt his genial lazy royal progress to reward the assiduity of them all by simply murmuring “how do my boy how do my dear friend charmed monsieur bloch how do argencourt” and on coming to myself who was the most highly favoured when he had been told my name “how do my young neighbour how’s your father what a splendid fellow he is” he made no great demonstration except to mme de villeparisis who gave him goodday with a nod of her head drawing one hand from a pocket of her little apron

   being formidably rich in a world where everyone was steadily growing poorer and having secured the permanent attachment to his person of the idea of this enormous fortune he displayed all the vanity of the great nobleman reinforced by that of the man of means the refinement and breeding of the former just managing to control the latter’s selfsufficiency one could understand moreover that his success with women which made his wife so unhappy was not due merely to his name and fortune for he was still extremely good looking and his profile retained the purity the firmness of outline of a greek god’s

    “do you mean to tell me she performed in your house” m d’argencourt asked the duchess

    “well don’t you see she came to recite with a bunch of lilies in her hand and more lilies on her dress” mme de guermantes shared her aunt’s affectation of pronouncing certain words in an exceedingly rustic fashion but never rolled her r’s like mme de villeparisis

   before m de norpois under constraint from his hostess had taken bloch into the little recess where they could talk more freely i went up to the old diplomat for a moment and put in a word about my father’s academic chair he tried first of all to postpone the conversation to another day i pointed out that i was going to balbec “what going again to balbec why you’re a regular globetrotter” he listened to what i had to say at the name of leroybeaulieu he looked at me suspiciously i conjectured that he had perhaps said something disparaging to m leroybeaulieu about my father and was afraid of the economist’s having repeated it to him all at once he seemed animated by a positive affection for my father and after one of those opening hesitations out of which suddenly a word explodes as though in spite of the speaker whose irresistible conviction prevails over his halfhearted efforts at silence “no no” he said to me with emotion “your father must not stand in his own interest he must not it is not fair to himself he owes a certain respect to his own really great merits which would be compromised by such an adventure he is too big a man for that if he should be elected he will have everything to lose and nothing to gain he is not an orator thank heaven and that is the one thing that counts with my dear colleagues even if you only talk platitudes your father has an important goal in life he should march straight ahead towards it and not allow himself to turn aside to beat bushes even the bushes more thorny for that matter than flowery of the grove of academe besides he would not get many votes the academy likes to keep a postulant waiting for some time before taking him to its bosom for the present there is nothing to be done later on i don’t say but he must wait until the society itself comes in quest of him it makes a practice not a very fortunate practice a fetish rather of the farà da sè of our friends across the alps leroybeaulieu spoke to me about all this in a way i did not at all like i pointed out to him a little sharply perhaps that a man accustomed as he is to dealing with colonial imports and metals could not be expected to understand the part played by the imponderables as bismarck used to say but whatever happens your father must on no account put himself forward as a candidate principis obsta his friends would find themselves placed in a delicate position if he suddenly called upon them for their votes indeed” he broke forth with an air of candour fixing his blue eyes on my face “i am going to say a thing that you will be surprised to hear coming from me who am so fond of your father well simply because i am fond of him we are known as the inseparables —arcades ambo simply because i know the immense service that he can still render to his country the reefs from which he can steer her if he remains at the helm out of affection out of high regard for him out of patriotism i should not vote for him i fancy moreover that i have given him to understand that i should not” i seemed to discern in his eyes the stern assyrian profile of leroybeaulieu “so that to give him my vote now would be a sort of recantation on my part” m de norpois repeatedly dismissed his brpther academicians as old fossils other reasons apart every member of a club or academy likes to ascribe to his fellow members the type of character that is the direct converse of his own less for the advantage of being able to say “ah if it only rested with me” than for the satisfaction of making the election which he himself has managed to secure seem more difficult a greater distinction “i may tell you” he concluded “that in the best interests of you all i should prefer to see your father triumphantly elected in ten or fifteen years’ time” words which i assumed to have been dictated if not by jealousy at any rate by an utter lack of any willingness to oblige and which later on i was to recall when the course of events had given them a different meaning

    “you haven’t thought of giving the institute an address on the price of bread during the fronde i suppose” the historian of that movement timidly inquired of m de norpois “you could make a considerable success of a subject like that” which was to say “you would give me a colossal advertisement” he added smiling at the ambassador pusillanimously but with a warmth of feeling which made him raise his eyelids and expose a double horizon of eye i seemed to have seen this look before and yet i had met the historian for the first time this afternoon suddenly i remembered having seen the same expression in the eyes of a brazilian doctor who claimed to be able to cure choking fits of the kind from which i suffered by some absurd inhalation of the essential oils of plants when in the hope that he would pay more attention to my case i had told him that i knew professor cottard he had replied as though speaking in cotterd’s interest “now this treatment of mine if you were to tell him about it would give him the material for a most sensational paper for the academy of medicine” he had not ventured to press the matter but had stood gazing at me with the same air of interrogation timid anxious appealing which it had just puzzled me to see on the face of the historian of the fronde obviously the two men were not acquainted and had little nothing in common but psychological like physical laws have a more or less general application and the requisite conditions are the same an identical expression lights the eyes of different human animals as a single sunrise lights different places a long way apart which have no connexion with one another i did not hear the ambassador’s reply for the whole party with a good deal of noise had again gathered round mme de villeparisis to watch her at work

    “you know who’ we’re talking about basin” the duchess asked her husband

    “i can make a pretty good guess” said the duke

    “ah as an actress she’s not i’m afraid in what one would call the great tradition”

    “you can’t imagine” went on mme de guermantes to m d’argencourt “anything more ridiculous”

    “in fact it was drolatic” put in m de guermantes whose odd vocabulary enabled people in society to declare that he was no fool and literary people at the same time to regard him as a complete imbecile

    “what i fail to understand” resumed the duchess “is how in the world robert ever came to fall in love with her oh of course i know one mustn’t discuss that sort of thing” she added with the charming pout of a philosopher and sentimentalist whose last illusion had long been shattered “i know that anybody may fall in love with anybody else and” she went on for though she might still laugh at modern literature it either by its dissemination through the popular press or else in the course of conversation had begun to percolate into her mind “that is the really nice thing about love because it’s what makes it so ‘mysterious’”

    “mysterious oh i must confess cousin that’s a bit beyond me” said the comte d’argencourt

    “oh dear yes it’s a very mysterious thing love” declared the duchess with the sweet smile of a goodnatured woman of the world but also with the rooted conviction with which a wagnerian assures a bored gentleman from the club that there is something more than just noise in the walküre “after all one never does know what makes one person fall in love with another it may not be at all what we think” she added with a smile repudiating at once by this interpretation the idea she had just suggested “after all one never knows anything does one” she concluded with an air of weary scepticism “besides one understands doesn’t one one simply can’t explain other people’s choices in love”

   but having laid down this principle she proceeded at once to abandon it and to criticise saintloup’s choice

    “all the same don’t you know it is amazing to me that a man can find any attraction in a person who’s simply silly”

   bloch hearing saintloup’s name mentioned and gathering that he was in paris promptly made a remark about him so outrageous that everybody was shocked he was beginning to nourish hatreds and one felt that he would stop at nothing to gratify them once he had established the principle that he himself was of great moral worth and that the sort of people who frequented la boulie an athletic club which he supposed to be highly fashionable deserved penal servitude every blow he could get against them seemed to him praiseworthy he went so far once as to speak of a lawsuit which he was anxious to bring against one of his la poulie friends in the course of the trial he proposed to give certain evidence which would be entirely untrue though the defendant would be unable to impugn his veracity in this way bloch who incidentally never put his plan into action counted on baffling and infuriating his antagonist what harm could there be in that since he whom he sought to injure was a man who thought only of doing the ‘right thing’ a la boulie man and against people like that any weapon was justified especially in the hands of a saint such as bloch himself

    “i say though what about swann” objected m d’argencourt who having at last succeeded in understanding the point of his cousin’s speech was impressed by her accuracy of observation and was racking his brains for instances of men who had fallen in love with women in whom he himself had seen no attraction

    “oh but swann’s case was quite different” the duchess protested “it was a great surprise i admit because she’s just a wellmeaning idiot but she was never silly and she was at one time good looking”

    “oh oh” muttered mme de villeparisis

    “you never thought so surely she had some charming points very fine eyes good hair she used to dress and does still dress wonderfully nowadays i quite agree she’s horrible but she has been a lovely woman in her time not that that made me any less sorry when charles married her because it was so unnecessary” the duchess had not intended to say anything out of the common but as m d’argencourt began to laugh she repeated these last words — either because she thought them amusing or because she thought it nice of him to laugh — and looked up at him with a coaxing smile to add the enchantment of her femininity to that of her wit she went on “yes really it wasn’t worth the trouble was it still after all she did have some charm and i can quite understand anybody’s falling in love with her but if you saw robert’s girl i assure you you’d simply die of laughter oh i know somebody’s going to quote augier at me ‘what matters the bottle so long as one gets drunk’ well robert may have got drunk all right but he certaintly hasn’t shewn much taste in his choice of a bottle first of all would you believe that she actually expected me to fit up a staircase right in the middle of my drawingroom oh a mere nothing — what — and she announced that she was going to lie flat on her stomach on the steps and then if you’d heard the things she recited i only remember one scene but i’m sure nobody could imagine anything like it it was called the seven princesses”

    “seven princesses dear dear what a snob she must be” cried m d’argencourt “but wait a minute why i know the whole play the author sent a copy to the king who couldn’t understand a word of it and called on me to explain it to him”

    “it isn’t by any chance from the sar peladan” asked the historian of the fronde meaning to make a subtle and topical allusion but in so low a tone that his question passed unnoticed

    “so you know the seven princesses do you” replied the duchess “i congratulate you i only know one but she’s quite enough i have no wish to make the acquaintance of the other six if they are all like the one i’ve seen”

    “what a goose” i thought to myself irritated by the coldness of her greeting i found a sort of bitter satisfaction in this proof of her complete inability to understand maeterlinck “to think that’s the woman i walk miles every morning to see really i’m too kind well it’s my turn now not to want to see her” thus i reasoned with myself but my words ran counter to my thoughts they were purely conversational words such as we say to ourselves at those moments when too much excited to remain quietly alone we feel the need for want of another listener to talk to ourselves without meaning what we say as we talk to a stranger

    “i can’t tell you what it was like” the duchess went on “you simply couldn’t help laughing not that anyone tried rather the other way i’m sorry to say for the young person was not at all pleased and robert has never really forgiven me though i can’t say i’m sorry actually because if it had been a success the lady would perhaps have come again and i don’t quite see marieaynard approving of that”

   this was the name given in the family to robert’s mother mme de marsantes the widow of aynard de saintloup to distinguish her from her cousin the princesse de guermantesbavière also a marie to whose christian name her nephews and cousins and brothersinlaw added to avoid confusion either that of her husband or another of her own making her mariegilbert or mariehedwige

    “to begin with there was a sort of rehearsal the night before which was a wonderful affair” went on mme de guermantes in ironical pursuit of her theme “just imagine she uttered a sentence no not so much not a quarter of a sentence and then she stopped she didn’t open her mouth — i’m not exaggerating — for a good five minutes”

    “oh i say” cried m d’argencourt

    “with the utmost politeness i took the liberty of hinting to her that this might seem a little unusual and she said — i give you her actual words —‘one ought always to repeat a thing as though one were just composing it oneself’ when you think of it that really is monumental”

    “but i understood she wasn’t at all bad at reciting poetry” said one of the two young men

    “she hasn’t the ghost of a notion what poetry is” replied mme de guermantes “however i didn’t need to listen to her to tell that it was quite enough to see her come in with her lilies i knew at once that she couldn’t have any talent when i saw those lilies”

   everybody laughed

    “i hope my dear aunt you aren’t angry with me over my little joke the other day about the queen of sweden i’ve come to ask your forgiveness’

    “oh no i’m not at all angry i even give you leave to eat at my table if you’re hungry — come along m valmère you’re the daughter of the house” mme de villeparisis went on to the librarian repeating a timehonoured pleasantry

   m de guermantes sat upright in the armchair in which he had come to anchor his hat on the carpet by his side and examined with a satisfied smile the plate of little cakes that was being held out to him

    “this gentleman makes you an admirable daughter” commented m d’argencourt whom the spirit of imitation prompted to keep mme de villeparisis’s little joke in circulation

   the librarian handed the plate of cakes to the historian of the fronde

    “you perform your functions admirably” said the latter startled into speech and hoping also to win the sympathy of the crowd at the same time he cast a covert glance of connivance at those who had anticipated him

    “tell me my dear aunt” m de guermantes inquired of mme de villeparisis “who was that rather goodlooking man who was going out just now as i came in i must know him because he gave me a sweeping bow but i couldn’t place him at all you know i never can remember names it’s such a nuisance” he added in a tone of satisfaction

    “m legrandin”

    “oh but oriane has a cousin whose mother if i’m not mistaken was a grandin yes i remember quite well she was a grandin de l’epervier”

    “no” replied mme de villeparisis “no relation at all these are plain grandins grandins of nothing at all but they’d be only too glad to be grandins of anything you chose to name this one has a sister called mme de cambremer”

    “why basin you know quite well who’ my aunt means” cried the duchess indignantly “he’s the brother of that great graminivorous creature you had the weird idea of sending to call on me the other day she stayed a solid hour i thought i should go mad but i began by thinking it was she who was mad when i saw a person i didn’t know come browsing into the room looking exactly like a cow”

    “listen oriane she asked me what afternoon you were at home i couldn’t very well be rude to her and besides you do exaggerate so she’s not in the least like a cow” he added in a plaintive tone though not without a quick smiling glance at the audience

   he knew that his wife’s lively wit needed the stimulus of contradiction the contradiction of common sense which protests that one cannot for instance mistake a woman seriously for a cow by this process mme de guermantes enlarging upon her original idea had been inspired to produce many of her most brilliant sayings and the duke in his innocent fashion helped her without seeming to do so to bring off her effects like in a railway carriage the unacknowledged partner of the threecard player

    “i admit she doesn’t look like a cow she looks like a dozen” exclaimed mme de guermantes “i assure you i didn’t know what to do when i saw a herd of cattle come marching into my drawingroom in a hat and heard them ask me how i was i had half a mind to say ‘please herd of cattle you must be making a mistake you can’t possibly know me because you’re a herd of cattle’ but after racking my brains over her i came to the conclusion that your cambremer woman must be the infanta dorothea who had said she was coming to see me one day and is rather bovine also so that i was just on the point of saying ‘your royal highness’ and using the third person to a herd of cattle the cut of her dewlap reminded me rather too of the queen of sweden but this massed attack had been prepared for by long range artillery fire according to all the rules of war for i don’t know how long before i was bombarded with her cards i used to find them lying about all over the house on all the tables and chairs like prospectuses i couldn’t think what they were supposed to be advertising you saw nothing in the house but ‘marquis et marquise de cambremer’ with some address or other which i’ve forgotten you may be quite sure nothing will ever take me there”

    “but it’s a great distinction to look like a queen” said the historian of the fronde

    “gad sir kings and queens in these days don’t amount to much” said m de guermantes partly because he liked to be thought broadminded and modern and also so as not to seem to attach any importance to his own royal friendships which he valued highly

   bloch and m de norpois had returned from the other room and came towards us

    “well sir” asked mme de villeparisis “have you been talking to him about the dreyfus case”

   m de norpois raised his eyes to the ceiling but with a smile as though calling on heaven to witness the monstrosity of the caprices to which his dulcinea compelled him to submit nevertheless he spoke to bloch with great affability of the terrible perhaps fatal period through which france was passing as this presumably meant that m de norpois to whom bloch had confessed his belief in the innocence of dreyfus was an ardent antidreyfusard the ambassador’s geniality his air of tacit admission that his listener was in the right of never doubting that they were both of the same opinion of being prepared to join forces with him to overthrow the government flattered bloch’s vanity and aroused his curiosity what were the important points which m de norpois never specified but on which he seemed implicitly to affirm that he was in agreement with bloch what opinion then did he hold of the case that could bring them together bloch was all the more astonished at the mysterious unanimity which seemed to exist between him and m de norpois in that it was not confined to politics mme de villeparisis having spoken at some length to m de norpois of bloch’s literary work

    “you are not of your age” the former ambassador told him “and i congratulate you upon that you are not of this age in which disinterested work no longer exists in which writers offer the public nothing but obscenities or ineptitudes efforts such as yours ought to be encouraged and would be if we had a government”

   bloch was flattered by this picture of himself swimming alone amid a universal shipwreck but here again he would have been glad of details would have liked to know what were the ineptitudes to which m de norpois referred bloch had the feeling that he was working along the same lines as plenty of others he had never supposed himself to be so exceptional he returned to the dreyfus case but did not succeed in elucidating m de norpois’s own views he tried to induce him to speak of the officers whose names were appearing constantly in the newspapers at that time they aroused more curiosity than the politicians who were involved also because they were not like the politicians well known already but wearing a special garb emerging from the obscurity of a different kind of life and a religiously guarded silence simply stood up and spoke and disappeared again like lohengrin landing from a skiff drawn by a swan bloch had been able thanks to a nationalist lawyer of his acquaintance to secure admission to several hearings of the zola trial he would arrive there in the morning and stay until the court rose with a packet of sandwiches and a flask of coffee as though for the final examination for a degree and this change of routine stimulating a nervous excitement which the coffee and the emotional interest of the trial worked up to a climax he would come out so enamoured of everything that had happened in court that in the evening as he sat at home he would long to immerse himself again in that beautiful dream and would hurry out to a restaurant frequented by both parties in search of friends with whom he would go over interminably the whole of the day’s proceedings and make up by a supper ordered in an imperious tone which gave him the illusion of power for the hunger and exhaustion of a day begun so early and unbroken by any interval for luncheon the human mind hovering perpetually between the two planes of experience and imagination seeks to fathom the ideal life of the people it knows and to know the people whose life it has had to imagine to bloch’s questions m de norpois replied

    “there are two officers involved in the case now being tried of whom i remember hearing some time ago from a man in whose judgment i felt great confidence and who praised them both highly — i mean m de miribel they are lieutenantcolonel henry and lieutenantcolonel picquart”

    “but” exclaimed bloch “the divine athena daughter of zeus has put in the mind of one the opposite of what is in the mind of the other and they are fighting against one another like two lions colonel picquart had a splendid position in the army but his moira has led him to the side that was not rightly his the sword of the nationalists will carve his tender flesh and he will be cast out as food for the beasts of prey and the birds that wax fat upon the bodies of men”

   m de norpois made no reply

    “what are those two palavering about over there” m de guermantes asked mme de villeparisis indicating m de norpois and bloch

    “the dreyfus case”

    “the devil they are by the way do you know who is a redhot supporter of dreyfus i give you a thousand guesses my nephew robert i can tell you that at the jockey when they heard of his goings on there was a fine gathering of the clans a regular hue and cry and as he’s coming up for election next week    ”

    “of course” broke in the duchess “if they’re all like gilbert who keeps on saying that all the jews ought to be sent back to jerusalem”

    “indeed then the prince de guermantes is quite of my way of thinking” put in m d’argencourt

   the duke made a show of his wife but did not love her extremely selfcentred he hated to be interrupted besides he was in the habit at home of treating her brutally convulsed with the twofold rage of a bad husband when his wife speaks to him and a good talker wher he is not listened to he stopped short and transfixed the duchess with a glare which made everyone feel uncomfortable

    “what makes you think we want to hear about gilbert and jerusalem it’s nothing to do with that but” he went on in a gentler tone “you will agree that if one of our family were to be pilled at the jockey especially robert whose father was chairman for ten years it would be a pretty serious matter what can you expect my dear it’s got ’em on the raw those fellows they’re all over it i don’t blame them either personally you know that i have no racial prejudice all that sort of thing seems to me out of date and i do claim to move with the times but damn it all when one goes by the name of ‘marquis de saintloup’ one isn’t a dreyfusard what more can i say”

   m de guermantes uttered the words “when one goes by the name of marquis de saintloup” with some emphasis he knew very well that it was a far greater thing to go by that of duc de guermantes but if his selfesteem had a tendency to exaggerate if anything the superiority of the title duc de guermantes over all others it was perhaps not so much the rules of good taste as the laws of imagination that urged him thus to attenuate it each of us sees in the brightest colours what he sees at a distance what he sees in other people for the general laws which govern perspective in imagination apply just as much to dukes as to ordinary mortals and not only the laws of imagination but those of speech now either of two laws of speech may apply here one being that which makes us express ourselves like others of our mental category and not of our caste under this law m de guermantes might be in his choice of expressions even when he wished to talk about the nobility indebted to the humblest little tradesman who would have said “when one goes by the name of duc de guermantes” whereas an educated man a swann a legrandin would not have said it a duke may write novels worthy of a grocer even about life in high society titles and pedigrees being of no help to him there and the epithet ‘aristocratic’ be earned by the writings of a plebeian who had been in this instance the inferior from whom m de guermantes had picked up ‘when one goes by the name’ he had probably not the least idea but another law of speech is that from time to time as there appear and then vanish diseases of which nothing more is ever heard there come into being no one knows how spontaneously perhaps or by an accident like that which introduced into france a certain weed from america the seeds of which caught in the wool of a travelling rug fell on a railway embankment forms of speech which one hears in the same decade on the lips of people who have not in any way combined together to use them so just as in a certain year i heard bloch say referring to himself that “the most charming people the most brilliant the best known the most exclusive had discovered that there was only one man in paris whom they felt to be intelligent pleasant whom they could not do without — namely bloch” and heard the same phrase used by countless other young men who did not know him and varied it only by substituting their own names for his so i was often to hear this ‘when one goes by the name’

    “what can one expect” the duke went on “with the influence he’s come under it’s easy to understand”

    “still it is rather comic” suggested the duchess “when you think of his mother’s attitude how she bores us to tears with her patrie française morning noon and night”

    “yes but there’s not only his mother to be thought of you can’t humbug us like that there’s a damsel too a flybynight of the worst type she has far more influence over him than his mother and she happens to be a compatriot of master dreyfus she has passed on her state of mind to robert”

    “you may not have heard duke that there is a new word to describe that sort of mind” said the librarian who was secretary to the antirevisionist committee “they say ‘mentality’ it means exactly the same thing but it has this advantage that nobody knows what you’re talking about it is the very latest expression just now the ‘last word’ as people say” meanwhile having heard bloch’s name he was watching him question m de norpois with misgivings which aroused others as strong though of a different order in the marquise trembling before the librarian and always acting the antidreyfusard in his presence she dreaded what he would say were he to find out that she had asked to her house a jew more or less affiliated to the ‘syndicate’

    “indeed” said the duke “‘mentality’ you say i must make a note of that i shall use it some day” this was no figure of speech the duke having a little pocketbook filled with such ‘references’ which he used to consult before dinnerparties “i like ‘mentality’ there are a lot of new words like that which people suddenly start using but they never last i read somewhere the other day that some writer was ‘talentuous’ you may perhaps know what it means i don’t and since then i’ve never come across the word again”

    “but ‘mentality’ is more widely used than ‘talentuous’” the historian of the fronde made his way into the conversation “i am on a committee at the ministry of education at which i have heard it used several times as well as at my club the volney and indeed at dinner at m emile ollivier’s”

    “i who have not the honour to belong to the ministry of education” replied the duke with a feigned humility but with a vanity so intense that his lips could not refrain from curving in a smile nor his eyes from casting round his audience a glance sparkling with joy the ironical scorn in which made the poor historian blush “i who have not the honour to belong to the ministry of education” he repeated relishing the sound of his words “nor to the volney club my only clubs are the union and the jockey — you aren’t in the jockey i think sir” he asked the historian who blushing a still deeper red scenting an insult and failing to understand it began to tremble in every limb “i who am not even invited to dine with m emile ollivier i must confess that i had never heard ‘mentality’ i’m sure you’re in the same boat argencourt

    “you know” he went on “why they can’t produce the proofs of dreyfus’s guilt apparently it’s because the war minister’s wife was his mistress that’s what people are saying”

    “ah i thought it was the prime minister’s wife” said m d’argencourt

    “i think you’re all equally tiresome about this wretched case” said the duchesse de guermantes who in the social sphere was always anxious to shew that she did not allow herself to be led by anyone “it can’t make any difference to me so far as the jews are concerned for the simple reason that i don’t know any of them and i intend to remain in that state of blissful ignorance but on the other hand i do think it perfectly intolerable that just because they’re supposed to hold ‘sound’ views and don’t deal with jewish tradesmen or have ‘down with the jews’ printed on their sunshades we should have a swarm of durands and dubois and so forth women we should never have known but for this business forced down our throats by marieaynard or victurnienne i went to see marieaynard a couple of days ago it used to be so nice there nowadays one finds all the people one has spent one’s life trying to avoid on the pretext that they’re against dreyfus and others of whom you have no idea who they can be”

    “no it was the war minister’s wife at least that’s the bedside rumour” went on the duke who liked to flavour his conversation with certain expressions which he imagined to be of the old school “personally of course as everyone knows i take just the opposite view to my cousin gilbert i am not feudal like him i would go about with a negro if he was a friend of mine and i shouldn’t care two straws what anybody thought still after all you will agree with me that when one goes by the name of saintloup one doesn’t amuse oneself by running clean against the rails of public opinion which has more sense than voltaire or even my nephew nor does one go in for what i may be allowed to call these acrobatics of conscience a week before one comes up for a club it is a bit stiff really no it is probably that little wench of his that has put him on his high horse i expect she told him that he would be classed among the ‘intellectuals’ the intellectuals they’re the very cream of those gentry it’s given rise by the way to a rather amusing pun though a very naughty one”

   and the duke murmured lowering his voice for his wife’s and m d’argencourt’s benefit “mater semita” which had already made its way into the jockey club for of all the flying seeds in the world that to which are attached the most solid wings enabling it to be disseminated at the greatest distance from its parent branch is still a joke

    “we might ask this gentleman who has a nerudite air to explain it to us” he went on indicating the historian “but it is better not to repeat it especially as there’s not a vestige of truth in the suggestion i am not so ambitious as my cousin mirepoix who claims that she can trace the descent of her family before christ to the tribe of levi and i will undertake to prove that there has never been a drop of jewish blood in our family still there is no good in our shutting our eyes to the fact you may be sure that my dear nephew’s highly original views are liable to make a considerable stir at landerneau especially as fezensac is ill just now and duras will be running the election you know how he likes to make nuisances” concluded the duke who had never succeeded in learning the exact meaning of certain phrases and supposed ‘making nuisances’ to mean ‘making difficulties’

   bloch tried to pin m de norpois down on colonel picquart

    “there can be no two opinions” replied m de norpois “his evidence had to be taken i am well aware that by maintaining this attitude i have drawn screams of protest from more than one of my colleagues but to my mind the government were bound to let the colonel speak one can’t dance lightly out of a blind alley like that or if one does there’s always the risk of falling into a ditch as for the officer himself his statement gave one at the first hearing a most excellent impression when one saw him looking so well in that smart chasseur uniform come into court and relate in a perfectly simple and frank tone what he had seen and what he had deduced and say ‘on my honour as a soldier’” here m de norpois’s voice shook with a faint patriotic throb “‘such is my conviction’ it is impossible to deny that the impression he made was profound”

    “there he is a dreyfusard there’s not the least doubt of it” thought bloch

    “but where he entirely forfeited all the sympathy that he had managed to attract was when he was confronted with the registrar gribelin when one heard that old public servant a man who had only one answer to make” here m de norpois began to accentuate his words with the energy of his sincere convictions “when one listened to him when one saw him look his superior officer in the face not afraid to hold his head up to him and say to him in a tone that admitted of no response ‘colonel sir you know very well that i have never told a lie you know that at this moment as always i am speaking the truth’ the wind changed m picquart might move heaven and earth at the subsequent hearings he made a complete fiasco”

    “no evidently he’s an antidreyfusard it’s quite obvious” said bloch to himself “but if he considers picquart a traitor and a liar how can he take his revelations seriously and quote them as if he found them charming and believed them to be sincere and if on the other hand he sees in him an honest man easing his conscience how can he suppose him to have been lying when he was confronted with gribelin”

    “in any case if this man dreyfus is innocent” the duchess broke in “he hasn’t done much to prove it what idiotic raving letters he writes from that island i don’t know whether m esterhazy is any better but he does shew some skill in his choice of words a different tone altogether that can’t be very pleasant for the supporters of m dreyfus what a pity for them there’s no way of exchanging innocents” everybody laughed “you heard what oriane said” the duc de guermantes inquired eagerly of e de villeparisis “yes i think it most amusing” this was not enough for the duke “well i don’t know i can’t say that i thought it amusing or rather it doesn’t make the slightest difference to me whether a thing is amusing or not i don’t care about wit” m d’argencourt protested “it is probably because i’ve been a member of parliament where i have listened to brilliant speeches that meant absolutely nothing i learned there to value more than anything logic that’s probably why they didn’t elect me again amusing things leave me cold” “basin don’t play the heavy father like that my child you know quite well that no one admires wit more than you do” “please let me finish it is just because i am unmoved by a certain type of humour that i am often struck by my wife’s wit for you will find it based as a rule upon sound observation she reasons like a man she states her case like a writer”

   possibly the explanation of m de norpois’s speaking in this way to bloch as though they had been in agreement may have lain in the fact that he himself was so keen an antidreyfusard that finding the government not antidreyfusard enough he was its enemy just as much as the dreyfusards perhaps because the object to which he devoted himself in politics was something more profound situated on another plane from which dreyfusism appeared as an unimportant modality which did not deserve the attention of a patriot interested in large questions of foreign policy perhaps rather because the maxims of his political wisdom being applicable only to questions of form of procedure of expediency they were as powerless to solve questions of fact as in philosophy pure logic is powerless to tackle the problems of existence or else because that very wisdom made him see danger in handling such subjects and so in his caution he preferred to speak only of minor incidents but where bloch made a mistake was in thinking that m de norpois even had he been less cautious by nature and of a less exclusively formal cast of mind could supposing he would have told him the truth as to the part played by henry picquart or du paty de clam or as to any of the different aspects of the case the truth indeed as to all these matters bloch could not doubt that m de norpois knew how could he fail to know it seeing that he was a friend of all the ministers naturally bloch thought that the truth in politics could be approximately reconstructed by the most luminous minds but he imagined like the man in the street that it resided permanently beyond the reach of argument and in a material form in the secret files of the president of the republic and the prime minister who imparted it to their cabinet now even when a political truth does take the form of written documents it is seldom that these have any more value than a radiographic plate on which the layman imagines that the patient’s disease is inscribed in so many words when as a matter of fact the plate furnishes simply one piece of material for study to be combined with a number of others which the doctor’s reasoning powers will take into consideration as a whole and upon them found his diagnosis so too the truth in politics when one goes to wellinformed men and imagines that one is about to grasp it eludes one indeed later on to confine ourselves to the dreyfus case when so startling an event occurred as henry’s confession followed by his suicide this fact was at once interpreted in opposite ways by the dreyfusard ministers and by cavaignac and cuignet who had themselves made the discovery of the forgery and conducted the examination still more so among the dreyfusard ministers themselves men of the same shade of dreyfusism judging not only from the same documents but in the same spirit the part played by henry was explained in two entirely different ways one set seeing in him an accomplice of esterhazy the others assigning that part to du paty de clam thus rallying in support of a theory of their opponent cuignet and in complete opposition to their supporter reinach all that bloch could elicit from m de norpois was that if it were true that the chief of staff m de boisdeffre had had a secret communication sent to m rochefort it was evident that a singularly regrettable irregularity had occurred

    “you may be quite sure that the war minister must in petto at any rate be consigning his chief of staff to the infernal powers an official disclaimer would not have been to my mind a work of supererogation but the war minister expresses himself very bluntly on the matter inter pocula there are certain subjects moreover about which it is highly imprudent to create an agitation over which one cannot retain control afterwards”

    “but those documents are obviously forged” put in bloch

   m de norpois made no reply to this but announced that he did not approve of the manifestations that were being made by prince henri d’orléans

    “besides they can only ruffle the calm of the pretorium and encourage agitations which looked at from either point of view would be deplorable certainly we must put a stop to the antimilitarist conspiracy but we cannot possibly tolerate either a brawl encouraged by those elements on the right who instead of serving the patriotic ideal themselves are hoping to make it serve them heaven be praised france is not a south american republic and the need has not yet been felt here for a military pronunciamento”

   bioch could not get him to speak on the question of dreyfus’s guilt nor would he utter any forecast as to the judgment in the civil trial then proceeding on the other hand m de norpois seemed only too ready to indicate the consequences of this judgment

    “if it is a conviction” he said “it will probably be quashed for it is seldom that in a case where there has been such a number of witnesses there is not some flaw in the procedure which counsel can raise on appeal to return to prince henri’s outburst i greatly doubt whether it has met with his father’s approval”

    “you think chartres is for dreyfus” asked the duchess with a smile her eyes rounded her cheeks bright her nose buried in her plate her whole manner deliciously scandalised

    “not at all i meant only that there runs through the whole family on that side a political sense which we have seen in the admirable princesse clémentine carried to its highest power and which her son prince ferdinand has kept as a priceless inheritance you would never have found the prince of bulgaria clasping major esterhazy to his bosom”

    “he would have preferred a private soldier” murmured mme de guermantes who often met the bulgarian monarch at dinner at the prince de joinville’s and had said to him once when he asked if she was not envious “yes sir of your bracelets”

    “you aren’t going to mme de sagan’s ball this evening” m de norpois asked mme de villeparisis to cut short his conversation with bloch my friend had not failed to interest the ambassador who told us afterwards not without a quaint simplicity thinking no doubt of the traces that survived in bloch’s speech of the neohomeric manner which he had on the whole outgrown “he is rather amusing with that way of speaking a trifle old fashioned a trifle solemn you expect him to come out with ‘the learned sisters’ like lamartine or jeanbaptiste rousseau it has become quite uncommon in the youth of the present day as it was indeed in the generation before them we ourselves were inclined to be romantic” but however exceptional his companion may have seemed to him m de norpois decided that the conversation had lasted long enough

    “no sir i don’t go to balls any more” she replied with a charming grandmotherly smile “you’re going all of you i suppose you’re the right age for that sort of thing” she added embracing in a comprehensive glance m de châtellerault his friend and bloch “still i was asked” she went on pretending just for fun to be flattered by the distinction “in fact they came specially to ask me” ‘they’ being the princesse de sagan

    “i haven’t had a card” said bloch thinking that mme de villeparisis would at once offer to procure him one and that mme de sagan would be glad to see at her ball the friend of a woman whom she had called in person to invite

   the marquise made no reply and bloch did not press the point for he had another more serious matter to discuss with her and with that in view had already asked her whether he might call again in a couple of days having heard the two young men say that they had both just resigned from the rue royale club which was letting in every tom dick and harry he wished to ask mme de villeparisis to arrange for his election there

    “aren’t they rather bad form rather stuckup snobs these sagans” he inquired in a tone of sarcasm

    “not at all they’re the best we can do for you in that line” m d’argencourt who adopted all the catchwords of parisian society assured him

    “then” said bloch still half in irony “i suppose it’s one of the solemnities the great social fixtures of the season”

   mme de villeparisis turned merrily to mme de guermantes

    “tell us is it a great social solemnity mme de sagan’s ball”

    “it’s no good asking me” answered the duchess “i have never yet succeeded in finding out what a social solemnity is besides society isn’t my strong point”

    “indeed i thought it was just the other way” said bloch who supposed mme de guermantes to be speaking seriously

   he continued to the desperation of m de norpois to ply him with questions about the dreyfus case the ambassador declared that looking at it from outside he got the impression from du paty de clam of a somewhat cloudy brain which had perhaps not been very happily chosen to conduct that delicate operation which required so much coolness and discernment a judicial inquiry

    “i know that the socialist party are crying aloud for his head on a charger as well as for the immediate release of the prisoner from the devil’s isle but i think that we are not yet reduced to the necessity of passing the caudine forks of mm géraultrichard and company so far the whole case has been an utter mystery i don’t say that on one side just as much as on the other there has not been some pretty dirty work to be hushed up that certain of your client’s more or less disinterested protectors may have the best intentions i will not attempt to deny but you know that heaven is paved with such things” he added with a look of great subtlety “it is essential that the government should give the impression that they are not in the hands of the factions of the left and that they are not going to surrender themselves bound hand and foot at the demand of some pretorian guard or other which believe me is not the same thing as the army it stands to reason that should any fresh evidence come to light a new trial would be ordered and what follows from that obviously that to demand a new trial is to force an open door when the day comes the government will speak with no uncertain voice or will let fall into abeyance what is their essential prerogative cock and bull stories will no longer be enough we must appoint judges to try dreyfus and that will be an easy matter because although we have acquired the habit in our sweet france where we love to belittle ourselves of thinking or letting it be thought that in order to hear the words truth and justice it is necessary to cross the channel which is very often only a roundabout way of reaching the spree there are judges to be found outside berlin but once the machinery of government has been set in motion will you have ears for the voice of authority when it bids you perform your duty as a citizen will you have ears for its voice will you take your stand in the ranks of law and order when its patriotic appeal sounds will you have the wisdom not to turn a deaf ear but to answer ‘present’”

   m de norpois put these questions to bloch with a vehemence which while it alarmed my friend flattered him also for the ambassador spoke to him with the air of one addressing a whole party questioned him as though he had been in the confidence of that party and might be held responsible for the decisions which it would adopt “should you fail to disarm” m de norpois went on without waiting for bloch’s collective answer “should you before even the ink had dried on the decree ordering the fresh trial of the case obeying it matters not what insidious word of command fail i say to disarm and band yourselves rather in a sterile opposition which seems to some minds the ultima ratio of policy should you retire to your tents and burn your boats you would be doing so to your own damnation are you the prisoners of those who foment disorder have you given them pledges” bloch was in doubt how to answer m de norpois gave him no time “if the negative be true as i should like to think and if you have a little of what seems to me to be lamentably lacking in certain of your leaders and your friends namely political sense then on the day when the criminal court assembles if you do not allow yourselves to be dragooned by the fishers in troubled waters you will have won your battle i do not guarantee that the whole of the general staff is going to get away unscathed but it will be so much to the good if some of them at least can save their faces without setting the heather on fire

    “it stands to reason moreover that it is with the government that it rests to pronounce judgment and to close the list — already too long — of unpunished crimes not certainly at the bidding of socialist agitators nor yet of any obscure military mouthpiece” he added looking bloch boldly in the face perhaps with the instinct that leads all conservatives to establish support for themselves in the enemy’s camp “government action is not to be dictated by the highest bidder from wherever the bid may come the government are not thank heaven under the orders of colonel driant nor at the other end of the scale under m clemenceau’s we must curb the professional agitators and prevent them from raising their heads again france the vast majority here in france desires only to be allowed to work in orderly conditions as to that there can be no question whatever but we must not be afraid to enlighten public opinion and if a few sheep of the kind our friend rabelais knew so well should dash headlong into the water it would be as well to point out to them that the water in question was troubled that it had been troubled deliberately by an agency not within our borders in order to conceal the dangers lurking in its depths and the government ought not to give the impression that they are emerging from their passivity in selfdefence when they exercise the right which is essentially their own i mean that of setting the wheels of justice in motion the government will accept all your suggestions if it is proved that there has been a judicial error they can be sure of an overwhelming majority which would give them room to act with freedom”

    “you sir” said bloch turning to m d’argencourt to whom he had been made known with the rest of the party on that gentleman’s arrival “you are a dreyfusard of course they all are abroad”

    “it is a question that concerns only the french themselves don’t you think” replied m d’argencourt with that peculiar form of insolence which consists in ascribing to the other person an opinion which one must obviously know that he does not hold since he has just expressed one directly its opposite

   bloch coloured m d’argencourt smiled looking round the room and if this smile so long as it was directed at the rest of the company was charged with malice at bloch’s expense it became tempered with cordiality when finally it came to rest on the face of my friend so as to deprive him of any excuse for annoyance at the words which he had heard uttered though those words remained just as cruel mme de guermantes murmured something to m d’argencourt which i could not hear but which must have referred to bloch’s religion for there flitted at that moment over the face of the duchess that expression to which one’s fear of being noticed by the person of whom one is speaking gives a certain hesitancy and unreality while there is blended with it the inquisitive malicious amusement inspired in one by a group of human beings to which one feels oneself to be fundamentally alien to retrieve himself bloch turned to the duc de châtellerault “you sir as a frenchman you must be aware that people abroad are all dreyfusards although everyone pretends that in prance we never know what is going on abroad anyhow i know ï can talk freely to you saintloup told me so” but the young duke who felt that every one was turning against bloch and was a coward as people often are in society employing a mordant and precious form of wit which he seemed by a sort of collateral atavism to have inherited from m de charlus replied “you must not ask me sir to discuss the dreyfus case with you it is a subject which on principle i never mention except to japhetics” everyone smiled except bloch not that he was not himself in the habit of making scathing references to his jewish origin to that side of his ancestry which came from somewhere near sinai but instead of one of these epigrams doubtless because he had not one ready the operation of the internal machine brought to bloch’s lips something quite different and we caught only “but how on earth did you know who told you” as though he had been the son of a convict whereas given his name which had not exactly a christian sound and his face his surprise argued a certain simplicity of mind

   what m de norpois had said not having completely satisfied him he went up to the librarian and asked him whether mme de villeparisis did not sometimes have in her house m du paty de clam or m joseph reinach the librarian made no reply he was a nationalist and never ceased preaching to the marquise that the social revolution might break out at any moment and that she ought to shew more caution in the choice of her friends he asked himself whether bloch might not be a secret emissary of the syndicate come to collect information and went off at once to repeat to mme de villeparisis the questions that bloch had put to him she decided that at the best he was illbred and might be in a position to compromise m de norpois also she wished to give satisfaction to the librarian the only person of whom she went in fear by whom she was being indoctrinated though without any marked success every morning he read her m judet’s article in the petit journal she decided therefore to make it plain to bloch that he need not come to the house again and had no difficulty in finding among her social repertory the scene by which a great lady shows anyone her door a scene which does not in any way involve the raised finger and blazing eyes that people imagine as bloch came up to her to say goodbye buried in her deep armchair she seemed only halfawakened from a vague somnolence her sunken eyes gleamed with only the feeble though charming light of a pair of pearls bloch’s farewell barely pencilling on the marquise’s face a languid smile drew from her not a word nor did she offer him her hand this scene left bloch in utter bewilderment but as he was surrounded by a circle of spectators he felt that it could not be prolonged without disadvantage to himself and to force the marquise the hand which she had made no effort to take he himself thrust out at her mme de villeparisis was startled but doubtless while still bent upon giving an immediate satisfaction to the librarian and the antidreyfusard clan she wished at the same time to provide for the future and so contented herself with letting her eyelids droop over her closing eyes

    “i believe she’s asleep” said bloch to the librarian who feeling that he had the support of the marquise assumed an indignant air “goodbye madame” snouted bloch

   the old lady made the slight movement with her lips of a dying woman who wants to open her mouth but whose eye can no longer recognise people then she turned overflowing with a restored vitality to m d’argencourt while bloch left the room convinced that she must be ‘soft’ in the head full of curiosity and anxious to have more light thrown upon so strange an incident he came to see lier again a few days later she received him in the most friendly fashion because she was a goodnatured woman because the librarian was not there because she had in mind the little play which bloch was going to produce for her and finally because she had acted once and for all the little scene of the indignant lady that she had wished to act a scene that had been universally admired and discussed the same evening in various drawingrooms but in a version which had already ceased to bear any resemblance to the truth

    “you were speaking just now of the seven princesses duchess you know not that it’s anything to be proud of that the author of that — what shall i call it — that production is a compatriot of mine” said m d’argencourt with a fine scorn blended with satisfaction at knowing more than anyone else in the room about the author of a work which had been under discussion “yes he’s a belgian by nationality” he went on

    “indeed no we don’t accuse you of any responsibility for the seven princesses fortunately for yourself and your compatriots you are not like the author of that absurdity i know several charming belgians yourself your king who is inclined to be shy but full of wit my ligne cousins and heaps of others but you i am thankful to say do not speak the same language as the author of the seven princesses besides if you want to know it’s not worth talking about because really there is absolutely nothing in it you know the sort of people who are always trying to seem obscure and even plan to make themselves ridiculous to conceal the fact that they have not an idea in their heads if there was anything behind it all i may tell you that i’m not in the least afraid of a little daring” she added in a serious tone “provided that there is some idea in it i don’t know if you’ve seen borelli’s piece some people seem to have been shocked by it but i must say even if they stone me through the streets for saying it” she went on without stopping to think that she ran no very great risk of such a punishment “i found it immensely interesting but theseven princesses it’s all very well one of them having a fondness for my nephew i cannot carry family feeling quite    ”

   the duchess broke off abruptly for a lady came in who was the comtesse de marsantes robert’s mother mme de marsantes was regarded in the faubourg saintgermain as a superior being of a goodness a resignation that were positively angelic so i had been told and had had no particular reason to feel surprised not knowing at the same time that she was the sister of the duc de guermantes later i have always been taken aback whenever i have learned that such women melancholy pure victimised venerated like the ideal forms of saints in church windows had flowered from the same genealogical stem as brothers brutal debauched and vile brothers and sisters when they are closely alike in features as were the pue de guermantes and mme de marsantes ought i felt to have a single intellect in common the same heart as a person would have who might vary between good and evil moods but in whom one could not for all that expect to find a vast breadth of outlook if he had a narrow mind or a sublime abnegation if his heart was hard

   mme de marsantes attended brunetière’s lectures she fascinated the faubourg saintgermain and by her saintly life edified it as well but the morphological link of handsome nose and piercing gaze led one nevertheless to classify mme de marsantes in the same intellectual and moral family as her brother the duke i could not believe that the mere fact of her being a woman and perhaps those of her having had an unhappy life and won everyone’s sympathy could make a person be so different from the rest of her family as in the old romances where all the virtues and graces are combined in the sister of wild and lawless brothers it seemed to me that nature less unconventional than the old poets must make use almost exclusively of the elements common to the family and i was unable to credit her with enough power of invention to construct out of materials analogous to those that composed a fool and clod a lofty mind without the least strain of clownishness a saint unsoiled by any brutality mme de marsantes was wearing a gown of white surah embroidered with large palms on which stood out flowers of a different material these being black this was because three weeks earlier she had lost her cousin m de montmorency a bereavement which did not prevent her from paying calls or even from going to small dinners but always in mourning she was a great lady atavism had filled her with the frivolity of generations of life at court with all the superficial rigorous duties that that implies mme de marsantes had not had the strength of character to regret for any length of time the death of her father and mother but she would not for anything in the world have appeared in colours in the month following that of a cousin she was more than pleasant to me both because i was robert’s friend and because i did not move in the same world as he this pleasantness was accompanied by a pretence of shyness by that sort of intermittent withdrawal of the voice the eyes the mind which a woman draws back to her like a skirt that has indiscreetly spread so as not to take up too much room to remain stiff and erect even in her suppleness as a good upbringing teaches a good upbringing which must not however be taken too literally many of these ladies passing very swiftly into a complete dissolution of morals without ever losing the almost childlike correctness of their manners mme de marsantes was a trifle irritating in conversation since whenever she had occasion to speak of a plebeian as for instance bergotte or elstir she would say isolating the word giving it its full value intoning it on two different notes with a modulation peculiar to the guermantes “i have had the honour the great honour of meeting monsieur bergotte” or “of making the acquaintance of monsieur elstir” whether that her hearers might marvel at her humility or from the sam tendency that mme de guermantes shewed to revert to the use of obsolete forms as a protest against the slovenly usages of the present day in which people never professed themselves sufficiently ‘honoured’ whichever of these was the true reason one felt that when mme de marsantes said “i have had the honour the great honour” she felt she was playing an important part and shewing that she could take in the names of distinguished men as she would have welcomed the men themselves at her home in the country had they happened to be in the neighbourhood on the other hand as her family connexion was numerous as she was devoted to all her relatives as slow in speech and fond of explaining things at length she was always trying to make clear the exact degree of kinship she found herself without any desire to create an effect and without really caring to talk about anyone except touching peasants and sublime gamekeepers referring incessantly to all the mediatised houses in europe a failing which people less brilliantly connected than herself could not forgive and if they were at all intellectual derided as a sign of stupidity

   in the country mme de marsantes was adored for the good that she did but principally because the purity of a strain of blood into which for many generations there had flowed only what was greatest in the history of france had taken from her manner everything that the lower orders call ‘manners’ and had given her a perfect simplicity she never shrank from kissing a poor woman who was in trouble and would tell her to come up to the castle for a cartload of wood she was people said the perfect christian she was determined to find an immensely rich wife for robert being a great lady means playing the great lady that is to say to a certain extent playing at simplicity it is a pastime which costs an extremely high price all the more because simplicity charms people only on condition that they know that you are not bound to live simply that is to say that you are very rich some one said to me afterwards when i had told him of my meeting her “you saw of course that she must have been lovely as a young woman” but true beauty is so individual so novel always that one does not recognise it as beauty i said to myself this afternoon only that she had a tiny nose very blue eyes a long neck and a sad expression

    “listen” said mme de villeparisis to the duchesse de guermantes “i’m expecting a woman at any moment whom you don’t wish to know i thought i’d better warn you to avoid any unpleasantness but you needn’t be afraid i shall never have her here again only i was obliged to let her come today it’s swann’s wife”

   mme swann seeing the dimensions that the dreyfus case had begun to assume and fearing that her husband’s racial origin might be used against herself had besought him never again to allude to the prisoner’s innocence when he was not present she went farther and used to profess the most ardent nationalism in doing which she was only following the example of mme verdurin in whom a middleclass antisemitism latent hitherto had awakened and grown to a positive fury mme swann had won by this attitude the privilege of membership in several of the women’s leagues that were beginning to be formed in antisemitic society and had succeeded in making friends with various members of the aristocracy it may seem strange that so far from following their example the duchesse de guermantes so close a friend of swann had on the contrary always resisted his desire which he had not concealed from her to introduce to her his wife but we shall see in due course that this arose from the peculiar nature of the duchess who held that she was not ‘bound to’ do things and laid down with despotic force what had been decided by her social ‘free will’ which was extremely arbitrary

    “thank you for telling me” said the duchess “it would indeed be most unpleasant but as i know her by sight i shall be able to get away in time”

    “i assure you oriane she is really quite nice an excellent woman” said mme de marsantes

    “i have no doubt she is but i feel no need to assure myself of it”

    “have you been invited to lady israels’s” mme de villeparisis asked the duchess to change the conversation

    “why thank heaven i don’t know the woman” replied mme de guermantes “you must ask marieaynard she knows her i never could make out why”

    “i did indeed know her at one time” said mme de marsantes “i confess my faults but i have decided not to know her any more it seems she’s one of the very worst of them and makes no attempt to conceal it besides we have all been too trusting too hospitable i shall never go near anyone of that race again while we had old friends country cousins people of our own flesh and blood on whom we shut our doors we threw them open to jews and now we see what thanks we get from them but i’ve no right to speak i have an adorable son and like a young fool he says and does all the maddest things you can imagine” she went on having caught some allusion by m d’argencourt to robert “but talking of robert haven’t you seen him” she asked mme de villeparisis “being saturday i thought he’d be coming to paris on leave and in that case he would be sure to pay you a visit”

   as a matter of fact mme de marsantes thought that her son would not obtain leave that week but knowing that even if he did he would never dream of coming to see mme de villeparisis she hoped by making herself appear to have expected to find him in the room to procure his forgiveness from her susceptible aunt for all the visits that he had failed to pay her

    “robert here but i have never had a single word from him i don’t think i’ve seen him since balbec”

    “he is so busy he has so much to do” pleaded mme de marsantes

   a faint smile made mme de guermantes’s eyelashes quiver as she studied the circle which with the point of her sunshade she was tracing on the carpet whenever the duke had been too openly unfaithful to his wife mme de marsantes had always taken up the cudgels against her own brother on her sisterinlaw’s behalf the latter had a grateful and bitter memory of this protection and was not herself seriously shocked by robert’s pranks at this point the door opened again and robert himself entered the room

    “well talk of the saint” said mme de guermantes

   mme de marsantes who had her back to the door had not seen her son come in when she did catch sight of him her motherly bosom was convulsed with joy as by the beating of a wing her body half rose her seat her face quivered and she fastened on robert eyes big astonishment

    “what you’ve come how delightful what a surprise”

    “ah talk of the saint — i see” cried the belgian diplomat with a shout of laughter

    “delicious ain’t it” came tartly from the duchess who hated puns and had ventured on this one only with a pretence of making fun of herself

    “good afternoon robert” she said “i believe he’s forgotten his aunt”

   they talked for a moment probably about myself for as saintloup was leaving her to join his mother mme de guermantes turned to me

    “good afternoon how are you” was her greeting

   she allowed to rain on me the light of her azure gaze hesitated for a moment unfolded and stretched towards me the stem of her arm leaned forward her body which sprang rapidly backwards like a bush that has been pulled down to the ground and on being released returns to its natural position thus she acted under the fire of saintloup’s eyes which kept her under observation and were making frantic efforts to obtain some further concession still from his aunt fearing that our conversation might fail altogether he joined in to stimulate it and answered for me

    “he’s not very well just now he gets rather tired i think he would be a great deal better by the way if he saw you more often for i can’t help telling you that he admires you immensely”

    “oh but that’s very nice of him” said mme de guermantes in a deliberately casual tone as if i had brought her her cloak “i am most flattered”

    “look i must go and talk to my mother for a minute take my chair” said saintloup thus forcing me to sit down next to his aunt

   we were both silent

    “i see you sometimes in the morning” she said as though she were telling me something that i did not know and i for my part had never seen her “it’s so good for one a walk”

    “oriane” began mme de marsantes in a low tone “you said you were going on to mme de saintferréol’s would you be so very kind as to tell her not to expect me to dinner i shall stay at home now that i’ve got robert and one other thing but i hardly like to ask you if you would leave word as you pass to tell them to send out at once for a box of the cigars robert likes ‘corona’ they’re called i’ve none in the house”

   robert came up to us he had caught only the name of mme de saintferréol

    “who in the world is mme de saintferréol” he inquired in a sur — prised but decisive tone for he affected a studied ignorance of everything to do with society

    “but my dear boy you know quite well” said his mother “she’s vermandois’s sister it was she gave you that nice billiard table you liked so much”

    “what she’s vermandois’s sister i had no idea of that really my family are amazing” he went on turning so as to include me in the conversation and adopting unconsciously bloch’s intonation just as he borrowed his ideas “they know the most unheardof people people called saintferréol” emphasising the final consonant of each word “and names like that they go to balls they drive in victorias they lead a fabulous existence it’s prodigious”

   mme de guermantes made in her throat a slight short sharp sound as of an involuntary laugh which one chokes back meaning thereby to shew that she paid just as much tribute as the laws of kinship imposed on her to her nephew’s wit a servant came in to say that the prince von faffenheimmunsterburgweinigen had sent word to m de norpois that he was waiting

    “bring him in sir” said mme de villeparisis to the old ambassador who started in quest of the german minister

    “stop sir do you think i ought to shew him the miniature of the empress charlotte”

    “why i’m sure he’ll be delighted” said the ambassador in a tone of conviction and as though he were envying the fortunate minister the favour that was in store for him

    “oh i know he’s very sound” said mme de marsantes “and that is so rare among foreigners but i’ve found out all about him he is antisemitism personified”

   the prince’s name preserved in the boldness with which its opening syllables were — to borrow an expression from music — attacked and in the stammering repetition that scanned them the impulse the mannered simplicity the heavy delicacies of the teutonic race projected like green boughs over the ‘heim’ of dark blue enamel which glowed with the mystic light of a rhenish window behind the pale and finely wrought gildings of the german eighteenth century this name included among the several names of which it was composed that of a little german wateringplace to which as a child i had gone with my grandmother at the foot of a mountain honoured by the feet of goethe from the vineyards of which we used to drink at the kurhof their illustrious vintages with elaborate and sonorous names like the epithets which homer applies to his heroes and so scarcely had i heard the prince’s name spoken than before i had recalled the wateringplace the name itself seemed to shrink to grow rich with humanity to find large enough a little place in my memory to which it clung familiar earth to earth picturesque savoury light with something about it too that was authorised prescribed and then m de guermantes in explaining who the prince was quoted a number of his titles and i recognised the name of a village threaded by the river on which every evening my cure finished for the day i used to go in a boat amid the mosquitoes and that of a forest so far away that the doctor would not allow me to make the excursion to it and indeed it was comprehensible that the suzerainty of the lord extended to the surrounding places and associated afresh in the enumeration of his titles the names which one could read close together upon a map thus beneath the visor of the prince of the holy roman empire and knight of franconia it was the face of a dear and smiling land on which had often lingered for me the light of the sixo’clock sun that i saw at any rate before the prince rheingraf and elector palatine had entered the room for i speedily learned that the revenues which he drew from the forest and river peopled with gnomes and undines and from the enchanted mountain on which rose the ancient burg that cherished memories of luther and lewis the germanic he employed in keeping five charron motorcars a house in paris and one in london a box on mondays at the opera and another for the ‘tuesdays’ at the ‘français’ he did not seem to me nor did he seem to regard himself as different from other men of similar fortune and age who had a less poetic origin he had their culture their ideals he was proud of his rank but purely on account of the advantages it conferred on him and had now only one ambition in life to be elected a corresponding member of the academy of moral and political sciences which was the reason of his coming to see mme de villeparisis if he whose wife was a leader of the most exclusive set in berlin had begged to be introduced to the marquise it was not the result of any desire on his part for her acquaintance devoured for years past by this ambition to be elected to the institute he had unfortunately never been in a position to reckon above five the number of academicians who seemed prepared to vote for him he knew that m de norpois could by himself dispose of at least ten others a number which he was capable by skilful negotiations of increasing still further and so the prince who had known him in russia when they were both there as ambassadors had gone to see him and had done everything in his power to win him over but in vain might he multiply his friendly overtures procure for the marquis russian decorations quote him in articles on foreign politics he had had before him an ingrate a man in whose eyes all these attentions appeared to count as nothing who had not advanced the prospects of his candidature one inch had not even promised him his own vote no doubt m de norpois received him with extreme politeness indeed begged that he would not put himself out and “take the trouble to come so far out of his way” went himself to the prince’s residence and when the teutonic knight had launched his “i should like immensely to be your colleague” replied in a tone of deep emotion “ah i should be most happy” and no doubt a simpleton a dr cottard would have said to himself “well here he is in my house it was he who insisted on coming because he regards me as a more important person than himself he tells me that he would be happy to see me in the academy words do have some meaning after all damn it probably if he doesn’t offer to vote for me it is because it hasn’t occurred to him he lays so much stress on my great influence presumably he imagines that larks drop into my mouth ready roasted that i have all the support i want and that is why he doesn’t offer me his but i have only got to get him with his back to the wall and just say to him quietly ‘very well vote for me will you’ and he will be obliged to do it”

   but prince von faffenheim was no simpleton he was what dr cottard would have called ‘a fine diplomat’ and he knew that m de norpois was no less fine a one than himself nor a man who would have failed to realise without needing to be told that he could confer a favour on a candidate by voting for him the prince in his embassies and as foreign minister had conducted on his country’s behalf instead of as in the present instance his own many of those conversations in which one knows beforehand just bow far one is prepared to go and at what point one will decline to commit oneself he was not unaware that in this diplomatic language to talk meant to offer and it was for this reason that he had arranged for m de norpois to receive the cordon of saint andrew but if he had had to report to his government the conversation which he had subsequently had with m de norpois he would have stated in his dispatch “i realised that i had gone the wrong way to work” for as soon as he had returned to the subject of the institute m de norpois had repeated

    “i should like nothing better nothing could be better for my colleagues they ought i consider to feel genuinely honoured that you should have thought of them it is a really interesting candidature a little outside our ordinary course as you know the academy is very conventional it takes fright at everything which has at all a novel sound personally i deplore this how often have i had occasion to say as much to my colleagues i cannot be sure god forgive me that i did not even once let the word ‘hidebound’ escape me” he added in an undertone with a scandalised smile almost aside as in a scene on the stage casting at the prince a rapid sidelong glance from his blue eyes like a veteran actor studying the effect on his audience “you understand prince that i should not care to allow a personality so eminent as yourself to embark on a venture which was hopeless from the start so long as my colleagues’ ideas linger so far behind the times i consider that the wiser course will be to abstain but you may rest assured that if i were ever to discern a mind that was a little more modern a little more alive shewing itself in that college which is tending to become a mausoleum if i could reckon upon any possible chance of your success i should be the first to inform you of it”

    “the cordon was a mistake” thought the prince “the negotiations have not advanced in the least that is not what he wanted i have not yet laid my hand on the right key”

   this was a kind of reasoning of which m de norpois formed in the same school as the prince would also have been capable one may mock at the pedantic silliness with which diplomats of the norpois type go into ecstasies over some piece of official wording which is for all practical purposes meaningless but their childishness has this compensation diplomats know that in the loaded scales which assure that european or other equilibrium which we call peace good feeling sounding speeches earnest entreaties weigh very little and that the heavy weight the true determinant consists in something else in the possibility which the adversary does if he is strong enough or does not enjoy of satisfying in exchange for what one oneself wants a desire with this order of truths which an entirely disinterested person such as my grandmother for instance would not have understood m de norpois and prince von faffenheim had frequently had to deal chargé d’affaires in countries with which we had been within an ace of going to war m de norpois in his anxiety as to the turn which events were about to take knew very well that it was not by the word ‘peace’ nor by the word ‘war’ that it would be revealed to him but by some other apparently commonplace word a word of terror or blessing which the diplomat by the aid of his cipher would immediately read and to which to safeguard the honour of france he would respond in another word quite as commonplace but one beneath which the minister of the enemy nation would at once see written ‘war’ moreover in accordance with a timehonoured custom analogous to that which gave to the first meeting between two young people promised to one another in marriage the form of a chance encounter at a performance in the théâtre du gymnase the dialogue in the course of which destiny was to dictate the word ‘war’ or the word ‘peace’ was held as a rule not in the ministerial sanctum but on a bench in a kurgarten where the minister and m de norpois went independently to a thermal spring to drink at its source their little tumblers of some curative water by a sort of tacit convention they met at the hour appointed for their cure began by taking together a short stroll which beneath its innocent appearance each of the speakers knew to be as tragic as an order for mobilisation and so in a private matter like this nomination for election to the institute the prince had employed the same system of induction which had served him in his public career the same method of reading beneath superimposed symbols

   and certainly it would be wrong to pretend that my grandmother and the few who resembled her would have been alone in their failure to understand this kind of calculation for one thing the average human being practising a profession the lines of which have been laid down for him from the start comes near by his want of intuition to the ignorance which my grandmother owed to her lofty disinterestedness often one has to come down to ‘kept’ persons male or female before one finds the hidden spring of actions or words apparently of the most innocent nature in selfinterest in the bare necessity to keep alive what man does not know that when a woman whom he is going to pay says to him “don’t let’s talk about money” the speech must be regarded as what is called in music ‘a silent beat’ and that if later on she declares “you are far too much trouble you are always keeping things from me i’ve done with you” he must interpret this as “some one else has been offering me more” and yet this is only the language of a lady of easy virtue not so far removed from the ladies in society the apache furnishes more striking examples but m as norpois and the german prince if apaches and their ways were unknown to them had been accustomed to living on the same plane as nations which are also despite their greatness creatures of selfishness and cunning kept in order only by force by consideration of their material interests which may drive them to murder a murder that is often symbolic also since its mere hesitation or refusal to fight may spell for a nation the word ‘perish but inasmuch as all this is not set forth in yellow and otherwise coloured books the people as a whole are naturally pacific should they be warlike it is instinctively from hatred from a sense of injury not for the reasons which have made up the mind of their ruler on the advice of his norpois

   the following winter the prince was seriously ill he recovered but his heart was permanently affected

    “the devil” he said to himself “i can’t afford to lose any time over the institute if i wait too long i may be dead before they elect me that really would be unpleasant”

   he composed on the foreign politics of the last twenty years an essay for the revue des deux mondes in which he referred more than once and in the most flattering terms to m de norpois the french diplomat called upon him to thank him he added that he did not know how to express his gratitude the prince said to himself like a man who has been trying to fit various keys into a stubborn lock “still not the right one” and feeling somewhat out of breath as he shewed m de norpois to the door thought “damn it these fellows will see me in my grave before letting me in we must hurry up”

   that evening he met m de norpois again at the opera

    “my dear ambassador” he began to him “you told me today that you did not know what you could do to prove your gratitude it was a great exaggeration for you owe me none but i am going to be so indelicate as to take you at your word”

   m de norpois had no less high an esteem for the prince’s tact than the prince had for his he understood at once that it was not a request that prince von faffenheim was about to present to him but an offer and with a radiant affability made ready to hear it

    “well now you will think me highly indiscreet there are two people to whom i am greatly attached — in quite different ways as you will understand in a moment — two people both of whom have recently settled in paris where they intend to remain for the future my wife and the grand duchess john they are thinking of giving a few dinners chiefly in honour of the king and queen of england and what they would have liked more than anything in the world would have been to be able to offer their guests the company of a person for whom without knowing her they both of them feel a great admiration i confess that i did not know how i was going to gratify their wish when i learned just now by the most extraordinary accident that you were a friend of this person i know that she lives a most retired life and sees only a very few people —‘happy few’ as stendhal would say — but if you were to give me your backing with the generosity that you have always shewn me i am sure that she would allow you to present me to her and to convey to her the wishes of both the grand duchess and the princess perhaps she would consent to dine with us when the queen of england comes and then one never knows if we don’t bore her too much to spend the easter holidays with us at beaulieu at the grand duchess john’s the person i allude to is called the marquise de villeparisis i confess that the hope of becoming one of the frequenters of such a school of wit would console me would make me contemplate without regret the abandoning of my attempt at the institute for in her house too i understand there is a regular flow of intellect and brilliant talk”

   with an inexpressible sense of pleasure the prince felt that the lock no longer resisted and that at last the key was turning

    “such an alternative is wholly unnecessary my dear prince” replied m de norpois “nothing is more in harmony with the institute than the house you speak of which is a regular hotbed of academicians i shall convey your request to mme la marquise de villeparisis she will undoubtedly be flattered as for her dining with you she goes out very little and that will perhaps be more difficult to arrange but i shall present you to her and you can plead your cause in person you must on no account give up the academy tomorrow fortnight as it happens i shall be having luncheon before going on with him to an important meeting at leroybeaulieu’s without whom nobody can be elected i had already allowed myself in conversation with him to let fall your name with which naturally he was perfectly familiar he raised certain objections but it so happens that he requires the support of my group at the next election and i fully intend to return to the charge i shall tell him quite openly of the wholly cordial ties that unite us i shall not conceal from him that if you were to stand i should ask all my friends to vote for you” here the prince breathed a deep sigh of relief “and he knows that i have friends i consider that if i were to succeed in obtaining his assistance your chances would become very strong come that evening at six to mme de villeparisis’s i will introduce you to her and i can give you an account then of my conversation with him”

   thus it was that prince von faffenheim had been led to call upon mme de villeparisis my profound disillusionment occurred when he spoke it had never struck me that if an epoch in history has features both particular and general which are stronger than those of a nationality so that in a biographical dictionary with illustrations which go so far as to include an authentic portrait of minerva leibniz with his wig and ruff differs little from marivaux or samuel bernard a nationality has particular features stronger than those of a caste in the present instance these were rendered before me not by a discourse in which i had expected before i saw him to hear the rustling of the elves and the dance of the kobolds but by a transposition which certified no less plainly that poetic origin the fact that as he bowed short red corpulent over the hand of mme de villeparisis the rheingraf said to her “aow to you too matame la marquise” in the accent of an alsatian porter

    “won’t you let me give you a cup of tea or a little of this cake it is so good” mme de guermantes asked me anxious to have shewn herself as friendly as possible “i do the honours in this house just as if it was mine” she explained in an ironical tone which gave a slightly guttural sound to her voice as though she were trying to stifle a hoarse laugh

    “sir” said mme de villeparisis to m de norpois “you won’t forget that you have something to say to the prince about the academy”

   mme de guermantes lowered her eyes and gave a semicircular turn to her wrist to look at the time

    “gracious i must fly at once if i’m to get to mme de saintferréol’s and i’m dining with mme leroi”

   and she rose without bidding me goodbye she had just caught sight of mme swann who appeared considerably embarrassed at finding me in the room she remembered doubtless that she had been the first to assure me that she was convinced of dreyfus’s innocence

    “i don’t want my mother to introduce me to mme swann” saintloup said to me “she’s an exwhore her husband’s a jew and she comes here to pose as a nationalist hallo here’s uncle palamède”

   the arrival of mme swann had a special interest for me due to an incident which had occurred a few days earlier and which i am obliged to record on account of the consequences which it was to have at a much later date as the reader will learn in due course well a few days before this visit to mme de villeparisis i had myself received a visitor whom i little expected namely charles morel the son though i had never heard of his existence of my greatuncle’s old servant this greatuncle he in whose house i had met the lady in pink had died the year before his servant had more than once expressed his intention of coming to see me i had no idea of the object of his visit but should have been glad to see him for i had learned from françoise that he had a genuine veneration for my uncle’s memory and made a pilgrimage regularly to the cemetery in which he was buried but being obliged for reasons of health to retire to his home in the country where he expected to remain for some time he delegated the duty to his son i was surprised to see come into my room a handsome young fellow of eighteen dressed with expensive rather than good taste but looking all the same like anything in the world except the son of a gentleman’s servant he made a point moreover at the start of our conversation of severing all connexion with the domestic class from which he sprang by informing me with a smile of satisfaction that he had won the first prize at the conservatoire the object of his visit to me was as follows his father when going through the effects of my uncle adolphe had set aside some which he felt could not very well be sent to my parents but were at the same time of a nature likely to interest a young man of my age these were the photographs of the famous actresses the notorious courtesans whom my uncle had known the last fading pictures of that gay life of a man about town which he divided by a watertight compartment from his family life while young morel was shewing them to me i noticed that he addressed me as though he were speaking to an equal he derived from saying ‘you’ to me as often and ‘sir’ as seldom as possible the pleasure natural in one whose father had never ventured when addressing my parents upon anything but the third person almost all these photographs bore an inscription such as “to my best friend” one actress less grateful and more circumspect than the rest had written “to the best of friends” which enabled her so i was assured to say afterwards that my uncle was in no sense and had never been her best friend but was merely the friend who had done the most little services for her the friend she made use of a good kind man in other words an old fool in vain might young morel seek to divest himself of his lowly origin one felt that the shade of my uncle adolphe venerable and gigantic in the eyes of the old servant had never ceased to hover almost a holy vision over the childhood and boyhood of the son while i was turning over the photographs charles morel examined my room and as i was looking for some place in which i might keep them “how is it” he asked me in a tone in which the reproach had no need to find expression so im plicit was it in the words themselves “that i don’t see a single photograph of your uncle in your room” i felt the blood rise to my cheeks and stammered “why i don’t believe i have such a thing” “what you haven’t one photograph of your uncle adolphe who was so devoted to you i— will send you one of my governor’s — he has quantities of them — and i hope you will set it up in the place of honour above that chest of drawers which came to you from your uncle” it is true that as i had not even a photograph of my father or mother in my room there was nothing so very shocking in there not being one of my uncle adolphe but it was easy enough to see that for old morel who had trained his son in the same way of thinking my uncle was the important person in the family my parents only reflecting a diminished light from his i was in higher favour because my uncle used constantly to say that i was going to turn out a sort of racine or vaulabelle and morel regarded me almost as an adopted son as a child by election of my uncle i soon discovered that this young man was extremely ‘pushing’ thus at this first meeting he asked me being something of a composer as well and capable of setting short poems to music whether i knew any poet who had a good position in society i mentioned one he did not know the work of this poet and had never heard his name of which he made a note well i found out that shortly afterwards he wrote to the poet telling him that a fanatical admirer of his work he morel had composed a musical setting for one of his sonnets and would be grateful if the author would arrange for its performance at the comtesse soandso’s this was going a little too fast and exposing his hand the poet taking offence made no reply

   for the rest charles morel seemed to have besides his ambition a strong leaning towards more concrete realities he had noticed as he came through the courtyard jupien’s niece at work upon a waistcoat and although he explained to me only that he happened to want a fancy waistcoat at that very moment i felt that the girl had made a vivid impression on him he had no hesitation about asking me to come downstairs and introduce him to her “but not as a connexion of your family you follow me i rely on your discretion not to drag in my father say just a distinguished artist of your acquaintance you know how important it is to make a good impression on tradespeople” albeit he had suggested to me that not knowing him well enough to call him he quite realised‘dear friend’ i might address him before the girl in some such terms as “not dear master of course although    well if you like dear distinguished artist” once in the shop i avoided ‘qualifying’ him as saintsimon would have expressed it and contented myself with reiterating his ‘you’ he picked out from several patterns of velvet one of the brightest red imaginable and so loud that for all his bad taste he was never able to wear the waistcoat when it was made the girl settled down to work again with her two ‘apprentices’ but it struck me that the impression had been mutual and that charles morel whom she regarded as of her own ‘station’ only smarter and richer had proved singularly attractive to her as i had been greatly surprised to find among the photographs which his father had sent me one of the portrait of miss sacripant otherwise odette by elstir i said to charles morel as i went with him to the outer gate “i don’t suppose you can tell me but did my uncle know this lady well i don’t see at what stage in his life i can fit her in exactly and it interests me because of m swann    ” “why if i wasn’t forgetting to tell you that my father asked me specially to draw your attention to that lady’s picture as a matter of fact she was ‘lunching’ with your uncle the last time you ever saw him my father was in two minds whether to let you in it seems you made a great impression on the wench and she hoped to see more of you but just at that time there was some trouble in the family by what my father tells me and you never set eyes on your uncle again” he broke off with a smile of farewell across the courtyard at jupien’s niece she was watching him and admiring no doubt his thin face and regular features his fair hair and sparkling eyes i as i gave him my hand was thinking of mme swann and saying to myself with amazement so far apart so different were they in my memory that i should have henceforth to identify her with the ‘lady in pink’

   m de charlus was not long in taking his place by the side of mme swann at every social gathering at which he appeared and contemptuous towards the men courted by the women promptly attached himself to the smartest of the latter whose garments he seemed almost to put on as an ornament to his own the baron’s frock coat or swallowtails made one think of a portrait by some great painter of a man dressed in black but having by his side thrown over a chair the brilliantly coloured cloak which he is about to wear at some costume ball this partnership generally with some royal lady secured for m de charlus various privileges which he liked to enjoy for instance one result of it was that his hostesses at theatricals or concerts allowed the baron alone to have a front seat in a row of ladies while the rest of the men were crowded together at the back of the room and then besides completely absorbed it seemed in repeating at the top of his voice amusing stories to the enraptured lady m de charlus was dispensed from the necessity of going to shake hands with any of the others was set free in other words from all social duties behind the scented barrier in which the beauty of his choice enclosed him he was isolated amid a crowded drawingroom as in a crowded theatre or concerthall behind the rampart of a box and when anyone came up to greet him through so to speak the beauty of his companion it was permissible for him to reply quite curtly and without interrupting his business of conversation with a lady certainly mme swann was scarcely of the rank of the people with whom he liked thus to flaunt himself but he professed admiration for her friendship for swann he knew that she would be flattered by his attentions and was himself flattered at being compromised by the prettiest woman in the room

   mme de villeparisis meanwhile was not too well pleased to receive a visit from m de charlus he while admitting serious defects in his aunt’s character was genuinely fond of her but every now and then carried away by anger by an imaginary grievance he would sit down and write to her without making any attempt to resist his impulse letters full of the most violent abuse in which in made the most of trifling incidents which until then he seemed never even to have noticed among other examples i may instance the following which my stay at balbec brought to my knowledgemme de villeparisis fearing that she had not brought enough money with her to balbec to enable her to prolong her holiday there and not caring since she was of a thrifty disposition and shrank from unnecessary expenditure to have money sent to her from paris had borrowed three thousand francs from m de charlus a month later annoyed for some trivial reason with his aunt he asked her to repay him this sum by telegraph he received two thousand nine hundred and ninetyodd francs meeting his aunt a few days later in paris in the course of a friendly conversation he drew her attention with the utmost politeness to the mistake that her banker had made when sending the money “but there was no mistake” replied mme de villeparisis “the money order cost six francs seventyfive” “oh of course if it was intentional it is all right” said m de charlus “i mentioned it only in case you didn’t know because in that case if the bank had done the same thing with anyone who didn’t know you as well as i do it might have led to unpleasantness” “no no there was no mistake” “after all you were quite right” m de charlus concluded easily stooping to kiss his aunt’s hand and in fact he bore no resentment and was only amused at this little instance of her thrift but some time afterwards imagining that in a family matter his aunt had been trying to get the better of him and had ‘worked up a regular conspiracy’ against him as she took shelter foolishly enough behind the lawyers with whom he suspected her of having plotted to undo him he had written her a letter boiling over with insolence and rage “i shall not be satisfied with having my revenge” he added as a postscript “i shall take care to make you a laughingstock tomorrow i shall tell everyone the story of the money order and the six francs seventyfive you kept back from me out of the three thousand i lent you i shall disgrace you publicly” instead of so doing he had gone to his aunt the next day to beg her pardon having already regretted a letter in which he had used some really terrible language but apart from this to whom could he have told the story of the money order seeking no longer vengeance but a sincere reconciliation now was the time for him to keep silence but already he had repeated the story everywhere while still on the best of terms with his aunt he had told it without any malice as a joke and because he was the soul of indiscretion he had repeated the story but without mme de villeparisis’s knowledge with the result that having learned from his letter that he intended to disgrace her by making public a transaction in which he had told her with his own lips that she had acted rightly she concluded that he had been deceiving her from the first and had lied when he pretended to be fond of her this storm had now died down but neither of them knew what opinion exactly the other had of her or him this sort of intermittent quarrel is of course somewhat exceptional of a different order were the quarrels of bloch and his friends of a dif — ferent order again were those of m de charlus as we shall presently see with people wholly unlike mme de villeparisis in spite of which we must bear in mind that the opinions which we hold of one another our relations with friends and kinsfolk are in no sense permanent save in appearance but are as eternally fluid as the sea itself whence all the rumours of divorce between couples who have always seemed so perfectly united and will soon afterwards speak of one another with affection hence all the terrible things said by one friend of another from whom we supposed him to be inseparable and with whom we shall find him once more reconciled before we have had time to recover from our surprise all the ruptures of alliances after so short a time between nations

    “i say my uncle and mme swann are getting warm over there” remarked saintloup “and look at mamma in the innocence of her heart going across to disturb them to the pure all things are pure i suppose”

   i studied m de charlus the tuft of his grey hair his eye the brow of which was raised by his monocle to emit a smile the red flowers in his buttonhole formed so to speak the three mobile apices of a convulsive and striking triangle i had not ventured to bow to him for he had given me no sign of recognition and yet albeit he had not turned his head in my direction i was convinced that he had seen me while he repeated some story to mme swann whose sumptuous pansycoloured cloak floated actually over the baron’s knee his roving eye like that of a street hawker who is watching all the time for the ‘tecs’ to appear had certainly explored every corner of the room and taken note of all the people who were in it m de châtellerault came up to bid him good day without any indication on m de charlus’s face that he had seen the young duke until he was actually standing in front of him in this way in fairly numerous gatherings such as this m de charlus kept almost continuously on show a smile without any definite direction or particular object which preexisting before the greetings of new arrivals found itself when these entered its zone devoid of any indication of friendliness towards them nevertheless it was obviously my duty to go across and speak to mme swann but as she was not certain whether i already knew mme de marsantes and m de charlus she was distinctly cold fearing no doubt that i might ask her to introduce me to them i then made my way to m de charlus and at once regretted it for though he could not have helped seeing me he shewed no sign whatsoever as i stood before him and bowed i found standing out from his body which it prevented me from approaching by the full length of his outstretched arm a finger widowed one would have said of an episcopal ring of which he appeared to be offering for the kiss of the faithful the consecrated site and i was made to appear to have penetrated without leave from the baron and by an act of trespass for which he would hold me permanently responsible the anonymous and vacant dispersion of his smile this coldness was hardly of a kind to encourage mme swann to melt from hers

    “how tired and worried you look” said mme de marsantes to her son who had come up to greet m de charlus

   and indeed the expression in robert’s eyes seemed every minute to reach a depth from which it rose at once like a diver who has touched bottom this bottom which hurt robert so when he touched it that he left it at once to return to it a moment later was the thought that he had quarrelled with his mistress

    “never mind” his mother went on stroking his cheek “never mind it’s good to see my little boy again”

   but this show of affection seeming to irritate robert mme de marsantes led her son away to the other end of the room where in an alcove hung with yellow silk a group of beauvais armchairs massed their violethued tapestries like purple irises in a field of buttercups mme swann finding herself alone and having realised that i was a friend of saintloup beckoned to me to come and sit beside her not having seen her for so long i did not know what to talk to her about i was keeping an eye on my hat among the crowd of hats that littered the carpet and i asked myself with a vague curiosity to whom one of them could belong which was not that of the duc de guermantes and yet in the lining of which a capital ‘g’ was surmounted by a ducal coronet i knew who everyone in the room was and could not think of anyone whose hat this could possibly be

    “what a pleasant man m de norpois is” i said to mme swann looking at the ambassador “it is true robert de saintloup says he’s a pest but    ”

    “he is quite right” she replied

   seeing from her face that she was thinking of something which she was keeping from me i plied her with questions for the satisfaction of appearing to be greatly taken up by some one in this room where she knew hardly anyone she took me into a corner

    “i am sure this is what m de saintloup meant” she began “but you must never tell him i said so for he would think me indiscreet and i value his esteem very highly i am an ‘honest injun’ don’t you know the other day charlus was dining at the princesse de guermantes’s i don’t know how it was but your name was mentioned m de norpois seems to have told them — it’s all too silly for words don’t go and worry yourself to death over it nobody paid any attention they all knew only too well the mischievous tongue that said it — that you were a hypocritical little flatterer”

   i have recorded a long way back my stupefaction at the discovery that a friend of my father such as m de norpois was could have expressed himself thus in speaking of me i was even more astonished to learn that my emotion on that evening long ago when i had asked him about mme swann and gilberte was known to the princesse de guermantes whom i imagined never to have heard of my existence each of our actions our words our attitudes is cut off from the ‘world’ from the people who have not directly perceived it by a medium the permeability of which is of infinite variation and remains unknown to ourselves having learned by experience that some important utterance which we eagerly hoped would be disseminated such as those so enthusiastic speeches which i used at one time to make to all comers and on every occasion on the subject of mme swann has found itself often simply on account of our anxiety immediately hidden under a bushel how immeasurably less do we suppose that some tiny word which we ourselves have forgotten or else a word never ottered by us but formed on its course by the imperfect refraction of a different word can be transported without ever halting for any obstacle to infinite distances — in the present instance to the princesse de guermantes — and succeed in diverting at our expense the banquet of the gods what we actually recall of our conduct remains unknown to our nearest neighbour what we have forgotten that we ever said or indeed what we never did say flies to provoke hilarity even in another planet and the image that other people form of our actions and behaviour is no more like that which we form of them ourselves than is like an original drawing a spoiled copy in which at one point for a black line we find an empty gap and for a blank space an unaccountable contour it may be all the same that what has not been transcribed is some nonexistent feature which we behold merely in our purblind selfesteem and that what seems to us added is indeed a part of ourselves but so essential a part as to have escaped our notice so that this strange print which seems to us to have so little resemblance to ourselves bears sometimes the same stamp of truth scarcely flattering indeed but profound and useful as a photograph taken by xrays not that that is any reason why we should recognise ourselves in it a man who is in the habit of smiling in the glass at his handsome face and stalwart figure if you shew him their radiograph will have face to face with that rosary of bones labelled as being the image of himself the same suspicion of error as the visitor to an art gallery who on coming to the portrait of a girl reads in his catalogue “dromedary resting” later on this discrepancy between our portraits according as it was our own hand that drew them or another i was to register in the case of others than myself living placidly in the midst of a collection of photographs which they themselves had taken while round about them grinned frightful faces invisible to them as a rule but plunging them in stupor if an accident were to reveal them with the warning “this is you”

   a few years earlier i should have been only too glad to tell mme swann in what connexion i had fawned upon m de norpois since the connexion had been my desire to know her but i no longer felt this desire i was no longer in love with gilberte on the other hand i had not succeeded in identifying mme swann with the lady in pink of my childhood accordingly i spoke of the woman who was on my mind at the moment

    “did you see the duchesse de guermantes just now” i asked mme swann

   but since the duchess did not bow to mme swann when they met the latter chose to appear to regard her as a person of no importance whose presence in a room one did not even remark

    “i don’t know i didn’t realise her” she replied sourly using an expression borrowed from england

   i was anxious nevertheless for information with regard not only to mme de guermantes but to all the people who came in contact with her and for all the world like bloch with the tactlessness of people who seek in their conversation not to give pleasure to others but to elucidate from sheer egoism facts that are interesting to themselves in my effort to form an exact idea of the life of mme de guermantes i questioned mme de villeparisis about mme leroi

    “oh yes i know who’ you mean” she replied with an affectation of contempt “the daughter of those rich timber people i’ve heard that she’s begun to go about quite a lot lately but i must explain to you that i am rather old now to make new acquaintances i have known such interesting such delightful people in my time that really i do not believe mme lerol would be any addition to what i already have” mme de marsantes who was playing lady in waiting to the marquise presented me to the prince and while she was still doing so m de norpois also presented me in the most glowing terms perhaps he found it convenient to do me a courtesy which could in no way damage his credit since i had just been presented perhaps it was because he thought that a foreigner even so distinguished a foreigner was unfamiliar with french society and might think that he was having introduced to him a young man of fashion perhaps to exercise one of his prerogatives that of adding the weight of his personal recommendation as an ambassador or in his taste for the archaic to revive in the prince’s honour the old custom flattering to his rank that two sponsors were necessary if one wished to be presented

   mme de villeparisis appealed to m de norpois feeling it imperative that i should have his assurance that she had nothing to regret in not knowing mme leroi

    “am i not right m l’ambassadeur mme leroi is quite uninteresting isn’t she quite out of keeping with the people who come here i was quite right not to make friends with her wasn’t i”

   whether from independence or because he was tired m de norpois replied merely in a bow full of respect but devoid of meaning

    “sir” went on mme de villeparisis with a laugh “there are some absurd people in the world would you believe that i had a visit this afternoon from a gentleman who tried to persuade me that he found more pleasure in kissing my hand than a young woman’s”

   i guessed at once that this was legrandin m de norpois smiled with a slight quiver of the eyelid as though such a remark had been prompted by a concupiscence so natural that one could not find fault with the person who had uttered it almost as though it were the beginning of a romance which he was prepared to forgive if not to encourage with the perverse indulgence of a voisenon or the younger crébillon

    “many young women’s hands would be incapable of doing what i see there” said the prince pointing to mme de villeparisis’s unfinished watercolours and he asked her whether she had seen the flower paintings by fantinlatour which had recently been exhibited

    “they are of the first order and indicate as people say nowadays a fine painter one of the masters of the palette” declared m de norpois “i consider all the same that they stand no comparison with these in which i find it easier to recognise the colouring of the flower”

   even supposing that the partiality of an old lover the habit of flattering people the critical standard admissible in a small circle had dictated this speech to the exambassador it proved upon what an absolute vacuum of true taste the judgment of people in society is based so arbitrary that the smallest trifle can make it rush to the wildest absurdities on the way to which it is stopped held up by no genuinely felt impression

    “i claim no credit for knowing about flowers i’ve lived all my life among the fields” replied mme de villeparisis modestly “but” she added graciously turning to the prince “if i did when i was quite a girl form a rather more serious idea of them than children generally do in the country i owe that to a distinguished fellowcountryman of yours herr von schlegel i met him at broglie when i was staying there once with my aunt cordelia marshal de castellane’s wife don’t you know i remember so well m lebrun m de salvandy m doudan getting him to talk about flowers i was only a little girl i wasn’t able to follow all he said but he liked playing with me and when he went back to your country he sent me a beautiful botany book to remind me of a drive we took together in a phaeton to the val richer when i fell asleep on his knee i have got the book still and it taught me to observe many things about flowers which i should not have noticed otherwise when mme de barante published some of mme de broglie’s letters charming and affected like herself i hoped to find among them some record of those conversations with herr von schlegel but she was a woman who looked for nothing from nature but arguments in support of religion”

   robert called me away to the far end of the room where he and his mother were

    “you have been good to me” i said “how can i thank you can we dine together tomorrow”

    “tomorrow yes if you like but it will have to be with bloch i met him just now on the doorstep he was rather stiff with me at first because i had quite forgotten to answer his last two letters at least he didn’t tell me that that was what had annoyed him but i guessed it but after that he was so friendly to me that i simply can’t disappoint him between ourselves on his side at least i can feel it’s a life and death friendship” nor do i consider that robert was altogether mistaken furious detraction was often with bloch the effect of a keen affection which he had supposed to be unreturned and as he had little power of imagining the lives of other people and never dreamed that one might have been ill or away from home or otherwise occupied a week’s silence was at once interpreted by him as meaning a deliberate coldness and so i have never believed that his most violent outbursts as a friend or in later years as a writer went very deep they rose to a paroxysm if one replied to them with an icy dignity or by a platitude which encouraged him to redouble his onslaught but yielded often to a warmly sympathetic attitude “as for being good” went on saintloup “you say i have been to you but i haven’t been good at all my aunt tells me that it’s you who avoid her that you never said a word to her she wondered whether you had anything against her”

   fortunately for myself if i had been taken in by this speech our departure which i believed to be imminent for balbec would have prevented my making any attempt to see mme guermantes again to assure her that i had nothing against her and so to put her under the necessity of proving that it was she who had something against me but i had only to remind myself that she had not even offered to let me see her elstirs besides this was not a disappointment i had never expected her to begin talking to me about them i knew that i did not appeal to her that i need have no hope of ever making her like me the most that i had been able to look forward to was that thanks to her kindness i might there and then receive since i should not be seeing her again before i left paris an entirely pleasing impression which i could take with me to balbec indefinitely prolonged intact instead of a memory broken by anxiety and sorrow

   mme de marsantes kept on interrupting her conversation with robert to tell me how often he had spoken to her about me how fond he was of me she treated me with a deference which almost hurt me because i felt it to be prompted by her fear of being embroiled on my account with this son whom she had not seen all day with whom she was eager to be alone and over whom she must accordingly have supposed that the influence which she wielded was not equal to and must conciliate mine having heard me earlier in the afternoon make some reference to bloch’s uncle m nissim bernard mme de marsantes inquired whether it was he who had at one time lived at nice

    “in that case he knew m de marsantes there before our marriage” she told me “my husband used often to speak of him as an excellent man with such a delicate generous nature”

    “to think that for once in his life he wasn’t lying it’s incredible” would have been bloch’s comment

   all this time i should have liked to explain to mme de marsantes that robert felt infinitely more affection for her than for myself and that had she shewn any hostility towards me it was not in my nature to attempt to set him against her to detach him from her but now that mme de guermantes had left the room i had more leisure to observe robert and i noticed then for the first time that once again a sort of flood of anger seemed to be coursing through him rising to the surface of his stern and sombre features i was afraid lest remembering the scene in the theatre that afternoon he might be feeling humiliated in my presence at having allowed himself to be treated so harshly by his mistress without making any rejoinder

   suddenly he broke away from his mother who had put her arm round his neck and coming towards me led me behind the little flowerstrewn counter at which mme de villeparisis had resumed her seat making a sign to me to follow him into the smaller room i was hurrying after him when m de charlus who must have supposed that i was leaving the house turned abruptly from prince von faffenheim to whom he had been talking and made a rapid circuit which brought him face to face with me i saw with alarm that he had taken the hat in the lining of which were a capital ‘g’ and a ducal coronet in the doorway into the little room he said without looking at me

    “as i see that you have taken to going into society you must do me the pleasure of coming to see me but it’s a little complicated” he went on with a distracted calculating air as if the pleasure had been one that he was afraid of not securing again once he had let slip the opportunity of arranging with me the means by which it might be realised “i am very seldom at home you will have to write to me but i should prefer to explain things to you more quietly i am just going will you walk a short way with me i shall only keep you a moment”

    “you’d better take care sir” i warned him “you have picked up the wrong hat by mistake”

    “do you want to stop me taking my own hat” i assumed a similar mishap having recently occurred to myself that someone else having taken his hat he had seized upon one at random so as not to go home bareheaded and that i had placed him in a difficulty by exposing his stratagem i told him that i must say a few words to saintloup “he is still talking to that idiot the duc de guermantes” i added “that really is charming i shall tell my brother” “oh you think that would interest m de charlus” i imagined that if he had a brother that brother must be called charlus also saintloup had indeed explained his family tree to me at balbec but i had forgotten the details “who has been talking to you about m de charlus” replied the baron in an arrogant tone “go to robert”

    “i hear” he went on “that you took part this morning in one of those orgies that he has with a woman who is disgracing him you would do well to use your influence with him to make him realise the pain he is causing his poor mother and all of us by dragging our name in the dirt”

   i should have liked to reply that at this degrading luncheon the conversation had been entirely about emerson ibsen and tolstoy and that the young woman had lectured robert to make him drink nothing but water in the hope of bringing some balm to robert whose pride had i felt been wounded i sought to find an excuse for his mistress i did not know that at that moment in spite of his anger with her it was on himself that he was heaping reproaches but it always happens even in quarrels between a good man and a worthless woman and when the right is all on one side that some trifle crops up which enables the woman to appear not to have been in the wrong on one point and as she ignores all the other points the moment the man begins to feel the need of her company or is demoralised by separation from her his weakness will make his conscience more exacting he will remember the absurd reproaches that have been flung at him and will ask himself whether they have not some foundation in fact

    “i’ve come to the conclusion i was wrong about that matter of the necklace” robert said to me “of course i never meant for a moment to do anything wrong but i know very well other people don’t look at things in the same way as oneself she had a very hard time when she was young in her eyes i was bound to appear just the rich man who thinks he can get anything he wants with his money and with whom a poor person cannot compete whether in trying to influence boucheron or in a lawsuit of course she has been horribly cruel to me when i have never thought of anything but her good but i do see clearly she believes that i wanted to make her feel that one could keep a hold on her with money and that’s not true and she’s so fond of me what must she be thinking of me poor darling if you only knew she has such charming ways i simply can’t tell you she has often done the most adorable things for me how wretched she must be feeling now in any case whatever happens in the long run i don’t want to let her think me a cad i shall dash off to boucheron’s and get the necklace you never know very likely when she sees me with it she will admit that she’s been in the wrong don’t you see it’s the idea that she is suffering at this moment that i can’t bear what one suffers oneself one knows that’s nothing but with her — to say to oneself that she’s suffering and not to be able to form any idea of what she feels — i think i shall go mad in a minute — i’d much rather never see her again than let her suffer she can be happy without me if she must that’s all i ask listen you know to me everything that concerns her is enormously important it becomes something cosmic i shall run to the jeweller’s and then go and ask her to forgive me but until i get down there what will she be thinking of me if she could only know that i was on my way what about your going down there and telling her for all we know that might settle the whole business perhaps” he went on with a smile as though he hardly ventured to believe in so idyllic a possibility “we can all three dine together in the country but we can’t tell yet i never know how to handle her poor child i shall perhaps only hurt her more than ever besides her decision may be irrevocable”

   robert swept me back to his mother

    “goodbye” he said to her “i’ve got to go now i don’t know when i shall get leave again probably not for a month i shall write as soon as i know myself”

   certainly robert was not in the least of the type of son who when he goes out with his mother feels that an attitude of exasperation towards her ought to balance the smiles and bows which he bestows on strangers nothing is more common than this odious form of vengeance on the part of those who appear to believe that rudeness to one’s own family is the natural complement to one’s ceremonial behaviour whatever the wretched mother may say her son as though he had been taken to the house against his will and wished to make her pay dearly for his presence refutes immediately with an ironical precise cruel contradiction the timidly ventured assertion the mother at once conforms though without thereby disarming him to the opinion of this superior being of whom she will continue to boast to everyone when he is not present as having a charming nature and who all the same spares her none of his keenest thrusts saintloup was not at all like this but the anguish which rachel’s absence provoked in him brought it about that for different reasons he was no less harsh with his mother than the sons i have been describing are with theirs and as she listened to him i saw the same throb like that of a mighty wing which mme de marsantes had been unable to repress when her son first entered the room convulse her whole body once again but this time it was an anxious face eyes wide with grief that she fastened on him

    “what robert you’re going away seriously my little son the one day i’ve seen anything of you”

   and then quite softly in the most natural tone in a voice from which she strove to banish all sadness so as not to inspire her son with a pity which would perhaps have been painful to him or else useless and might serve only to irritate him like an argument prompted by plain common sense she added

    “you know it’s not at all nice of you”

   but to this simplicity she added so much timidity to shew him that she was not trespassing on his freedom so much affection so that he should not reproach her with spoiling his pleasures that saintloup could not fail to observe in himself as it were the possibility of a similar wave of affection that was to say an obstacle to his spending the evening with his lady and so he grew angry

    “it’s unfortunate but nice or not that’s how it is”

   and he heaped on his mother the reproaches which no doubt he felt that he himself perhaps deserved thus it is that egoists have always the last word having laid down at the start that their determination is unshakeable the more the sentiment in them to which one appeals to make them abandon it is touched the more fault they find not with themselves who resist the appeal but with those persons who put them under the necessity of resisting it with the result that their own firmness may be carried to the utmost degree of cruelty which only aggravates all the more in their eyes the culpability of the person who is so indelicate as to be hurt to be in the right and to cause them thus treacherously the pain of acting against their natural instinct of pity but of her own accord mme de marsantes ceased to insist for she felt that she would not be able to keep him

    “i shall leave you here” he said to me “but you’re not to keep him long mamma because he’s got to go somewhere else in a minute”

   i was fully aware that my company could not afford any pleasure to mme de marsantes but i preferred by not going with robert not to let her suppose that i was involved in these pleasures which deprived her of him i should have liked to find some excuse for her son’s conduct less from affection for him than from pity tor her but it was she who spoke first

    “poor boy” she began “i am sure i must have hurt him dreadfully you see sir mothers are such selfish creatures after all he hasn’t many pleasures he comes so little to paris oh dear if he hadn’t gone already i should have liked to stop him not to keep him of course but just to tell him that i’m not vexed with him that i think he was quite right will you excuse me if i go and look over the staircase”

   i accompanied her there

    “robert robert” she called “no he’s gone we are too late”

   at that moment i would as gladly have undertaken a mission to make robert break with his mistress as a few hours earlier to make him go and live with her altogether in one case saintloup would have regarded me as a false friend in the other his family would have called me his evil genius yet i was the same man at an interval of a few hours

   we returned to the drawingroom seeing that saintloup was not with us mme de villeparisis exchanged with m de norpois that dubious derisive and not too pitying glance with which people point out to one another an overjealous wife or an overloving mother spectacles which to outsiders are amusing as much as to say “there now there’s been trouble”

   robert went to his mistress taking with him the splendid ornament which after what had been said on both sides he ought not to have given her but it came to the same thing for she would not look at it and even after their reconciliation he could never persuade her to accept it certain of robert’s friends thought that these proofs of disinterestedness which she furnished were deliberately planned to draw him closer to her and yet she was not greedy about money except perhaps to be able to spend it without thought i have seen her bestow recklessly on people whom she believed to be in need the most insensate charity “at this moment” robert’s friends would say to him seeking to balance by their malicious words a disinterested action on rachel’s part “at this moment she will be in the promenade at the foliesbergères she’s an enigma that girl is a regular sphinx” after all how many women who are not disinterested since they are kept by men have we not seen with a delicacy that flowers from their sordid existence set with their own hands a thousand little limits to the generosity of their lovers

   robert knew of scarcely any of the infidelities of his mistress and tortured his mind over what were mere nothings compared with the real life of rachel a life which began every day only after he had left her he knew of scarcely any of these infidelities one could have told him of them without shaking his confidence in rachel for it is a charming law of nature which manifests itself in the heart of the most complex social organisms that we live in perfect ignorance of those we love on one side of the mirror the lover says to himself “she is an angel she will never yield herself to me i may as well die — and yet she does care for me she cares so much that perhaps — but no it can never possibly happen” and in the exaltation of his desire in the anguish of waiting what jewels he flings at the feet of this woman how he runs to borrow money to save her from inconvenience meanwhile on the other side of the screen through which their conversation will no more carry than that which visitors exchange outside the glass wall of an aquarium the public are saying “you don’t know her i congratulate you she has robbed in fact ruined i don’t know how many men there isn’t a worse girl in paris she’s a common swindler and cunning isn’t the word” and perhaps the public are not entirely wrong in their use of the last epithet for indeed the sceptical man who is not really in love with the woman and whom she merely attracts says to his friends “no no my dear fellow she is not in the least a prostitute i don’t say she hasn’t had an adventure or two in her time but she’s not a woman one pays she’d be a damned sight too expensive if she was with her it’s fifty thousand francs or nothing” well he has spent fifty thousand francs on her he has had her once but she finding moreover a willing accomplice in the man himself has managed to persuade him that he is one of those who have had her for nothing such is society in which every one of us has two aspects in which the most obvious the most notorious faults will never be known by a certain other person save embedded in under the protection of a shell a smooth cocoon a delicious curiosity of nature there were in paris two thoroughly respectable men to whom saintloup no longer bowed and could not refer without a tremor in his voice calling them exploiters of women this was because they had both been ruined by rachel

    “i blame myself for one thing only” mme de marsantes murmured in my ear “and that was my telling him that he wasn’t nice to me he such an adorable unique son there’s no one else like him in the world the only time i see him to have told him he wasn’t nice to me i would far rather he’d beaten me because i am sure that whatever pleasure he may be having this evening and he hasn’t many will be spoiled for him by that unfair word but sir i mustn’t keep you since you’re in a hurry”

   anxiously mme de marsantes bade me goodbye these sentiments bore upon robert she was sincere but she ceased to be to become a great lady once more

    “i have been so interested so glad to have this little talk with you thank you thank you”

   and with a humble air she fastened on me a look of gratitude of exhilaration as though my conversation were one of the keenest pleasures that she had experienced in her life these charming glances went very well with the black flowers on her white skirt they were those of a great lady who knew her business

    “but i am in no hurry” i replied “besides i must wait for m de charlus i am going with him”

   mme de villeparisis overheard these last words they appeared to vex her had the matter in question not been one which could not possibly give rise to such a sentiment it might have struck me that what seemed to be at that moment alarmed in mme de villeparisis was her modesty but this hypothesis never even entered my mind i was delighted with mme de guermantes with saintloup with mme de marsantes with m de charlus with mme de villeparisis i did not stop to reflect and i spoke lightheartedly and at random

    “you’re going from here with my nephew palamède” she asked me

   thinking that it might produce a highly favourable impression on mme de villeparisis if she learned that i was on intimate terms with a nephew whom she esteemed so greatly “he has asked me to go home with him” i answered blithely “i am so glad besides we are greater friends than you think and i’ve quite made up my mind that we’re going to be better friends still”

   from being vexed mme de villeparisis seemed to have grown anxious “don’t wait for him” she said to me with a preoccupied air “he is talking to m de faffenheim he’s certain to have forgotten what he said to you you’d much better go now quickly while his back is turned”

   the first emotion shewn by mme de villeparisis would have suggested but for the circumstances offended modesty her insistence her opposition might well if one had studied her face alone have appeared to be dictated by virtue i was not myself in any hurry to join robert and his mistress but mme de villeparisis seemed to make such a point of my going that thinking perhaps that she had some important business to discuss with her nephew i bade her goodbye next to her m de guermantes superb and olympian was ponderously seated one would have said that the notion omnipresent in all his members of his vast riches gave him a particular high density as though they had been melted in a crucible into a single human ingot to form this man whose value was so immense at the moment of my saying goodbye to him he rose politely from his seat and i could feel the dead weight of thirty millions which his oldfashioned french breeding set in motion raised until it stood before me i seemed to be looking at that statue of olympian zeus which phidias is said to have cast in solid gold such was the power that good breeding had over m de guermantes over the body of m de guermantes at least for it had not an equal mastery over the ducal mind m de guermantes laughed at his own jokes but did not unbend to other people’s

   as i went downstairs i heard behind me a voice calling out to me

    “so this is how you wait for me is it”

   it was m de charlus

    “you don’t mind if we go a little way on foot” he asked dryly when we were in the courtyard “we can walk until i find a cab that suits me”

    “you wished to speak to me about something sir”

    “oh yes as a matter of fact there were some things i wished to say to you but i am not so sure now whether i shall as far as you are concerned i am sure that they might be the startingpoint which would lead you to inestimable benefits but i can see also that they would bring into my existence at an age when one begins to value tranquillity a great loss of time great inconvenience i ask myself whether you are worth all the pains that i should have to take with you and i have not the pleasure of knowing you well enough to be able to say perhaps also to you yourself what i could do for you does not appear sufficiently attractive for me to give myself so much trouble for i repeat quite frankly that for me it can only be trouble”

   i protested that in that case he must not dream of it this summary end to the discussion did not seem to be to his liking

    “that sort of politeness means nothing” he rebuked me coldly “there is nothing so pleasant as to give oneself trouble for a person who is worth one’s while for the best of us the study of the arts a taste for old things collections gardens are all mere ersatz succedanea alibis in the heart of our tub like diogenes we cry out for a man we cultivate begonias we trim yews as a last resort because yews and begonias submit to treatment but we should like to give our time to a plant of human growth if we were sure that he was worth the trouble that is the whole question you must know something about yourself are you worth my trouble or not”

    “i would not for anything in the world sir be a cause of anxiety to you” i said to him “but so far as i am concerned you may be sure that everything which comes to me from you will be a very great pleasure to me i am deeply touched that you should be so kind as to take notice of me in this way and try to help me”

   greatly to my surprise it was almost with effusion that he thanked me for this speech slipping his arm through mine with that intermittent familiarity which had already struck me at balbec and was in such contrast to the coldness of his tone

    “with the want of consideration common at your age” he told me “you are liable to say things at times which would open an unbridgeable gulf between us what you have said just now on the other hand is exactly the sort of thing that touches me and makes me want to do a great deal for you”

   as he walked arm in arm with me and uttered these words which albeit tinged with contempt were so affectionate m de charlus now fastened his gaze on me with that intense fixity which had struck me the first morning when i saw him outside the casino at balbec and indeed many years before that through the pink hawthorns standing beside mme swann whom i supposed then to be his mistress in the park at tansonville now let it stray around him and examine the cabs which at this time of the day were passing in considerable numbers on the way to their stables looking so determinedly at them that several stopped the drivers supposing that he wished to engage them but m de charlus immediately dismissed them

    “they’re not what i want” he explained to me “it’s all a question of the colour of their lamps and the direction they’re going in i hope sir” he went on “that you will not in any way misinterpret the purely disinterested and charitable nature of the proposal which i am going to make to you”

   i was struck by the similarity of his diction to swann’s closer now than at balbec

    “you have enough intelligence i suppose not to imagine that it is from want of society from any fear of solitude and boredom that i have recourse to you i do not as a rule care to talk about myself but you may possibly have heard — it was alluded to in a leading article in the times which made a considerable impression — that the emperor of austria who has always honoured me with his friendship and is good enough to insist on keeping up terms of cousinship with me declared the other day in an interview which was made public that if the comte de chambord had had by his side a man as thoroughly conversant with the undercurrents of european politics as myself he would be king of france today i have often thought sir that there was in me thanks not to my own humble talents but to circumstances which you may one day have occasion to learn a sort of secret record of incalculable value of which i have not felt myself at liberty to make use personally but which would be a priceless acquisition to a young man to whom i would hand over in a few months what it has taken me more than thirty years to collect what i am perhaps alone in possessing i do not speak of the intellectual enjoyment which you would find in learning certain secrets which a michelet of our day would give years of his life to know and in the light of which certain events would assume for him an entirely different aspect and i do not speak only of events that have already occurred but of the chain of circumstances” this was a favourite expression with m de charlus and often when he used it he joined his hands as if in prayer but with his fingers stiffened as though to illustrate by their complexity the said circumstances which he did not specify and the chain that linked them “i could give you an explanation that no one has dreamed of not only of the past but of the future” m de charlus broke off to question me about bloch whom he had heard discussed though without appearing to be listening in his aunt’s drawingroom and with that ironical accent he so skilfully detached what he was saying that he seemed to be thinking of something else altogether and to be speaking mechanically simply out of politeness he asked if my friend was young good looking and so forth bloch if he had heard him would have been more puzzled even than with m de norpois but for very different reasons to know whether m de charlus was for or against drey fus “it is not a bad idea if you wish to learn about life” went on m de charlus when he had finished questioning me “to include among your friends an occasional foreigner” i replied that bloch was french “indeed” said m de charlus “i took him to be a jew” his assertion of this incompatibility made me suppose that m de charlus was more antidreyfusard than anyone i had met he protested however against the charge of treason levelled against dreyfus but his protest took this form “i understand the newspapers to say that dreyfus has committed a crime against his country — so i understand i pay no attention to the newspapers i read them as i wash my hands without finding that it is worth my while to take any interest in what i am doing in any case the crime is nonexistent your friend’s compatriot would have committed a crime if he had betrayed judaea but what has he to do with france” i pointed out that if there should be a war the jews would be mobilised just as much as anyone else “perhaps so and i am not sure that it would not be an imprudence if we bring over senegalese and malagasies i hardly suppose that their hearts will be in the task of defending france which is only natural your dreyfus might rather be convicted of a breach of the laws of hospitality but we need not discuss that perhaps you could ask your friend to allow me to be present at some great festival in the temple at a circumcision with jewish chants he might perhaps take a hall and give me some biblical entertainment as the young ladies of saintcyr performed scenes taken from the psalms by racine to amuse louis xiv you might even arrange parties to give us a good laugh for instance a battle between your friend and his father in which he would smite him as david smote goliath that would make quite an amusing farce he might even while he was about it deal some stout blows at his hag or as my old nurse would say his ‘haggart’ of a mother that would be an excellent show and would not be unpleasing to us eh my young friend since we like exotic spectacles and to thrash that noneuropean creature would be giving a wellearned punishment to an old camel” as he poured out this terrible almost insane language m de charlus squeezed my arm until it ached i reminded myself of all that his family had told me of his wonderful kindness to this old nurse whose molièresque vocabulary he had just quoted and thought to myself that the connexions hitherto i felt little studied between goodness and wickedness in the same heart various as they might be would be an interesting subject for research

   i warned him that anyhow mme bloch no longer existed while as for m bloch i questioned to what extent he would enjoy a sport which might easily result in his being blinded m de charlus seemed annoyed “that” he said “is a woman who made a great mistake in dying as for blinding him surely the synagogue is blind it does not perceive the truth of the gospel in any case think at this moment when all these unhappy jews are trembling before the stupid fury of the christians what an honour it would be for him to see a man like myself condescend to be amused by their sports” at this point i caught sight of m bloch senior who was coming towards us probably on his way to meet his son he did not see us but i offered to introduce him to m de charlus i had no conception of the torrent of rage which my words were to let loose “introduce him to me but you must have singularly little idea of social values people do not get to know me as easily as that in the present instance the awkwardness would be twofold on account of the youth of the introducer and the unworthiness of the person introduced at the most if i am ever permitted to enjoy the asiatic spectacle which i suggested to you i might address to the horrible creature a few words indicative of generous feeling but on condition that he allows himself to be thoroughly thrashed by his son i might go so far as to express my satisfaction” as it happened m bloch paid no attention to us he was occupied in greeting mme sazerat with a series of sweeping bows which were very favourably received i was surprised at this for in the old days at combray she had been indignant at my parents for having young bloch in the house so antisemitic was she then but dreyfusism like a strong gust of wind had a few days before this wafted m bloch to her feet my father’s friend had found mme sazerat charming and was particularly gratified by the antisemitism of the lady which he regarded as a proof of the sincerity of her faith and the soundness of her dreyfusard opinions and also as enhancing the value of the call which she had authorised him to pay her he had not even been offended when she had said to him stolidly “m drumont has the impudence to put the revisionists in the same bag as the protestants and the jews a delightful promiscuity” “bernard” he had said with pride on reaching home to m nissim bernard “you know she has that prejudice” but m nissim bernard had said nothing only raising his eyes to heaven in an angelic gaze saddened by the misfortunes of the jews remembering his old friendships with christians grown mannered and precious with increasing years for reasons which the reader will learn in due course he had now the air of a preraphaelite ghost on to which hair had been incongruously grafted like threads in the heart of an opal “all this dreyfus business” went on the baron still clasping me by the arm “has only one drawback it destroys society i do not say polite society society has long ceased to deserve that laudatory epithet by the influx of mr and mrs camels and camelfies and camelyards astonishing creatures whom i find even in the houses of my own cousins because they belong to the patrie française or the antijewish or some such league as if a political opinion entitled one to any social qualification” this frivolity in m de charlus brought out his family likeness to the duchesse de guermantes

   i remarked to him on the resemblance as he appeared to think that i did not know her i reminded him of the evening at the opera when he had seemed to be trying to avoid me he assured me with such insistence that he had never even seen me there that i should have begun to believe him if presently a trifling incident had not led me to think that m de charlus in his excessive pride perhaps did not care to be seen with me

    “let us return to yourself” he said “and my plans for you there exists among certain men sir a freemasonry of which i cannot now say more than that it numbers in its ranks four of the reigning sovereigns of europe now the courtiers of one of these are trying to cure him of his fancy that is a very serious matter and may bring us to war yes sir that is a fact you remember the story of the man who believed that he had the princess of china shut up in a bottle it was a form of insanity he was cured of it but as soon as he ceased to be mad he became merely stupid there are maladies which we must not seek to cure because they alone protect us from others that are more serious a cousin of mine had trouble with his stomach he could not digest anything the most learned specialists on the stomach treated him with no effect i took him to a certain doctor another highly interesting man by the way of whom i could tell you a great deal he guessed at once that the trouble was nervousness he persuaded his patient ordered him to eat whatever he liked quite boldly and assured him that his digestion would stand it but my cousin had nephritis also what the stomach can digest perfectly well the kidneys cease after a time to eliminate and my cousin instead of living to a good old age with an imaginary disease of the stomach which obliged him to keep to a diet died at forty with his stomach cured but his kidneys ruined given a very considerable advantage over people of your age for all one knows you will perhaps become what some eminent man of the past might have been if a good angel had revealed to him in the midst of a humanity that knew nothing of them the secrets of steam and electricity do not be foolish do not refuse from discretion understand that if i do you a great service i expect my reward from you to be no less great it is many years now since people in society ceased to interest me i have but one passion left to seek to redeem the mistakes of my life by conferring the benefit of my knowledge on a soul that is still virgin and capable of being inflamed by virtue i have had great sorrows sir of which i may tell you perhaps some day i have lost my wife who was the loveliest the noblest the most perfect creature that one could dream of seeing i have young relatives who are not — i do not say worthy but who are not capable of accepting the moral heritage of which i have been speaking for all i know you may be he into whose hands it is to pass he whose life i shall be able to direct and to raise to so lofty a plane my own would gain in return perhaps in teaching you the great secrets of diplomacy i might recover a taste for them myself and begin at last to do things of real interest in which you would have an equal share but before i can tell i must see you often very often every day”

   i was thinking of taking advantage of this unexpected kindness on m de charlus’s part to ask him whether he could not arrange for me to meet his sisterinlaw when suddenly i felt my arm violently jerked as though by an electric shock it was m de charlus who had hurriedly withdrawn his arm from mine although as he talked he had allowed his eyes to wander in all directions he had only just caught sight of m d’argencourt who was coming towards us from a side street on seeing us m d’argencourt appeared worried cast at me a look of distrust almost that look intended for a creature of another race than one’s own with which mme de guermantes had quizzed bloch and tried to avoid us but one would have said that m de charlus was determined to shew him that he was not at all anxious not to be seen by him for he called to him simply to tell him something that was of no importance and fearing perhaps that m d’argencourt had not recognised me m de charlus informed him that i was a great friend of mme de villeparisis of the duchesse de guermantes of robert de saintloup and that he himself charlus was an old friend of my grandmother and glad to be able to shew her grandson a little of the affection that he felt for her nevertheless i observed that m d’argencourt albeit i had barely been introduced to him at mme de villeparisis’s and m de charlus had now spoken to him at great length about my family was distinctly colder to me than he had been in the afternoon and for a long time he shewed the same aloofness whenever we met he watched me now with a curiosity in which there was no sign of friendliness and seemed even to have to overcome an instinctive repulsion when on leaving us after a moment’s hesitation he held out a hand to me which he at once withdrew

    “i am sorry about that” said m de charlus “that fellow argencourt well born but ill bred more than feeble as a diplomat an impossible husband always running after women like a person in a play is one of those men who are incapable of understanding but perfectly capable of destroying the things in life that are really great i hope that our friendship will be one of them if it is ever to be formed and i hope also that you will honour me by keeping it — as i shall — well clear of the heels of any of those donkeys who from idleness or clumsiness or deliberate wickedness trample upon what would seem to have been made to endure unfortunately that is the mould in which most of the men one meets have been cast”

    “the duchesse de guermantes seems to be very clever we were talking this afternoon about the possibility of war it appears that she is specially well informed on that subject”

    “she is nothing of the sort” replied m de charlus tartly “women and most men for that matter understand nothing of what i was going to tell you my sisterinlaw is a charming woman who imagines that we are still living in the days of balzac’s novels when women had an influence on politics going to her house could at present have only a bad effect on you as for that matter going anywhere that was one of the very things i was just going to tell you when that fool interrupted me the first sacrifice that you must make for me — i shall claim them from you in proportion to the gifts i bestow on you — is to give up going into society it distressed me this afternoon to see you at that idiotic teaparty you may remind me that i was there myself but for me it was not a social gathering it was simply a family visit later on when you have established your position if it amuses you to step down for a little into that sort of thing it may perhaps do no harm and then i need not point out how invaluable i can be to you the ‘open sesame’ to the guermantes house and any others that it is worth while throwing open the doors of to you rests with me i shall be the judge and intend to remain master of the situation”

   i thought i would take advantage of what m de charlus had said about my call on mme de villeparisis to try to find out what position exactly she occupied in society but the question took another form on my lips than i had intended and i asked him instead what the villeparisis family was

    “that is absolutely as though you had asked me what the nobody family was” replied m de charlus “my aunt married for love a m thirion who was extremely rich for that matter and whose sisters had married surprisingly well and from that day onwards he called himself marquis de villeparisis it did no harm to anyone at the most a little to himself and very little what his reason was i cannot tell i suppose he was actually a ‘monsieur de villeparisis’ a gentleman born at villeparisis which as you know is the name of a little place outside paris my aunt tried to make out that there was such a marquisate in the family she wanted to put things on a proper footing i can’t tell you why when one takes a name to which one has no right it is better not to copy the regular forms”

   mme de villeparisis being merely mme thirion completed the fall which had begun in my estimation of her when i had seen the composite nature of her party i felt it to be unfair that a woman whose title and name were of quite recent origin should be able thus to impose upon her contemporaries with the prospect of similarly imposing upon posterity by virtue of her friendships with royal personages now that she had become once again what i had supposed her to be in my childhood a person who had nothing aristocratic about her these distinguished kinsfolk who gathered round her seemed to remain alien to her she did not cease to be charming to us all i went occasionally to see her and she sent me little presents from time to time but i had never any impression that she belonged to the faubourg saintgermain and if i had wanted any information about it she would have been one of the last people to whom i should have applied

    “at present” went on m de charlus “by going into society you will only damage your position warp your intellect and character also you must be particularly careful in choosing your friends keep mistresses if your family have no objection that doesn’t concern me indeed i can only advise it you young rascal young rascal who will soon have to start shaving” he rallied me passing his fingers over my chin “but the choice of your men friends is more important eight out of ten young men are little scoundrels little wretches capable of doing you an injury which you will never be able to repair wait now my nephew saintloup is quite a suitable companion for you at a pinch as far as your future is concerned he can be of no possible use to you but for that i am sufficient and really when all’s said and done as a person to go about with at times when you have had enough of me he does not seem to present any serious drawback that i know of at any rate he is a man not one of those effeminate creatures one sees so many of nowadays who look like little renters and at any moment may bring their innocent victims to the gallows” i did not know the meaning of this slang word ‘renter’ anyone who had known it would have been as greatly surprised by his use of it as myself people in society always like talking slang and people against whom certain things may be hinted like to shew that they are not afraid to mention them a proof of innocence in their eyes but they have lost their sense of proportion they are no longer capable of realising the point at which a certain pleasantry will become too technical too shocking will be a proof rather of corruption than of simplicity “he is not like the rest of them he has nice manners he is really serious”

   i could not help smiling at this epithet ‘serious’ to which the intonation that m de charlus gave to it seemed to impart the sense of ‘virtuous’ of ‘steady’ as one says of a little shopgirl that she is ‘serious’ at this moment a cab passed zigzagging along the street a young cabman who had deserted his box was driving it from inside where he lay sprawling upon the cushions apparently half drunk m de charlus instantly stopped him the driver began to argue

    “which way are you going”

    “yours” this surprised me for m de charlus had already refused several cabs with similarly coloured lamps

    “well i don’t want to get up on the box d’you mind if i stay down here”

    “no but you must put down the hood well think over my proposal” said m de charlus preparing to leave me “i give you a few days to consider my offer write to me i repeat i shall need to see you every day and to receive from you guarantees of loyalty of discretion which for that matter you do appear i must say to furnish but in the course of my life i have been so often taken in by appearances that i never wish to trust them again damn it it’s the least you can expect that before giving up a treasure i should know into what hands it is going to pass very well bear in mind what i’m offering you you are like hercules’ though unfortunately for yourself you do not appear to me to have quite his muscular development at the parting of the ways try not to have to regret all your life not having chosen the way that leads to virtue hallo” he turned to the cabman “haven’t you put the hood down i’ll do it myself i think too i’d better drive seeing the state you appear to be in”

   he jumped in beside the cabman took the reins and the horse trotted off

   as for myself no sooner had i turned in at our gate than i found the pendant to the conversation which i had heard exchanged that afternoon between bloch and m de norpois but in another form brief inverted and cruel this was a dispute between our butler who believed in dreyfus and the guermantes’ who was an antidreyfusard the truths and countertruths which came in conflict above ground among the intellectuals of the rival leagues the patrie française and the droits de l’homme were fast spreading downwards into the subsoil of popular opinion m reinach was manipulating by appeals to sentiment people whom he had never seen while for himself the dreyfus case simply presented itself to his reason as an incontrovertible theory which he proved in the sequel by the most astonishing victory for rational policy a victory against france according to some that the world has ever seen in two years he replaced a billot by a clemenceau ministry revolutionised public opinion from top to bottom took picquart from his prison to install him ungrateful in the ministry of war perhaps this rationalist manipulator of crowds was himself the puppet of his ancestry when we find that the systems of philosophy which contain the most truths were dictated to their authors in the last analysis by reasons of sentiment how are we to suppose that in a simple affair of politics like the dreyfus case reasons of this order may not unknown to the reasoner have controlled his reason bloch believed himself to have been led by a logical sequence to choose dreyfusism yet he knew that his nose skin and hair had been imposed on him by his race doubtless the reason enjoys more freedom yet it obeys certain laws which it has not prescribed for itself the case of the guermantes’ butler and our own was peculiar the waves of the two currents of dreyfusism and antidreyfusism which now divided france from end to end were on the whole silent but the occasional echoes which they emitted were sincere when you heard anyone in the middle of a conversation which was being deliberately kept off the case announce furtively some piece of political news generally false but always with a hopefulness of its truth you could induce from the nature of his predictions where his heart lay thus there came into conflict on certain points on one side a timid apostolate on the other a righteous indignation the two butlers whom i heard arguing as i came in furnished an exception to the rule ours let it be understood that dreyfus was guilty the guermantes’ butler that he was innocent this was done not to conceal their personal convictions but from cunning and in the keenness of their rivalry our butler being uncertain whether the fresh trial would be ordered wished beforehand in the event of failure to deprive the duke’s butler of the joy of seeing a just cause vanquished the duke’s butler thought that in the event of a refusal ours would be more indignant at the detention on the devil’s isle of an innocent man the porter looked on i had the impression that it was not he who was the cause of dissension in the guermantes household

   i went upstairs and found my grandmother not so well for some time past without knowing exactly what was wrong she had been complaining of her health it is in moments of illness that we are compelled to recognise that we live not alone but chained to a creature of a different kingdom whole worlds apart who has no knowledge of us and by whom it is impossible to make ourselves understood our body say that we met a brigand by the way we might yet convince him by an appeal to his personal interest if not to our own plight but to ask pity of our body is like discoursing before an octopus for which our words can have no more meaning than the sound of the tides and with which we should be appalled to find ourselves condemned to live my grandmother’s attacks passed often enoughunnoticed by the attention which she kept always diverted to ourselves when the pain was severe in the hope of curing it she would try in vain to understand what the trouble was if the morbid phenomena of which her body was the theatre remained obscure and beyond the reach of her mind they were clear and intelligible to certain creatures belonging to the same natural kingdom as themselves creatures to which the human mind has learned gradually to have recourse in order to understand what the body is saying to it as when a foreigner accosts us we try to find some one belonging to his country who will act as interpreter these can talk to our body and tell us if its anger is serious or will soon be appeased cottard whom we had called in to see my grandmother and who had infuriated us by asking with a dry smile the moment we told him that she was ill “ill you’re sure it’s not what they call a diplomatic illness” he tried to soothe his patient’s restlessness by a milk diet but incessant bowls of milk soup gave her no relief because my grandmother sprinkled them liberally with salt the toxic effects of which were as yet widal not having made his discoveries unknown for medicine being a compendium of the successive and contradictory mistakes of medical practioners when we summon the wisest of them to our aid the chances are that we may be relying on a scientific truth the error of which will be recognised in a few years’ time so that to believe in medicine would be the height of folly if not to believe in it were not greater folly still for from this mass of errors there have emerged in the course of time many truths cottard had told us to take her temperature a thermometer was fetched throughout almost all its length it was clear of mercury scarcely could one make out crouching at the foot of the tube in its little cell the silver salamander it seemed dead the glass reed was slipped into my grandmother’s mouth we had no need to leave it there for long the little sorceress had not been slow in casting her horoscope we found her motionless perched halfway up her tower and declining to move shewing us with precision the figure that we had asked of her a figure with which all the most careful examination that my grandmother’s mind could have devoted to herself would have been incapable of furnishing her 101 degrees for the first time we felt some anxiety we shook the thermometer well to erase the ominous line as though we were able thus to reduce the patient’s fever simultaneously with the figure shewn on the scale alas it was only too clear that the little sibyl unreasoning as she was had not pronounced judgment arbitrarily for the next day scarcely had the thermometer been inserted between my grandmother’s lips when almost at once as though with a single bound exulting in her certainty and in her intuition of a fact that to us was imperceptible the little prophetess had come to a halt at the same point in an implacable immobility and pointed once again to that figure 101 with the tip of her gleaming wand nothing more did she tell us in vain might we long seek pray she was deaf to our entreaties it seemed as though this were her final utterance a warning and a menace then in an attempt to constrain her to modify her response we had recourse to another creature of the same kingdom but more potent which is not content with questioning the body but can command it a febrifuge of the same order as the modern aspirin which had not then come into use we had not shaken the thermometer down below 995 and hoped that it would not have to rise from there we made my grandmother swallow this drug and then replaced the thermometer in her mouth like an implacable warder to whom one presents a permit signed by a higher authority whose protecting influence one has sought and who finding it to be in order replies “very well i have nothing to say if it’s like that you may pass” this time the watcher in the tower dirt not move but sullenly she seemed to be saying “what use will that be to you since you are friends with quinine she may give me the order not to go up once ten times twenty times and then she will grow tired of telling me i know her get along with you this won’t last for ever and then you’ll be a lot better off” thereupon my grandmother felt the presence within her of a creature which knew the human body better than herself the presence of a contemporary of the races that have vanished from the earth the presence of earth’s first inhabitant — long anterior to the creation of thinking man — she felt that aeonial ally who was sounding her a little roughly even in the head the heart the elbow he found out the weak places organised everything for the prehistoric combat which began at once to be fought in a moment a trampled python the fever was vanquished by the potent chemical substance to which my grandmother across the series of kingdoms reaching out beyond all animal and vegetable life would fain have been able to give thanks and she remained moved by this glimpse which she had caught through the mists of so many centuries of a climate anterior to the creation even of plants meanwhile the thermometer like a weird sister momentarily vanquished by some more ancient god held motionless her silver spindle alas other inferior creatures which man has trained to the chase of the mysterious quarry which he cannot pursue within the pathless forest of himself reported cruelly to us every day a certain quantity of albumen not large but constant enough for it also to appear to bear relation to some persistent malady which we could not detect bergotte had shocked that scrupulous instinct in me which made me subordinate my intellect when he spoke to me of dr du boulbon as of a physician who would not bore me who would discover methods of treatment which however strange they might appear would adapt themselves to the singularity of my mind but ideas transform themselves in us they overcome the resistance with which we at first meet them and feed upon rich intellectual reserves which we did not know to have been prepared for them so as happens whenever anything we have heard said about some one whom we do not know has had the faculty of awakening in us the idea of great talent of a sort of genius in my inmost mind i gave dr du boulbon the benefit of that unlimited confidence which he inspires in us who with an eye more penetrating than other men’s perceives the truth i knew indeed that he was more of a specialist in nervous diseases the man to whom charcot before his death had predicted that he would reign supreme in neurology and psychiatry “ah i don’t know about that it’s quite possible” put in françoise who was in the room and heard charcot’s name as she heard du boulbon’s for the first time but this in no way prevented her from saying “it’s possible” her ‘possibles’ her ‘perhapses’ her ‘i don’t knows’ were peculiarly irritating at such a moment one wanted to say to her “naturally you don’t know since you haven’t the faintest idea of what we are talking about how can you even say whether it’s possible or not you know nothing about it anyhow you can’t say now that you don’t know what charcot said to du boulbon you do know because we have just told you and your ‘perhapses’ and ‘possibles’ don’t come in because it’s a fact”

   in spite of this more special competence in cerebral and nervous matters as i knew that du boulbon was a great physician a superior man of a profound and inventive intellect i begged my mother to send for him and the hope that by a clear perception of the malady he might perhaps cure it carried the day finally over the fear that we had of if we called in a specialist alarming my grandmother what decided my mother was the fact that encouraged unconsciously by cottard my grandmother no longer went out of doors and scarcely rose from her bed in vain might she answer us in the words of mme de sévigné‘s letter on mme de la fayette “everyone said she was mad not to wish to go out i said to these persons so headstrong in their judgment ‘mme de la fayette is not mad’ and i stuck to that it has taken her death to prove that she was quite right not to go out” du boulbon when he came decided against — if not mme de sévigné whom we did not quote to him — my grandmother at any rate instead of sounding her chest fixing on her steadily his wonderful eyes in which there was perhaps the illusion that he was making a profound scrutiny of his patient or the desire to give her that illusion which seemed spontaneous but must be mechanically produced or else not to let her see that he was thinking of something quite different or simply to obtain the mastery over her he began talking about bergotte

    “i should think so indeed he’s magnificent you are quite right to admire him but which of his books do you prefer indeed well perhaps that is the best after all in any case it is the best composed of his novels claire is quite charming in it of his male characters which appeals to you most”

   i supposed at first that he was making her talk like this about literature because he himself found medicine boring perhaps also to display his breadth of mind and even with a more therapeutic aim to restore confidence to his patient to shew her that he was not alarmed to take her mind from the state of her health but afterwards i realised that being distinguished particularly as an alienist and by his work on the brain he had been seeking to ascertain by these questions whether my grandmother’s memory was in good order as though reluctantly he began to inquire about her past life fixing a stern and sombre eye on her then suddenly as though catching sight of the truth and determined to reach it at all costs with a preliminary rubbing of his hands which he seemed to have some difficulty in wiping dry of the final hesitations which he himself might feel and of all the objections which we might have raised looking down at my grandmother with a lucid eye boldly and as though he were at last upon solid ground punctuating his words in a quiet impressive tone every inflexion of which bore the mark of intellect he began his voice for that matter throughout this visit remained what it naturally was caressing and under his bushy brows his ironical eyes were full of kindness

    “you will be quite well madame on the day — when it comes and it rests entirely with you whether it comes today — on which you realise that there is nothing wrong with you and resume your ordinary life you tell me that you have not been taking your food not going out”

    “but sir i have a temperature”

   he laid a finger on her wrist

    “not just now at any rate besides what an excuse don’t you know that we keep out in the open air and overfeed tuberculous patients with temperatures of 102”

    “but i have a little albumen as well”

    “you ought not to know anything about that you have what i have had occasion to call ‘mental albumen’ we have all of us had when we have not been very well little albuminous phases which our doctor has done his best to make permanent by calling our attention to them for one disorder that doctors cure with drugs as i am told that they do occasionally succeed in doing they produce a dozen others in healthy subjects by inoculating them with that pathogenic agent a thousand times more virulent than all the microbes in the world the idea that one is ill a belief of that sort which has a disturbing effect on any temperament acts with special force on neurotic people tell them that a shut window is open behind their back they will begin to sneeze make them believe that you have put magnesia in their soup they will be seized with colic that their coffee is stronger than usual they will not sleep a wink all night do you imagine madame that i needed to do any more than look into your eyes listen to the way in which you express yourself look if i may say so at this lady your daughter and at your grandson who takes so much after you to learn what was the matter with you” “your grandmother might perhaps go and sit if the doctor allows it in some quiet path in the champselysées near that laurel shrubbery where you used to play when you were little” said my mother to me thus indirectly consulting dr du boulbon her voice for that reason assuming a tone of timid deference which it would not have had if she had been addressing me alone the doctor turned to my grandmother and being apparently as wellread in literature as in science adjured her as follows “go to the champselysées madame to the laurel shrubbery which your grandson loves the laurel you will find healthgiving it purifies after he had exterminated the serpent python it was with a bough of laurel in his hand that apollo made his entry into delphi he sought thus to guard himself from the deadly germs of the venomous monster so you see that the laurel is the most ancient the most venerable and i will add — what is of therapeutic as well as of prophylactic value — the most beautiful of antiseptics”

   in as much as a great part of what doctors know is taught them by the sick they are easily led to believe that this knowledge which patients exhibit is common to them all and they pride themselves on taking the patient of the moment by surprise with some remark picked up at a previous bedside thus it was with the superior smile of a parisian who in conversation with a peasant might hope to surprise him by using suddenly a word of the local dialect that dr du boulbon said to my grandmother “probably a windy night will make you sleep when the strongest soporifics would have no effect” “on the contrary sir when the wind blows i can never sleep at all” but doctors are touchy people “ach” muttered du boulbon knitting his brows as if some one had trodden on his toe or as if my grandmother’s sleeplessness on stormy nights were a personal insult to himself he had not however an undue opinion of himself and since in his character as a ‘superior’ person he felt himself bound not to put any faith in medicine he quickly recovered his philosophic serenity

   my mother in her passionate longing for reassurance from bergotte’s friend added in support of his verdict that a first cousin of my grandmother who suffered from a nervous complaint had lain for seven years cloistered in her bedroom at combray without leaving her bed more than once or twice a week

    “you see madame i didn’t know that and yet i could have told you”

    “but sir i am not in the least like her on the contrary my doctor complains that he cannot get me to stay in bed” said my grandmother whether because she was a little annoyed by the doctor’s theories or was anxious to submit to him any objections that might be raised to them in the hope that he would refute these and that after he had gone she would no longer find any doubt lurking in her own mind as to the accuracy of his encouraging diagnosis

    “why naturally madame you cannot have all the forms of — if you’ll excuse my saying so — mania at once you have others but not that particular one yesterday i visited a home for neurasthenics in the garden i saw a man standing on a seat motionless as a fakir his neck bent in a position which must have been highly uncomfortable on my asking him what he was doing there he replied without turning his head or moving a muscle ‘you see doctor i am extremely rheumatic and catch cold very easily i have just been taking a lot of exercise and while i was getting hot like a fool my neck was touching my flannels if i move it away from my flannels now before letting myself cool down i am certain to get a stiff neck and possibly bronchitis’ which he would in fact have done ‘you’re a fine specimen of neurasthenia that’s what you are’ i told him and do you know what argument he advanced to prove that i was mistaken it was this that while all the other patients in the place had a mania for testing their weight so much so that the weighing machine had to be padlocked so that they should not spend the whole day on it he had to be lifted on to it bodily so little did he care to be weighed he prided himself on not sharing the mania of the others without thinking that he had also one of his own and that it was this which saved him from the other you must not be offended by the comparison madame for the man who dared not turn his neck for fear of catching a chill is the greatest poet of our day that poor maniac is the most lofty intellect that i know submit to being called a neurotic you belong to that splendid and pitiable family which is the salt of the earth all the greatest things we know have come to us from neurotics it is they and they only who have founded religions and created great works of art never will the world be conscious of how much it owes to them nor above all of what they have suffered in order to bestow their gifts on it we enjoy fine music beautiful pictures a thousand exquisite things but we do not know what they cost those who wrought them in sleeplessness tears spasmodic laughter rashes asthma epilepsy a terror of death which is worse than any of these and which you perhaps have felt madame” he added with a smile at my grandmother “for confess now when i came into the room you were not feeling very confident you thought that you were ill dangerously ill perhaps heaven only knows what the disease was of which you thought you had detected the symptoms and you were not mistaken they were there neurosis has an absolute genius for malingering there is no illness which it cannot counterfeit perfectly it will produce lifelike imitations of the dilatations of dyspepsia the sicknesses of pregnancy the broken rhythm of the cardiac the feverishness of the consumptive if it is capable of deceiving the doctor how should it fail to deceive the patient no no you mustn’t think i’m making fun of your sufferings i should not undertake to heal them unless i understood them thoroughly and well they say there’s no good confession unless it’s mutual i have told you that without nervous trouble there can be no great artist what is more” he added raising a solemn forefinger “there can be no great scientist either i will go further and say that unless he himself is subject to nervous trouble he is not i won’t say a good doctor but i do say the right doctor to treat nervous troubles in nervous pathology a doctor who doesn’t say too many foolish things is a patient halfcured just as a critic is a poet who has stopped writing verse and a policeman a burglar who has retired from practice i madame i do not like you fancy myself to be suffering from albuminuria i have not your nervous fear of food nor of fresh air but i can never go to sleep without getting out of bed at least twenty times to see if my door is shut and in that home where i found the poet yesterday who would not move his neck i had gone to secure a room for — this is between ourselves — i spend my holidays there looking after myself when i have increased my own trouble by wearing myself out in the attempt to cure other people”

    “but do you want me to take a cure like that sir” came to a frightened voice from my grandmother

    “it is not necessary madame the symptoms which you describe will vanish at my bidding besides you have with you a very efficient person whom i appoint as your doctor from now onwards that is your trouble itself the superactivity of your nerves even if i knew how to cure you of that i should take good care not to all i need do is to control it i see on your table there one of bergotte’s books cured of your neurosis you would no longer care for it well i might feel it my duty to substitute for the joys that it procures for you a nervous stability which would be quite incapable of giving you those joys but those joys themselves are a strong remedy the strongest of all perhaps no i have nothing to say against your nervous energy all i ask is that it should listen to me i leave you in its charge it must reverse its engines the force which it is now using to prevent you from getting up from taking sufficient food let it employ in making you eat in making you read in making you go out and in distracting you in every possible way you needn’t tell me that you are fatigued fatigue is the organic realisation of a preconceived idea begin by not thinking it and if ever you have a slight indisposition which is a thing that may happen to anyone it will be just as if you hadn’t it for your nervous energy will have endowed you with what m de talleyrand in an expression full of meaning called ‘imaginary health’ see it has begun to cure you already you have been sitting up in bed listening to me without once leaning back on your pillows your eye is bright your complexion is good i have been talking to you for half an hour by the clock and you have never noticed the time well madame i shall now bid you goodday”

   when after seeing dr du boulbon to the door i returned to the room in which my mother was by herself the oppression that had been weighing on me for the last few weeks lifted i felt that my mother was going to break out with a cry of joy and would see my joy i felt that inability to endure the suspense of the coming moment at which a person is going to be overcome with emotion in our presence which in another category is a little like the thrill of fear that goes through one when one knows that somebody is going to come in and startle one by a door that is still closed i tried to speak to mamma but my voice broke and bursting into tears i stayed for a long time my head on her shoulder crying tasting accepting relishing my grief now that i knew that it had departed from my life as we like to exalt ourselves by forming virtuous plans which circumstances do not permit us to put into execution françoise annoyed me by her refusal to share in our joy she was quite overcome because there had just been a terrible scene between the lovesick footman and the talebearing porter it had required the duchess herself in her unfailing benevolence to intervene restore an apparent calm to the household and forgive the footman for she was a good mistress and that would have been the ideal ‘place’ if only she didn’t listen to ‘stories’

   during the last few days people had begun to hear of my grandmother’s illness and to inquire for news of her saintloup had written to me “i do not wish to take advantage of a time when your dear grandmother is unwell to convey to you what is far more than mere reproaches on a matter with which she has no concern but i should not be speaking the truth were i to say to you even out of politeness that i shall ever forget the perfidy of your conduct or that there can ever be any forgiveness for so scoundrelly a betrayal” but some other friends supposing that my grandmother was not seriously ill they may not even have known that she was ill at all had asked me to meet them next day in the champselysées to go with them from there to pay a call together ending up with a dinner in the country the thought of which appealed to me i had no longer any reason to forego these two pleasures when my grandmother had been told that it was now imperative if she was to obey dr du boulbon’s orders that she should go out as much as possible she had herself at once suggested the champselysées it would be easy for me to escort her there and while she sat reading to arrange with my friends where i should meet them later and i should still be in time if i made haste to take the train with them to ville d’avray when the time came my grandmother did not want to go out she felt tired but my mother acting on du boulbon’s instructions had the strength of mind to be firm and to insist on obedience she was almost in tears at the thought that my grandmother was going to relapse again into her nervous weakness which she might never be able to shake off never again would there be such a fine warm day for an outing the sun as it moved through the sky interspersed here and there in the broken solidity of the balcony its unsubstantial muslins and gave to the freestone ledge a warm epidermis an indefinite halo of gold as françoise had not had time to send a ‘tube’ to her daughter she left us immediately after luncheon she very kindly consented however to call first at jupien’s to get a stitch put in the cloak which my grandmother was going to wear returning at that moment from my morning walk i accompanied her into the shop “is it your young master who brings you here” jupien asked françoise “is it you who are bringing him to see me or is it some good wind and fortune that bring you both” for all his want of education jupien respected the laws of grammar as instinctively as m de guermantes in spite of every effort broke them with françoise gone and the cloak mended it was time for my grandmother to get ready having obstinately refused to let mamma stay in the room with her she took left to herself an endless time over her dressing and now that i knew her to be quite well with that strange indifference which we feel towards our relatives so long as they are alive which makes us put everyone else before them i felt it to be very selfish of her to take so long to risk making me late when she knew that i had an appointment with my friends and was dining at ville d’avray in my impatience i finally went downstairs without waiting for her after i had twice been told that she was just ready at last she joined me without apologising to me as she generally did for having kept me waiting flushed and bothered like a person who has come to a place in a hurry and has forgotten half her belongings just as i was reaching the halfopened glass door which without warming them with it in the least let in the liquid throbbing tepid air from the street as though the sluices of a reservoir had been opened between the frigid walls of the passage

    “oh dear if you’re going to meet your friends i ought to have put on another cloak i look rather povertystricken in this one”

   i was startled to see her so flushed and supposed that having begun by making herself late she had had to hurry over her dressing when we left the cab at the end of the avenue gabriel in the champselysées i saw my grandmother without a word to me turn aside and make her way to the little old pavilion with its green trellis at the door of which i had once waited for françoise the same parkkeeper who had been standing there then was still talking to françoise’s ‘marquise’ when following my grandmother who doubtless because she was feeling sick had her hand in front of her mouth i climbed the steps of that little rustic theatre erected there among the gardens at the entrance as in those circus booths where the clown dressed for the ring and smothered in flour stands at the door and takes the money himself for the seats the ‘marquise’ at the receipt of custom was still there in her place with her huge uneven face smeared with a coarse plaster and her little bonnet of red flowers and black lace surmounting her auburn wig but i do not suppose that she recognised me the parkkeeper abandoning his watch over the greenery with the colour of which his uniform had been designed to harmonise was talking to her on a chair by her side

    “so you’re still here” he was saying “you don’t think of retiring”

    “and what have i to retire for sir will you kindly tell me where i shall be better off than here where i should live more at my ease and with every comfort and then there’s all the coming and going plenty of distraction my little paris i call it my customers keep me in touch with everything that’s going on just to give you an example there’s one of them who went out not more than five minutes ago he’s a magistrate in the very highest position there is very well sir” she cried with ardour as though prepared to maintain the truth of this assertion by violence should the agent of civic authority shew any sign of challenging its accuracy “for the last eight years do you follow me every day god has made regularly on the stroke of three he’s been here always polite never saying one word louder than another never making any mess and he stays half an hour and more to read his papers and do his little jobs there was one day he didn’t come i never noticed it at the time but that evening all of a sudden i said to myself ‘why that gentleman never came today perhaps he’s dead’ and that gave me a regular turn you know because of course i get quite fond of people when they behave nicely and so i was very glad when i saw him come in again next day and i said to him i did ‘i hope there was nothing wrong yesterday sir’ then he told me that it was his wife that had died and he’d been so put out poor gentleman what with one thing and another he hadn’t been able to come he had that really sad look you know people have when they’ve been married fiveandtwenty years and then the parting but he seemed pleased all the same to be back here you could see that all his little habits had been quite upset i did what i could to make him feel at home i said to him ‘y’ mustn’t let go of things sir just come here the same as before it will be a little distraction for you in your sorrow’”

   the ‘marquise’ resumed a gentler tone for she had observed that the guardian of groves and lawns was listening to her complacently and with no thought of contradiction keeping harmlessly in its scabbard a sword which looked more like a horticultural implement or some symbol of a gardengod

    “and besides” she went on “i choose my customers i don’t let everyone into my little parlours as i call them and doesn’t the place just look like a parlour with all my flowers such friendly customers i have there’s always some one or other brings me a spray of nice lilac or jessamine or roses my favourite flowers roses are”

   the thought that we were perhaps despised by this lady because we never brought any sprays of lilac or fine roses to her bower made me redden and in the hope of making a bodily escape — or of being condemned only by default — from an adverse judgment i moved towards the exit but it is not always in this world the people who bring us fine roses to whom we are most friendly for the ‘marquise’ thinking that i was bored turned to me

    “you wouldn’t like me to open a little place for you”

   and on my declining

    “no you’re sure you won’t” she persisted smiling “well just as you please you’re welcome to it but i know quite well not having to pay for a thing won’t make you want to do it if you don’t want to”

   at this moment a shabbily dressed woman hurried into the place who seemed to be feeling precisely the want in question but she did not belong to the ‘marquise’s’ world for the latter with the ferocity of a snob flung at her

    “i’ve nothing disengaged ma’am”

    “will they be long” asked the poor lady reddening beneath the yellow flowers in her hat

    “well ma’am if you’ll take my advice you’ll try somewhere else you see there are still these two gentlemen waiting and i’ve only one closet the others are out of order”

    “not much money there” she explained when the other had gone “it’s not the sort we want here either they’re not clean don’t treat the place with respect it would be your humble here that would have to spend the next hour cleaning up after her ladyship i’m not sorry to lose her penny”

   finally my grandmother emerged and feeling that she probably would not seek to atone by a lavish gratuity for the indiscretion that she had shewn by remaining so long inside i beat a retreat so as not to have to share in the scorn which the ‘marquise’ would no doubt heap on her and began strolling along a path but slowly so that my grandmother should not have to hurry to overtake me as presently she did i expected her to begin “i am afraid i’ve kept you waiting i hope you’ll still be in time for your friends” but she did not utter a single word so much so that feeling a little hurt i was disinclined to speak first until looking up at her i noticed that as she walked beside me she kept her face turned the other way i was afraid that her heart might be troubling her again i studied her more carefully and was struck by the disjointedness of her gait her hat was crooked her cloak stained she had the confused and worried look the flushed slightly dazed face of a person who has just been knocked down by a carriage or pulled out of a ditch

    “i was afraid you were feeling sick grandmamma are you feeling better now” i asked her

   probably she thought that it would be impossible for her without alarming me not to make some answer

    “i heard the whole of her conversation with the keeper” she told me “could anything have been more typical of the guermantes or the verdurins and their little circle heavens what fine language she put it all in” and she quoted with deliberate application this sentence from her own special marquise mme de sévigné “as i listened to them i thought that they were preparing for me the pleasures of a farewell”

   such was the speech that she made me a speech into which she had put all her critical delicacy her love of quotations her memory of the classics more thoroughly even than she would naturally have done and as though to prove that she retained possession of all these faculties but i guessed rather than heard what she said so inaudible was the voice in which she muttered her sentences clenching her teeth more than could be accounted for by the fear of being sick again

    “come” i said lightly so as not to seem to be taking her illness too seriously “since your heart is bothering you shall we go home now i don’t want to trundle a grandmother with indigestion about the champselysées”

    “i didn’t like to suggest it because of your friends” she replied “poor boy but if you don’t mind i think it would be wiser”

   i was afraid of her noticing the strange way in which she uttered these words

    “come” i said to her sharply “you mustn’t tire yourself talking if your heart is bad it’s silly wait till we get home”

   she smiled at me sorrowfully and gripped my hand she had realised that there was no need to hide from me what i had at once guessed that she had had a slight stroke

   we made our way back along the avenue gabriel through the strolling crowd i left my grandmother to rest on a seat and went in search of a cab she in whose heart i always placed myself when i had to form an opinion of the most unimportant person she was now closed to me had become part of the world outside and more than from any casual passerby i was obliged to keep from her what i thought of her condition to say no word of my uneasiness i could not have spoken of it to her in greater confidence than to a stranger she had suddenly handed back to me the thoughts the griefs which from the days of my infancy i had entrusted for all time to her keeping she was not yet dead i was already alone and even those allusions which she had made to the guermantes to mme de sévigné to our conversations about the little clan assumed an air of being without point or occasion fantastic because they sprang from the nullity of this very being who tomorrow possibly would have ceased to exist for whom they would no longer have any meaning from that nullity incapable of conceiving them which my grandmother would shortly be

    “well sir i don’t like to say no but you have not made an appointment you have no time fixed besides this is not my day for seeing patients you surely have a doctor of your own i cannot interfere with his practice unless he were to call me in for a consultation it’s a question of professional etiquette    ”

   just as i was signalling to a cabman i had caught sight of the famous professor e— — almost a friend of my father and grandfather acquainted at any rate with them both who lived in the avenue gabriel and with a sudden inspiration had stopped him just as he was entering his house thinking that he would perhaps be the very person to advise my grandmother but he was evidently in a hurry and after calling for his letters seemed anxious to get rid of me so that my only chance of speaking to him lay in going up with him in the lift of which he begged me to allow him to work the switches himself this being a mania with him

    “but sir i am not asking you to see my grandmother here you will realise from what i am trying to tell you that she is not in a fit state to come what i am asking is that you should call at our house in half an hour’s time when i have taken her home”

    “call at your house really sir you must not expect me to do that i am dining with the minister of commerce i have a call to pay first i must change at once and to make matters worse i have torn my coat and my’ other one has no buttonholes for my decorations i beg you please to oblige me by not touching the switches you don’t know how the lift works one can’t be too careful getting that buttonhole made means more delay well as i am a friend of your people if your grandmother comes here at once i will see her but i warn you that i shall be able to give her exactly a quarter of an hour nor a moment more”

   i had started off at once without even getting out of the lift which professor e——had himself set in motion to take me down again casting a suspicious glance at me as he did so

   we may indeed say that the hour of death is uncertain but when we say so we represent that hour to ourselves as situated in a vague and remote expanse of time it never occurs to us that it can have any connexion with the day that has already dawned or may signify that death — or its first assault and partial possession of us after which it will never leave hold of us again — may occur this very afternoon so far from uncertain this afternoon every hour of which has already been allotted to some occupation you make a point of taking your drive every day so that in a month’s time you will have had the full benefit of the fresh air you have hesitated over which cloak you will take which cabman to call you are in the cab the whole day lies before you short because you have to be at home early as a friend is coming to see you you hope that it will be as fine again tomorrow and you have no suspicion that death which has been making its way towards you along another plane shrouded in an impenetrable darkness has chosen precisely this day of all days to make its appearance in a few minutes’ time more or less at the moment when the carriage has reached the champselysées perhaps those who are haunted as a rule by the fear of the utter strangeness of death will find something reassuring in this kind of death — in this kind of first contact with death — because death thus assumes a known familiar guise of everyday life a good luncheon has preceded it and the same outing that people take who are in perfect health a drive home in an open carriage comes on top of its first onslaught ill as my grandmother was there were after all several people who could testify that at six o’clock as we came home from the champselysées they had bowed to her as she drove past in an open carriage in perfect weather legrandin making his way towards the place de la concorde raised his hat to us stopping to look after us with an air of surprise i who was not yet detached from life asked my grandmother if she had acknowledged his greeting reminding her of his readiness to take offence my grandmother thinking me no doubt very frivolous raised her hand in the air as though to say “what does it matter it is not of the least importance”

   yes one might have said that a few minutes earlier when i was looking for a cab my grandmother was resting on a seat in the avenue gabriel and that a little later she had driven past in an open carriage but would that have been really true the seat for instance to maintain its position at the side of an avenue — for all that it may be subjected also to certain conditions of equilibrium — has no need of energy but in order that a living person may be stable even when supported by a seat or in a carriage there is required a tension of forces which we do not ordinarily perceive any more than we perceive because its action is universal atmospheric pressure possibly if we were to be hollowed out and then left to support the pressure of the air we might feel in the moment that preceded our extinction that terrible weight which there was nothing left in us to neutralise similarly when the abyss of sickness and death opens within us and we have no longer any resistance to offer to the tumult with which the world and our own body rush upon us then to endure even the tension of our own muscles the shudder that freezes us to the marrow then even to keep ourselves motionless in what we ordinarily regard as nothing but the simple negative position of a lifeless thing requires if we wish our head to remain erect and our eyes calm an expense of vital energy and becomes the object of an exhausting struggle

   and if legrandin had looked back at us with that astonished air it was because to him as to the other people who passed us then in the cab in which my grandmother was apparently seated she had seemed to be foundering sliding into the abyss clinging desperately to the cushions which could barely arrest the downward plunge of her body her hair in disorder her eye wild unable any longer to face the assault of the images which its pupil was not strong enough now to bear she had appeared to them although i was still by her side submerged in that unknown world somewhere in which she had already received the blows traces of which she still bore when i looked up at her a few minutes earlier in the champselysées her hat her face her cloak left in disorder by the hand of the invisible angel with whom she had wrestled i have thought since that this moment of her stroke cannot have altogether surprised my grandmother that indeed she had perhaps foreseen it a long time back had lived in expectation of it she had not known naturally when this fatal moment would come had never been certain any more than those lovers whom a similar doubt leads alternately to found unreasonable hopes and unjustified suspicions on the fidelity of their mistresses but it is rarely that these grave maladies like that which now at last had struck her full in the face do not take up their abode in the sick man for a long time before killing him during which time they make haste like a ‘sociable’ neighbour or tenant to introduce themselves to him a terrible acquaintance not so much from the sufferings that it causes as from the strange novelty of the definite restriction which it imposes upon life a woman sees herself dying in these cases not at the actual moment of death but months sometimes years before when death has hideously come to dwell in her the sufferer makes the acquaintance of the stranger whom she hears coming and going in her brain she does not know him by sight it is true but from the sounds which she hears him regularly make she can form an idea of his habits is he a criminal one morning she can no longer hear him he has gone ah if it were only for ever in the evening he has returned what are his plans her specialist put to the question like an adored mistress replies with avowals that one day are believed another day fail to convince her or rather it is not the mistress’s part but that of the servants one interrogates that the doctor plays they are only third parties the person whom we press for an answer whom we suspect of being about to play us false is life itself and although we feel her to be no longer the same we believe in her still or at least remain undecided until the day on which she finally abandons us

   i helped my grandmother into professor e——‘s lift and a moment later he came to us and took us into his consulting room but there busy as he was his bombastic manner changed such is the force of habit for his habit was to be friendly that is to say lively with his patients since he knew that my grandmother was a great reader and was himself one also he devoted the first few minutes to quoting various favourite passages of poetry appropriate to the glorious summer weather he had placed her in an armchair and himself with his back to the light so as to have a good view of her his examination was minute and thorough even obliging me at one moment to leave the room he continued it after my return then having finished went on although the quarter of an hour was almost at an end repeating various quotations to my grandmother he even made a few jokes which were witty enough though i should have preferred to hear them on some other occasion but which completely reassured me by the tone of amusement in which he uttered them i then remembered that m fallières the president of the senate had many years earlier had a false seizure and that to the consternation of his political rivals he had returned a few days later to his duties and had begun it was said his preparations for a more or less remote succession to the presidency of the republic my confidence in my grandmother’s prompt recovery was all the more complete in that just as i was recalling the example of m fallières i was distracted from following up the similarity by a shout of laughter which served as conclusion to one of the professor’s jokes after which he took out his watch wrinkled his brows petulantly on seeing that he was five minutes late and while he bade us goodbye rang for his other coat to be brought to him at once i waited until my grandmother had left the room closed the door and asked him to tell me the truth

    “there is not the slightest hope” he informed me “it is a stroke brought on by uraemia in itself uraemia is not necessarily fatal but this case seems to me desperate i need not tell you that i hope i am mistaken anyhow you have cottard you’re in excellent hands excuse me” he broke off as a maid came into the room with his coat over her arm “i told you i’m dining with the minister of commerce and i have a call to pay first ah life is not all a bed of roses as one is apt to think at your age”

   and he graciously offered me his hand i had shut the door behind me and a footman was shewing us into the hall when we heard a loud shout of rage the maid had forgotten to cut and hem the buttonhole for the decorations this would take another ten minutes the professor continued to storm while i stood on the landing gazing at a grandmother for whom there was not the slightest hope each of us is indeed alone we started for home

   the sun was sinking it burnished an interminable wall along which our cab had to pass before reaching the street in which we lived a wall against which the shadow cast by the setting sun of horse and carriage stood out in black on a ruddy background like a funeral car on some pompeian terracotta at length we arrived at the house i made the invalid sit at the foot of the staircase in the hall and went up to warn my mother i told her that my grandmother had come home feeling slightly unwell after an attack of giddiness as soon as i began to speak my mother’s face was convulsed by the paroxysm of a despair which was yet already so resigned that i realised that for many years she had been holding herself quietly in readiness for an uncalendared but final day she asked me no question it seemed that just as malevolence likes to exaggerate the sufferings of other people so in her devotion she would not admit that her mother was seriously ill especially with a disease which might affect the brain mamma shuddered her eyes wept without tears she ran to give orders for the doctor to be fetched at once but when françoise asked who was ill she could not reply her voice stuck in her throat she came running downstairs with me struggling to banish from her face the sob that contracted it my grandmother was waiting below on the sofa in the hall but as soon as she heard us coming drew herself together stood up and waved her hand cheerfully at mamma i had partially wrapped her head in a white lace shawl telling her that it was so that she should not catch cold on the stairs i had hoped that my mother would not notice the change in her face the distortion of her mouth my precaution proved unnecessary my mother went up to my grandmother kissed her hand as though it were that of her god raised her up carried her to the lift with infinite precautions in which there was with the fear of hurting her by any clumsy movement the humility of one who felt herself unworthy to touch the most precious thing to her in the world but never once did she raise her eyes nor look at the sufferer’s face perhaps this was in order that my grandmother might not be saddened by the thought that the sight of her could alarm her daughter perhaps from fear of a grief so piercing that she dared not face it perhaps from reverence because she did not feel it permissible to herself without impiety to remark the trace of any mental weakening on those venerated features perhaps to be better able to preserve intact in her memory the image of the true face of my grandmother radiant with wisdom and goodness so they went up side by side my grandmother half hidden by her shawl my mother turning away her eyes

   meanwhile there was one person who never took hers from what could be made out of my grandmother’s altered features at which her daughter dared not look a person who fastened on them a gaze wondering indiscreet and of evil omen this was françoise not that she was not sincerely attached to my grandmother indeed she had been disappointed and almost scandalised by the coldness shewn by mamma whom she would have liked to see fling herself weeping into her mother’s arms but she had a certain tendency always to look at the worse side of things she had retained from her childhood two peculiarities which would seem to be mutually exclusive but which when combined strengthened one another the want of restraint common among people of humble origin who make no attempt to conceal the impression in other words the painful alarm aroused in them by the sight of a physical change which it would be in better taste to appear not to notice and the unfeeling coarseness of the peasant who begins by tearing the wings off dragonflies until she is allowed to wring the necks of chickens and lacks that modesty which would make her conceal the interest that she feels in the sight of suffering flesh

   when thanks to the faultless ministrations of françoise my grandmother had been put to bed she discovered that she could speak much more easily the little rupture or obstruction of a bloodvessel which had produced the uraemia having apparently been quite slight and at once she was anxious not to fail mamma in her hour of need to assist her in the most cruel moments through which she had yet had to pass

    “well my child” she began taking my mother’s hand in one of her own and keeping the other in front of her lips so as to account for the slight difficulty which she still found in uttering certain words “so this is all the pity you shew your mother you look as if you thought that indigestion was quite a pleasant thing”

   then for the first time my mother’s eyes gazed passionately into those of my grandmother not wishing to see the rest of her face and she replied beginning the list of those false promises which we swear but are unable to fulfil

    “mamma you will soon be quite well again your daughter will see to that”

   and embodying all her dearest love all her determination that her mother should recover in a kiss to which she entrusted them and which she followed with her mind with her whole being until it flowered upon her lips she bent down to lay it humbly reverently upon the precious brow my grandmother complained of a sort of alluvial deposit of bedclothes which kept gathering all the time in the same place over her left leg and from which she could never manage to free herself but she did not realise that she was herself the cause of this so that day after day she accused françoise unjustly of not ‘doing’ her bed properly by a convulsive movement she kept flinging to that side the whole flood of those billowing blankets of fine wool which gathered there like the sand in a bay which is very soon transformed into a beach unless the inhabitants construct a breakwater by the successive deposits of the tide

   my mother and i whose falsehood was exposed before we spoke by the obnoxious perspicacity of françoise would not even admit that my grandmother was seriously ill as though such an admission might give pleasure to her enemies not that she had any and it was more loving to feel that she was not so bad as all that in short from the same instinctive sentiment which had led me to suppose that andrée was too sorry for albertine to be really fond of her the same individual phenomena are reproduced in the mass in great crises in a war the man who does not love his country says nothing against it but regards it as lost commiserates it sees everything in the darkest colours

   françoise was of infinite value to us owing to her faculty of doing without sleep of performing the most arduous tasks and if when she had gone to bed after several nights spent in the sickroom we were obliged to call her a quarter of an hour after she had fallen asleep she was so happy to be able to do the most tiring duties as if they had been the simplest things in the world that so far from looking cross her face would light up with a satisfaction tinged with modesty only when the time came for mass or for breakfast then had my grandmother been in her death agony still françoise would have quietly slipped away so as not to make herself late she neither could nor would let her place be taken by her young footman it was true that she had brought from combray an extremely exalted idea of everyone’s duty towards ourselves she would not have tolerated that any of our servants should ‘fail’ us this doctrine had made her so noble so imperious so efficient an instructor that there had never come to our house any servants however corrupted who had not speedily modified purified their conception of life so far as to refuse to touch the usual commissions from tradesmen and to come rushing — however little they might previously have sought to oblige — to take from my hands and not let me tire myself by carrying the smallest package but at combray françoise had contracted also — and had brought with her to paris — the habit of not being able to put up with any assistance in her work the sight of anyone coming to help her seemed to her like receiving a deadly insult and servants had remained for weeks in the house without receiving from her any response to their morning greeting had even gone off on their holidays without her bidding them goodbye or their guessing her reason which was simply and solely that they had offered to do a share of her work on some day when she had not been well and at this moment when my grandmother was so ill françoise’s duties seemed to her peculiarly her own she would not allow herself she the official incumbent to be done out of her part in the ritual of these festal days and so her young footman sent packing by her did not know what to do with himself and not content with having copied the butler’s example and supplied himself with notepaper from my desk had begun as well to borrow volumes of poetry from my bookshelves he sat reading them for a good half of the day out of admiration for the poets who had written them but also so as during the rest of his time to begem with quotations the letters which he wrote to his friends in his native village naturally he expected these to dazzle them but as there was little sequence in his ideas he had formed the notion that these poems picked out at random from my shelves were matters of common knowledge to which it was customary to refer so much so that in writing to these peasants whose stupefaction he discounted he interspersed his own reflexions with lines from lamartine just as he might have said “who laughs last laughs longest” or merely “how are you keeping”

   to ease her pain my grandmother was given morphine unfortunately if this relieved her in other ways it increased the quantity of albumen the blows which we aimed at the wicked ogre who had taken up his abode in my grandmother were always wide of the mark and it was she her poor interposed body that had to bear them without her ever uttering more than a faint groan by way of complaint and the pain that we caused her found no compensation in a benefit which we were unable to give her the savage ogre whom we were anxious to exterminate we barely succeeded in touching and all we did was to enrage him still further and possibly hasten the moment at which he would devour his luckless captive on certain days when the discharge of albumen had been excessive cottard after some hesitation stopped the morphine in this man so insignificant so common there was in these brief moments in which he deliberated in which the relative dangers of one and another course of treatment presented themselves alternately to his mind until he arrived at a decision the same sort of greatness as in a general who vulgar in all the rest of his life is a great strategist and in an hour of peril after a moment’s reflexion decides upon what is from the military point of view the wisest course and gives the order “advance eastwards” medically however little hope there might be of setting any limit to this attack of uraemia it did not do to tire the kidneys but on the other hand when my grandmother did not have morphine her pain became unbearable she perpetually attempted a certain movement which it was difficult for her to perform without groaning to a great extent suffering is a sort of need felt by the organism to make itself familiar with a new state which makes it uneasy to adapt its sensibility to that state we can discern this origin of pain in the case of certain inconveniences which are not such for everyone into a room filled with a pungent smoke two men of a coarse fibre will come and attend to their business a third more highly strung will betray an incessant discomfort his nostrils will continue to sniff anxiously the odour he ought one would say to try not to notice but will keep on attempting to attach by a more exact apprehension of it to his troubled sense of smell one consequence of which may well be that his intense preoccupation will prevent him from complaining of a toothache when my grandmother was in pain the sweat trickled over the pink expanse of her brow glueing to it her white locks and if she thought that none of us was in the room she would cry out “oh it’s dreadful” but if she caught sight of my mother at once she employed all her energy in banishing from her face every sign of pain or — an alternative stratagem — repeated the same plaints accompanying them with explanations which gave a different sense retrospectively to those which my mother might have overheard

    “oh my dear it’s dreadful to have to stay in bed on a beautiful sunny day like this when one wants to be out in the air i am crying with rage at your orders”

   but she could not get rid of the look of anguish in her eyes the sweat on her brow the convulsive start checked at once of her limbs

    “there is nothing wrong i’m complaining because i’m not lying very comfortably i feel my hair is untidy my heart is bad i knocked myself against the wall”

   and my mother at the foot of the bed riveted to that suffering form as though by dint of piercing with her gaze that painbedewed brow that body which hid the evil thing within it she could have succeeded in reaching that evil thing and carrying it away my mother said

    “no no mamma dear we won’t let you suffer like that we will find something to take it away have patience just for a moment let me give you a kiss darling — no you’re not to move”

   and stooping over the bed with bended knees almost kneeling on the ground as though by an exercise of humility she would have a better chance of making acceptable the impassioned gift of herself she lowered towards my grandmother her whole life contained in her face as in a ciborium which she extended over her adorned in relief with dimples and folds so passionate so sorrowful so sweet that one knew not whether they had been carved by the chisel of a kiss a sob or a smile my grandmother also tried to lift up her face to mamma’s it was so altered that probably’ had she been strong enough to go out she would have been recognised only by the feather in her hat her features like the clay in a sculptor’s hands seemed to be straining with an effort which distracted her from everything else to conform to some particular model which we failed to identify this business of modelling was now almost finished and if my grandmother’s face had shrunk in the process it had at the same time hardened the veins that ran beneath its surface seemed those not of a piece of marble but of some more rugged stone constantly thrust forwards by the difficulty that she found in breathing and as constantly forced back on to her pillow by exhaustion her face worn diminished terribly expressive seemed like in a primitive almost prehistoric carving the rude flushed purplish desperate face of some savage guardian of a tomb but the whole task was not yet accomplished next her resistance must be overcome and that tomb the entrance to which she had so painfully guarded with that tense contraction entered

   in one of those moments in which as the saying goes one does not know what saint to invoke as my grandmother was coughing and sneezing a good deal we took the advice of a relative who assured us that if we sent for the specialist x ——he would get rid of all that in a couple of days people say that sort of thing about their own doctors and their friends believe them just as françoise always believed the advertisements in the newspapers the specialist came with his bag packed with all the colds and coughs of his other patients like aeolus’s bottle my grandmother refused pointblank to let herself be examined and we out of consideration for the doctor who had had his trouble for nothing deferred to the desire that he expressed to inspect each of our noses in turn albeit there was nothing the matter with any of them according to him however there was everything whether headache or colic heartdisease or diabetes was a disease of the nose that had been wrongly diagnosed to each of us he said “i should like to have another look at that little cornea don’t put it off too long i can soon get rid of it for you with a hot needle” we were of course thinking of something quite different and yet we asked ourselves “get rid of what” in a word every one of our noses was diseased his mistake lay only in his use of the present tense for by the following day his examination and provisional treatment had taken effect each of us had his or her catarrh and when in the street he ran into my father doubled up with a cough he smiled to think that an ignorant layman might suppose the attack to be due to his intervention he had examined us at a moment when we were already ill

   my grandmother’s illness gave occasion to various people to manifest an excess or deficiency of sympathy which surprised us quite as much as the sort of chance which led one or another of them to reveal to us connecting links of circumstances or of friendship for that matter which we had never suspected and the signs of interest shewn by the people who called incessantly at the house to inquire revealed to us the gravity of an illness which until then we had not sufficiently detached from the countless painful impressions that we received in my grandmother’s room summoned by telegram her sisters declined to leave combray they had discovered a musician there who gave them excellent chamber concerts in listening to which they thought that they could find better than by the invalid’s bedside food for thought a melancholy exaltation the form of which was to say the least of it unusual mme sazerat wrote to mamma but in the tone of a person whom the sudden breaking off of a betrothal the cause of the rupture being her dreyfusism has parted from one for ever bergotte on the other hand came every day and spent several hours with me

   he had always made a habit of going regularly for some time to the same house where accordingly he need not stand on ceremony but formerly it had been in order that he might talk without being interrupted now it was so that he might sit for as long as he chose in silence without being expected to talk for he was very ill some people said with albuminuria like my grandmother according to another version he had a tumour he grew steadily weaker it was with difficulty that he came up our staircase with greater difficulty still that he went down it even though he held on to the banisters he often stumbled and he would i believe have stayed at home had he not been afraid of losing altogether the habit of going out the capacity to go out he the ‘man with the little beard’ whom i had seen so alert not very long since he was now quite blind and even his speech was frequently obstructed

   but at the same time by a directly opposite process the body of his work known only to a few literary people at the period when mme swann used to patronise their timid efforts to disseminate it now grown in stature and strength before the eyes of all had acquired an extraordinary power of expansion among the general public the general rule is no doubt that only after his death does a writer become famous but it was while he still lived and during his slow progress towards a death that he had not yet reached that this writer was able to watch the progress of his works towards renown a dead writer can at least be illustrious without any strain on himself the effulgence of his name is stopped short by the stone upon his grave in the deafness of the eternal sleep he is not importuned by glory but for bergotte the antithesis was still incomplete he existed still sufficiently to suffer from the tumult he was moving still though with difficulty while his books bounding about him like daughters whom one loves but whose impetuous youthfulness and noisy pleasures tire one brought day after day to his very bedside a crowd of fresh admirers

   the visits which he now began to pay us came for me several years too late for i had no longer the same admiration for him as of old which is not in any sense incompatible with the growth of his reputation a man’s work seldom becomes completely understood and successful before that of another writer still obscure has begun in the minds of certain people more difficult to please to substitute a fresh cult for one that has almost ceased to command observance in the books of bergotte which i constantly reread his sentences stood out as clearly before my eyes as my own thoughts the furniture in my room and the carriages in the street all the details were quite easily seen not perhaps precisely as one had always seen them but at any rate as one was accustomed to see them now but a new writer had recently begun to publish work in which the relations between things were so different from those that connected them for me that i could understand hardly anything of what he wrote he would say for instance “the hosepipes admired the smart upkeep of the roads” and so far it was simple i followed him smoothly along those roads “which started every five minutes from briand and claudel” at that point i ceased to understand because i had expected the name of a place and was given that of a person instead only i felt that it was not the sentence that was badly constructed but i myself that lacked the strength and ability necessary to reach the end i would start afresh striving tooth and nail to climb to the pinnacle from which i would see things in their novel relations and each time after i had got about halfway through the sentence i would fall back again as later on when i joined the army in my attempts at the exercise known as the ‘bridgeladder’ i felt nevertheless for the new writer the admiration which an awkward boy who never receives any marks for gymnastics feels when he watches another more nimble and from then onwards i felt less admiration for bergotte whose limpidity began to strike me as insufficient there was a time at which people recognised things quite easily in pictures when it was fromentin who had painted them and could not recognise them at all when it was renoir

   people of taste and refinement tell us nowadays that renoir is one of the great painters of the last century but in so saying they forget the element of time and that it took a great deal of time well into the present century before renoir was hailed as a great artist to succeed thus in gaining recognition the original painter the original writer proceeds on the lines adopted by oculists the course of treatment they give us by their painting or by their prose is not always agreeable to us when it is at an end the operator says to us “now look” and lo and behold the world around us which was not created once and for all but is created afresh as often as an original artist is born appears to us entirely different from the old world but perfectly clear women pass in the street different from what they used to be because they are renoirs those renoir types which we persistently refused to see as women the carriages too are renoirs and the water and the sky we feel tempted to go for a walk in the forest which reminds us of that other which when we first saw it looked like anything in the world except a forest like for instance a tapestry of innumerable shades but lacking precisely the shades proper to forests such is the new and perishable universe which has just been created it will last until the next geological catastrophe is precipitated by a new painter or writer of original talent

   this writer who had taken bergotte’s place in my affections wearied me not by the incoherence but by the novelty of associations — perfectly coherent — which my mind was not trained to follow the fact that it was always at the same point that i felt myself relinquish my grasp pointed to a common character in the efforts that i had always to make moreover when once in a thousand times i did succeed in following the writer to the end of his sentence what i saw there was always of a humour a truth a charm similar to those which i had found long ago in reading bergotte only more delightful i reflected that it was not so many years since a similar reconstruction of the world like that which i was waiting now for his successor to produce had been wrought for me by bergotte himself until i was led to ask myself whether there was indeed any truth in the distinction which we are always making between art which is no more advanced now than in homer’s day and science with its continuous progress perhaps on the contrary art was in this respect like science each new writer seemed to me to have advanced beyond the stage of his immediate predecessor and how was i to know that in twenty years’ time when i should be able to accompany without strain or effort the newcomer of today another might not appear at whose approach he in turn would be packed off to the limbo to which his own coming would have consigned bergotte

   i spoke to the latter of the new writer he gave me a distaste for him not so much when he said that his art was uncouth easy and vacuous as when he told me that he had seen him and had almost mistaken him so strong was the likeness for bloch from that moment my friend’s features outlined themselves on the printed pages and i no longer felt any obligation to make the effort necessary to understand them if bergotte had decried him to me it was less i fancy out of jealousy for a success that was yet to come than out of ignorance of his work he read scarcely anything the bulk of his thought had long since passed from his brain into his books he had grown thin as though they had been extracted from him by surgical operations his reproductive instinct no longer impelled him to any activity now that he had given an independent existence to almost all his thoughts he led the vegetative life of a convalescent of a woman after childbirth his fine eyes remained motionless vaguely dazed like the eyes of a man who lies on the seashore and in a vague daydream sees only each little breaking wave however if it was less interesting to talk to him now than i should once have found it i felt no compunction for that he was so far a creature of habit that the simplest habits like the most elaborate once he had formed them became indispensable to him for a certain length of time i do not know what made him come to our house first of all but after that every day it was simply because he had been there the day before he would come to the house as he might have gone to a café so that no one should talk to him so that he might — very rarely — talk himself one might in short have found in his conduct a sign that he was moved to sympathise with us in our anxiety or that he enjoyed my company had one sought to draw any conclusion from such an assiduity in calling it did not fail to impress my mother sensitive to everything that might be regarded as an act of homage to her invalid and every day she reminded me “see that you don’t forget to thank him nicely”

   we had also — a discreet feminine attention like the refreshments that are brought to us in the studio between sittings by a painter’s mistress — a courteous supplement to those which her husband paid us professionally a visit from mme cottard she came to offer us her ‘waitingwoman’ or if we preferred the services of a man she would ‘scour the country’ for one and best of all on our declining said that she did hope this was not just a ‘putoff on our part a word which in her world signifies a false pretext for not accepting an invitation she assured us that the professor who never referred to his patients when he was at home was as sad about it as if it had been she herself who was ill we shall see in due course that even if this had been true it would have been at once a very small and a considerable admission on the part of the most faithless and the most attentive of husbands

   offers as helpful and infinitely more touching owing to the form in which they were couched which was a blend of the highest intelligence the warmest sympathy and a rare felicity of expression were addressed to me by the hereditary grand duke of luxembourg i had met him at balbec where he had come on a visit to one of his aunts the princesse de luxembourg being himself at that time merely comte de nassau he had married some months later the charming daughter of another luxembourg princess extremely rich because she was the only daughter of a prince who was the proprietor of an immense flourmill whereupon the grand duke of luxembourg who had no children of his own and was devoted to his nephew nassau had obtained the approval of his chamber to his declaring the young man his heir as with all marriages of this nature the origin of the bride’s fortune was the obstacle as it was also the deciding factor i remembered this comte de nassau as one of the most striking young men i had ever met already devoured at that time by a dark and blazing passion for his betrothed i was deeply touched by the letters which he wrote me day after day during my grandmother’s illness and mamma herself in her emotion quoted sadly one of her mother’s expressions “sévigné would not have put it better”

   on the sixth day mamma yielding to my grandmother’s entreaties left her for a little and pretended to go and lie down i should have liked so that my grandmother might go to sleep françoise to sit quite still and not disturb her by moving in spite of my supplications she got up and left the room she was genuinely devoted to my grandmother with her uncanny insight and her natural pessimism she regarded her as doomed she would therefore have liked to pay her every possible attention but word had just come that an electrician was in the house one of the oldest servants of his firm the head of which was his brotherinlaw highly esteemed throughout the building where he had worked for many years and especially by jupien this man had been ordered to come before my grandmother’s illness it seemed to me that he might have been sent away again or told to wait but franchise’s code of manners would not permit of this it would have been a want of courtesy towards this worthy man my grandmother’s condition ceased at once to matter when after waiting a quarter of an hour i lost my patience and went to look for her in the kitchen i found her talking to him on the landing of the back staircase the door of which stood open a device which had the advantage should any of us come on the scene of letting it be thought that they were just saying goodbye but had also the drawback of sending a terrible draught through the house françoise tore herself from the workman not without turning to shout down after him various greetings forgotten in her haste to his wife and brotherinlaw a typical combray scruple not to be found wanting in politeness which françoise extended even to foreign politics people foolishly imagine that the vast dimensions of social phenomena afford them an excellent opportunity to penetrate farther into the human soul they ought on the contrary to realise that it is by plumbing the depths of a single personality that they might have a chance of understanding those phenomena a thousand times over françoise told the gardener at combray that war was the most senseless of crimes that life was the only thing that mattered yet when the russojapanese war broke out she was quite ashamed when she thought of the tsar that we had not gone to war also to help the ‘poor russians’ “since” she reminded us “we’re allianced to them” she felt this abstention to be not quite polite to nicholas ii who had always “said such nice things about us” it was a corollary of the same code which would have prevented her from refusing a glass of brandy from jupien knowing that it would ‘upset’ her digestion and which brought it about that now with my grandmother lying at death’s door the same meanness of which she considered france guilty in remaining neutral with regard to japan she would have had to admit in herself had she not gone in person to make her apologies to this good electrician who had been put to so much trouble

   luckily for ourselves we were soon rid of françoise’s daughter who was obliged to be away for some weeks to the regular stock of advice which people at combray gave to the family of an invalid “you haven’t tried taking him away for a little    the change of air you know    pick up an appetite    etc” she had added the almost unique idea which she had specially created in her own imagination and repeated accordingly whenever we saw her without fail as though hoping by dint of reiteration to force it through the thickness of people’s heads “she ought to have taken herself in hand radically from the first” she did not recommend any one cure rather than another provided that it were ‘radical’ as for françoise herself she noticed that we were not giving my grandmother many medicines since according to her they only destroyed the stomach she was quite glad of this but at the same time even more humiliated she had in the south of france some cousins — relatively welltodo — whose daughter after falling ill just as she was growing up had died at twentythree for several years the father and mother had ruined themselves on drugs on different doctors on pilgrimages from one wateringplace to another until her decease now all this seemed to françoise for the parents in question a kind of luxury as though they had owned racehorses or a place in the country they themselves in the midst of their affliction derived a certain gratification from the thought of such lavish expenditure they had now nothing left least of all their most precious possession their child but they did enjoy telling people how they had done as much for her and more than the richest in the land the ultraviolet rays to the action of which several times a day for months on end the poor girl had been subjected delighted them more than anything the father elated in his grief by the glory of it all was led to speak of his daughter at times as of an operatic star for whose sake he had ruined himself françoise was not unmoved by this wealth of scenic effect that which framed my grandmother’s sickbed seemed to her a trifle meagre suited rather to an illness on the stage of a small provincial theatre

   there came a time when her uraemic trouble affected my grandmother’s eyes for some days she could not see at all her eyes were not at all like those of a blind person but remained just the same as before and i gathered that she could see nothing only from the strangeness of a certain smile of welcome which she assumed the moment one opened the door until one had come up to her and taken her hand a smile which began too soon and remained stereotyped on her lips fixed but always fullfaced and endeavouring to be visible from all points because she could no longer rely upon her sight to regulate it to indicate the right moment the proper direction to bring it to the point to make it vary according to the change of position or of facial expression of the person who had come in because it was left isolated without the accompanying smile in her eyes which would have distracted a little from it the attention of the visitor it assumed in its awkwardness an undue importance giving one the impression of an exaggerated friendliness then her sight was completely restored from her eyes the wandering affliction passed to her ears for several days my grandmother was deaf and as she was afraid of being taken by surprise by the sudden entry of some one whom she would not have heard come in all day long albeit she was lying with her face to the wall she kept turning her head sharply towards the door but the movement of her neck was clumsy for one cannot adapt oneself in a few days to this transposition of faculties so as if not actually to see sounds to listen with one’s eyes finally her pain grew less but the impediment of her speech increased we were obliged to ask her to repeat almost everything that she said

   and now my grandmother realising that we could no longer understand her gave up altogether the attempt to speak and lay perfectly still when she caught sight of me she gave a sort of convulsive start like a person who suddenly finds himself unable to breathe but could make no intelligible sound then overcome by her sheer powerlessness she let her head drop on to the pillows stretched herself out flat in her bed her face grave like a face of marble her hands motionless on the sheet or occupied in some purely physical action such as that of wiping her fingers with her handkerchief she made no effort to think then came a state of perpetual agitation she was incessantly trying to get up but we restrained her so far as we could from doing so for fear of her discovering how paralysed she was one day when she had been left alone for a moment i found her standing on the floor in her nightgown trying to open the window

   at balbec once when a widow who had jumped into the sea had been rescued against her will my grandmother had told me moved perhaps by one of those presentiments which we discern at times in the mystery — so obscure for all that — of the organic life around us in which nevertheless it seems that our own future is foreshadowed that she could think of nothing so cruel as to tear a poor wretch from the death that she had deliberately sought and restore her to her living martyrdom

   we were just in time to catch my grandmother she put up an almost violent resistance to my mother then overpowered seated forcibly in an armchair she ceased to wish for death to regret being alive her face resumed its impassivity and she began laboriously to pick off the hairs that had been left on her nightgown by a fur cloak which somebody had thrown over her shoulders

   the look in her eyes changed completely often uneasy plaintive haggard it was no longer the look we knew it was the sullen expression of a doddering old woman   

   by dint of repeatedly asking her whether she would not like her hair done françoise managed to persuade herself that the request had come from my grandmother she armed herself with brushes combs eau de cologne a wrapper “it can’t hurt madame amédée” she said to herself “if i just comb her nobody’s ever too ill for a good combing” in other words one was never too weak for another person to be able for her own satisfaction to comb one but when i came into the room i saw between the cruel hands of françoise as blissfully happy as though she were in the act of restoring my grandmother to health beneath a thin rain of aged tresses which had not the strength to resist the action of the comb a head which incapable of maintaining the position into which it had been forced was rolling to and fro with a ceaseless swirling motion in which sheer debility alternated with spasms of pain i felt that the moment at which françoise would have finished her task was approaching and i dared not hasten it by suggesting to her “that is enough” for fear of her disobeying me but i did forcibly intervene when in order that my grandmother might see whether her hair had been done to her liking françoise with innocent savagery brought her a glass i was glad for the moment that i had managed to snatch it from her in time before my grandmother whom we had carefully kept without a mirror could catch even a stray glimpse of a face unlike anything she could have imagined but alas when a moment later i leaned over her to kiss that dear forehead which had been so harshly treated she looked up at me with a puzzled distrustful shocked expression she did not know me

   according to our doctor this was a symptom that the congestion of her brain was increasing it must be relieved in some way

   cottard was in two minds françoise hoped at first that they were going to apply ‘clarified cups’ she looked for the effects of this treatment in my dictionary but could find no reference to it even if she had said ‘scarified’ instead of ‘clarified’ she still would not have found any reference to this adjective since she did not look any more for it under ‘s’ than under ‘c’ she did indeed say ‘clarified’ but she wrote and consequently assumed that the printed word was ‘esclarified’ cottard to her disappointment gave the preference though without much hope to leeches when a few hours later i went into my grandmother’s room fastened to her neck her temples her ears the tiny black serpents were writhing among her bloodstained locks as on the head of medusa but in her pale and peaceful entirely motionless face i saw wide open luminous and calm her own beautiful eyes as in days gone by perhaps even more charged with the light of intelligence than they had been before her illness since as she could not speak and must not move it was to her eyes alone that she entrusted her thought that thought which at one time occupies an immense place in us offering us undreamedof treasures at another time seems reduced to nothing then may be reborn as though by spontaneous generation by the withdrawal of a few drops of blood her eyes soft and liquid like two pools of oil in which the rekindled fire that was now burning lighted before the face of the invalid a reconquered universe her calm was no longer the wisdom of despair but that of hope she realised that she was better wished to be careful not to move and made me the present only of a charming smile so that i should know that she was feeling better as she gently pressed my hand

   i knew the disgust that my grandmother felt at the sight of certain animals let alone being touched by them i knew that it was in consideration of a higher utility that she was enduring the leeches and so it infuriated me to hear françoise repeating to her with that laugh which people use to a baby to make it crow “oh look at the little beasties running about on madame” this was moreover treating our patient with a want of respect as though she were in her second childhood but my grandmother whose face had assumed the calm fortitude of a stoic did not seem even to hear her

   alas no sooner had the leeches been taken off than the congestion returned and grew steadily worse i was surprised to find that at this stage when my grandmother was so ill françoise was constantly disappearing the fact was that she had ordered herself a mourning dress and did not wish to keep her dressmaker waiting in the lives of most women everything even the greatest sorrow resolves itself into a question of ‘tryingon’

   a few days later when i was in bed and sleeping my mother came to call me in the early hours of the morning with that tender consideration which in great crises people who are crushed by grief shew even for the slightest discomfort of others

    “forgive me for disturbing your sleep” she said to me

    “i was not asleep” i answered as i awoke

   i said this in good faith the great modification which the act of awakening effects in us is not so much that of introducing us to the clear life of consciousness as that of making us lose all memory of that other rather more diffused light in which our mind has been resting as in the opaline depths of the sea the tide of thought half veiled from our perception over which we were drifting still a moment ago kept us in a state of motion perfectly sufficient to enable us to refer to it by the name of wakefulness but then our actual awakenings produce an interruption of memory a little later we describe these states as sleep because we no longer remember them and when shines that bright star which at the moment of waking illuminates behind the sleeper the whole expanse of his sleep it makes him imagine for a few moments that this was not a sleeping but a waking state a shooting star it must be added which blots out with the fading of its light not only the false existence but the very appearance of our dream and merely enables him who has awoken to say to himself “i was asleep”

   in a voice so gentle that she seemed to be afraid of hurting me my mother asked whether it would tire me too much to get out of bed and stroking my hands went on

    “my poor boy you have only your papa and mamma to help you now”

   we went into the sickroom bent in a semicircle on the bed a creature other than my grandmother a sort of wild beast which was coated with her hair and couched amid her bedclothes lay panting groaning making the blankets heave with its convulsions the eyelids were closed and it was because the one nearer me did not shut properly rather than because it opened at all that it left visible a chink of eye misty filmed reflecting the dimness both of an organic sense of vision and of a hidden internal pain all this agitation was not addressed to us whom she neither saw nor knew but if this was only a beast that was stirring there where coulel my grandmother be yes i could recognise the shape of her nose which bore no relation now to the rest of her face but to the corner of which a beauty spot still adhered and the hand that kept thrusting the blankets aside with a gesture which formerly would have meant that those blankets were pressing upon her but now meant nothing

   mamma asked me to go for a little vinegar and water with which to sponge my grandmother’s forehead it was the only thing that refreshed her thought mamma who saw that she was trying to push back her hair but now one of the servants was signalling to me from the doorway the news that my grandmother was in the last throes had spread like wildfire through the house one of those ‘extra helps’ whom people engage at exceptional times to relieve the strain on their servants a practice which gives deathbeds an air of being social functions had just opened the front door to the duc de guermantes who was now waiting in the hall and had asked for me i could not escape him

    “i have just my dear sir heard your tragic news i should like as a mark of sympathy to shake hands with your father” i made the excuse that i could not very well disturb him at the moment m de guermantes was like a caller who turns up just as one is about to start on a journey but he felt so intensely the importance of the courtesy he was shewing us that it blinded him to all else and he insisted upon being taken into the drawingroom as a general rule he made a point of going resolutely through the formalities with which he had decided to honour anyone and took little heed that the trunks were packed or the coffin ready

    “have you sent for dieulafoy no that was a great mistake and if you had only asked me i would have got him to come he never refuses me anything although he has refused the duchesse de chartres before now you see i set myself above a princess of the blood however in the presence of death we are all equal” he added not that he meant to suggest that my grandmother was becoming his equal but probably because he felt that a prolonged discussion of his power over dieulafoy and his preeminence over the duchesse de chartres would not be in very good taste

   this advice did not in the least surprise me i knew that in the guermantes set the name of dieulafoy was regularly quoted only with slightly more respect among those of other tradesmen who were ‘quite the best’ in their respective lines and the old duchesse de mortemart néeguermantes i never could understand by the way why the moment one speaks of a duchess one almost invariably says “the old duchess of soandso” or alternatively in a delicate watteau tone if she is still young “the little duchess of soandso” would prescribe almost automatically with a droop of the eyelid in serious cases “dieulafoy dieulafoy” as if one wanted a place for ices she would advise ‘poiré blanche’ or for small pastry ‘rebattet rebattet’ but i was not aware that my father had as a matter of fact just sent for dieulafoy

   at this point my mother who was waiting impatiently for some cylinders of oxygen which would help my grandmother to breathe more easily came out herself to the hall where she little expected to find m de guermantes i should have liked to conceal him had that been possible but convinced in his own mind that nothing was more essential could be more gratifying to her or more indispensable to the maintenance of his reputation as a perfect gentleman he seized me violently by the arm and although i defended myself as against an assault with repeated protestations of “sir sir sir” dragged me across to mamma saying “will you do me the great honour of presenting me to your mother” letting go a little as he came to the last word and it was so plain to him that the honour was hers that he could not help smiling at her even while he was composing a grave face there was nothing for it but to mention his name the sound of which at once started him bowing and scraping and he was just going to begin the complete ritual of salutation he apparently proposed to enter into conversation but my mother overwhelmed by her grief told me to come at once and did not reply to the speeches of m de guermantes who expecting to be received as a visitor and finding himself instead left alone in the hall would have been obliged to retire had he not at that moment caught sight of saintloup who had arrived in paris that morning and had come to us in haste to inquire for news “i say this is a piece of luck” cried the duke joyfully catching his nephew by the sleeve which he nearly tore off regardless of the presence of my mother who was again crossing the hall saintloup was not sorry i fancy despite his genuine sympathy at having missed seeing me considering his attitude towards myself he left the house carried off by his uncle who — having had something very important to say to him and having very nearly gone down to doncières on purpose to say it was beside himself with joy at being able to save himself so much exertion “upon my soul if anybody had told me i had only to cross the courtyard and i should find you here i should have thought it a huge joke as your friend m bloch would say it’s a regular farce” and as he disappeared down the stairs with robert whom he held by the shoulder “all the same” he went on “it’s quite clear i must have touched the hangman’s rope or something i do have the most astounding luck” not that the duc de guermantes was illbred far from it but he was one of those men who are incapable of putting themselves in the place of other people who resemble in that respect undertakers and the majority of doctors and who after composing their faces and saying “this is a very painful occasion” after if need be embracing you and advising you to rest cease to regard a deathbed or a funeral as anything but a social gathering of a more or less restricted kind at which with a joviality that has been checked for a moment only they scan the room in search of the person whom they can tell about their own little affairs or ask to introduce them to some one else or offer a ‘lift’ in their carriage when it is time to go home the duc de guermantes while congratulating himself on the ‘good wind’ that had blown him into the arms of his nephew was still so surprised at the reception — natural as it was — that had been given him by my mother that he declared later on that she was as disagreeable as my father was civil that she had ‘absent fits’ during which she seemed literally not to hear a word you said to her and that in his opinion she had no selfpossession and perhaps even was not quite ‘all there’ at the same time he had been quite prepared according to what i was told to put this state of mind down in part at any rate to the circumstances and declared that my mother had seemed to him greatly ‘affected’ by the sad event but he had still stored up in his limbs all the residue of bows and reverences which he had been prevented from using up and had so little idea of the real nature of mamma’s sorrow that he asked me the day before the funeral if i was not doing anything to distract her

   a halfbrother of my grandmother who was in religion and whom i had never seen had telegraphed to austria where the head of his order was and having as a special privilege obtained leave arrived that day bowed down with grief he sat by the bedside reading prayers and meditations from a book without however taking his gimlet eyes from the invalid’s face at one point when my grandmother was unconscious the sight of this cleric’s grief began to upset me and i looked at him tenderly he appeared surprised by my pity and then an odd thing happened he joined his hands in front of his face like a man absorbed in painful meditation but on the assumption that i would then cease to watch him left as i observed a tiny chink between his fingers and at the moment when my gaze left his face i saw his sharp eye which had been making use of its vantagepoint behind his hands to observe whether my sympathy were sincere he was hidden there as in the darkness of a confessional he saw that i was still looking and at once shut tight the lattice which he had left ajar i have met him again since then but never has any reference been made by either of us to that minute it was tacitly agreed that i had not noticed that he was spying on me in the priest as in the alienist there is always an element of the examining magistrate besides what friend is there however cherished in whose and our common past there has not been some such episode which we find it convenient to believe that he must have forgotten

   the doctor gave my grandmother an injection of morphine and to make her breathing less troublesome ordered cylinders of oxygen my mother the doctor the nursing sister held these in their hands as soon as one was exhausted another was put in its place i had left the room for a few minutes when i returned i found myself face to face with a miracle accompanied on a muted instrument by an incessant murmur my grandmother seemed to be greeting us with a long and blissful chant which filled the room rapid and musical i soon realized that this was scarcely less unconscious that it was as purely mechanical as the hoarse rattle that i had heard before leaving the room perhaps to a slight extent it reflected some improvement brought about by the morphine principally it was the result the air not passing quite in the same way through the bronchial tubes of a change in the register of her breathing released by the twofold action of the oxygen and the morphine my grandmother’s breath no longer laboured panted groaned but swift and light shot like a skater along the delicious stream perhaps with her breath unconscious like that of the wind in the hollow stem of a reed there were blended in this chant some of those more human sighs which liberated at the approach of death make us imagine impressions of suffering or happiness in minds which already have ceased to feel and these sighs came now to add a more melodious accent but without changing its rhythm to that long phrase which rose mounted still higher then declined to start forth afresh from her unburdened bosom in quest of the oxygen then having risen to so high a pitch having been sustained with so much vigour the chant mingled with a murmur of supplication from the midst of her ecstasy seemed at times to stop altogether like a spring that has ceased to flow

   françoise in any great sorrow felt the need but did not possess the art — as simple as that need was futile — of giving it expression regarding my grandmother’s case as quite hopeless it was her own personal impressions that she was impelled to communicate to us and all that she could do was to repeat “it makes me feel all queer” in the same tone in which she would say when she had taken too large a plateful of cabbage broth “it’s like a load on my stomach” sensations both of which were more natural than she seemed to think though so feebly expressed her grief was nevertheless very great and was aggravated moreover by her annoyance that her daughter detained at combray to which this young parisian now referred as ‘the cambrousse’ and where she felt herself growing ‘pétrousse’ in other words fossilised would not presumably be able to return in time for the funeral ceremony which was certain françoise felt to be a superb spectacle knowing that we were not inclined to be expansive she made jupien promise at all costs to keep every evening in the week free she knew that he would be engaged elsewhere at the hour of the funeral she was determined at least to ‘go over it all’ with him on his return

   for several nights now my father my grandfather and one of our cousins had been sitting up and never left the house during the day their continuous devotion ended by assuming a mask of indifference and their interminable leisure round the deathbed made them indulge in that small talk which is an inseparable accompaniment of prolonged confinement in a railway carriage anyhow this cousin a nephew of my greataunt aroused in me an antipathy as strong as the esteem which he deserved and generally enjoyed he was always ‘sent for’ in times of great trouble and was so assiduous in his attentions to the dying that their mourning families on the pretext that he was in delicate health despite his robust appearance his bass voice and bristling beard invariably besought him with the customary euphemisms not to come to the cemetery i could tell already that mamma who thought of others in the midst of the most crushing grief would soon be saying to him in a very different form of words what he was in the habit of hearing said on all such occasions

    “promise me that you won’t come ‘tomorrow’ please for ‘her sake’ at any rate you won’t go ‘all the way’ it’s what she would have wished”

   but there was nothing for it he was always the first to arrive ‘at the house’ by reason of which he had been given among another set the nickname unknown to us of ‘no flowers by request’ and before attending everything he had always ‘attended to everything’ which entitled him to the formula “we don’t know how to thank you”

    “what’s that” came in a loud voice from my grandfather who had grown rather deaf and had failed to catch something which our cousin had just said to my father

    “nothing” answered the cousin “i was just saying that i’d heard from combray this morning the weather is appalling down there and here we’ve got too much sun”

    “yet the barometer is very low” put in my father

    “where did you say the weather was bad” asked my grandfather

    “at combray”

    “ah i’m not surprised whenever it’s bad here it’s fine at combray and vice versa good gracious talking of combray has anyone remembered to tell legrandin”

    “yes don’t worry about that it’s been done” said my cousin whose cheeks bronzed by an irrepressible growth of beard dimpled faintly with the satisfaction of having ‘remembered’ it

   at this point my father hurried from the room i supposed that a sudden change for better or worse had occurred it was simply that dr dieulafoy had just arrived my father went to receive him in the drawingroom like the actor who is to come next on the stage we had sent for him not to cure but to certify in almost a legal capacity dr dieulafoy might indeed be a great physician a marvellous professor to these several parts in which he excelled he added a third in which he remained for forty years without a rival a part as original as that of the arguer the scaramouch or the noble father which consisted in coming to certify an agony or a death the mere sound of his name foreshadowed the dignity with which he would sustain the part and when the servant announced “m dieulafoy” one imagined oneself at a play by molière to the dignity of his attitude was added without being conspicuous the suppleness of a perfect figure a face in itself too goodlooking was toned down by the convention due to distressing circumstances in the sable majesty of his frock coat the professor entered the room melancholy without affectation uttered not the least word of condolence which might have been thought insincere nor was he guilty of the slightest infringement of the rules of tact at the foot of a deathbed it was he and not the duc de guermantes who was the great gentleman having examined my grandmother but not so as to tire her and with ari excess of reserve which was an act of courtesy to the doctor who was treating the case he murmured a few words to my father bowed respectfully to my mother to whom i felt that my father had positively to restrain himself from saying “professor dieulafoy” but already our visitor had turned away not wishing to seem to be soliciting an introduction and left the room in the most polished manner conceivable simply taking with him the sealed envelope that was slipped into his hand he had not appeared to see it and we ourselves were left wondering for a moment whether we had really given it to him such a conjurer’s nimbleness had he put into the act of making it vanish without thereby losing anything of the gravity — which was increased rather — of the great consultant in his long frock coat with its silken lapels and his handsome head full of a noble commiseration the slowness and vivacity of his movements shewed that even if he had a hundred other visits to pay and patients waiting he refused to appear hurried for he was the embodiment of tact intelligence and kindness that eminent man is no longer with us other physicians other professors may have rivalled may indeed have surpassed him but the ‘capacity’ in which his knowledge his physical endowments his distinguished manners made him triumph exists no longer for want of any successor capable of taking his place mamma had not even noticed m dieulafoy everything that was not my grandmother having no existence for her i remember and here i anticipate that at the cemetery where we saw her like a supernatural apparition go up timidly to the grave and seem to be gazing in the wake of a flying form that was already far away my father having remarked to her “old norpois came to the house and to the church and on here he gave up a most important committee meeting to come you ought really to say a word to him he’ll be so gratified if you do” my mother when the ambassador stood before her and bowed could do no more than gently incline a face that shewed no tears a couple of days earlier — to anticipate once again before returning to where we were just now by the bed on which my grandmother lay dying — while they were watching by the body françoise who not disbelieving entirely in ghosts was terrified by the least sound had said “i believe that’s her” but in place of fear it was an ineffable sweetness that her words aroused in my mother who would have been so glad that the dead should return to have her mother with her sometimes still

   to return now to those last hours “you heard about the telegram her sisters sent us” my grandfather asked the cousin

    “yes beethoven they told me about it it’s worth framing still i’m not surprised”

    “my poor wife who was so fond of them too” said my grandfather wiping away a tear “we mustn’t blame them they’re stark mad both of them as i’ve always said what’s the matter now aren’t you going on with the oxygen”

   my mother spoke “oh but then mamma will be having more trouble with her breathing”

   the doctor reassured her “oh no the effect of the oxygen will last a good while yet we can begin it again presently”

   it seemed to me that he would not have said this of a dying woman that if this good effect were to last it meant that we could still do something to keep her alive the hiss of the oxygen ceased for a few moments but the happy plaint of her breathing poured out steadily light troubled unfinished without end beginning afresh now and then it seemed that all was over her breath stopped whether owing to one of those transpositions to another octave that occur in the breathing of a sleeper or else from a natural interruption an effect of unconsciousness the progress of asphyxia some failure of the heart the doctor stooped to feel my grandmother’s pulse but already as if a tributary were pouring its current into the dried riverbed a fresh chant broke out from the interrupted measure and the first was resumed in another pitch with the same inexhaustible force who knows whether without indeed my grandmother’s being conscious of them a countless throng of happy and tender memories compressed by suffering were not escaping from her now like those lighter gases which had long been compressed in the cylinders one would have said that everything thai she had to tell us was pouring out that it was to us that she was addressing herself with this prolixity this earnestness this effusion at the foot of the bed convulsed by every gasp of this agony not weeping but now and then drenched with tears my mother presented the unreasoning desolation of a leaf which the rain lashes and the wind twirls on its stem they made me dry my eyes before i went up to kiss my grandmother

    “but i thought she couldn’t see anything now” said my father

    “one can never be sure” replied the doctor

   when my lips touched her face my grandmother’s hands quivered a long shudder ran through her whole body reflex perhaps perhaps because certain affections have their hyperaesthesia which recognises through the veil of unconsciousness what they barely need senses to enable them to love suddenly my grandmother half rose made a violent effort as though struggling to resist an attempt on her life françoise could not endure this sight and burst out sobbing remembering what the doctor had just said i tried to make her leave the room at that moment my grandmother opened her eyes i thrust myself hurriedly in front of françoise to hide her tears while my parents were speaking to the sufferer the sound of the oxygen had ceased the doctor moved away from the bedside my grandmother was dead

   an hour or two later françoise was able for the last time and without causing them any pain to comb those beautiful tresses which had only begun to turn grey and hitherto had seemed not so old as my grandmother herself but now on the contrary it was they alone that set the crown of age on a face grown young again from which had vanished the wrinkles the contractions the swellings the strains the hollows which in the long course of years had been carved on it by suffering as at the faroff time when her parents had chosen for her a bridegroom she had the features delicately traced by purity and submission the cheeks glowing with a chaste expectation with a vision of happiness with an innocent gaiety even which the years had gradually destroyed life in withdrawing from her had taken with it the disillusionments of life a smile seemed to be hovering on my grandmother’s lips on that funeral couch death like a sculptor of the middle ages had laid her in the form of a young maidenembed"
