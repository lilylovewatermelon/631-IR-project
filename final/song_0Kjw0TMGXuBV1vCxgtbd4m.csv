youngest nigga i’m stuntin’ no more civics from honda
money come in abudance that’s the reason she wanna

intro 2 trey songz
lay up lay up
lay up lay up

verse 1 meek mill
i keep a vest on my chest to cover my heart
i’d rather fuck in the light ‘fore i make love in the dark
cuz she was fuckin’ me right it felt like love from the start
was gettin’ money on tour so we was lovin’ for fall
but first we go together then break up tears drip on her makeup
fuck all night ‘til we wake up and like george gervin we lay up
cuz all them lies i made up it’s big checks no pay cut
floor seats in florida heat game vs lakers
shorty on my team now it was us versus them haters
and everybody they talk bad when they talk that she take up
she hermes all flavors young boy get paper
and all i know is go hard and every time i touch that ball i go swish

chorus trey songz
she know it’s gametime when i do it like that
when i pass it to her baby throw it right back
she can get the lay up all night
she be tryna lay up all right
and when i shoot i don’t miss don’t miss i don’t miss don’t miss
i don’t miss when i do it now
she could get the lay up all night
she be tryna lay up all right

sitting back with this paper falling in my lap
feeling isolated nothing but them hundred stacks
when your money up tell me who you’re supposed to trust
every night a different woman fuck your money up
my bank account in shape i could run with puff
i came to put you down shorty so what the fuck is up
since i met her she can’t keep that pussy off me
on the pill i’mma kill that pussy softly
back to back time to show you how a gangster move
keys to the pad talkin’ infinity pools
v12’s ain’t a thang time to change your name
paper stuffed in her purse can’t hear her phone ring

chorus trey songz
she know it’s gametime when i do it like that
when i pass it to her baby throw it right back
she can get the lay up all night
she be tryna lay up all right
and when i shoot i don’t miss don’t miss i don’t miss don’t miss
i don’t miss when i do it now
she could get the lay up all night
she be tryna lay up all right

verse 3 wale
homie picture me rollin’ all them bitches be on me
they be fishing for compliments i’m just fishing off boca
made a grip off them vocals got a gift with the vocals
so much over these hoes should have been on a poster
infatuated to say the least
he lay it weak i lay you once you lay a week
wale a freak he know it doe no go with hoes
when it come to showin’ i am working with totem pole
that’s head on head she give me head i give her glow
i’m in her body i’m in her head like quote unquote
the coldest flow the flyest combination was voila
au revoir to my rivals double m genius shotta
chorus trey songz
she know it’s gametime when i do it like that
when i pass it to her baby throw it right back
she can get the lay up all night
she be tryna lay up all right
and when i shoot i don’t miss don’t miss i don’t miss don’t miss
i don’t miss when i do it now
she could get the lay up all night
she be tryna lay up all right

verse 4 trey songz
from the night to the morn’ yeah she tryna lay
got a freaky freaky game and she tryna play
