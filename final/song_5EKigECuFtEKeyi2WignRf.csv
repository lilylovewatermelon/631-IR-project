its been a while since you last saw me
one breaks down and the other ones fade
these eyes can see the days break
too late for the others mistakes

prechorus
sit down laugh thinking what have we done
let me inside
is it all over before its begun
please give me some time

chorus
cause we are runnin into the sun
getting close to somethin into the sun
you know that were fallin were falling back
into the sun

verse 2
i never meant to let you go
why did i leave maybe well never know
but im a man now broken on the ground
im in need and i think that it shows

prechorus
all this time were goin nowhere and we know it
i was so blind
all the lights are leadin to where youre goin
im not far behind
