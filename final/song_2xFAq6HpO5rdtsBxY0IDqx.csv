this greed  its bigger than you and me
will you come again
body

tongue tied and a visceral third degree
feel warm  center of gravity
wash us all away
body never lies

will you come again
will we stay friends
oh you paralyze
oh you paralyze

there are times when i wish
that i was you
thick skinned  cities that you drive me through
better than me  youre a woman

seven days and my system is free again
we rise  lose it on oblivion
falling away  sorry for the way
your child is on fire  your child is on fire

will you come again
will we stay friends
oh you paralyze
oh you paralyze
see bush liveget tickets as low as 28you might also likewill you come again
will we stay friends
will you come again
will we stay
will we stay
will we stay

lick these my ruby lips
drop your protein pills
and find that that its
better just to lose yourself
we kiss we kiss we kiss

pretty words could never say

will you come again1embed"
