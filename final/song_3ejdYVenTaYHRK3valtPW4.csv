ive known faces that have disappeared in time
find me wrapped in glass and slowly soaked in lime
all my friends have pictures made to make you cry
ive seen this and wondered what ive done to calcify

chorus
i ignore you
as i close my eyes i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind we let it all slip away
i ignore you
as i close my eyes i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind we let it all slip away

verse 2
i cant stand to see your thalidomide robot face
i dont even try it
you had to be a liar just to infiltrate me
im still drowning

chorus
i ignore you
as i close my eyes i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind we let it all slip away
i ignore you
as i close my eyes i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind we let it all slip away
see slipknot liveget tickets as low as 85you might also likebridge
take this away
take this away
i can feel it on my mouth
i can taste you on my fingers
i can hear you like the holy ghost
and kill you if you get too close

chorus
i ignore you
as i close my eyes i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind we let it all slip away
i ignore you
as i close my eyes i feel it all slipping away
i come toward you
we all got left behind we let it all slip away

outro
we let it all slip away
we let it all slip away
we let it all slip away
we let it all slip away
we let it all slip away
we let it all slip awayembed"
