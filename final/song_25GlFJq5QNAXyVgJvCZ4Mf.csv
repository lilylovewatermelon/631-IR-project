ooh champagne pourin down
arms legs wrapped around you
ooh champagne let it fall down
arms legs keep grabbing

verse 1
see i be catchin you starin be careful
the idle mind is a dangerous place to be left in
but keep your eyes on me
yeah your heart dont stand a chance
it feels like its been far too long
your knees cant hold your legs
your feet just want to pace
the eyes keep me all in a trance
let me ask you
would you leave it all in the back of your head
or all in the palm of my hand huh
aint nobody holding you back
dont it feel like its been far too long girl
your heart dont stand a chance
your knees just want to break
your eyes keep me all in a trance
and let me ask you mmm
i know the approach is so far from what youre used to
but you know it
and do i hold a candle to the last one over your moon
baby of course i do
and im not closing my tab
dont it feel like its been far too long girl

verse 2
yeah yeah twostep in the corridor
spinning the greatest hits of hall  oates
open of chronic smoke
i know my time will flee
but your heart dont stand a chance uh
it feels like its been far too long hmm
the moment is all that we have
my meter should be up by the half
a ticket is the least of my cares
so let me ask you uh
am i dreaming
mind on the tip of a cloud
or is it real as the stone in your crown
say aint nobody towing my jag uh
dont it feel like its been far too long girl huh
your heart dont stand a chance
im waiting for the white flag
youre talking with the blunt in your hand
and wont you pass that huh
i know in the morning
the sunlight cover your wounds huh
but im hoping that i look the same as the way you always knew
baby of course i flew
but im not over what we had huh
dont it feel like its been far too long girl uh
your heart dont stand a chance

ooh champagne pourin down

skit
i remember being tumbled around and not being able to get to the surface where the air was
and looking down and seeing my body spinning around in the white water20embed"
