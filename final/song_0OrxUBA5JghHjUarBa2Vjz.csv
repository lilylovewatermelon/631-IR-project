i never wanna be alone
but now that youre gone
im thinking that this love is all but done
nothings ever been so clear
but when youre near
im feeling like anytime i change my mind here

verse 1 josh
and i should say im fine here
just to leave your mind at ease
and i mostly stay inside here
and then i watch as all these
dreams fall far from the ocean floor
while years roll by in the driftless north
how inexorably all things fade
and still half hoping that somehow
everything can turn out ok

chorus mellow fellow  ruru
i never wanna be alone
but now that youre gone
im thinking that this love is all but done
nothings ever been so clear
but when youre near
im feeling like anytime i change my mind here

i see you online
now this is real life
images of when when you you were were mine mine
now youre looking me up
youre looking me down
im just a clown
and you know my
heart is a ghost town woo
i fall into myself and drown
never wanna be here
never wanna be there
welcome to my lonely zone
guess ill see you on my phone

chorus mellow fellow  ruru
i never wanna be alone
but now that youre gone
im thinking that this love is all but done
nothings ever been so clear
but when youre near
im feeling like anytime i change my mind here2embed"
