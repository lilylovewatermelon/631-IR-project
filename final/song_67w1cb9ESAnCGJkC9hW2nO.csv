cry alone ive gone away
no more nights no more pain
ive gone alone took all my strength
ive made the change
i wont see you tonight

chorus 1
sorrow sank deep inside my blood
all the ones around me
i cared for and loved

verse 2
its building up inside of me
a place so dark so cold i had to set me free
dont mourn for me youre not the one to place the blame
as bottles call my name
i wont see you tonight

chorus 2
sorrow sank deep inside my blood
all the ones around me
i cared for and most of all i loved
but i cant see myself that way
please dont forget me or cry while im away

no more nights no more pain

and while im gone everything will be alright
