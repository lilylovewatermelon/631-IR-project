and wondering why the world has passed him by
hoping that hes bent for more than arguments
and failed attempts to fly fly

we were meant to live for so much more
have we lost ourselves
somewhere we live inside

have we lost ourselves
somewhere we live inside
somewhere we live inside
we were meant to live for so much more
have we lost ourselves
somewhere we live inside
