outside the cafe by the cracker factory
you were practicing a magic trick
and my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
on the last of your pick and mix
said youre mistaken if youre thinking
that i havent been called cold before
as you bit into your strawberry lace
and then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
its all you had left and it was going to waste

chorus
your pastimes consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i love that little game you had called crying lightning
and how youd like to aggravate the icecream man
on rainy afternoons

verse 2
the next time that i caught my own reflection
it was on its way to meet you
thinking of excuses to postpone
you never looked like yourself from the side
but your profile could not hide
the fact you knew i was approaching your throne
with folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
stood and puffed your chest out like youd never lost a war
and though i tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
there was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw
you might also likechorus
and your pastimes consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called crying lightning
and how youd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
uninviting but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
crying lightning

instrumental break

chorus
your pastimes consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called
crying lightning crying lightning
crying lightning crying lightning
your pastimes consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called crying53embed"
