i heard what you said
the leaders are dead
theyre robbing the skies
i can hear their followers cry

chorus
starlings in the slipstream
starlings in the slipstream
starlings in the slipstream
starlings in the slipstream

verse 2
the language of influence
is cluttered with hard hard cs
and i put a spy cam
in a sorority

chorus
darlings on the splitscreen
darlings on the splitscreen
darlings on the splitscreen

outro
theres no women in alaska
theres no creoles in vermont
theres no coast of nebraska
my mother i forgot
slavic princess with a rose in her teeth
do you suppose she would bite you if she could
insane cobra split the wood
trader of the lowland breed
call a jitney drive away
in the slipstream we will stay
stay away away away away away away awayyou might also like1embed"
