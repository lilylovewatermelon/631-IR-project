general i salute you
i put a hole in any nigga tryna shoot you

and what i dont do i have one of my troops do
nigga well kill you

verse 1 young buck
im ready for combat a soldier on the front line
take it to the streets nigga motherfuck a punchline cmon
it only take one time for you to send a death threat
and watch these bullets have that ass singin like keith sweat braaattttt
you aint met me yet i been camouflaged in the bushes
and im cosignin 50 cause them niggas all pussy
bustin shots at ya convoy you dont want war
no surrender no retreat this is vietnam boy cmon
check my war wounds i done took a couple for the team
only niggas that been on the battlefield know what i mean yeah
take cover we comin pullin pins out of grenades
you wont make it to the general without gettin sprayed bitch
might as well say hello to my brand new little friend
only time he come out to put holes in grown men come on
you can send your troops and get em all blow back
walk up on em with a deuce deuce and nigga hold that buck

look nigga i suggest you go home
cause i wont hesitate to let the chrome touch ya
nigga im never scared like bone crusher
stand alone provide my own supper
tell ya baby momma stop comin around here or im gon fuck her
dont try to take up for them lames around you
hell get shots for free like i flagrant fouled you
im on the road blowin grade a haze and brown uh huh
got niggas runnin like the kkks around yea
my albums comin a new years approachin
my buzz gettin bigger a few ears is open
can your team play in the game without you there to coach em
theres a very fine line between a pool and a ocean
sometimes im in atlanta where they bankhead bounce
and you could come but after you give banks head bounce bounce
these niggas really want war cause if so put on your vest
cause all you gotta do is say yes
