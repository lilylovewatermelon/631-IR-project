thats where my love lives
a long long ride to sunland
here where i did this

across the great divide alone
wondering open afraid and
arriving alive unknown
unknown unwise and unaided

if i could i might
send my love on a plane ride
a black cross high in a blue sky
a green cross gliding on a million pines

across the great divide alone
wondering open afraid and
arrive in a life unknown
unknown unwise and unaided

across the great divide alone
wondering open afraid and
try to find a life unknown
unknown unwise and unaided

across the great divide alone
wondering open afraid and
arrive in a life unknown
unknown unwise and unaided
