jefferson
can we get back to politics

madison
please

jefferson
yo ev’ry action has an equal opposite reaction
john adams shat the bed i love the guy but he’s in traction
poor alexander hamilton he is missing in action
so now i’m facing—

jefferson and madison
aaron burr

jefferson
with his own faction

madison
he’s very attractive in the north new yorkers like his chances

jefferson
he’s not very forthcoming on any particular stances
you might also likemadison
ask him a question it glances off he obfuscates he dances

jefferson
and they say i’m a francophile at least they know i know where france is

madison
thomas that’s the problem see they see burr as a less extreme you

jefferson
ha

madison
you need to change course a key endorsement might redeem you

jefferson
who did you have in mind

madison

jefferson
who is it

madison

jefferson

madison
it might be nice it might be nice
to get hamilton on your side

jefferson and madison
it might be nice it might be nice
to get hamilton on your side
