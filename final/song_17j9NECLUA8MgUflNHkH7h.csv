you say its easier
alone and undisturbed
you said yes and danced before
and got your feelings hurt
you say most days youre good
its not so bad this room
why chance the rain today
even though its clear and sunny
and you fight it so hard
how to tell if its real or not

chorus
take a breath and listen listen
open up stop wishing wishing
all that youve been missin missin
standing in front of you
everything youre fearing fearing
all the walls youre building building
take a chance your reasons reasons
standing in front of you standing in front of you
standing in front of you standing in front of you

verse 2
you start to sway again
feeling good in your skin
you start to remember when
you didnt have to try
and then the glitter turns to dust
the color fades enough to make out pictures of a fire
that burns like love
you can close your eyes dont worry
ill still be here in the morning

take a breath and listen listen
open up stop wishing wishing
all that youve been missin missin
standing in front of you
everything youre fearing fearing
all the walls youre building building
take a chance your reasons reasons
standing in front of you standing in front of you
standing in front of you standing in front of you

bridge
and they wont break us
and they cant get through
cause im gonna be here
standing in front of you

chorus
take a breath and listen listen
open up stop wishing wishing
all that youve been missin missin
standing in front of you
everything youre fearing fearing
all the walls youre building building
take a chance your reasons reasons
standing in front of you standing in front of you
standing in front of you standing in front of you
standing in front of you standing in front of youembed"
