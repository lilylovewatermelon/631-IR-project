just in case my car goes off the highway
or the plane that i get on decides that its my last day
i want you to know when youre alone and you feel afraid
youre not the only person in the world that isnt okay
theres millions of us just like you like you like you
just like you like you
theres millions of us just like you like you like you
just like you like you

verse 1
its strange the way the mind can wander but also stop to gossip
and chat with memories that you and me arent really fond of
maybe youre out to find love maybe you lost who you was
maybе youre just like me and feel thе need to stay in your rut
cause if you left it you might feel like youre no longer you
its so impressive the way the mind can play with the truth
its interestin that nobody can walk in your shoes
but still relate and feel the same so in a way guess we do
you ever think about what it would be like
if the clouds were gone and you could see light
if the door was open would you take flight
or just close the curtains up and stay inside
take a walk with me take a risk with me
im scared too and it gets so tempting
when youre so empty to disown everything
you hold dearly when you know clearly
you been so buried in your own fairytale
the souls tearin bunch of holes in me
i relate to it but in case you been
thinkin no one does heres a great theory
throw a hail mary let ya mind fly
to the sun rise could be so scary
make your faith vary feel the pain glaring
but the weight carried aint in vain hear me hear me

or the plane that i get on decides that its my last day
i want you to know when youre alone and you feel afraid

theres millions of us just like you like you like you
just like you like you
theres millions of us just like you like you like you
just like you like you

verse 2
so often i feel desperate i think my hearts infected
how bout yours how bout yours how bout yours i guess if
you feel the best when your life is hectic you might be destined
to stay defective so join the club it aint that hard to get in
its hard to leave though look at the guest list
i bet that your name is on it dont believe me check it
see dead ends
in life we come to tend to raise some questions
suggestion
know that your feelings might give wrong directions infested
yeah with the feeling of failure
let it take over your body it makes ya
question the life that you have situations
you might have enjoyed become nothin but dated
old and forgotten but what would you say if
i told you that there was some hope we could make it
i know what youre thinkin im thinkin it too
could you really improve and be somethin worth savin
see i could pretend like i have all the answers
but none of us do its the reason we battle
convincing yourself that you dont really matters
like feedin a cancer and letting it travel
to every part of you but what if we did
the unthinkable and cancel our trips
whats achievable depends on the risk
so pick up your chin and listen to this
chorus
just in case my car goes off the highway
or the plane that i get on decides that its my last day
i want you to know when youre alone and you feel afraid
youre not the only person in the world that isnt okay
theres millions of us just like you like you like you
just like you like you
theres millions of us just like you like you like you
just like you like you you you you you

yeah everybody falls sometimes
just remember that thats alright
its the rainy days that give us love for the sun
and if it isnt i guess ill be fine believin it does oh yeah
everybody falls sometimes
just remember that thats alright
its the lows in life that make you cherish the highs
and if it isnt i guess ill be fine believin a lie ayy

chorus
just in case my car goes off the highway

i want you to know when youre alone and you feel afraid
youre not the only person in the world that isnt okay
