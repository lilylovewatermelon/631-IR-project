i got my head on a swivel
think its time i open my mind where i left these niggas incompletely
make sure that they cant delete me
im bout to rewire your whole fucking mainframe sick of the same
lame old same thing
i got some bubonic you might wanna mix with some whisk
i got a vendetta with showing niggas that im way better
feeling way worthless the lost black sheep of good music
only good for a hook huh let me show you flows
intuitive when it comes to the many things i know
cold most winters i would dream of being a winner
feeling like less than shit to the doubters
pain i promise to all who oppose my knowledge
my reign the fucking essence of pain fuck rain
standing in a monsoon of cool time will tell
this is what it is when youre walking to hell

chorus
cold
bitch you know im cold yeah
im one cold blooded nigga
oh so cold
niggas know im cold yeah
one cold blooded nigga

i love how i can make so many people feel uneasy
walk right past i know you hoes see me
cant deny the shine of a jedi
worldclass almighty super cudder the godly
burbon divas just smoking tiva those my hobbies
i love shittin on these niggas that is my fave
cant fuck with an unstoppable force
that lives with no regrets and of course no remorse
one two one two assholes now please listen close
i live for the day to watch all you pussies roast
whoosah whoosah so i dont slit nobody throat
aw it aint my fault homie thought he had the juice
bash a nigga face and watch the blood leak
put my ear where his jaw was tell a nigga to speak
standing in a monsoon of cool karma is my armor
was only scared of my father beyond that im

chorus
cold
bitch you know im cold yeah
im one cold blooded nigga
oh so cold
niggas know im cold yeah
one cold blooded nigga

bitch you know im cold yeah
im one cold blooded nigga
oh so cold
niggas know im cold yeah
one cold blooded nigga
