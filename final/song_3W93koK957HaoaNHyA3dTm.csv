here comes the cold
break out the winter clothes
and find a love to call your own
you enter you
your cheeks a shade of pink
and the rest of you in powder blue

prechorus
who knows what will be
but ill make you this guarantee see

chorus
no way november will see our goodbye
when it comes to december its obvious why
no one wants to be alone at christmas time

verse 2
in the dark on the phone
you tell me the names of your brothers
and your favorite colors
im learning you
and when it snows again
well take a walk outside
and search the sky
like children do
ill say to you
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likechorus
no way november will see our goodbye
when it comes to december its obvious why
no one wants to be alone at christmas time
and come january were frozen inside
making new resolutions a hundred times
february wont you be my valentine
and well both be safe til st patricks day

bridge
we should take a ride tonight around the town
and look around at all the beautiful houses
something in the way that blue lights on a black night
can make you feel more
everybody it seems to me just wants to be
just like you and me
hey hey

chorus
no one wants to be alone at christmas time
and come january were frozen inside
making new resolutions a hundred times
february wont you be my valentine
and well both be safe til st patricks day

outro
and if our always is all that we gave
and we someday take that away
ill be alright if it was just until st patricks day3embed"
