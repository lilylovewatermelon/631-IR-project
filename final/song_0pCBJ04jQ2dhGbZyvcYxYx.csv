tryna get a check they was procrastinatin
i stay around killers i stay around robbers they keepin me motivated
my brother was droppin me off with my blick he know im intoxicated
im goin to give dede his bond tonight da want him incarcerated
i told him i aint make it just because im hot i gotta get nominated
i gotta go turn up and get me a check and i cant keep my mama waitin
i put my perc in my lean but i wasnt sharin lean
twentyone hundred on jeans but i was sharin jeans
feds come hide in closet
car stopped stash the masi
they talk bad about me
they say im luminati
they say dont talk to the jails
he aint buy no guns through zelle
he aint send no pounds through mail
he dont be on the block for real
fuck him he gon die for real
lowkey he a clown for real
he dont do for his guys for real
he stay out of town for real
what he do in his raps he lyin
he doin shows no time to kill
i love them deep they turned they back on me them signs for real

chorus
think what you want aint tryna clear no rumors up
think what you want i know they do not fuck with us
i made dis aint what u want i brought the block
he had the chance to tell on niggas he gave em up
they dont fuck with you for real i know
they dont love you for real i know
they dont appreciate your skills i know
they do not care if you die or live ooh

knowin your vibes be fake and crazy thats why me i keep it the realest
niggas did somethin to you you aint did shit back but you posed to be one of them killers

i give em money to handle they business they spinnin the block back to back like a triller
posed to be gang they say that i changed they makin me mad ima tell em i didnt
im talkin the worst way i helped niggas out on they birthday
we shouldntve been cool in the first place
always support at your court date
sneak up on opps make em urinate
sleep in the traps til our shirts stink

chorus
think what you want aint tryna clear no rumors up
think what you want i know they do not fuck with us
i made dis aint what u want i brought the block
he had the chance to tell on niggas he gave em up
they dont fuck with you for real i know
they dont love you for real i know
they dont appreciate your skills i know
they do not care if you die or live ooh3embed"
