our fridays are mondays and our second home is on wheels
i told you id slow down but we both know i never will
half of our nights baby we spend em sleeping alone
i gotta go conversations and raising our kids through the phone

chorus
i know its been hard i know it aint easy
oh but i couldnt do one show without you oh baby believe me
crowds have been crazy but baby im missin you bad
just wanna say thank you for living this dream i know you never had

verse 2
im seeing those signs with your name written on em in lights
spotlights on me but they know youre the reason i shine
you married the music the day that you married me
baby im just a singer and you are the songs that i sing

chorus
i know its been hard i know it aint easy
oh but i couldnt do one show without you oh baby believe me
crowds have been crazy but baby im missing you bad
just wanna say thank you for living this dream i know you never had
