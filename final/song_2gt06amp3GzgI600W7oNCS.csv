ive got to stack my paper daily on my grind
keeping ways this crooked game can pay me on my mind
on the block all day bout to drive me crazy but i got to shine
all day i gotta get my hustle on because i wanna ball not get my struggle on

zro
gotta get up and get it cause i gotta have someing
if im broke ima play spondalay cause ima grab someing
im a soldier and i aint gon stop swinging till i fold ya
i gotta pay ready bills plus i need some doja
from doing shows to kicking in dos for feddy
prefer a glock cause it aint heavy
im in the dodge not the cheve cause im ready to ride tonight
roll with tensions i dont need nobody eyes tonight
because a snitch is somebody that you dig a ditch for
when you do it alone is when you get rich brah
even when im on the block i got my spot tied down
any short stopping they know im ready to ride down
cause i need my money aint no working for free
if it aint 25 hundred dont even bull with me
cause i aint coming unless i can get what im worth
cause i be feeling like im the rawest mc on this earth

hook
you might also liketpop
i like to see the sunshine and just roll on 84s
let these boppers know the deal they know that southside gon hold
gon hold fa sho pockets gon fold
screwed up click my family and we done kicked in the do
zro king of the ghetto stacking his feddy
copping these dollar signs so you busters aint ready
we cocked up in a cheve plus we pushing the clock
benz on lorenzos sitting low in the drop
i wont stop because im too far gone
corleone im a rider till you come back home
taking fos to the dome screwzoo sit on your throne
we still jamming your songs thanking the lord you was born
because without you it wouldnt be no rapping
the only thing i could see is my pistols a clickclacking
clickclacking bad actor nine packer
reflecting this beam for you petty ass jackers

hook

lil flex
we pop cristal in the memory of
and write songs for the people we remember we love
remember we thugs this is for the crips and the bloods
nobody cries when we die only swishas and jugs
ounces of bud put up your mug its going down
pop the trunk and show surround the dirty 3rd is where im found
one hundred percent realer of the 790 taxing niggas
by mouth phones i be faxing niggas
from the streets you better ask them niggas
i got more toys in the trunk than you action figures
they dont come around because we clap too much
and i dont bar with lil boys cause they act too much
if you think about getting clips and jacking us
then you better think again cause the gatsll bust
like biggie smalls say im notorious
the way that we ball is so glorious glorious
hook

buddah man
for change i spit game you better believe
im letting my k sneeze till you cease to breathe
got a hunger for cheese im all about my scratch
on fire like a match its best you backback
when this hammer track back dont mug this nigga wrong
hollow tip bullets put plugs in niggas domes
i aint stopping till you gone i aint taking a loss
im a game spitter certified mafia boss
gogetters with one hitters that sting like a wasp
necks be iced out no matter the cost
a verbal holocaust i spits the real
for niggas that dont know this the deal
stepped out entered the do with thug appeal
boys saying this nigga must be a thug for real
show nothing but skills and im ready to throw down
it go down im grooving now kicking the do down
no time to slow down im tearing this hoe down
but peel your niggas off and im taking some mo down
this a southside showdown recognize the name
lyrics like hot flame game recognize game stack paper
