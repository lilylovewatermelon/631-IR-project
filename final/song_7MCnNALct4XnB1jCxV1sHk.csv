a boy is born in hard time mississippi
surrounded by four walls that aint so pretty
his parents give him love and affection
to keep him strong moving in the right direction
living just enough just enough for the city

verse 2
his father works some days for fourteen hours
and you can bet he barely makes a dollar
his mother goes to scrub the floors for many
and youd best believe she hardly gets a penny
living just enough just enough for the city yeah

his sisters black but she is sho nuff pretty
her skirt is short but lord her legs are sturdy
to walk to school shes got to get up early
her clothes are old but never are they dirty
living just enough just enough for the city mmm

verse 5
his hair is long his feet are hard and gritty
he spends his life walking the streets of new york city
hes almost dead from breathing in air pollution
he tried to vote but to him theres no solution
living just enough just enough for the city

verse 6
i hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
and that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
this place is cruel nowhere could be much colder
if we dont change the world will soon be over
living just enough stop giving just enough for the city
