i never thought that i would find a way out
i never thought id hear my heart beat so loud
i cant believe theres something left in my chest anymore
but goddamn you got me in love again
i used to think that i was made out of stone
i used to spend so many nights on my own
i never knew i had it in me to dance anymore
but goddamn you got me in love again

prechorus
show me that heavens right here baby
touch me so i know im not crazy
never have i ever met somebody like you
used to be afraid of love and what it might do
but goddamn you got me in love again

chorus
you got me in love again
you got me in love again
you got me in love again
again

verse 2
so many nights my tears fell harder than rain
scared i would take my broken heart to the grave
id rather die than have to live in a storm like before
but goddamn you got me in love again
