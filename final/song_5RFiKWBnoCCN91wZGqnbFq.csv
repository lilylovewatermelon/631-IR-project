he was born in the woods
torn from his home
well he was naked
and destined
to be out on his own
and he waited in darkness
hoping someone might see
from something so rough
what a treasure hed be

chorus
stronger than steel and wood
seen me through the bad and good
and when im hanging by a string
every little thing
is understood
between martin and me

verse 2
well hes hollow in the middle
from the shape that hes in
hes either filled up with music
or locked in his shell again
and it takes some fine tuning
to make him come around
but hes a huge piece of me
and ill never put him down

verse 3
he is a good friend
and he has his own voice
and you get what you give
sometimes its just noise
but if you treat him well
he will last your life long
and if youre honest and open
well he will write you a song
write you a song write you a song
