this is the last time
that i will say these words
i remember the first time
the first of many lies
sweep it into the corner
or hide it under the bed
say these things they go away
but they never do

but i was in the middle of
something i forget now
but ive seen too little of

chorus
the last time
you fall on me for anything you like
your one last line
you fall on me for anything you like
and years make everything alright
you fall on me for anything you like
and i no i dont mind

verse 2
this is the last time
that i will show my face
one last tender lie and
then im out of this place
tread it into the carpet
or hide it under the stairs
you say that some things never die
well i tried and i tried
