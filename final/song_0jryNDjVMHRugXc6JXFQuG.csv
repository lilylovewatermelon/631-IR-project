who who who can love me like you do

verse 1
i can be prone to wander too full of pride sometimes
i dont make it easy to love this heart of mine
i can get so distracted caught up in doubt and fear
but every time i think youve left me youre still right here

chorus
who who who can love me like you do
im a mess i confess but you carry me through
who who who can calm my weary soul when im lost and alone
thank god that i know who can

verse 2
only you can hold my head up only you can help me see
only you can break the grip that sin had on me
and i know i dont deserve it but thats why you call it grace
you covered a debt that i could never repay

chorus
tell me who who who can love me like you do
im a mess i confess but you carry me through
who who who can calm my weary soul when im lost and alone
thank god that i know who can
you might also likebridge
even when im hard to hold
you stay faithful
youll never let me go oohooh
even on my darkest day
you light my way
forever i will say
only you only you
only you only you can
only you only you
only you can
ohoh ohoh

chorus
who who who can love me like you do like you do
im a mess i confess but you carry me through carry me through
who who who can calm my weary soul when im lost and alone
thank god that i know

outro
when im lost and alone
thank god that i know who canembed"
