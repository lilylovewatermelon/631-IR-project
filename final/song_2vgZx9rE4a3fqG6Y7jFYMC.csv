you can try i guarantee this shit wont work
you can die i guarantee this shit wont hurt
i cant deny i was fuckin with you at first
pain killer in disguise i cant feel a thing off the percs

verse 1
i cant feel tryna figure out if this shit is real
i cant feel tryna figure out if this shit real
rocket got them pints nah for real
tryna pop me a motherfucking seal
big dripping pussy nigga really spill
keep a chopper by my side a big galil
with your bitch tryna netflix and chill

feel like bob pussy nigga tryna build
third eye open just like the hills
try to test me and my niggas gonna kill

prechorus

no cap pussy nigga nah for real

feel the breeze like your ass in a skirt
im a chemic in the kitchen like a nerd
hang with killers they gorillas go berserk

tryna get my niggas to go to work
ima hit you where it hurts
leave your pussy ass right up in the dirt
bad foreign bitch and she like to flirt
working good like a clerk
bigass chopper make you twerk
put a nigga in a hearse
put a pussy nigga on a shirt

prechorus

no cap pussy nigga nah for real
