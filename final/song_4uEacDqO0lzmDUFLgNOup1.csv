yes this is all i have left in me
verse 1 jhené aiko
said she had just self expressed herself to death
now nothings left
nothingness
she finessed it
she the best
and i said and i said
pretty bird and i said
pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird
sounds so pretty when you cry
pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird
youre so pretty but why i never see you fly
pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird
please dont die please dont die
pretty bird pretty bird i know your hurtin
well so am i so am i
pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird
please dont cry you can fly
and theres a blinding light inside of you
theres a blinding light inside of you
and they cannot deny you they cannot deny you
pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird
pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird
please dont die please dont die
pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird
please dont die please dont die
pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird

sounds so pretty when you cry
pretty bird pretty bird i know your hurtin
well so am i
pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird
pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird
pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird
please dont die please dont cry
pretty bird pretty bird
we need your life we need your life
you might also likeverse 2 common
the city heard the sounds of a pretty bird
yelling from slauson to 53rd
what happens if you holla and cant be heard
for the birds and the drama i paint these words
they say through the pain is how we learn
you landed on the window of pain simple and plain
its hard for you to fly in the rain
the way love goes is not the way that it came
come fly undie be born again
ive seen the strongest of them be torn from men
ripped apart and get put back together
them the ones with the most beautiful feathers
lets flock together rock together nirvana
a birds persona to be free and honor
the sky thats when you really most high
unafraid of the unknown and now we know why

outro jhene aiko
pretty bird pretty bird pretty bird
let me hear that back33embed"
