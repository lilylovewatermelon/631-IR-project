yeah i think ill make me some homemade soup
im feelin pretty good and thats the truth

i know the suns still shining
when i close my eyes
theres some hard times in the neighborhood
but why cant every day be just this good

its been fifteen years since i left home
and said good luck to every seed id sown
gave it my best and then i left it alone
i hope theyre doin alright

verse 4

or take my old harley for a three day cruise
