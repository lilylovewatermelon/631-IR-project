thank god im fresh
knock knock cudi open up its chip
gotta kush pack shells and some henney we could sip
keep a couple dollas on give a penny to a bitch
but im wit a couple hos who said they really wanna get
acquainted with some niggas who aint the average niggas
they just wanna see why all they girlfriends be wanting pictures
i be flyer then a hundred gnats worth a hundred hundredstacks
i aint gonna stop shoppin till i hit a hundred sacks
polo thats a given i aint even gotta mention
candy oldschool put you niggas in detention
slabbed niggas deepedup tool in the clothes
im just a young fresh fly fool with some gold

chorus kid cudi

dodging and popping pictures like them hos was working with the law
back in shaker bitches trynna play me to the left
now i pick the hoes that i want and give my niggas what is left

im living life dawg what about you
and i aint even gotta tell a lie
my swag my steez got a nigga skyhigh
so im watchin my moves
from the shoes on the coupe
be damned if a nigga aint high to the roof
pimp tight get it right homie more or less
i gotta thank god im fresh14embed"
