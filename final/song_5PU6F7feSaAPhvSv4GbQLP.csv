go
forever falling into oblivion
the darkness crawls forward
it engulfs my will to live
fear is failure
and this is my motivation

verse 2
take back what was stolen
reclaim all thats lost
with virtue i will rise up from the ruins

hook
come on

chorus
through adversity there is redemption
with passion fighting
i am unbroken
through adversity there is redemption
with passion fighting
i am unbroken

verse 3
take back what was stolen
embrace the cycle
refuse to turn back now and be led astray
fear is failure
and this is my affirmation

through adversity there is redemption
with passion fighting
i am unbroken
through adversity there is redemption
with passion fighting
unbroken

bridge
the absence of fear is the renewal of self
the absence of doubt breeds desire
if there is truth to face
i will design it
i will not be denied

outro
unbroken
i will not be denied
i will not be denied
