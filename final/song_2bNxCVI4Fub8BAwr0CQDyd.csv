they say im trouble they say im bad
they say im evil and that makes me glad
a dirty nogood down to the bone
your worst nightmare cant take me home
so ive got some mischief in my blood
can you blame me i never got no love
they think im callous a lowlife hood
i feel so useless misunderstood

verse 2 mal jay evie carlos  all
call me a schemer call me a freak
how can you say that im just unique
