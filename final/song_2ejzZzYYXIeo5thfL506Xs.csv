everybody knows youve been stepping on my toes
and im getting pretty tired of it
you keep astepping out of line and amessing with my mind
if you had any sense youd quit

chorus
cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl
you said i was the only man in this whole world
now you better do some thinking then youll find
you got the only daddy thatll walk the line

verse 2
i keep aworking every day all you want to do is play
im tired of staying out all night
im acoming unglued from your funny little moods
now honeybaby that aint right

chorus
cause ever since you were a little bitty teeny girl
you said i was the only man in this whole world
now you better do some thinking then youll find
you got the only daddy thatll walk the line

and abegging me to come back home

chorus

you said i was the only man in this whole world
now you better do some thinking then youll find
you got the only daddy thatll walk the line
