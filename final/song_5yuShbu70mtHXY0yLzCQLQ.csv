lighting stog after stog i choke on the smoke
they tell me to quit dont listen what im told
they help me forget that this world is so cold
i dont even know what im chasin no more
tell me what i want just keep searchin on
its never enough cup after cup
blunt after blunt i wouldnt give one if i could find a fuck
ha ha ha uh in the cut and i put that on my mama
and my bitch called talkin bout some drama
i swear there aint no time for women on the come up
its either pussy or the commas

chorus
man i just wanna go flex
gold on my teeth and on my neck
and im stone cold with the flex
with my squad and im smokin up a check
man i just wanna go flex
gold on my teeth and on my neck
and im stone cold with the flex
with my squad and im smokin up a check

verse 2
