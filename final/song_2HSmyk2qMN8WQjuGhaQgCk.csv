verse 1
i been hot since the birth of my son
i remain unfazed trust worse has been done
man fuck a valuation show me personal funds
its the pretty boys versus the petty boys
sold that already got a whole new set of toys
shit is so surreal drizzy drake you better enjoy it
nothing else bigger than the ovo letterman boys
cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides
ollie got the first еdition parked up roadside
the only sign of strugglin is coming from thosе guys
im tryna just relay what i can see through my own eyes
and nothin tell the truth like the eyes will
lived so much for others dont remember how i feel
friends in high places and friends that are high still
still managed to moonwalk straight through a minefield
and then ill come back to tell you how that feels
built this house for us all pain in my back still
you niggas gassed up you couldnt pay the

verse 2
champagne poetry these are the effortless flows supposedly
something else is controlling me
under her pictures live some of the greatest quotes from me
under me i see all the people that claim they over me
and above me i see nobody
id have to be dead for them to say that you took it from me
the twenty percent of you that we own is my tootsies money
nigga im wilding with your bread you owe it to me
cj grab racks out the bag and throw it to me
they dont want a problem with the boy but its goin to be
trust in my brothers is as strong as i know it should be
future sign the contracts he dont even show it to me
i dont have to secondguess nothing with no one i love
bout to build a second guest house cause we growing too much
think i got to scale the love back cause

outro
i need you i need you i need you
i need to make you see
what you mean to me
until i do im hoping you will know what i mean
part ii

intro
yeah oh
heavy day
for real
yeah
yeah

verse
the citys on fire and people are in denial
charges being laid but well see what they do at trial
im calling this shit from now
sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down
i havent been able to see family for a while
that shit is wearin me out
i used to hide my pain in delilah behind the bar til my niggas carried me out
and if moneys all i need in my grave then bury me now
i know i tend to talk about how i got a fortune on me
but with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
man i cant even rip and show my remorse to the homie
know i carry the guilt of the citys misfortunes on me
i even got the cleanin staff plotting extortion on me
my parents divorce is on me
my therapists voice is making the choices for me
and i always censor myself cause no matter what they reporting on me
the pressure is weighin on me
career is going great but now the rest of mes fading slowly
my soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me
my chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly
my heart feel vacant and lonely but still
im makin the most of this shit and more
every single move is like rolling dice on the board
seen too many brothers get twentyfive from the boys
id rather see all of em get twentyfive from the lord
and if the last negotiation made you pay me twentyfive
well this is the perfect time to give me twentyfive more
im bigger now than before
coparent of the year we figured out a rapport
no fair what drizzy made on the second leg of the tour
how could anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed
how the niggas turnin up with you turned you in for rewards
how the  do we manage to win everything but awards
 windows of opportunity let me go through the doors
this the part where i dont ever say pardon me anymore
this the part where ima find a new part of me to explore
this the part where all my partners know what we in it for
this the part where we gon throw us a party after the war
and if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket
well this is the perfect time that i empty them shits for sure
you owe that shit to the boy yeah
outro
i need to make you see
i love you i love you i love you
what you mean to me
i need to make you see
what you mean to me
what you mean to me
what you mean to me29embed"
