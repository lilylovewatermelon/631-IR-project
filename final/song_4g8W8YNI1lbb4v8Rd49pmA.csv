who really cares
who really cares
when i talk
what i feel
what i say
nobody not really

who wants to take
the time to understand
i would like someone to heal me with some empathy
but i cant findâ€¦
nobody not really

maybe im invisible to the world
does anyone in the world even think of me
as more than just a hopeless cause
maybe the world is not my block
my stoop
my life
my dreams
my anything anything

who wants to help
momma but shes so tired
papa but youre not here
im alone in a big empty space with
nobody not really
