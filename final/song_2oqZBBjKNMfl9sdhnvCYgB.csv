and i can hardly speak my heart is beating so and anyone can tell
you think you know me well
well you dont know me

no you dont know the one
who dreams of you at night and longs to kiss your lips
and longs to hold you tight oh im just a friend
thats all ive ever been cause you dont know me

for i never knew the art of making love
though my heart aches with love for you
afraid and shy ive let my chance go by
the chance that you might love me too

you give your hand to me and then you say goodbye
i watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
oh youll never know the one who loves you so
well you dont know me

for i never knew the art of making love
