ain’t got bars nor the charge to call her anyways
my mind’s a mile a minute
and my thoughts they bark like hounds
i focus on my breathing and the universal sound
i think about my darlin girl sleepin all alone
i pray the stars will shoot her all the wishes she can hold
on the day that i return i aim to lay her down
but right now i am focused on the universal sound
i think about tobacco juice and mason jars of shine
i think about the vices i’ve let take me over time
i recall when is a baby i didn’t need nothin around
but a little bitty rattler and the universal sound
id close my eyes
it was all so clear
it was all right then
it was all right here
i focus on my breathin’ and the universal sound
i let it take me over from the toenails to the crown
of the body that i’m in till they put me in the ground
and i return to the chorus of the universal sound
see tyler childers liveget tickets as low as 39you might also likei’ve been up on the mountain
and i’ve seen his wondrous grace
i’ve sat there on a barstool  and i’ve looked him in the face
he seemed a little haggard but it did not slow him down
he was hummin to the neon of the universal soundembed"
