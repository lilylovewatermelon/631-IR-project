boy you better put a lid on it

chorus danny
you dont know what its like to get your head lumped in
cause you keep flapping those gums like you the boss till we check your chin
oh no you dont know what its like to get your head lumped in
cause you keep flapping those gums so just run along cause you dont want none

verse 1 jdog with da kurlzz
let me take you back so back in time
that made the front page news living lives of crime
cause we ran moonshine outlaws to be exact
we did something new and we never turned back
six shots point blank aiming at your face
imma quickdraw then im gone without a trace
and ill rob a bank or ill cheat and steal
derail a fucking train cause you know that i will
you need to pay your dues or get cement shoes
and were still on the run the most ruthless crew

chorus danny
you dont know what its like to get your head lumped in
cause you keep flapping those gums like you the boss till we check your chin
oh no you dont know what its like to get your head lumped in
cause you keep flapping those gums so just run along cause you dont want none

im a heartbreak kid im a stickup kid
bangbang tommy gun yous a punkass bitch
knocked out one punch like a superhero
paid up crapped out now youre back to zero
boombingpow king kong no doubt
like a prohibition imma have to dry you out
youll be picking up your teeth straight off of the ground
imma switchblade shank you know how word gets around
all bets are in i say you roll the dice
looks like another seven its the end of your life

chorus danny
you dont know what its like to get your head lumped in
cause you keep flapping those gums like you the boss till we check your chin
oh no you dont know what its like to get your head lumped in
cause you keep flapping those gums so just run along cause you dont want none

verse 3 johnny 3 tears
its no matter just a matter of time
it dont matter to three it aint no matter of mine
if you keep your mouth shut then youll be just fine
if you keep running gums you better look out behind
you see un to the dead
got the full clip bitch is cocked and empty
the cock of the walk but you walked too far
now your cocks on the block on the boulevard
im the joh to the ny 3t
you lucky you aint dead if you know they sent me
chorus danny  da kurlzz
you dont know what its like to get your head lumped in
cause you keep flapping those gums like you the boss till we check your chin
oh no you dont know what its like to get your head lumped in
cause you keep flapping those gums so just run along cause you dont want none

bridge danny  charlie scene
un to the dead
you got your fists raised but your legs are shakey
un to the dead
you know that im the shit thats why youre trying to take me

verse 4 charlie scene
we can go around the corner i aint catching a case
this will all be over quick imma do what it takes
so you better know your role and never speak out of place
or imma roll your ass up and smack the lips off your face
you better not run cause my bullets are faster
id never really hit a bitch so im gonna smack you
this wont even be a fight cause im knocking you out
and my name aint dick so keep it outta your mouth

outro danny da kurlzz  charlie scene
un to the dead
let it be known we do this shit on the daily
un to the dead
aint nothing still serving you baby4embed"
