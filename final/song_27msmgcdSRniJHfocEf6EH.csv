dont fret precious im here
step away from the window step away from the window
go back to sleep

chorus
lay your head down child
i wont let the boogeyman come
count the bodies like sheep
to the rhythm of the war drums
pay no mind to the rabble
pay no mind to the rabble
head down go to sleep
to the rhythm of the war drums

verse 2
pay no mind what other voices say
they dont care about you like i do like i do
safe from pain and truth and choice and other poison devils
see they dont give a fuck about you like i do

prechorus
just stay with me safe and ignorant
go back to sleep go back to sleep

lay your head down child
i wont let the boogeyman come
count the bodies like sheep
to the rhythm of the war drums
pay no mind to the rabble
pay no mind to the rabble
head down go to sleep
to the rhythm of the war drums

bridge
ill be the one to protect you from
your enemies and all your demons
ill be the one to protect you from
a will to survive and a voice of reason

ill be the one to protect you from
your enemies and your choices son
theyre one and the same i must isolate you
isolate and save you from yourself

chorus
swaying to the rhythm
of the new world order and
counting bodies like sheep
to the rhythm of the war drums
the boogeymen are coming
the boogeymen are coming
keep your head down go to sleep
to the rhythm of the war drums

outro
stay with me safe and ignorant
just stay with me
hold you and protect you from the other ones
the evil ones
dont love you son
go back to sleep11embed"
