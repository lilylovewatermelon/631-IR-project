and its true we named our children after towns
that wed never been to
and its true that the clouds just hung around
like black cadillacs outside a funeral
and we were done done done
with all the fuck fuck fucking around

chorus
you were so true to yourself
you were true to no one else
well i should put you in the ground
ive got the time i got the hours
i got the days i got the weeks
i could say to myself
ive got the words but i cant speak
well i was done done done
with all the circcirccircling round

bridge
i didnt die and i aint complaining
i aint blaming you
i didnt know that the words you said to me
meant more to me than they ever could you
i didnt lie and i aint saying
i told the whole truth
i didnt know that this game we were playing
even had a set of rules

we named our children after towns
that wed never been to
and its true that the clouds just hung around
like black cadillacs outside a funeral
and we were laughing at the stars
while our feet clung tight to the ground
so pleased with ourselves
for using so many verbs and nouns
but we were all still just dumb dumb dumber
than the dirt dirt dirt on the ground

chorus
well wings on flames kings with no names
well this place just aint got right air right now
you were so all over town but still so crayola brown
well you should run round yourself right now
and we were done done done
with all the fuck fuck fucking around
circling round8embed"
