i grew up without a father
hes been locked up since 96
but theres another man he aint here no more
that raised me as a kid
we used to ride out to the battlefield
and hed tell me stories bout the past
he taught me the things he knew id need to know
and answered all the questions that id ask
i hope hes smiling up there lookin down
and proud of this wild child that came around

chorus
i got my pops last name
still feel his hand here on my shoulder
i still hear him say
youll understand when you get older
today i couldnt be any more grateful thankful or proud to say
i got my pops last name
i got my pops last name

verse 2
he taught me yes maam no maam
god is good and god is great
taught me elbows off the table
and always clean your plate ooh
he said knowledge over money oohooh ooh
cause the ones with money always pay
he left little bits of gold like that all over the place
