standing in the kitchen
wondering where anjelas gone
she didnt even drive here
she couldnt have gotten very far

prechorus
what does it matter anyways
i didnt like her anyways
i only let her crawl into my arms
i wasnt trying to lead anyone on
i was only trying to stay warm

chorus
oh anjela
cant stand the cold
and its not summer anymore
i havent seen the last of her

verse 2
there was euphemisms and arrangements
there was alleged transgressions
she said im not very good at talking about this stuff
so nevermind
she buried her face in the pillow
you might also likeprechorus
what does it matter anyways
she didnt like me anyways
i only thought because she climbed into my arms
but she wasnt trying to turn anyone on
she was only trying to stay warm

chorus
oh anjela
cant stand the cold
and its not summer anymore
i havent seen the last of her
