yeah
hey
leave me alone

verse 1
panicstricken handle business not a joke yeah
manners missin travel different no control yeah
time to listen time to zip it keep it closed
my description highly gifted take some notes yeah
lack of interest whyd you visit hit the road yeah
im kinda twisted so keep your distance be a ghost
yeah see im inventive but quite the menace you aint know
well then im offended lets jog your memories here we go yeah
i went from nobody to kinda famous
hide my plaques inside the closet i just cant explain it
my wife she tells me that shes proud and thinks that i should hang em
but i just leave em on the ground right next to my selfhatred
yeah yeah mental health wheres my mental health
diagnosed with ocd what does that mean well gather round
that means i obsessively obsess on things i think about
that means i might take a normal thought and think its so profound leave me alone
ruminating fill balloons up full of doubts
do the same things if i dont im overwhelmed leave me alone
thoughts are pacing they go round and round and round
its so draining lets move onto something else fine oh leave me alone
runnin the game but they dont even know it
like im undercover and dont wanna blow it
i come out of nowhere they dont even notice
the flow is so cold you would think it was snowin oh leave me alone
im under the weather but wind isnt blowin
i got an umbrella for difficult moments
you got to admit it im very devoted
im out in the rain but it dont always open so i i i

hold up my balloons and cover up my face
i can feel them weighin on me every day
i should let em go and watch em float away
but im scared if i do then ill be more afraid more afraid
tell them how i feel but they dont wanna change dont wanna change
tell them how i feel but they remain the same same
loosen up my grip they say thats not okay
quiet quiet quiet quiet quiet ayy leave me alone oh

verse 2
i hate when they debate if were underrated
were so overlooked that theyre lookin over our numbers nathan leave me alone
we dont do enough interviews or go out in public lately
we dont post enough on our socials
to keep the buzz from fading leave me alone
let it fade yeah let it fade
once its decimated then you drop a song outta nowhere
and all the fans embrace it leave me alone
then the buzz will surface again its part of my operation
i dont need advice from my doubts right now
end of conversation leave me alone
shut your mouth yeah shut your mouth
better tone it down close it now
if you make a sound ima change the dial leave me alone
funny how they be acting loud comin unannounced
its floating round
man the kid is wild pretty vile true leave me alone
im kinda funny but dont really show it
i keep it together but have a disorder
i go to my room and i sit in my corner
and talk to myself in a language thats foreign leave me alone
i think of a rhyme and i have to record it
but know if i dont ill wake up in the mornin
and question my life again always avoiding
i hate to be different but hate to be normal so i leave me alone
prechorus
hold up my balloons and cover up my face
i can feel them weighin on me every day
i should let em go and watch em float away
but im scared if i do then ill be more afraid
tell them how i feel but they dont wanna change wanna change
tell them how i feel but they remain the same they remain the same
loosen up my grip they say thats not okay
quiet quiet quiet quiet quiet ayy
leave me alone

chorus

verse 3

finally called him back we didnt talk long no
he asked me how id been i sent him this song leave me alone quiet quiet quiet
yeah think he took offense he kinda seemed off off
i texted him that night to ask what he thought leave me alone quiet quiet quiet
it took a couple days to get a response
but once i finally did he said this song sucks leave me alone quiet quiet quiet
feel the symptoms couldnt miss em wrestle with em
then i pin and flip em brought some back up

so persistent dont forget this hold the tension soul is bendin
no pretendin openended low percentage so demented leave me alone
whole consensus flow tremendous no apprentice dope incentive
show intensive so possessive tone aggressive watch your step when i leave me alone
