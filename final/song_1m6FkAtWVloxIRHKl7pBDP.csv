you aint gotta question it

verse 1 justin bieber
if it aint broke then we dont need to fix it
believing in that she sayll have you livid
no they wont be happy til your love is over
they tryna break us up but you dont wanna get it
they aint never had your back like i got it
they ain’t never had trust like how we got it
so they cant help but to come and hate on it
they see what we got and you know they want it
dont question it

hook justin bieber
you aint gotta question it
you already know the answer
the truthll make us relevant
hurts but its necessary
dont want us to lose what we are no
dont want us to lose what we are

its like youre always looking for a problem
but there aint enough equations for you to solve em
so quick to turn nothin right into somethin
take the numbers out my phone go head and call em
they ain’t ever had my back like you got it
they aint never had a chance how you got it
so they cant help but to come and hate on it
they see what we got and you know they want it dont question it

chorus justin bieber
you aint gotta question it
you already know the answer
the truthll make us relevant
hurts but its necessary yeah
dont want us to lose what we are
dont wanna lose no
dont want us to lose what we are
lose what we are

verse 3 nas
she texts me hows you love life
and how are you i said im good
they only get as close as you allow them to
we should be closer together
warm oceans better weather
instead of us playing games forever
she says whatever
i says whatever
who get you wetter than the half moon wearer
hstry sweater
serendipity when you with me
swear you love that one thing we did
that one time in that one place
blew your mind you got my mind gone when im home
im serious girl a much older dude a whole 42
ive accomplished my goals its only you
you and i in that wraith retired my pimp superfly cape
just my mets cap and my batch and im straight
esco
chorus justin bieber
you aint gotta question it oh
you already know the answer
the truthll make us relevant
hurts but its necessary yeah
dont want us to lose what we are
dont wanna lose no
dont want us to lose what we are
lose what we are12embed"
