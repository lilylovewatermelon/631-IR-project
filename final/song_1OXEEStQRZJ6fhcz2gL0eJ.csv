verse 1
follow the flow look
they say a midget standin on the giants shoulder can see much
further than the giant the giant
so i got the whole rap world on my shoulder they tryin to see
further than i am than i am
and i have been tryin to be patient with they preoccupation
with david and goliath goliath
but sooner or later that patience gonna run its course
and im forced to be a tyrant be a tyrant
but me and tyran comin through your environment
iron mask nigga iron gats nigga i am back
with the team no i in that
roc yall not eyein that

verse 2
jeah look
im so far ahead of my time im bout to start another life
look behind you im bout to pass you twice
back to the future gotta slow up for the present
im fast niggas cant get pass my past
how they propose to deal with my perfect present
when i unwrap the gift  the curse in one session
aint no livin person can test him
only two restin in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
seven straight summers critics might not admit it
but nobody in rap did it quite like i did it
if you did it i done it before you get it i had it
got mad at it and dont want it no more
and that goes for everything from flippin that raw
flippin whores flippin vocal chords dont get it twisted
get it right did different did it better did it nice
did the impossible then did it twice get it right
chorus
cant touch the untouchable break the unbreakable
shake the unshakeable its hovi baby
cant see the unseeable reach the unreachable
do the impossible its hovi baby

verse 3
yup hovis home the global phone
the world is back in order the number one rap recorder is back
you cats overfelt yourself
you couldnt help yourself now witness the real for real
in my absence cats get absentminded
now its time to rewind and remind em
why im in the position that i am
changin the game my game could nail madonna
well after im gone theyll honor
history in the makin pistol pete
leave competition shakin without missin the beat woo
chasin the hihat all over the track
the snare is scared of the air in here boom
and plus i get paper dog dont let me forget
the watch face so blue like its holdin its breath
cant see me skill for skill or check for check
its the bowtie flow dog i bring it to your neck
live and direct i will bring it to your set
i got now i dont care who got next
rapper slash exec kordell stewart
your flow all yall using is mine youre all useless
you aint a factor who are you foolin
you all are faggots you takin us backwards takin it backwards
im tryin to progress with this rap shit
nigga nigga your whole careers a accident
who was gassin em fuck outta here
chorus
cant touch the untouchable break the unbreakable
shake the unshakeable its hovi baby
cant see the unseeable reach the unreachable
do the impossible its hovi baby4embed"
