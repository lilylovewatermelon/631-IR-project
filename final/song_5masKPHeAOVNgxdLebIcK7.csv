darling darling oh turn the lights back on now
were watching watching as the credits all roll down
and crying crying you know were playing to a full house house

prechorus parson james
no heroes villains one to blame
while wilted roses fill the stage
and the thrill the thrill is gone
our debut was a masterpiece
but in the end for you and me
oh the show it cant go on

chorus parson james
we used to have it all but nows our curtain call
so hold for the applause oh
and wave out to the crowd and take our final bow
oh its our time to go but at least we stole the show
at least we stole the show
at least we stole the show
at least we stole the show
at least we stole the show

darling darling you know that we are sold out
and kisses fading but the band plays on now
were crying crying so let the velvet roll down down

prechorus parson james
no heroes villains one to blame
while wilted roses fill the stage
and the thrill the thrill is gone
our debut was a masterpiece
our lines we read so perfectly
but the show it cant go on

chorus parson james
we used to have it all but nows our curtain call
so hold for the applause oh
