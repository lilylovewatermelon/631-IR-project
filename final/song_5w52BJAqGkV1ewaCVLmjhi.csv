i went with you up to the place you grew up in
we spent a week in the cold
just long enough to walden it with you
any longer it wouldve got old
singin ace of spades when lemmy died
but nothings changed las alright
im sleepin in my bed again and gettin in my head
and then walk around the reservoir

chorus
you you mustve been looking for me
sendin smoke signals pelicans circling
burning trash out on the beach

verse 2
one of your eyes is always halfshut
somethin happened when you were a kid
i didnt know you then and ill never understand
why it feels like i did
how soon is now in an 80s sedan
you slept inside of it because your dad
lived in a campground in the back of a van
you said that song will creep you out until youre dead

chorus
and you mustve been looking for me
sendin smoke signals pelicans circling
burning trash out on the beach
you might also likeverse 3
i wanna live at the holiday inn
where somebody else makes the bed
well watch tv while the lights on the street
put all the stars to death
its been on my mind since bowie died
just checkin out to hide from life
and all of our problems im gonna solve em
with you riding shotgun speeding cause fuck the cops

chorus
and you you mustve been looking for me
sendin smoke signals pelicans circling
burning trash out on the beach mm

verse 4
i buried a hatchet its comin up lavender
the futures unwritten the past is a corridor
im at the exit looking back through the hall
you are anonymous i am a concrete wall
