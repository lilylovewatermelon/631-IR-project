love is a burning thing
and it makes a fiery ring
bound by wild desire
i fell into a ring of fire

chorusx2
i fell into a burning ring of fire
i went down down down and the flames went higher
and it burns burns burns the ring of fire
the ring of fire

verse 2
the taste of love is sweet
when hearts like ours meet
i fell for you like a child
oh but the fire went wild
