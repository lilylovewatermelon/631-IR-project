i spend all my money
bought a big old fancy car
for these brighteyed honeys
oh yeah you know who you are
keep me up til the sun is high
til the birds start callin my name
im addicted and i dont know why
guess ive always been this way

prechorus
all these roads steer me wrong
but i still drive them all night long
all night long

chorus
all you young wild girls
you make a mess of me you make a mess of me
yeah you young wild girls
youll be the death of me the death of me
all you young wild girls
no matter what you do no matter what you do
yeah you young wild girls
ill always come back to you come back to you

verse 2
i get lost under these lights
i get lost in the words i say
start believin my own lies
like everythin will be okay
oh i still dream of a simple life
boy meets girl makes her his wife
but love dont exist when you live like this
that much i know yes i know
