ill tell you flat out
it hurts so much to think of this
so from my thoughts i will exclude
the very thing that
i hate more than everything is
the way im powerless
to dictate my own moods

prechorus 1
ive thrown away
so many things that couldve been much more
and i just pray
my problems go away if theyre ignored
but thats not the way it works
no thats not the way it works

chorus
when i go down
i go down hard
and i take everything ive learned
and teach myself some disregard
when i go down
it hurts to hit the bottom
and all the things that got me there
i think if only i had fought them
you might also likeverse 2
if and when i can
clear myself of this clouded mind
ill watch myself settle down
into a place where
peace can search me out and find
that im so ready to be found

prechorus 2
ive thrown away
the hope i had in friendships
ive thrown away
so many things that could have been much more
ive thrown away the secret
to find an end to this
and i just pray
my problems go away if theyre ignored
but thats not the way it works
no thats not the way it works

chorus
when i go down when i go down
i go down hard i go down hard
and i take everything ive learned
and teach myself some disregard
when i go down when i go down
it hurts to hit the bottom
and all the things that got me there
i think if only i had fought them
bridge 1
any control i thought i had
just slips right through my hands
while my everpresent conscience
shakes its head and reprimands me
reprimands me
then and there
i confess
ill blame all this on my selfishness
yet you love me
and that consumes me
and ill stand up again
and do so willingly

bridge 2
you give me hope
and hope it gives me life
you touch my heavy heart
and when you do you make it light
as i exhale ah
i hear your voice
and i answer you ah
though i hardly make a noise
and from my lips ah
the words i choose to say
seem pathetic ah
but its a fallen mans praise
cause i love you
oh god i love you
bridge 3
bababa
bababa bababa
bababa
bababa bababa
and life is now worth living bababa
if only because of you bababa bababa
and when they say that i am dead and gone bababa
it wont be further from the truth bababa bababa

outro
when i go down
i lift my eyes to you
i wont look very far
cause youll be there
with open arms
to lift me up again
to lift me up againembed"
