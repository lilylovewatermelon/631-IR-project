i dont wanna say goodbye to you
so ill just say good night to you
my people no goodbyes to you uh
im just gon say good night

verse kanye west
good night
right now i can see it so vivid
like it was just yesterday like i could relive it
me and my grandparents on a field trip
and im the lil kid tryna touch the exhibits
but itll fade fore i get to get a hold of that
man i wish i could stop time like a photograph
every joke that they told id know to laugh
man man i wouldnt let a moment pass
what do it mean when you dream that you fallin
what do it mean when you dream that you ballin
what do it mean when you never dream at all then
and you dont really know cause you cant recall them
its sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to
people you never got a chance to say bye to
maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams
into real life real life if you try to
so close so close but so far but so far
and so far and so far no cigar no cigar
we cant dwell on the past all we got is today
so ima live like its no tomorrow no goodbyes goodbyes
