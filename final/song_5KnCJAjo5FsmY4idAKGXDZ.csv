there was a boy i met in kindergarten
he was sweet he said that i was smart
he was good at sports and people liked him
and at nap time once we shared a mat
i didnt sleep i sat and watched him breathing
watched him dream for nearly half an hour
oohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohooh
then he woke up
 
he pulled a scab off one time playing kick ball
kissed me quick then pressed it in my hand
i took that scab and put it in a locket
all year long i wore it near my heart
he didnt care if i was thin or pretty
and he was mine until we hit first grade
oohoohoohoohoohoohoohoohooh
then he woke up
 
last night i dreamed a horse with wings
flew down into my homeroom
on its back there he sat
and he held out his arms
so we sailed above the gym
across the faculty parking lot
my kindergarten boyfriend and i
and a horse with wings
 
now were all grown up and we know better
now we recognize the way things are
certain boys are just for kindergarten
certain girls are meant to be alone
but i believe that any dream worth having
is a dream that should not have to end
so ill build a dream that i can live in
and this time im never waking up
 
and well soar above the trees
over cars and croquet lawns
past the church and the lake
and the tricounty mall
we will fly through the dawn
to a new kindergarten
where nap time is centuries long
oohoohoohoohooh
oohoohoohoohooh
oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
