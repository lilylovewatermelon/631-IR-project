give me all you got with one shot sent to lend me

i know youre not the one i left to wait here helping

i i left in a sudden rush and never said why
you couldnt know that i had no goodbyes

the way that you wouldve been if
i stayed here at home im giving it up newo
how important i couldve been to you

you decide to answer when my fist rings hello

you couldnt know that i had no goodbyes

chorus
but i wish that you were im spying on you newo
the way that you wouldve been if
i stayed here at home im giving it up newo
how important i couldve been to you
