i can just hear them now
how could you let us down
but they dont know what i found
or see it from this way around
feeling it overtake
all that i used to hate
one by one every trait
i tried but its way too late
all the signs i dont read
two sides of me cant agree
when i breathe in too deep
going with what i always longed for

chorus 1
feel like a brand new person
but you make the same old mistakes
well i dont care im in love
stop before its too late
feel like a brand new person
but you make the same old mistakes
i finally know what its like
you dont have what it takes
stop before it’s too late
i know theres too much at stake
making the same mistakes
and i still dont know why its happening
stop while its not too late
and i still dont know
you might also likeverse 2
finally taking flight
i know you dont think its right
i know that you think its fake
maybe fakes what i like
point is i have the right
not thinking in black and white
im thinking its worth the fight
soon to be out of sight
knowing it all this time
going with what i always longed for

chorus 1
feel like a brand new person
but you make the same old mistakes
i dont care im in love
stop before its too late
feel like a brand new person
but you make the same old mistakes
so how do i know that its right
you dont have what it takes
stop before it’s too late

bridge
and i know that its hard to digest
but maybe your story aint so different from the rest
and i know it seems wrong to accept
but youve got your demons and shes got her regrets
and i know that its hard to digest
a realization is as good as it gets
and i know it seems wrong to accept
but youve got your demons and shes got her regrets
but youve got your demons and shes got her regrets
chorus 2
feel like a brand new person
so how will i know that its right
in a new direction
so how will i know ive gone too far
stop thinking youre the only option oh
feel like a brand new person
but you make the same old mistakes
i finally know what its like
stop before its too late
stop thinking youre the only option oh
in a new direction
but you make the same old mistakes
so how will i know ive gone too far
you dont have what it takes
stop before its too late
stop thinking youre the only option oh
feel like a brand new person
but you make the same old mistakes
and i know its hard to describe
stop thinking youre the only option oh
but you make the same old mistakes
you dont have what it takes
stop before its too late
i finally know what its like
stop before its too late
stop thinking youre the only option oh
stop thinking youre the only option oh133embed"
