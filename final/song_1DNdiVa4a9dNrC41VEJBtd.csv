verse 1
ten silver spoons coming after me
one life with one dream on repeat
ill escape if i try hard enough
till king of the jungle calls my bluff

prechorus
oh lord oh lord
i have been told i have been told
that i must take the unforsaken road
forsaken road
chorus
theres a fork in the road
ill do as i am told
and i dont know dont know dont know dont know
who i wanna be

hook

you say yes to everything
will that guarantee you a win
do you think you will be good enough
to love others and to be loved

prechorus
oh lord oh lord
now i can see now i can see
the cutlery will keep on chasing me
forsaken road

chorus
theres a fork in the road
ill do as i am told
and i dont know dont know dont know dont know
who i wanna be

bridge
we are the spoons metally mean
we scooped our way into your dreams
to knock the knives out bloody cold
and lead you down the unforsaken road
forsaken road

chorus
theres a fork in the road
ill do as i am told
and i dont know dont know dont know dont know
who i wanna be
