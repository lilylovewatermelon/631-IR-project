drop it
bones in the water and dust in my lungs
absorbing archaic like a sponge
ultimate way is the way you control
but can you stay if you detach your soul
bury the present and squeeze out the past
the ones you endear to never last
chemical burns and the animalistic
im just another hardline pseudostatistic
can you feel this
im dying to feel this
can you feel this
blood on the paper and skin on my teeth
trying to commit to whats beneath
to find the time is to lose the momentum
learn the lessons and immediately forget them
automatic and out of my reach
consult all the waste to find the key
minimal life and the polysyllabic
im just another blank page push the button pull the rage
can you feel this
im dying to feel this
can you feel this
i am all but what am i
another number that isnt equal to any of you
i control but i comply
pick me apart then pick up the pieces im uneven
i am the damaged one
all my life and the damage done
i am the damaged one
all my life and the damage done
i am the damaged one
all my life and the damage done
i am the damaged one
all my life and the damage done
can you feel this
dying to feel this
can you feel this
im dying to feel this
can you feel this
im dying to feel this
can you feel this
i am all but what am i
another number that isnt equal to any of you
i control but i comply
pick me apart then pick up the pieces im uneven
i am all but what am i
another number that doesnt equal to any of you
i control but i comply
pick me apart then pick up the pieces im uneven
