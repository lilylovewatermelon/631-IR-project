these bitches want nikes
they looking for a check
tell em it aint likely
said she need a ring like carmelo
you must be on that white like othello
all you want is nikes but the real ones
just like you just like me
i dont play i dont make time
but if you need dick i got you
and i yam from the line
pour up for aap rip pimp c
rip trayvon that nigga look just like me
woo fuckin buzzin woo
that my little cousin he got a little trade
his girl keep the scales a little mermaid
we out by the pool some little mermaids
me and them gel like twigs with them bangs
now thats a real mermaid
you been holding your breath weighted down
punk madre punk papá
he dont care for me but he cares for me
and thats good enough
we dont talk much or nothin
but when we talkin bout somethin
we have good discussion
i met his friends last week
feels like theyre up to somethin
thats good for us

well let you guys prophesy
well let you guys prophesy
we gon see the future first
well let you guys prophesy
we gon see the future first
living so the last night feels like a past life
speaking of the dont know what got into people
devil be possessin homies
demons try to bodyjump
why you think im in this bitch wearing a fucking yarmulke
acid on me like the rain
weed crumbles into glitter
rain glitter
we laid out on this wet floor
away turf no astro
mesmerized how the strobes glow
look at all the people feet dance
i know that your nigga came witcha
but he aint witcha
we only human and its humid in these balmains
i mean my balls sticking to my jeans
we breathin pheromones amber rose
sippin pinkgold lemonades
feelin
bridge frank ocean
i may be younger but ill look after you
were not in love but ill make love to you
when youre not here ill save some for you
im not him but ill mean something to you
ill mean something to you
ill mean something to you
you got a roommate hell hear what we do
its only awkward if youre fucking him too
