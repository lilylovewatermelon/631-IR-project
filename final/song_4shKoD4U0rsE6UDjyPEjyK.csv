come with me

verse 1
we took a back road
were gonna look at the stars
we took a backroad in my car
down to the ocean
it’s only water and sand
and in the ocean well hold hands

verse 2
but i dont really like you apologetically dressed in the best put on a heartbeat glide
without an answer the thunder speaks for the sky and on the cold wet dirt i cry
and on the cold wet dirt i cry

chorus
don’t you wanna come with me don’t you wanna feel my bones
on your bones
its only natural

verse 3
a cinematic vision ensued
like the holiest dream
theres someone calling
an angel whispers my name
but the message relayed is the same
wait till tomorrow youll be fine
but its gone to the dogs in my mind
i always hear them when the dead of night
comes calling to save me from this fight
but they can never wrong this right
see the killers liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likechorus
dont you wanna come with me dont you wanna feel my bones
on your bones
its only natural
don’t you wanna swim with me don’t you wanna feel my skin
on your skin
its only natural

never had a lover
i never had a lover
never had soul
i never had soul
never had a good time
and i never had a good time
never got cold
i never got gold

chorus
dont you wanna come with me dont you wanna feel my bones
on your bones
its only natural
dont you wanna swim with me dont you wanna feel my skin
on your skin
its only natural
dont you wanna come with me dont you wanna feel my bones
on your bones
it’s only natural
come and take a swim with me dont you wanna feel my skin
on your skin
it’s only natural3embed"
