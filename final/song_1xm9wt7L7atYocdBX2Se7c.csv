i’ve been an ocean slave for so long
there’s something that i can’t resist
something in the ocean mist
living anywhere else would be wrong
i’ve added it up
i can’t get enough
i’ve learned to say
i’ve been playing it tough
there’s plenty to see
optimistically optomisticaly
i saw some grinders out the back
perfect little six foot shacks
plenty of lip to crack
but we’re gonna break out
and see what’s outside our front door
not coming back
until we found what we’re looking for
found what we’re looking for
and we’ll meet back here again
till’ time rolls over the end
and we’ll die in our home town
know i found know i found
and we’ll meet back here again
till’ time rolls over the end
and we’ll die in our home town
know i found know i found
my way out
i saw some smoke coming out the stacks
not another soul around
the ocean perfect like glass
but that’s not gonna stop us no
from leaving the safety of the shore
not coming back
until we found what we’re looking for
found what we’re looking foryou might also likeembed"
