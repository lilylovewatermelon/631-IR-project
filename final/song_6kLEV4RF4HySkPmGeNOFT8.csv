if im giving you the cold shoulder
thats closure needed someone to hold
but we both had our own motives
never told him that mine was to stay alone

prechorus
and you dont belong to me
so you dont have to let me go
doesnt always have to be something more

chorus
ill be on my way
ill be on my way
im no good if i stay
so ill be on my way my way

verse 2
i feel it for a moment
in the moment i feel it til its gone
i dont care if you want this
being honest i dont know what i want

prechorus
and you dont belong to me
you were never mine before
so it doesnt need to be something more

ill be on my way

im no good if i stay
so ill be on my way my way

ill be on my way
ill be on my way
im no good if i stay
so ill be on my way my way1embed"
