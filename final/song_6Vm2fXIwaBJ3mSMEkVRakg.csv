those lips those eyes that food
well there aint nothin like a spread to get ya in the mood
wilbur cant you feel the burning flame of hot desire
youre gonna need more than some seltzer to put out this fire

verse 2 velma  edna
im wailing look out old baltimore
im selling something you cant purchase at a ten cent store
oh wilbur i feel like a princess come on take me to the ball
i bet youre tired of heavy lifting get your hands on something small

chorus velma  edna both
because im big blonde and beautiful
its time to face the facts its irrefutable
why waste one more minute now i feel brand spankin new
hey wilbur take a look its all for
you
