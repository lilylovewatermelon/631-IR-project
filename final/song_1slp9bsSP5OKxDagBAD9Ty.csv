people walking by you wondering why
no one ever stops to talk or thinks about it
if they ever did

what if god shuffled by
one day we might see
doing not a thing
breathing just to breathe
we might find some reason
but rushing around seems
whats wrong with the world

dont lose the dreams inside your head
theyll only be there til youre dead
dream

lying on the roof counting
the suns that fill the sky i wonder is
someone in the heavens
looking back down on me ill never know

so much space to believe
funny when youre small
the moon follows the car
doesnt no one but you see
hey the moon is chasing me
see dave matthews band liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likei worried if i looked away shed be gone
dont lose the dreams inside your head
theyll only be there til youre dead
dream

walking through the wood
no cares in the world
the world shes come to play
shes all mine just for a day

theres not a moment to lose in the game
dont let the troubles in your head
steal too much time youll soon be dead
so play

all fall down
it wont be so long now
out of the darkness comes light like a flash
you think you can you think you can
sometimes that is the problem
dream little darling dream
spinning on the wind
the leaf fell from the limb
but everyday should be a good day to die
oh all fall down
it wont be too long now
every fire dies
i find it hard to explain how i got here
i think i can i think i can
and then again i will falter
dream

oh i think i can
i think i can i think i can
i think i can i think i can
dream little darling dream
spining on the wind
the leaf fell from the limbembed"
