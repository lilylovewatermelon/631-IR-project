oh these words were thrown together
when i still had my faith in hand
kept it in my back pocket
with the change i had to spare
swim through the skies when its night
let the stars be my sea breeze
i love when the record echoes
reminds me of the trees

chorus 1 brendan lukens with adrienne gold
but i shouldnt have to say this to you
no you you know how to live life

verse 2 brendan lukens
this compilation of sayings and tunes
means everything to me now
oh i cut me open
but you did all the pouring out
ive discovered more and more
of this world that ive been calling mine
no i dont care what it takes
blood sweat or all my time because

chorus 2 brendan lukens with adrienne gold
i shouldnt have to say this to you
no you you know how to live life
and i shouldnt have to sing all these tunes
no you you make me feel alive
you might also likeoutro brendan lukens adrienne gold
i
im not one to point fingers
 shouldnt have to say this to you
but you got me in a bind
no you
ripping through all our nights
 you know
all choruses aside
i
and swim through the skies when its night
 shouldnt have to say this to you
let the stars be my sea breeze
no you
i love when the record echoes
 you knowembed"
