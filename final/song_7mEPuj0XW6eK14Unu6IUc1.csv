this is for the things i dont say enough
waiting for the day we touch
your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
ill see you soon but ill talk to you sooner
this is for the things i dont say enough
waiting for the day we touch
your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
ill see you soon but ill talk to you sooner

verse 1 substantial
do you honestly believe id turn my back on you and leave my true love all alone in this cruel world
when every single solitary day i do my best to secure a future for me and you girl
cause it is all about you its been all about you
seconds feel like millenniums when im without you
but my momma said there be days like this and aint jack we can do
thats the way life is
but its been weeks since i felt your lips and im a fiend for my queen so i need a fix
only for now ill settle for these talks on the phone
but i cut my arm off for a moment alone
with the one that i cherish whether in rome or paris amsterdam or japan
please note that i am thinkin bout my baby as much as humanly possible
an i know youre frustrated cause life has too many obstacles

hook
this is for the things i dont say enough
waiting for the day we touch
your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
ill see you soon but ill talk to you sooner
this is for the things i dont say enough
waiting for the day we touch
your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
ill see you soon but ill talk to you sooner

my dear my dear my dear i know youre lonely
an i know very well that its hard and it hurts but theres no need to cry
cause i will be home soon and there aint no limit to the things that we goin do
whatever you want name it and ill make it reality
to see my babys face nothin means more than that for me
this is far from flattery i aint trying to impress you
truth is i miss you and im hurtin internally
sometimes these long trips feel like eternity
but they say distance makes the heart grow fonder
and in this case its proven to be fact
so ill be back like a t100
from blocks away you will see me comin
with the biggest smile you ever seen on my face
cause even the toughest man on the planet needs lovin
theres nothin tame the wild like a womans embrace

hook
this is for the things i dont say enough
waiting for the day we touch
your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
ill see you soon but ill talk to you sooner
this is for the things i dont say enough
waiting for the day we touch
your lips to mine eclipse solar lunar
ill see you soon but ill talk to you sooner
verse 3 substantial
feels like its been forever and i cant wait to see ya
its like wit bonnie and clyde tony and maria
romeo and juliet akeem and lisa
basically inseparable and its more than sexual
withstand every shell tell me dont you like the sound of that
got my heart racing and about to have a heart attack
wantin to be loved by you just you
theres nobody loves you like i do
and i aint scared to show it
but these feelings are hard to put into words
and im a poet slash mc
so give me credit for expressing them
because writin this was more nervous than i ever been
i had to get it out for when im unable to sit with you
you have a little song that i wrote for you to listen to
so you know the way that youre missin me im missin you
i wanna give you the world but for now i hope thisll do13embed"
