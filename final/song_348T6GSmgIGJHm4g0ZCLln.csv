the first degree was a riot
were making sure
my lessons learned
im not ashamed but im trying
ive come to expect the standards you have set
tell me just how dangerous is second best
youve settled for less and im sure youll settle again

chorus
theres no stopping me
im gunning you down does this make you feel safe
theres no stopping this
im gunning you down does this make you feel safe

verse 2
the closer that i look is just the further that you get
already stubborn skin thickens
in attempt to understand
understand

chorus
theres no stopping me
im gunning you down  does this make you feel safe
theres no stopping this
im gunning you down does this make you feel safe

verse 3
came as a gift from a good friend a good friend
that disapproves but understands
that you represent
and actively encourage
all of my worst habits
they all are
proof that were both capable of the most terrible things
dont test me

chorus
theres no stopping me
im gunning you down does this make you feel safe
theres no stopping this
im gunning you down does this make you feel safe

bridge 2
you got tired got tired of waiting when of waiting
the guilt subsides still waiting

i know its not what you deserve
you got tired got tired of waiting when of waiting
the guilt subsides still waiting
go up against
i know its not what you deserve
outro
how dangerous is second best
youve settled for less
well i know its not what you deserve it’s not what you deserve
i know it’s not what you deserve i know it’s not what you deserve3embed"
