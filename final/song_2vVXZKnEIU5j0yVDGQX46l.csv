if it were up to me
i’d turn you into a stone
and turn the lights down low for effect
and i’d steal your cigarettes and id be
softer than i am through cigarette smoke
and if anybody asks ill say i did it as a joke so
but how about his loneliness he gets it from his mom
100 dollars for his haircut but a smile from god
and when he touches you you’ll wonder how he keeps his hands so soft
he got some money from his grandma
guess he’ll never have a job

chorus 1
oh pretty boy pretty boy
don’t speak dont speak
you pretty boys pretty boys
are only good for one thing for one thing

verse 2
but anyways
that isn’t even what i meant to say
i meant to sing a song to you to make you fall asleep
and i wouldn’t have to talk to you and you wouldn’t talk to me
but i could lay on top of you and soak in all your heat
don’t let them catch you crying boy if it didn’t really hurt
she took a drink to jog her memory but it didn’t really work
she meant to sing a song but couldn’t memorize the words
she only knew the chorus she had to mumble through the verse

oh pretty boy pretty boy
don’t think dont think
you pretty boys pretty boys
are only good for one thing for one thingembed"
