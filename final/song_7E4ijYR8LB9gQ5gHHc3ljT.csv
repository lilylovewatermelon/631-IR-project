theres a reason why we put a week of work in
so we can do whatever we want on the weekend
its when you take your blue collar off and let your neck turn red
everybody does it just a little different
so when we wind up all the same whats the difference
yeah you better get to livin it up before you wake up dead

chorus
atip em back til you cant walk
cut loose like a chainsaw
plastered like a drywall
hammered like an old bent nail
jacked up like a fourby
bout as buzzed as a bud light
long gone as last night
loaded like a buckshot shell
theres more than one way
to get straight up sideways

verse 2
you can do it in the sticks in mississippi
or on a rooftop new york city
from the carolina coast to a california beach
yall raise one up with me

tip em back til you cant walk
cut loose like a chainsaw
plastered like a drywall
hammered like an old bent nail
jacked up like a fourby
bout as buzzed as a bud light
long gone as last night
loaded like a buckshot shell
theres more than one way
to get straight up sideways
straight up sideways

outro
atip em back til you cant walk
cut loose like a chainsaw
plastered like a drywall
hammered like an old bent nail
jacked up like a fourby
about as buzzed as a bud light
along gone as last night
loaded like a buckshot shell
theres more than one way
more than one way
to get straight up sideways woo
straight up sideways
