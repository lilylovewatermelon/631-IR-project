hey love
yeah i lost you babe
pickin up a penny with a presson is
easier than holding you down
cant be any harder than holding you up now
to come clean i said to be real is to come clean is to come clean
to be real its
probably true what they say about me
probably came from my inner circle
it usually come from your inner circle
or lack thereof and i dont know who i can trust
ive been droppin out and
ive been hangin out with my high friends
and we too stoned to pay attention now
much too cool for seventh grade
i mean really its same me its old me
you know same shit
ive been on the lowkey grinding
grinding grinding grinding grinding grinding
learning on the lowkey shining
tryin to keep to myself
but you bring me out of character
every time again

chorus
