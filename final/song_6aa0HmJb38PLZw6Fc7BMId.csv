oh virgo

verse
i wish i could look in your eyes
and tell you how i feel right now inside
baby i know that its real real
so real real so real real so real real
i miss you how i wish i could be with you
i miss you how i wish how i wish
how i wish i could be with you right now
be with you right now
every morning every afternoon every night
i wanna be with you
it dont matter if we go to the park or watch a play
stay in a hotel room all day i just wanna be with you
i love everything about you from your old school tennis shoes
to the way you move when youre dancin with me
do you remember our first kiss
it wasnt long enough
remember the first time we spent those weeks together
they were not long enough
all of our conversations all of your sweet pages
theyre never long enough ah
when its time for me to leave
its so hard to say goodbye ah
i never wanna say goodbye
i never ever want to say goodbye ah
