falling too fast to prepare for this
tripping in the world could be dangerous
everybody circling is vulturous
negative nepotist
everybody waiting for the fall of man
everybody praying for the end of times
everybody hoping they could be the one
i was born to run i was born for this

prechorus
whip whip
run me like a racehorse
pull me like a ripcord
break me down and build me up
i wanna be the slip slip
word upon your lip lip
letter that you rip rip
break me down and build me up

chorus
whatever it takes
cause i love the adrenaline in my veins
i do whatever it takes
cause i love how it feels when i break the chains
whatever it takes
yeah take me to the top
im ready for whatever it takes
cause i love the adrenaline in my veins
i do what it takes

always had a fear of being typical
looking at my body feeling miserable
always hanging on to the visual
i wanna be invisible
looking at my years like a martyrdom
everybody needs to be a part of em
never be enough im the prodigal son
i was born to run i was born for this

prechorus
whip whip
run me like a racehorse
pull me like a ripcord
break me down and build me up
i wanna be the slip slip
word upon your lip lip
letter that you rip rip
break me down and build me up

chorus
whatever it takes
cause i love the adrenaline in my veins
i do whatever it takes
cause i love how it feels when i break the chains
whatever it takes
yeah take me to the top
im ready for whatever it takes
cause i love the adrenaline in my veins
i do what it takes
bridge
hypocritical egotistical
dont wanna be the parenthetical hypothetical
working hard on something that im proud of out of the box
an epoxy to the world and the vision weve lost
im an apostrophe
im just a symbol to remind you that theres more to see
im just a product of the system a catastrophe
and yet a masterpiece and yet im halfdiseased
and when i am deceased
at least ill go down to the grave and die happily
and leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
i do what it takes

chorus
whatever it takes
cause i love the adrenaline in my veins
i do whatever it takes
cause i love how it feels when i break the chains
whatever it takes
yeah take me to the top
im ready for whatever it takes
cause i love the adrenaline in my veins
i do what it takes199embed"
