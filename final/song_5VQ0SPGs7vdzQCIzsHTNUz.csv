im going in im ready to surrender
like a diamond i need a little pressure
so press me down till i scream
if youre the flame im kerosene
im burning up baby

chorus
all i need is your body heat right next to me
burning up burning up so give it up give it up
all i need is your body heat right next to me
i’m burning up baby all i want is your body heat
burning up burning up so give it up give it up
all i need is your body heat

verse 2
im restless im craving your attention
my red lips have found a new obsession
lets go all night just you and me
if youre the flame im kerosene
im burning up baby

chorus
all i need is your body heat right next to me
burning up burning up so give it up give it up
all i need is your body heat right next to me
i’m burning up baby all i want is your body heat
burning up burning up so give it up give it up
all i need is your body heat

and all of the stars above
you melt me and my body feels no shame
and i dont care tonight
if it burns too bright
cause baby thats why i came

burning up burning up so give it up give it up
all i need is your body heat right next to me
