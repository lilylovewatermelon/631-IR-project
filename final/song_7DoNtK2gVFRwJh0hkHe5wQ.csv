verse 1
you tell me that im complicated
and that might be an understatement
anything else hahahahaha
you tell me that im indecisive
fickle but i try to hide it
anything else hahahahaha
you tell me that i overthink
til i ruin a good thing
anything else hahahahaha
you tell me that youd rather fight
than spend a single peaceful night
with somebody else hahahaha

all of the mazes and the madness in my mind
