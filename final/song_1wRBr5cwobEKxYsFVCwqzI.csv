verse 1
you love another man
my heart is broken in two
she wears a ring on the other hand
shes scared to tell me the truth

prechorus
but if you are leaving oh
i want you to know that
i shouldve loved you way more way more
so if this is the end of us now

chorus
ill see you around
ill see you around around
you mean more to me than anything
and it hurts cause you dont love me
no no no no
so i just wanna see you happy

verse 2
now that you are comfortable
i think that i am losin my mind
its crazy cause we were so inseparable
guess things change with time
oh does he kiss and wipe away your tears
does he tell you that theres nothin to fear
ohoh if i had a wishing well
i would have you right here
