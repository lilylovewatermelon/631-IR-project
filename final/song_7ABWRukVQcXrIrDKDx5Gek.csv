in a foreign place the saving grace was the feeling
that it was a heart that he was stealing
oh he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
the eyes are bright he couldnt wait to get away
and i bet that juliet was just the icing on the cake
make no mistake no

chorus
and even if somehow we could have
shown you the place you wanted
well im sure you could have
made it that bit better on your own

verse 2
and i bet she told a million people that shed stay in touch
but all the little promises they dont mean much
when theres memories to be made
and i hope youre holding hands by new years eve
they made it far too easy to believe
that true romance cant be achieved these days

chorus
and even if somehow they could have
shown you the place you wanted
well im sure you could have
made it that bit better on your own
you are the only ones who knowyou might also like41embed"
