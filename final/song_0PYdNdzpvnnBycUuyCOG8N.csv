falalalala lalalala
tis the season to be jolly
falalalala lalalala
don we now our gay apparel
falala lalala lalala
troll the ancient yuletide carol
falalalala lalalala
see the blazing yule before us
falalalala lalalala
strike the harp and join the chorus
falalalala lalalala
follow me in merry measure
falalalala lalalala
while i tell of yuletide treasure
falalalala lalalala
fast away the old year passes
falalalala lalalala
hail the new year lads and lasses
falalalala lalalala
sing we joyous all together
falalalala lalalala
heedless of the wind and weather
falalalala lalalalayou might also likeembed"
