i dont know if we should be alone together
i still got a crush thats obvious
if nobodys around whats stopping us
everywhere i go you show whatever
i dont ever mind sharing oxygen
i just wanna get lost in your lungs

and im allergic to the waiting

and i love to watch her dance
but its making me go crazy

can you let your baby be my girl
can you let your baby be my girl
can you let your baby be mine

verse 2
i dont think that we should be around each other
when youre in the room you get my eyes

i can make you laugh until you cry
you know you got all my attention
you know you got all mine
