my neighbor’s car got stolen last night
right out of his driveway
we heard the dogs barking
we never paid them any mind
and mary says she’s gonna lock the door
from now on when we go away
ive been walkin around this farm
wonderin if it’s time

chorus
time to get a gun
that’s what ive been thinkin
i could afford one
if i did just a little less drinkin
time to put somethin
between me and the sun
when the talkin is over
it’s time to get a gun

verse 2
last week a government man was there
when i walked out my back door
he said i’m sorry to bother you ma’am
it don’t matter anymore
cause even while we were talking
right here where we stand
they’re making plans for a four lane highway
and a big old over pass

its time to get a gun
that’s what ive been thinkin
i could afford one
if i did just a little less drinkin
time to put somethin
between me and the sun
when the talkin is over
it’s time to get a gun

verse 3
mary says she’s worried about herself and her kids
she’s never known anybody who had a gun
and her daddy never did
but i think it should be up to me
cause when it’s all said and done
somebody’s got to walk into the night
and i’m gonna be that one

chorus
its time to get a gun
that’s what ive been thinkin
i could afford one
if i did just a little less drinkin
time to put somethin
between me and the sun
when the talkin is over
it’s time to get a gun
outro
when the party is over
it’s time to get a gunembed"
