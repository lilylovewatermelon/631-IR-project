i think you can do much better than me
after all the lies that i made you believe
guilt kicks in and i start to see
the edge of the bed
where your nightgown used to be

prechorus
i told myself i won’t miss you
but i remembered
what it feels like beside you

chorus
i really miss your hair in my face
and the way your innocence tastes
and i think you should know this
you deserve much better than me

verse 2
while lookin’ through your old box of notes
i found those pictures i took
that you were lookin’ for
if there’s one memory i don’t wanna lose
that time at the mall
you and me in the dressing room
see hinder liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likeprechorus
i told myself i won’t miss you
but i remembered
what it feels like beside you

chorus
i really miss your hair in my face
and the way your innocence tastes
and i think you should know this
you deserve much better than me

bridge
the bed i’m lyin’ is getting colder
wish i never would’ve said it’s over
and i can’t pretend
i won’t think about you when i’m older
cause we never really had our closure
this can’t be the end

chorus
i really miss your hair in my face
and the way your innocence tastes
and i think you should know this
you deserve much better than me
i really miss your hair in my face
and the way your innocence tastes
and i think you should know this
you deserve much better than me
outro
and i think you should know this
you deserve much better than me
and i think you should know this
you deserve much better than me
and i think you should know this
you deserve much better than me
and i think you should know this7embed"
