i can tell by the way you move your lips
while youre breathing
it hits me in the chest
like a sledge hammer
infests my mind like
nothing else matters
would you like to
know whats on my mind
i can feel the mood
leaking out from your eyes
let us get down to business
let us not be shy
im combusting inside
like a nitrous engine
i got to refrain from all this spinning
would you like to
know whats on my mind
ill shut the blinds on my window
just like how well shut our minds off
from the world
theres no reason to worry
theres no reason to doubt
i want you to show me
what youre all about
something crazy happens
when the lights are let down low
something crazy happens
when inhibitions are out of control
its like jumping into a wild rushing river
chills up your back as your body quivers
would you like to
know whats on my mind
its you and i and nows the time
to build up this tension
so do it right lust how you like
for your stimulation
ive been over heating
and were both fending
for it to boil over the top
would you like to
know whats on my mindyou might also likeembed"
