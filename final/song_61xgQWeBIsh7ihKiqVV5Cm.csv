i had every intention of getting hammered here tonight
i gave my truck keys to the bar keep
said dave dont you dare let me drive
in the middle of this bottle
i drank my train of thought off track
so ive gotta stop drinking or start rethinking my reason for throwing them back

chorus
cause its just wasted whiskey trying to drink you off my mind
there aint enough bourbon behind this bar
and i aint got that kinda time
so im gonna stand while i can and raise my glass
toast every time you kiss me
cause drinking to forget about you
is wasted whiskey

verse 2
so heres to new beginnings and to the memories
and cheers to your mamma and daddy cause they were right about you and me
and heres to milsap on the jukebox and to your new friends youve found
and heres to our joint account master card cause im buying the whole house a round
