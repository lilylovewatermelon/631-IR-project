how dare you say that my behaviors unacceptable
so condescending unnecessarily critical
i have the tendency of getting very physical
so watch your step cause if i do youll need a miracle

chorus
but when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
youll understand what i mean when i say
theres no way were gonna give up
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe

verse 2
you drain me dry and make me wonder why im even here
the double vision i was seeing is finally clear
you try to stay but you know very well i want you gone
not fit to fuckin tread the ground that i am walking on

chorus
but when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
youll understand what i mean when i say
theres no way were gonna give up
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe

when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
youll understand what i mean when i say
theres no way were gonna give up
and like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breathe
is there anyone out there cause its getting harder and harder to breatheembed"
