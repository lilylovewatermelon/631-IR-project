im finna pull up just to freeze the whole scene up
i be smoking antidotes that scientists aint heard of
switching back to us my whole squad in the vapor
she thought it was fog nah this just how we blaze up
i learned from my grandpa n em big cousins and all of them
i dont give no fuck about who mad let me get to him
let me blink my eye and after that you see im through with him boy you niggas weak you need to be a lil more positive
im tryna keep control dont let me start with him
i hate a stupid nigga so much i wanna bother him
these rappers still a joke we verbally kill all of them
leave it up to me ill smoke a blunt and then go slaughtering
i told ya man i dont give no fuck if he be sleeping there
they say why you mad
i say because these fools dont listen man
pull off on a bitch now she get mad cuz we aint inviting them
pull up to the show the line too long
i hope you get in there you bitchyou might also like1embed"
