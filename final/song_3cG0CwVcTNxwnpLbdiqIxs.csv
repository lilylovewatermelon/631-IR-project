you make it up as you go along
why pretend that youre something that youre not
i believe in you and always will
ever since you told me youre for real
inside emotional mood swing soon collide
now gather up all your tenacity
take my hand cause im setting you free

who cares whos there to stare and tell you how to look
im not even sure they know you by name
who cares whos there to share what they think of you
everybody here plays the same fucking games

let me see your fire
put your fist up in the air

verse 2
alive thats how i want you to feel tonight
live youre only here once so do it well
find your own way to rise up and give them hell
there is no reason to wonder if you should
go tell them you cant be bought or sold
break your silence and tell them who you are
cause theyre all witness to a shooting star
