the sun is up shining in the sky
got a heart of gold i can see
baby you got you now you got me
somethings on dont be late
its time to leave for the higher state

there is no time to be low tomorrow
theres only time to kill
there is no time to be high and fly
theres only time to thrill

so when i am up and you are down
baby thats when you come around
gotta ease my pain and soothe my brain
gotta take me in out of this rain
somethings on so dont be late
its time to leave for the higher state

there is no rhyme to express my emotion
theres only rhme to feel
there is no rhyme to fulfil my devotion
theres only rhyme to heal

dont fret get high theres a new dawn that says hi
the higher state
you might also likerepeat

its a happy day for you and i
and the sun is up shining in the sky
got a heart of gold i can see
baby you got you now you got me

it is no crime to be lost with no direction
its just a crime to not live
and there is no crime to be asked for affection
its just a crime to not live

dont fret get high theres a new dawn that says hi
the higher stateembed"
