no choice now its too late
let him go he gave up
i gave up
lisa said take time for me
droppin him down to his knees
ah chest down

chorus
take me away see ive got to explain
things they have changed in such a permanent way
life seems unreal can we go back to your place
oh you drink too much makes me drink just the same

verse 2
people tried felt so right
givin themselves good advice
lookin down sometimes felt nice

bridge
he knows its justified to kill to survive
he then in dollars makes more dead than alive
lets suck more blood lets run three hours a day
the world is over but i dont care

chorus
cause i am with you now ive got to explain
things they have changed in such a permanent way
life seems unreal can we go back to your place
oh you drink too much makes me drink just the same oh

the first time it happened too fast
the second time i thought it would last
we all like it a little different13embed"
