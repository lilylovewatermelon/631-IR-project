5FcwIJt39NpSTVQkaguJcq,The Taliban Song - Live,Toby Keith,7xPAsIGxs8It3pVWnZEHan,"1 contributorthe taliban song live lyricsim just a middleaged middleeastern camel herdin man
i got a little 2bedroom cave here in north afghanistan
things used to be real nice and they got out of hand
since they moved in
they call themselves the taliban
ooooo yeah the taliban ooo the taliban babyoo yeah

now i aint seen my wifes face since they came here
they make her wear a scarf over her head
that covers her from ear to ear
she loves the desert and the hot white sand
but man shes just like me nah she cant stand
the taliban ooo the taliban baby

but you know someday soon were both gonna saddle up
and itll be ride camel ride
my old lady shell be here with me
just smilin right by my side
we should do just fine out around palestine
or maybe turkmenistan
well bid a fair adieu and flip the finger to
the taliban

i know where you coming from brother
this is a patriotic love song
so yall feel free to salute if ya want to
i give ya permission
you might also likenow they attacked new york city
cause they thought they could win
said they would stand and fight
until the very bloody end
mr bush got on the phone with iraq and iran
and said now you sons a bitches
you better not be doin any business with that taliban

so we prayed to allah with all of our might
untill those big us jets came flyin one night
they dropped little bombs all over their holy land
and man you should have seen em run
like rabbits they ran the taliban

but you know someday soon were both gonna saddle up
and itll be ride camel ride
my old lady shell be here with me
just smilin right by my side
we should do just fine out around palestine
or maybe turkmenistan
well bid a fair adieu and flip a couple fingers
to the taliban

well bid a fair adieu and flip a big boner
to the taliban
