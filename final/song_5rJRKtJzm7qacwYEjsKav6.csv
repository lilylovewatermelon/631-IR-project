its like jumping its like leaping
its like walking on the ceiling
its like floating
its like flying through the air

its like soaring
its like gliding
its a rocket ship youre riding
its a feeling that can take you anywhere

chorus
so why they call it falling
why they call it falling
why they call it falling
i dont know

verse 2
there was passion
there was laughter
the first morning after
i just couldnt get my feet to touch the ground

every time we were together
wed talked about forever
i was certain
it was heaven we had found
see lee ann womack liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likerepeat chorus

bridge
but you cant live your life
walking in the clouds
sooner or later
you have to come down

verse 3
its like a knife
through the heart
when it all comes apart
its like someone takes a pin to your balloon

its a hole
its a cave
its kind of like a grave
when he tells you that hes found somebody new

chorus
and why they call it falling
why they call it falling
why they call it falling
now i know

why they call it falling
why they call it falling
now i knowembed"
