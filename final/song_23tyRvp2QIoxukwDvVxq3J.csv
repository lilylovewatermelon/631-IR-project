know my grandma happy finally got my shit together
told bro well take the time and we just stick together
every time bro catch a bid we do that shit together
i know he got two phones but i still sent a letter
cause i know how that feel
dont compare me to no other rapper i feel like my shit real
fronting bows and fucking niggas hoes before i got a deal
its love for sure but you done broke the code i dont know how to feel
and i aint told nobody no for real since i got a mill
im tied in
another bloody summer in atlanta done lost five friends
mama told me that water was cold i still had dived in
never let a nigga take me out its beef we dine in
dawg done lost his mind i pray to god to help him find it
i was in a dark spot but i came back and i broke the knot
remixing my country boy for a profit now a nigga run the charge
i dont need your comment nah
this the shit that i live for at least five niggas thatll kill for me
hundred racks for my kid lawyer
it aint my fault she dont got morals
i got rich thats my life story
i left the streets in a paddywagon i came back and got right to it
never question my loyalty if its that deep then dont do it
seem to go my hardest when im going through it
you might also likechorus
through with that said im done but then i doubled back
are you dumb you the one and im the cause of that
firearm always on me i be clutching that
know im wrong how the fuck we playing russian roulette
all my life i had to fight i feel like mike
shootouts every other week we had that
bitches every other night im past that
ima always play my part give a fuck bout no awards and shit

verse 2
i still aint drop my hardest shit
im tryna get on some other shit my mind still in the partments
my accountant say i need to slow it down with these dior garments
close my eyes and think about where i come from when im performing
im on top of every dime i check my balance every morning
im relaxing with a bad one they be asking can they join us
and my left wrist on crip nigga these bracelets sixty pointers
in the maybachs back to back on the southside it was me and wunna
im putting on for my people and them
say the wrong words we deleting him
no doubt about it they believe in him
wont let em down i promise
i really cried when marlo died i felt it all in my stomach
on the same shit that i been on i aint never switching my formula
i remember they made fun of me cant beef with nobody under me
these lil niggas should honor me im way up on em honestly
four buildings in the last month im boosting up my economy
four million that was this week which one of yall wanna come for me yeah
chorus
through with that said im done but then i doubled back
are you dumb you the one and im the cause of that
firearm always on me i be clutching that
know im wrong how the fuck we playing russian roulette
all my life i had to fight i feel like mike
shootouts every other week we had that
bitches every other night im past that
ima always play my part give a fuck bout no awards and shitembed"
