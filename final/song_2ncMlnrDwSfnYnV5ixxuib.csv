i still go riding around town
with the windows down and your feet up on my dash
got your rays on and my hat’s back and were feeling cool as cash
the night is on like you aint even gone
you go slidin through the static trying to find that song you love
smoke rolling up and you showin up like a dime piece in the dust
you got me stoned like you aint even gone

verse 1
sunset twilight friday night
round back chill a dollar fifty miller high life
headband peace sign looking fly shotgun bullet going straight through a street sign

prechorus
you had diamonds in your eyes when you were smiling
even pretty when youre cryin
if i said i wasnt missing you id be lyin
but the truth is girl the truth is

chorus
i still go riding around town
with the windows down and your feet up on my dash
got your rays on and my hats back and were feeling cool as cash
the night is on another moonlight ride like you aint even gone
you go sliding through the static trying to find that song you love
smoke rolling up and you showin’ up like a dime piece in the dust
you got me stoned it still feels so right
like you aint even gone like you aint even gone
like you aint even gone

midnight calling me looking for trouble
slipping them should have beens in my ear
got me shooting down that girls memory double
that blue eyes summer smoke sunburn red smile
said you were leaving this town got to runaway
i watched you drive away and girl you should have chased down

prechorus
those diamonds in your eyes when you were smiling
even pretty when youre cryin
if i said i wasnt missing you id be lyin
cause the truth is girl the truth is

chorus
i still go riding around town
with the windows down and your feet up on my dash
got your rays on and my hat’s back and were feeling cool as cash
the night is on another moonlight ride like you aint even gone
you go sliding through the static trying to find that song you love
smoke rolling up and you showin’ up like a dime piece in the dust
you got me stoned it still feels so right
like you aint even gone like you aint even gone gonee
you aint even gone gone gone
you aint even gone gone gone
outro
sunset twilight friday night
round back chill a dollar fifty miller high life
headband peace sign looking fly shotgun bullet going straight through a street sign
