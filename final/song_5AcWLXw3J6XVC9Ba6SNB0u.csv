so lets not even try youre right lets ball it up and throw it out
the window its becoming all so
clear in my mind ive thought this thing through more like once
or twice i feel that this is my last request to you

verse 1 spencer chamberlain aaron gillespie
hold your breath bottle it up and save it for the next one
its safe to say weve been riding this all night
none of this will ever change your mind
its never safe to rely on borrowed time
now were both undone and its time to open up your eyes

chorus spencer chamberlain aaron gillespie
consequence its our need in times like this
feeling free is our modern disease
youre a classic disaster with a knack for losing your exterior
im so sick from staring at the mirror

postchorus spencer chamberlain
this all needs a break from you
and i am used to this

bridge spencer chamberlain aaron gillespie
i fear that i am just an end
so youll play the mistaken
and ill play the victim in our screenplay of desire
and im still writing the letters ill never send

running in circles i cant forget how many times
ive played this in my mind feeling free feeling free

chorus spencer chamberlain aaron gillespie
consequence its our need in times like this
feeling free is our modern disease
youre a classic disaster with a knack for losing your exterior
im so sick from staring at the mirror

outro spencer chamberlain
this is my panic
this is my call to arms
this is my panic
this is my call to arms1embed"
