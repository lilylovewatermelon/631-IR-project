midnight bottle
take me calmly through my memories
and everything will come back to me
midnight bottle
make it real
what feels like make believe so i can see a little more clearly

prechorus 1
like every single move you make kissing me so carefully
on the corners of my dreaming eyes

chorus
ive got a midnight bottle gonna drink it down
a one way ticket takes me to the times we had before
when everything felt so right
if only for tonight
a midnight bottle gonna ease my pain
from all these feelings driving me insane
i think of you and everythings all right
if only for tonight

verse 2
got a midnight bottle
drifting off into the candlelight
where i can find you any old time
midnight bottle
i forgot how good it felt to be in a dream
just like you had me
