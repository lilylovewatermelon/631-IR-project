ive been cheated by you since i dont know when
so i made up my mind it must come to an end
look at me now will i ever learn
i dont know how but i suddenly lose control
theres a fire within my soul

prechorus
just one look and i can hear a bell ring
one more look and i forget everything whoa

chorus
mamma mia here i go again
my my how can i resist you
mamma mia does it show again
my my just how much ive missed you
yes ive been brokenhearted
blue since the day we parted
why why did i ever let you go
mamma mia now i really know
my my i could never let you go

verse 2
ive been angry and sad about things that you do
i cant count all the times that ive told you were through
and when you go when you slam the door
i think you know that you wont be away too long
you know that im not that strong
