excuse me your heart is in my heart
hello youve taken this too far
am i just a piece you push in your board game
have you been laughing all day long
you like it when its hard for me to see straight
you make it go on and on and on and on and on

chorus
save your goodbye
youre everywhere i go
youre everywhere i go
youre everywhere i go go go

verse 2
beg your pardon youre standing on my love
hello have you not had enough
am i just a piece you push in your board game
have you been laughing all day long
you like it when its hard for me to see straight
you make it go on and on and on and on and on

chorus
save your goodbye
youre everywhere i go
youre everywhere i go
youre everywhere i go go go go go
save your goodbye
youre everywhere i go
youre everywhere i go
youre everywhere i go go go go go

hey its my time to shine
and my sword is trembling
youre back inside my mind
and i cant stop remembering
i say im chasing dreams but you know ive been
running away from running away from you
some sort of comfort in your pain
i cant help from taking
no matter how i change
there will be no escaping
i say im chasing time but you know ive been
running away from running away from you

chorus
save your goodbye
youre everywhere i go
youre everywhere i go
youre everywhere i go go go go go
save your goodbye
youre everywhere i go
youre everywhere i go
youre everywhere i go go go go go1embed"
