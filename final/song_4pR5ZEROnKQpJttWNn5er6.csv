yeah

verse 1 machine gun kelly
its been six days since the last time i saw your face and you asked my sign
i told you mine i question why and you said everythings aligned
on the first date you told me i was your twin flame from a past life
and tonight the moon is full so take me anywhere outside
i cannot kiss you yet youre magic so ill just stare at you instead
i get insecure and panic cause i know youre too pure for this

chorus machine gun kelly
youre too good for me
im too bad to keep
im too sad lonely
i want you only

verse 2 machine gun kelly
ay i got six ways to say that i fell in love with you at first sight
i wish that i could frame the way you look at me with those eyes
freezе time baby rewind
maybe ask you еarlier be mine
see i didnt understand déjà vu til i met you

chorus machine gun kelly
youre too good for me
im too bad to keep
im too sad lonely
i want you only
youre too good for me
im too bad to keep
im too sad lonely
i want you only
