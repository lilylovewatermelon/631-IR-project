finding strength to call and ask her
rollercoaster favorite ride
let me kiss you one last time

leave me standing here act like im not around
the coast will probably never clear can i please go
home now
i had that dream about you again
where i wait outside until you let me in
and there i stay

lay beside me and listen at the wall
well keep on lying until the summer comes
i had that dream about you again
where you drive my car right off the fucking cliff

and now im breathing deeply walking backwards
finding strength to call and ask her
rollercoaster favorite ride
let me kiss you one last time

make me promise that i will never tell
all i remembers the way her bedroom smelled
i had that dream about you again
where i wait outside until you let me in
you might also likeand now im breathing deeply walking backwards
finding strength to call and ask her
rollercoaster favorite ride
let me kiss you one last time good night

good nightembed"
