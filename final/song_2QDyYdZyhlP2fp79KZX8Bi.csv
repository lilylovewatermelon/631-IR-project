what did you think id say to that
does a scorpion sting when fighting back
they strike to kill and you know i will
you know i will
what do you sing on your drive home
do you see my face in the neighbors lawn
does she smile
or does she mouth fuck you forever

prechorus
every time you call me crazy i get more crazy
what about that
and when you say i seem angry i get more angry

chorus
and theres nothing like a mad woman
what a shame she went mad
no one likes a mad woman
you made her like that
and youll poke that bear til her claws come out
and you find something to wrap your noose around
and theres nothing like a mad woman

verse 2
now i breathe flames each time i talk
my cannons all firin at your yacht
they say move on but you know i wont
and women like hunting witches too
doing your dirtiest work for you
its obvious that wanting me dead
has really brought you two together

what about that
and when you say i seem angry i get more angry

chorus
and theres nothing like a mad woman
what a shame she went mad
no one likes a mad woman
you made her like that
and youll poke that bear til her claws come out

and theres nothing like a mad woman

bridge
im taking my time taking my time
cause you took everything from me
watching you climb watching you climb
over people like me
the master of spin has a couple side flings
good wives always know
she should be mad should be scathing like me but
no one likes a mad woman

outro
what a shame she went mad
you made her like that44embed"
