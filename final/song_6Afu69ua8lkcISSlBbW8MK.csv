if i had one wish i would wish for two
for me and you to be happy
with the way things are sometimes gets hard
but weve come so far to be happy

chorus
yeah dont think that im complaining
sometimes it keeps on raining
oh but dont be frightened by thunder and lightning
the sun comes out and the flowers grow
and you find youre already on the road to be happy

verse 2
if i had one prayer to pull out of thin air
everyone everywhere would be happy
wed hand out valentines id be yours youd be mine
theres a place theres a time to be happy

chorus

bridge
well we fuss and we fight
we cant see the light
we wake up and decide
we dont need to be right to be happy
