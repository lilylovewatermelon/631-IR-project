seems like i was walkin in the wrong direction
i barely recognize my own reflection oh
scared of love but scared of life alone

verse 2
seems ive been playin on the safe side baby
buildin walls around my heart to save me oh
but its time for me to let it go

chorus
yeah im ready to feel now
no longer am i fraid of the fall down
it must be time to move on now
without the fear of how it might end
i guess im ready to love again

verse 3
just when you think that love will never find you
you run away but still its right behind you oh
its just somethin that we cant control

chorus
yeah im ready to feel now
no longer am i fraid of the fall down
it must be time to move on now
without the fear of how it might end
i guess im ready to love again
see lady a liveget tickets as low as 205you might also likebridge
so come and find me
ill be waitin up for you
ill be holdin out for you tonight

chorus
yeah im ready to feel now
no longer am i fraid of the fall down
it must be time to move on now
without the fear of how it might end
i guess im ready ready to love again
