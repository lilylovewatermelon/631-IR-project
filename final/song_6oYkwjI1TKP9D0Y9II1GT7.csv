ariel listen to me
the human world its a mess
life under the sea is better than anything theyve got up there

verse 1 sebastian
the seaweed is always greener
in somebody elses lake
you dream about going up there
but that is a big mistake
just look at the world around you
right here on the ocean floor
such wonderful things surround you
what more is you lookin for

chorus sebastian
under the sea under the sea
darling its better down where its wetter
take it from me
up on the shore they work all day
out in the sun they slave away
while we devotin full time to floatin
under the sea ahhaha

verse 2 sebastian  crab sebastian fish

but fish in the bowl is lucky
they in for a worser fate
one day when the boss get hungry
