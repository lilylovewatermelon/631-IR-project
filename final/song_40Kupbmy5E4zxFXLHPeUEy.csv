coast to coast and back again
i just had to do things my way
had to go against the wind
cause ive been dreaming of the girl i left behind
lord she had the truest heart ive ever known
and ive been looking for a world ill never find
ever since i left my east kentucky home

i can smell the wood smoke risin
feel the wind out in the pines
see the way i left her cryin
every time i close my eyes

cause ive been dreaming of the girl i left behind
lord she had the truest heart ive ever known
and ive been looking for a world ill never find
ever since i left my east kentucky home

think ill get up with the sunrise
think ill pack my things and go
its taken me this long to realize
the only thing i need to know

cause ive been dreaming of the girl i left behind
lord she had the truest heart ive ever known
and ive been looking for a world ill never find
ever since i left my east kentucky homesee the steeldrivers liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeembed"
