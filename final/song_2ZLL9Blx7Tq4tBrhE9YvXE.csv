picture yourself in the living room
your pipe and slippers set out for you
i know you think that it aint too far
but i i hear the call of a lifetime ring
felt the need to get up for it
oh you cut out the middleman
get free from the middleman
chorus 1
you got no time for the messenger
got no regard for the thing that you dont understand
you got no fear of the underdog
thats why you will not survive

verse 2
i want to forget how convention fits
but can i get out from under it
can i get it out of me oh oh oh
it cant all be wedding cake
it cant all be boiled away
i try but i cant let go of it
cant let go of it uhhuh

chorus 2
cause you dont talk to the water boy
and theres so much you could learn but you dont want to know
you will not back up an inch ever
thats why you will not survive
yeah
you might also likeverse 3
the thing that i tell you now
it may not go over well
and it may not be photoop
in the way that i spell it out

chorus 3
but you wont hear from the messenger
dont wanna know bout something that you dont understand
you got no fear of the underdog
thats why you will not survive
