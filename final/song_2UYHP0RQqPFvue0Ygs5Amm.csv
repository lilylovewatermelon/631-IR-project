all i give are little clues
maybe one day ill get through
but there is nothing i can do
ill just keep on lying to you
i only need to say its true
your poor little heart already knew
but there is nothing you can do
ill just keep on lying to you

verse
should my cover ever blow
would you ever let it go
there is something you should know
but hell if id ever let it show

so here i am trying to be strong
it was noon now my shadows long
i guess ill go and tell you just as soon
as i get to the end of this song
to the end of this song
to the end of this song
to the end of this song
to the end of this song
you might also likebridge
the curse has won again
soon ill be alone
take all you can
please understand
that it never really was love

all i give are little clues
maybe one day ill get through
there is nothing you could do
ill just keep on lying to you19embed"
