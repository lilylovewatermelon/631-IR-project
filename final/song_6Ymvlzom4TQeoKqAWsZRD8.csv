theres somethin bout a truck in a farmers field
a no trespass sign and time to kill
nobodys gonna get hurt so whats the big deal
theres somethin bout a truck in a farmers field

verse 2
and theres somethin bout beer sitting on ice
after a long hard day makes it taste just right
on that dropped tailgate on a summer night
theres somethin bout beer sittin on ice

verse 3
and theres somethin bout a girl in a red sundress
with an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
in that farmers field hah will make a boy a mess
theres somethin bout a girl in a red sundress

verse 4
and theres somethin bout a kiss thats gonna lead to more
on that dropped tailgate back behind the corn
the most natural thing youve ever felt before
theres somethin bout a kiss thats gonna lead to more

chorus
and theres somethin bout a truck in a field
and a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
begging for another kiss
and theres somethin bout you and me and the birds and the bees
and lord have mercy its a beautiful thing
aint nothing bout it luck theres somethin bout a truck

theres somethin bout a creek around 2 am
after a few of those beers you wanna dive on in
you dont need no clothes so just hang em on a limb
theres somethin bout a creek around 2 am

chorus
and theres somethin bout a truck in a field
and a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
begging for another kiss
and theres somethin bout you and me and the birds and the bees
and lord have mercy its a beautiful thing
aint nothing bout it luck theres somethin bout a truck
aint nothing bout it luck theres somethin bout a truck
