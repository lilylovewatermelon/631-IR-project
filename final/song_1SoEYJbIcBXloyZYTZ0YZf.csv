i said sir is she comin back soon
he smiled and he stated son im over rated
ive had too much credit in those old love tunes

cause i dont know a thing about love
i just kinda hang out here above
i just watch from the sky will love grow will it die
no i dont know a thing about love

then i asked him where is she tonight
you must see all things with your light
he said son i could tell you some things that might kill you
but i dont get involved with whats wrong or whats right

cause i dont know a thing about love
i just kinda hang out here above
i just watch from the sky will love grow will it die
no i dont know a thing about lovе

he said son i can move the ocеans when i take the notion
or make mountains tremble and rivers run dry
but in all matters human remember that theres someone
in charge of all the things way above you and i

now i dont know a thing about love
i just kinda hang out here above
i just watch from the sky will love grow will it die
no i dont know a thing about love
i dont know a thing about love
i dont know a thing about love
