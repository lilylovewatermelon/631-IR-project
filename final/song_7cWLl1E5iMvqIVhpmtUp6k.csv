i went out last night
im going out tonight again
anything to capture your attention your attention
and shes a real sweet girl
and you know i got a boy
details we both forgot to mention forgot to mention

prechorus 1
and you
i always know where you are
and you always know where i am
were takin it way too far
but i dont want it to end

chorus
this kiss is something i cant resist
your lips are undeniable
this kiss is something i cant risk
your heart is unreliable
something so sentimental
you make so detrimental
and i wish it didnt feel like this
cause i dont wanna miss this kiss
i dont wanna miss this kiss
this kiss this kiss this kiss
