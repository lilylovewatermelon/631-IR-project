whered you get to whered you go
ive been so lost since you left
wish you kept leading me on
tried to reach ya tried to call
i bang my head against your door
but there aint nobody home

prechorus
and if you want to stay lost awhile
ill rearrange the road i take
and meet you out in the wild
and if you want we can wait behind
we can find a place to hide
maybe i could change your mind

chorus
so im holding out for something more
let me hold your rolling heart of stone
weigh down heavy like you did before
let me hold your rolling heart of stone
let it roll let it roll let it roll again
let it roll let it roll let me hold your heart of stone

verse 2
if you think you might feel the same
ill be right here where we left off
same old story same old place
i wont wander i wont let go
cause theres more life in my bones
than you give me credit for

and if you want to stay lost awhile

let me hold your rolling heart of stone
weigh down heavy like you did before
let me hold your rolling heart of stone
let it roll let it roll let it roll again
let it roll let it roll let it roll again
