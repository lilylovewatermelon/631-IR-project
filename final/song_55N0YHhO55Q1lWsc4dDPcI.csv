that slow burn wait while it gets dark
bruising the sun
i feel grown up with you in your car
i know its dumb

verse 2
weve both got a million bad habits to kick
not sleeping is one
were biting our nails youre biting my lip
im biting my tongue

refrain
the people are talking people are talking
the people are talking people are talking

chorus
raise a glass cause im not done sayin it
they all wanna get rough get away with it
let em talk cause were dancing in this world alone
world alone were alone

verse 3
all my fake friends and all of their noise
complain about work
theyre studying business i study the floor
and you havent stopped smoking all night
maybe the internet raised us
or maybe people are jerks
you might also likerefrain
the people are talking people are talking
but not you
the people are talking people are talking

chorus
raise a glass cause im not done sayin it
they all wanna get rough get away with it
let em talk cause were dancing in this world alone
world alone were alone
all the doubleedged people and schemes
they make a mess then go home and get clean
youre my best friend and were dancing in a world alone
a world alone were all alone

bridge
i know were not everlasting
were a train wreck waiting to happen
one day the blood wont flow so gladly
one day well all get still get still

refrain
the people are talking people are talking
the people are talking people are talking
the people are talking people are talking
the people are talking people are talking
chorus
raise a glass cause im not done sayin it
they all wanna get rough get away with it
let em talk cause were dancing in this world alone
world alone were alone
all the doubleedged people in schemes
they make a mess then go home and get clean
youre my best friend and were dancing in a world alone
a world alone were all alone

outro
the people are talking people are talking
the people are talking people are talking
the people are talking people are talking
the people are talking people are talking
let em talk
