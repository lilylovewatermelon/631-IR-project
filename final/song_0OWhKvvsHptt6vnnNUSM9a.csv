go on and put on that dress that all the bad boys like
i know your daddy aint home so ride with me tonight
you always wind up here in a puddle of tears
them boys are out and theyre angry and theyre lookin for blood
in the back of a blue old pickup truck
youve got nowhere to go although youre all gussied up

verse 2
theres so much whiskey in his coke itll make her nose bend
but she swears that his love is a damn godsend
she known god since she was a child
she used to play in the yard and she would drеam of one day
til the world came around and took hеr dreamin away
told her how to dress and act and smile

prechorus
shes an oklahoma smokeshow
hes an asshole from back home
shell never make it out alive
of that smalltown bar scene
where small vices kill your big dreams
hed take you home but hes too drunk to drive

chorus
ive been here ive been up all night
thinkin bout a life with you and i
one youll never know
cause youre a smalltown smokeshow
well ive been here ive been up all night
thinkin bout a life with you and i
one youll never know
cause youre a smalltown smokeshow
