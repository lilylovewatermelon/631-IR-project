whos to say that we always have to agree
i think we can both can take this one mistake
like some kind of amnesty
why to love and with such brutality
were compatible maybe a bit too much
thats our ambiguity
ive cried a thousand storms
ive blown away the clouds
the heartbeat of the sun is racing mine
and listen how my heart is waiting

chorus
this is the day and the time
i wanna believe that we may still have a chance
we took a leap in the dark
and i can see now
how shadows have turned to light

verse 2
well we know how ephemeral are things
disillusion takes what illusion gives
whats the use of make believe
the needles of the clock
are moving right to left
pretend we never heard of things we said
like weve been deaf
and start all over

this is the day and the time
i wanna believe that we may still have a chance
we took a leap in the dark
and i can see now
how shadows have turned to light

bridge
the heartbeat of the sun is racing mine
and listen how how ooh

chorus
this is the day and the time
i wanna believe that we may still have a chance
we took a leap in the dark
and i can see now
how shadows have turned to light

outro
ah the time
ah ah oohembed"
