he was sitting on the front porch of a halfway house
chaining cigarettes and drinking coffee
i was walking by on my way home
stopped and said hello how are ya
he looked at me and said ive seen better days
i looked at him and said theres a better way

chorus 1
three nails and a cross equal forgiveness
just like you i was lost and thats hell to have to live with
ive sat on that front porch where youre sitting now
i kept looking deep inside till i figured out
three nails and a cross equal forgiveness

verse 2
she was sitting on her bed crying crocodiles
sixteen aint a good age to be pregnant
and she thinks mom and dad wont love her anymore
like the boy who swore he always would but doesnt
she turns and sees that bible laying by her bed
and she crumbles to her knees as she bows her head

chorus 2
three nails and a cross equal forgiveness
lord help me cause im lost and thats hell to have to live with
i need you more than ever now without a doubt
ive made a big mistake can you help me out
three nails and a cross equal forgiveness
