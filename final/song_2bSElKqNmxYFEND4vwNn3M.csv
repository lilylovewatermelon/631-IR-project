hey girl its not a question if youre sexy
the only question it is â€’ what you know about these stereotypes
cmon

verse 1
so innocent you can tell by the clothes
college girl with a 40
good girl by day
damn who would have known
but when the lights go lights go down
and shes out on the floor
the freak comes out
and she loses control
the way she moves got me begging for more for more

prechorus
shes dancin like theres no one else in the room
private dance for two
cause in the dark its like shes someone else

chorus
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night night night
im talking to you and you
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night night night
im talking to you and you

shawty like when the bass vibrate speakers
her bodys hypnotic
the fellas all wanna meet her
cant leave without saying goodbye to your angel face
fly me home under your wings baby wings baby wings baby
we can go back to my crib
first time ill blindfold you
you cant know where i live
im kidding girl its your world im living in
me im just visiting
why dont you put on a show for me
baby

prechorus
shes dancin like theres no one else in the room
private dance for two
cause in the dark its like shes someone else

chorus
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night night night
im talking to you and you
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night night night
im talking to you and you
bridge
she owns the night
the night is hers
make reservations
to view them curves
she speaks that body language
aint got to say a word
all eyes on her

chorus
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night night night
im talking to you and you
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night
she owns the night night night
im talking to you and youembed"
