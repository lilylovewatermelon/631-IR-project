you got two black eyes from loving too hard
and a black car that matches your blackest soul
i wouldnt change ya oh
wouldnt ever try to make you leave no
oh the neon coast was your sign
and the midwest wind with pisces rising
wouldnt change ya oh
wouldnt ever try to make you leave no

prechorus
static palms melt your vibe
midnight whisperings

chorus
the black magic of mulholland drive
swimming pools under desert skies
drinking white wine in the blushing light
just another la devotee
sunsets on the evil eye
invisible to the hollywood shrine
always on the hunt for a little more time
just another la devotee

you got bleached out eyes from the valley sand
and the black tar palms keep weeping your name
i couldnt change ya oh
couldnt ever try to make you see no
the high rise lights that read your rights
and a downtown storm with aries rising
couldnt change ya oh
couldnt ever try to make you see no

prechorus
static palms melt your vibe
midnight whisperings

swimming pools under desert skies
drinking white wine in the blushing light
