this isnt over til we talk in the light
said i was sober but you knew that i lied
you grip the wheel maybe id like to try
ill flip it over with you and me inside

verse 2
i wont atone for debts i paid for in full
hang up my shame on display for you for you
im not the same and you dont get to decide
who gets replaced who gets to live and to die

refrain
so what do you want from me
so what do you want
so what do you want from me
so what do you want
so what do you want from me
so what do you want
so what do you want from me
so what do you want

refrain
so what do you want from me
so what do you want
so what do you want from me
so what do you want
