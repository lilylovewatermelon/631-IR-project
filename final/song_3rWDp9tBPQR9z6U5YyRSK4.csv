rain
he wanted it comfortable i wanted that pain
he wanted a bride i was making my own name
chasing that fame he stayed the same
all of me changed like midnight

verse 1
my town was a wasteland
full of cages full of fences
pageant queens and big pretenders
but for some it was paradise
my boy was a montage
a slowmotion love potion
jumping off things in the ocean
i broke his heart cause he was nice
he was sunshine i was midnight rain

chorus
he wanted it comfortable i wanted that pain
he wanted a bride i was making my own name
chasing that fame he stayed the same
all of me changed like midnight

verse 2
it came like a postcard
picture perfect shiny family
holiday peppermint candy
but for him its every day
so i peered through a window
a deep portal time travel
all the love we unravel
and the life i gave away
cause he was sunshine i was midnight rain

he wanted it comfortable i wanted that pain
he wanted a bride i was making my own name
chasing that fame he stayed the same
all of me changed like midnight rain
he wanted it comfortable i wanted that pain
he wanted a bride i was making my own name
chasing that fame he stayed the same
all of me changed like midnight

outro
i guess sometimes we all get
just what we wanted just what we wanted
and he never thinks of me
except for when im on tv
i guess sometimes we all get
some kind of haunted some kind of haunted
and i never think of him
except on midnights like this
midnights like this midnights like this31embed"
