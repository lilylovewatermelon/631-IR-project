well i started on the whiskey pretty early this morning
thats alright i was up all night
but i passed out before the sun came up
i really wanted to see one of those
i know thats no way for a man to behave
with a mortgage due and a baby on the way
but somehow i made it to where im at
its been a living as a matter of fact

verse 2
i get a bad attitude from being tired and running round
never ask for anyone to say they like my sound
i never been a part of any musical scenes
i aint just talking nashville if you know what i mean
they dont write about me in their magazines
and i dont ask for no reviews on the songs that i sing
ive never had a lot of friends and im alright by that
but people keep on coming back

chorus
raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
they dont care about no trends
they dont care about songs that sell
yeah tomorrow ill be gone
so tonight everybody just sing along
raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
see cody jinks liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeverse 3
ive been standing on the outside for all of my life
but i like the view im not gonna lie
yeah the yuppies and the hipsters and the wannabe scenes
that aint down home to me
i like twodollar beers i like threedollar wells
at some old honky tonk bar that i know by the smell
some old drunk on a bar stool on a merle haggard tune
thats my kind of room

chorus
raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
they dont care about no trends
they dont care about songs that sell
yeah tomorrow ill be gone
so tonight everybody just sing along
raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys

instrumental break

chorus
raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
they dont care about no trends
they dont care about songs that sell
yeah tomorrow ill be gone
so tonight everybody just sing along
raising hell with the hippies and the cowboys
outro
and ill be raising hell with the hippies and the cowboysembed"
