weather man said it’s gonna snow
by now i should be used to the cold

verse 1
midfebruary shouldn’t be so scary
it was only december
i still remember the presents the tree you and me

chorus
but you went away
how dare you
i miss you
they say i’ll be ok
but i’m not going to ever get over you

bridge
living alone here in this place
i think of you and i’m not afraid

verse 2
your favorite records make me feel better
cause you sing along
with every song
i know you didn’t mean to give them to me
see miranda lambert liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likechorus
but you went away
how dare you
i miss you
they say i’ll be ok
but i’m not going to ever get over you

break
it really sinks in you know when i see it in stone

chorus
cause you went away
how dare you
i miss you
they say i’ll be ok
but i’m not going to ever get over youembed"
