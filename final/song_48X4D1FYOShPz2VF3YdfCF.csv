i dont want to be your friend
i just want to be your lover
no matter how it ends
no matter how it starts

chorus
forget about your house of cards
and ill do mine
forget about your house of cards
and ill do mine
and fall off the table get swept under
denial denial

verse 2
the infrastructure will collapse
from voltage spikes
throw your keys in the bowl
kiss your husband goodnight

chorus
and forget about your house of cards
and ill do mine
forget about your house of cards
and ill do mine
fall off the table get swept under
denial denial
denial denial
your ears should be burning
