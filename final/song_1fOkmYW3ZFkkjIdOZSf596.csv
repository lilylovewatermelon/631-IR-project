and the peaches and the mangos
that you could sell for me

verse 1 frank ocean
what do you think my brain is made for
is it just a container for the mind
this great grey matter
sensei replied what is your woman
is she just a container for the child
that soft pink matter
cotton candy majin buu oh oh ohh
close my eyes and fall into you you you
my god shes giving me pleasure

verse 2 frank ocean
what if the sky and the stars are for show
and the aliens are watching live
from the purple matter
sensei went quiet then violent
and we sparred until we both grew tired
nothing mattered
cotton candy majin buu oh oh oh oh
dim the lights and fall into you you you
my god giving me pleasure
pleasure pleasure pleasure
pleasure over matter

hey hey
since you been gone i been having withdrawals
you were such a habit to call
i aint myself at all had to tell myself naw
she better with some fella with a regular job
i didnt wanna get her involved
by dinner mr benjamin was sitting in awe
hopped into my car drove far
fars too close and i remember my memorys no sharp
butter knife what a life anyway
im building yall a clock stop what am i hemingway
she had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
any of em that were unsouthern not me cousin
if models are made for modelin
thick girls are made for cuddlin
switch worlds and we can huddle then
who needs another friend i need to hold your hand
youd need no other man wed flee to other lands

grey matter
blue used to be my favorite color
now i aint got no choice

outro andré 3000
youre good at being bad youre bad at being good

for heavens sakes go to hell knock on wood

make her walk the mufucking plank
make her rob a mufucking bank
with no mask on and a rusty revolver286embed"
