white lips pale face
breathin in the snowflakes
burnt lungs sour taste
lights gone days end
struggling to pay rent
long nights strange men

prechorus
and they say
shes in the class a team
stuck in her daydream
been this way since eighteen
but lately her face seems
slowly sinking wasting
crumbling like pastries
and they scream
the worst things in life come free to us

chorus
cause were just under the upper hand
and go mad for a couple grams
and she dont wanna go outside tonight
and in a pipe she flies to the motherland
or sells love to another man
its too cold outside
for angels to fly
angels to fly

ripped gloves raincoat
tried to swim and stay afloat
dry house wet clothes
loose change banknotes
wearyeyed dry throat
call girl no phone

prechorus
and they say
shes in the class a team
stuck in her daydream
been this way since eighteen
but lately her face seems
slowly sinking wasting
crumbling like pastries
and they scream
the worst things in life come free to us

chorus
cause were just under the upper hand
and go mad for a couple grams
but she dont wanna go outside tonight
and in a pipe she flies to the motherland
or sells love to another man
its too cold outside
for angels to fly
bridge
an angel will die
covered in white
closed eyes and hopin for a better life
this time well fade out tonight
straight down the line

prechorus
and they say
shes in the class a team
stuck in her daydream
been this way since eighteen
but lately her face seems
slowly sinking wasting
crumbling like pastries
and they scream
the worst things in life come free to us

chorus
and were all under the upper hand
and go mad for a couple grams
and we dont wanna go outside tonight
and in a pipe we fly to the motherland
or sell love to another man
its too cold outside
for angels to fly
outro
angels to fly
fly fly
for angels to fly
to fly to fly
for angels to die197embed"
