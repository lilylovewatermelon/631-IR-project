shadows are falling and i’ve been here all day
it’s too hot to sleep and time is running away
i feel like my soul has turned into steel
i’ve still got the scars that the sun didn’t let me heal
there’s not even room enough to be anywhere

refrain
it’s not dark yet but it’s getting there

verse 2
well my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
behind every beautiful thing there’s been some kind of pain
she wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
she put down in writing what was in her mind
i just don’t see why i should even care

refrain
it’s not dark yet but it’s getting there

verse 3
well i’ve been to london and i’ve been to gay paris
i’ve followed the river and i got to the sea
i’ve been down to the bottom of a world full of lies
i ain’t lookin for nothing in anyone’s eyes
sometimes my burden is more than i can bear
see calum scott liveget tickets as low as 62you might also likerefrain
it’s not dark yet but it’s getting there

verse 4
i was born here and i’ll die here against my will
i know it looks like i’m moving but i’m standing still
every nerve in my body is so naked and numb
i can’t even remember what it was i came here to get away from
don’t even hear a murmur of a prayer

outro
and its not dark yet but its getting there
sometimes my burden is more than i can bear
and its not dark yet but its getting thereembed"
