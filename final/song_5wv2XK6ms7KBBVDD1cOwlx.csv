we dont have to know
anyone at all
anyone at all
draw the blinds back slow
sun fades in our room
two begin to bloom
silk skin lovers danced
with diamonds in their hands
diamonds in their hands
we could feel like them
rarely would we ask
of things we used to have

chorus
is that cool with you
that i wanna call your name
is that cool with you
that i wanna call your name
is that news to you
that i wanna call your name
is that cool with you
that i wanna call

verse 2
we dont have to go
anywhere at all
anywhere at all
bless our gardens growth
ivy climbs the wall
heather in the fall
you might also likesmokescreen those who stand
so righteous in our path
that never thought to ask
well define whats fair
oh baby they prefer
illusion to despair

chorus
is that cool with you
that i wanna call your name
is that cool with you
that i wanna call your name
is that news to you
that i wanna call your name
is that cool with you
that i wanna call

verse 3
i see their heads against the windows
breathing on the glass
dreaming of the day that they can finally relax
if only this normality
belonged to more than fantasy
its too much

well theyre hoping and faking
theyre curled in disdain
the flowers too tall for the table again
but its alright they called it faith
outro
is that cool with you
that i wanna call your name
is that cool with you
that i wanna call your name27embed"
