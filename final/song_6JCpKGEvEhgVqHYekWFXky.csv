verse 1
i want to tear a big hole in what is to be
to end all this infatuation with unity
im seeking my salvation alone again
i never needed to be one of you anyway

prechorus
dont want to be another player losing in this game
im trying to impress upon you were not the same
my own individuality is so unique
im one impressive motherfucker now wouldnt you say

chorus
break apart and
divide divide divide divide

you might say that im the last man standing now
and though you try youll never find a way to break me
you might say that im sick of being lost in the crowd
i hear the sirens but theyre never gonna take me

verse 2
i am little more provocative than you might need
it is your shock and then your horror on which i feed
so can you tell me what exactly does freedom mean
if im not free to be as twisted as i wanna be

im trying to impress upon you were not the same
my psychotic mentality is so unique
im one aggressive motherfucker now wouldnt you say

and though you try youll never find a way to break me
