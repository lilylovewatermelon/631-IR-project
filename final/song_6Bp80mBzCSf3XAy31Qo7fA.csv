one song
glory
one song before i go
glory
one song to leave behind

find one song
one last refrain
glory
from the pretty boy front man
who wasted opportunity
one song
he had the world at his feet
glory
in the eyes of a young girl
a young girl
find glory beyond the cheap colored lights
one song before the sun sets
glory
on another empty life

time flies
time dies
glory
one blaze of glory
one blaze of glory
glory
you might also likefind glory in a song that reigns true
truth like a blazing fire
an eternal flame
find one song
a song about love
glory
from the soul of a young man
a young man
find the one song before the virus takes hold
glory
like a sunset
one song
to redeem this empty life

time flies
and then no need to endure anymore
time diesembed"
