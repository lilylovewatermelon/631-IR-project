we did some shit that we was never posed to do
if i aint put you down you still wouldnt have a clue
they say you get around so what to me you new
just know im down for whatever you wanna do
but lately i been indecisive its probably best for you to choose
new ferrari cost an m if you want one im buying two
fell in love with stacking hundreds plus my favorite color blue
started all this shit with nothing aint no way that i can lose
if i run into the opps then we gon eat bruh say they food
hundred million dollars cash inside the room yeah thats my mood
aint seen the hood in a minute but shh im still in tune
we got sticks and wе outside i live my life likе im a goon

chorus
we fell in love with shit we never posed to love
you start acting out of character i blame it on the drugs
i gave everything i could i guess my good aint good enough
had some people fuck me over so i keep my guard up

verse 2
new ferrari got two motors gas station charge up
i remember tryna run it up to snatch a charger
i told bro to keep his prayers up know god got us
i been showing too much love if i keep going my heartll bust
they know they cant fuck with us
i see her i get a rush
dont go missing stay in touch
i wont fold or bend or break i swear im solid as they come
i am not lil dude he might be two but he cannot be one
i walk out my hand on my gun i gotta make it back to my son
dive in the endzone i cant fumble
invest a couple ms on my mama
live like jack but i dont like drama
bulletproof cadillacs like obama
they know to shoot first aint no warning
sometimes staying focusedll get boring
im tryna touch a hundred this run
bottega bomber on this shit foreign
bitches trifling niggas sniping aint no love a niggall hit your baby mama
tom ford jacket bell bottoms aint going to prom though
marble countertop to these floors im from the slum ho
i play as the glue in this shit and make sure we stick together
brodie lost his life and it inspired me to get my shit together
aint no sense in me putting time in if it dont even matter
if you dont get it you throw a fit and im starting to peep a pattern
you couldve just brushed that off you had to be dramatic
765 mclaren this aint the one they got
brabus truck at least half a ticket i got it in the projects
if anything i tried to help you i aint never try to knock you
you might also likechorus
we fell in love with shit we never posed to love
you start acting out of character i blame it on the drugs
i gave everything i could i guess my good aint good enough
had some people fuck me over so i keep my guard up

outro
bitches trifling niggas sniping aint no love a niggall hit your baby mama
tom ford jacket belt bottoms aint going to prom though
marble countertop to these floors im from the slum hoembed"
