she looked so good movin cross the dance floor
better than the day she left me
arm in arm with somebody new
holdin hands and laughin like we used to

prechorus
ive got my best smile on but its no disguise
it dont hide the pain in these eyes

chorus
i did her so wrong for so long
turned my back on her love now shes long gone
i did my part to break her heart
she walked out on me and tore my world apart
she used to be mine
oh she used to be mine

verse 2
its taken every bit of strength that i have
to keep a hurt look off my face
i cant keep from lookin back over my shoulder
at the lucky man takin my place

prechorus
oh if it werent for my pride id probably take off runnin
guess what im feelin is what i got comin

i did her so wrong for so long
turned my back on her love now shes long gone
i did my part to break her heart
she walked out on me and tore my world apart
she used to be mine
oh she used to be mine
