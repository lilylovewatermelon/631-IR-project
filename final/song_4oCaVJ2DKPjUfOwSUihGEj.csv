ive got a house in the back of my head
but i cant find a permanent resident
cause the markets down
and the areas not so good these days

ive got a watch but i dont have time
ive got a road and it leads to decadence
but a dead end sign waits down the line
i leave my footprints for the evidence

chorus
so take my life ill hand it to you
and you can try on my clothes
but you cant fill these shoes
on a silver platter your wish came true
so your heart of gold turned platinum
you can take my life oh
but you cant take it with you

verse 2
more long days and fleeting nights
i tell them wake me under flashing lights
cause im a brand name bought and sold
sold sold sold
they say a face for fame is a crying shame
because to face the crowd is to play the game
and i can play a little too rough
now and again every now and again
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likeyou drank the poison and i let you in

chorus
so take my life ill hand it to you
and you can try on my clothes
but you cant fill these shoes
on a silver platter your wish came true
so your heart of gold turned platinum
you can take my life oh
but you cant take it with you

bridge
you drank the poison and i i let you in
would you trade that heart of gold for a minute in my skin
you drank the poison and i i let you in
would you trade that heart of gold for a minute in my skin

chorus
so take my life ill hand it to you
and you can try on my clothes
but you cant fill these shoes
on a silver platter your wish came true
so your heart of gold turned platinum
you can take my life oh
but you cant take it with you1embed"
