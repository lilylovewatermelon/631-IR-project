today we live today we breathe
today we know that we are strong when we are weak
today we trust we overcome
take every chain that kept us slaves and throw em off

prechorus
were not waiting for permission
we defy our inhibition
like our middle name is fearless
unafraid

chorus
if were gonna fly we fly like eagles
arms out wide
if were gonna fear we fear no evil
we will rise
by your power we will go
by your spirit we are bold
if were gonna stand we stand as giants
if were gonna walk we walk as lions
we walk as lions

verse 2
today is ours its always been
before we face the fight
we know whos gonna win
we live by faith and not by sight
we dont want safe and quiet
we dont wanna run and hide

this is not an intermission
its our time not gonna miss it
youve already called us fearless
unafraid

chorus
if were gonna fly we fly like eagles
arms out wide
if were gonna fear we fear no evil
we will rise
by your power we will go
by your spirit we are bold
if were gonna stand we stand as giants
if were gonna walk we walk as lions
we walk as lions

bridge
oh everywhere we go
the battle has been won
we know youve gone before us
so were taking hold of faith
with every step we take
we know well rise victorious

chorus
if were gonna fly we fly like eagles
arms out wide
if were gonna fear we fear no evil
we will rise
by your power we will go
by your spirit we are bold
if were gonna stand we stand as giants
if were gonna walk we walk as lions
we walk as lions4embed"
