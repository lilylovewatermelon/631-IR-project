honestly what will become of me
dont like reality its way too clear to me
but really life is dandy
we are what we dont see
we miss everything daydreaming

verse 2
traveling i only stop at exits
wondering if ill stay stay
young and restless
living this way i stress less
i want to pull away when the dream dies
the pain sets in and i dont cry
i only feel gravity and i wonder why

well the dogs were whistling a new tune
barking at the new moon
hoping it would come soon so that they could—

barking at the new moon
hoping it would come soon so that they could—

outro
well the dogs were barking at the new moon
whistling a new tune
hoping it would come soon
and the sun was wondering if it should
stay away for a day
til the feeling went away
and the sky was falling
and the clouds were dropping
and the rain forgot how to bring salvation
the dogs were barking at the new moon
whistling a new tune
hoping it would come soon so that they could die11embed"
