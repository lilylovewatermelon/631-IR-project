so you thought it would happen
good love goodbye
i know where no one can reach you
no i dont mind

these days go by
as you turn around oh oh oh

never thought that it would mean so much
other people want to keep in touch

heaven wont keep us together
right place at the wrong time
it takes all kinds of weather
distant new skies

prechorus
somewhere no one can reach us
these days go by
as you turn around oh oh oh
