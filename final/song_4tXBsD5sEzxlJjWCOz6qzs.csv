verse 1 mike shinoda mike shinoda  chester bennington
god bless us everyone
were a broken people living under loaded gun
and it cant be outfought it cant be outdone
it cant be outmatched it cant be outrun no
god bless us everyone
were a broken people living under loaded gun
and it cant be outfought it cant be outdone
it cant be outmatched it cant be outrun no

chorus chester bennington with mike shinoda
and when i close my eyes tonight
to symphonies of blinding light
god bless us everyone
were a broken people living under loaded gun
oh like memories in cold decay
transmissions echoing away
far from the world of you and i
where oceans bleed into the sky

verse 2 chester bennington  mike shinoda
god save us everyone
will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
for the sins of our hand the sins of our tongue
the sins of our father the sins of our young no
god save us everyone
will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
for the sins of our hand the sins of our tongue
the sins of our father the sins of our young no
