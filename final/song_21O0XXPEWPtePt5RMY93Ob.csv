verse 1 mf doom
so nasty that its probably somewhat of a travesty
having me then he told the people you can call me your majesty
keep your battery charged you know it wont stick yo
and its not his fault you kick slow
shouldve let your trick ho chick hold your sick glow
plus nobody couldnt do nothin once he let the brick go
and you know i know thats a bunch of snow
the beat is so butter peep the slow cutter
as he utter the calm flow your mother— dont talk about my moms yo
sometimes he rhyme quick sometimes he rhyme slow
or vice versa whip up a slice of nice verse pie
hit it on the first try villain the worst guy
spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
shots of the scotch from out the square shot glasses
and he wont stop til he got the masses
and show em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
took a few minutes to convince the average bugaboo
its ugly like look at you its a damn shame
just remember all caps when you spell the man name

verse 2 mf doom
and you know it like a poet like baby doll
i bet she tried to say she gave me her all she played ball
all bets off the villain got the dice rigged
and they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
allegedly the investigation is still ongoing
in this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin
the pot doubles now they really got troubles
madman never go pop like snot bubblesyou might also like125embed"
