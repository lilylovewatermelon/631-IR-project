even when the sky is falling down
keep your head up
keep your head up
cause even when the sky is falling down
keep your head up
keep your head up

chorus tuka
if i’m gonna live with it
imma live it up
if i’m gonna live with it
imma live it up
and if it’s bittersweet
put some drink in a fill up cup
twist a blunt
hit ‘em with a flush
middle finger’s up

verse 1 tuka
when i a kid
just a young pup
nothing but a dumb fuck
music made my blood pump
sup mum
moving to the city
gonna be a rap star
catch me on the come up
will you miss me bummin in the backyard
done with the small town politics
done watching bogans trynna ball out
i wasn’t gonna swallow it
and holla at my homies
from the mountains
and i honour it
but once i found my path
the only option was to follow it
i used to kick a lot of nonsense
there has been a lot of progress
learn to lick my wounds
and watch the haters piss about
while i got busy on it swore
to live it down
cause honestly
i wasnt ever in it for the profit
what got me in to hiphop
was never in a wallet
still i was just a novice
you could see me at the show
front row blood nose
jump around fucking mosh pit

if i’m gonna live with it
imma live it up
if i’m gonna live with it
imma live it up
and if it’s bittersweet
put some drink in a fill up cup
twist a blunt
hit ‘em with a flush
middle finger’s up

even when the sky is falling down
keep your head up
keep your head up
cause even when the sky is falling down
keep your head up
keep your head up

verse 2 tuka
blame it on the beat
for making a man listen
blame it on the rhythm
for making him dance with it
but somebody answer this
can i bust
so ambitious that i must
and i don’t mean to vent though
but that is when the only thing
that can lend a helping hand
is a lonely stint yo
grab a pad and pen
spill that magic ink
place some ownership
on what that homie thinks
let’s go
i know you hate it when
a rapper talks bout rappin’
stock standard
jabber jaw
man i’m bored
god damn it
what happened
player i ain’t talkin’ shit
and i don’t need no audience
to help me sing my choruses but
if you gotta minute
you gotta listen if you wanna hear it
if you wanna hear it
fuck competitive competitors
they only want a competition
that’s not what i’m in it for
it’s probably why i’m gonna win it
chorus tuka x2
if i’m gonna live with it
imma live it up
if i’m gonna live with it
imma live it up
and if it’s bittersweet
put some drink in a fill up cup
twist a blunt
hit ‘em with a flush
middle finger’s up

cause even when the sky is falling down
keep your head up
keep your head up
cause even when the sky is falling down
keep your head up
keep your head upembed"
