sunday morning well soon be out on the boulevards
monday morning we have to fly back home again
while im sleeping you paint a ring on my finger with your black markerpen

im all about you youre all about me were all about each other
im all about you youre all about me were all about each other

you dont have to tell cause i know so well what we are all after
likewise if uncertainty puts a spell on me i have to zoom in your laughter your laughter
wednesday morning we sleep over and were late again
lets skip breakfast we need this precious time just to comprehend

im all about you youre all about me were all about each other
im all about you youre all about me were all about each other
im all about you youre all about me were all about each other
im all about you youre all about me were all about each other

each other each other each other each otheryou might also likeembed"
