verse 1
its alright its alright
cause the system never fails
the good guys are in power
and the bad guys are in jail
its alright its alright
just as long as we can vote
we live in democracy
and thats what we promote
isnt it isnt it ooh
isnt it isnt it ooh
its alright its alright
if the news says half the truth
hearing what we wants
the secret of eternal youth
its alright its alright
if the planet split in three
cause ill keep selling records
and youve got your mtv
you might also likechorus
if we forget about them dont worry
if they forget about us then hurry
how about the people who dont matter anymore
east timor timor timor

verse 2
its alright its alright
they dont show it all on tv
so we wont really know it
just by watching bc
its alright its alright
for our flag we die or kill
as long as we dont know it
wed do it just to pay the bills

chorus
if we forget about them dont worry
if they forget about us then hurry
how about the people who dont matter anymore
if we forget about them dont worry
if they forget about us then hurry
how about the people who dont matter anymore
east timor timor timor

bridge
lets keep tanning while its sunny
theyll risk our hides to make their money
now dont you find that funny
chorus
if we forget about them
if they forget about us then hurry
how about the people who dont matter anymore
if we forget about them dont worry
if they forget about us then hurry
how about the people who dont matter anymore
