ill unwrap the plastic cups
its just us my love
its just us my love
i will make the room up nice
put your insides all on ice
it was real true love
it was real true love

close all the windows
put signs on the handles
and strip down to my dundunduns
you have gone so far
you have gone so far
and tonight
its just me and the minibar

candles from the walmart that
every citys got to have
that i bought last night
that i bought last night
i was so excited to
do such normal things with you
when you left last night
with your toothbrush dry
you might also likeno such details will spoil my plan
that is the kind of girl i am
ha ha ha

can you hear room 318
man theyre really happening
theyre a wild bunch
theyre a wild bunch
but if they just knew
what my night was coming to
god would they vomit and run
you have gone so far
you have gone too far

so tonight
its just me and the minibar
nobody else
and i sing at the top of my lungs
happy birthday us
happy birthday us1embed"
