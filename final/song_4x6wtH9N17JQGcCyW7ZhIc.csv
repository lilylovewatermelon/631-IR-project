verse
sometimes i wonder why people act like the way they do
all the drama and changes they like to take you through
now its cool to think that youre cool with somebody
but the bottom line reality comes
no matter how bad that you think you do dawg you dont know me no
when you see me in public dont you worry about it yo its cool
ill shake your hand give mad love i aint got no beef with you no
just understand that sometimes i need my space to breathe
you probably feel the same as me if these shoes were on your feet yeah
i cant control how you feel about it
lord but all the drama i sure can do without it yes
so go on and feel the way that you want about how you think i am i am
but remember at the end of the day
im just a person like you tryna do the best that i can
and thats real

outro
yeah oh ohohoh real

i wanna thank you for letting me be myself again
i ooh i wanna thank you i wanna thank you
i wanna thank you i thank you thank you
