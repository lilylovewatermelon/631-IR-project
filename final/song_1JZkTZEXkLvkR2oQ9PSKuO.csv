daydreamer
sitting on the sea
soaking up the sun
he is a real lover
of making up the past
and feeling up his girl
like hes never felt her figure before

verse 2
a jaw dropper
looks good when he walks
is the subject of their talk
he would be hard to chase
but good to catch
and he could change the world
with his hands behind his back oh

chorus
you can find him sitting on your doorstep
waiting for a surprise
and he will feel like hes been there for hours
and you can tell that hell be there for life

verse 3
daydreamer
with eyes that make you melt
he lends his coat for shelter
plus hes there for you
when he shouldnt be
but he stays all the same
waits for you
then sees you through
see adele liveget tickets as low as 165you might also likebridge
theres no way i could describe him
what ive said is just what im hoping for

chorus
but i will find him sitting on my doorstep
waiting for a surprise
and he will feel like hes been there for hours
and i can tell that hell be there for life
and i can tell that hell be there for life17embed"
