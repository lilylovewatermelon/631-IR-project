say your kin the pen seeks ministry
god shaped hole leaves me empty
bottled friends wont bring relief
drown your voice with party

prechorus
for one and only
for one so lonely
faith creeps slowly over me

chorus
how jesus wept
he wept as he
took twelve steps
and carried me
oh how he wept
for thee
resurrection on me

verse 2
blunted thorns are soft on skin
will the weight of life lift me
hear the chatter fooling me
drown your voice with my tv

and i felt something light
a fear to abide by
i dont wanna fight
a blinding white light
and i heard a cry
and it was mine
burning to survive
