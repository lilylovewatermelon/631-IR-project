verse 1 big boi
aint it funny how youre born and then your life begins
just like a baby all alone— thats if you wasnt a twin
you must begin to fend for self when the umbilicals cut
the doctor put you under the heating lamp your spirit is touched
you know what i take that back why you was alive
date of conception interception cause the sperm did collide
from t n a to dna feelings turn to chilens
the morning after pill didnt put a halt to our very existence
we living breathing soon well be teethin
our granny got a gold and now we want one for that reason
an adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages but
parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages
cell therapists beware of this loogie that i spit
incarceration without rehabilitation really dont mean shit
lil ricky home—he gotta serve probation for six months
but uncle darnell and ol dirty bastard still in the joint

verse 2 khujo
good doesnt come without pain pain
meaning before it get better its gon get worse worse
like my homies on the sick side side stay dying over turf
that dont belong to urse i mean us us left in the dust dust
try to catch up with massah massah
i used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus esophagus of them crackers rah rah
but ephesians 612 said it wasnt flesh and blood that we wrestle against
principalities powers of this world
rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness in high places
so throw on the whole armor of righteousness
i spark this thing but my name aint bubba
i got problems with racist cab drivers like glover fuck you doing man my money good
and brothers that wax fat my money aint good fuck you man
and forget all about the struggle yeah suck my dick

verse 3 ceelo
i awaken to sunlight
thats beyond bright this day will be done right
there is a war just waiting on the other side of the door
but ill be bringing god to the gunfight
cant live forever—so have some fun right
lifes a bowl of candy—you can have one right
you can handle if tomorrow never come right
you get used to singing if only for one night
but i intend to raise two daughters and a son right
and i couldntve wrote this if i was hopeless
and see i focus to provoke this
so open wide for my opinionated opus
like playing go fish but not below this
before i go i thought that you all should know this
recognize and realize before any regretting
before you relapse perhaps youll consider resetting
hmm hmm
