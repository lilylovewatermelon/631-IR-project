ive sung the blues for every broken heart in here
time to light up this joint
with some boogie woogie feelings move your hips
i too felt love and now it leaves
just to come back knocking at my door and make me bleed again

chorus
feel the chain no longer holds
finding yourself or you find that soul
feel the chain no longer holds
reaching for answers that no one knows

verse 2
should we spend each day like its the last day of our lives
yeah why not be a king for a day ill make you queen
and see how long it shines
life aint always what it seems
so grab it by the balls and do your best before it leaves

chorus
feel the chain no longer holds
finding yourself or you find that soul
feel the chain no longer holds
reaching for answers that no one knows
you might also likepostchorus
feel the chain no longer holds
finding yourself or you find that soul

outro
in the rearview mirror only desert and storm
towards the sunsetembed"
