well the best friend that a man can have is jesus
and the worst one he can have is named jim beam
one of them just makes me as mean as a striped snake
and the other one has washed my spirit clean

chorus
and they cant coexist forever i knew that from the start
one lives in my bloodstream and the others in my heart
and the one thats in my bloodstream keeps me in the shape im in
and thе one thats in my heart has washed mе clean of all my sin
all my sin yeah

verse 2
well i aint no stranger to a barstool
and i aint no stranger to a pew
one of them has cost me a good chunk of my time
and the other one has made my spirit new

chorus
and they cant coexist forever i knew that from the start
one lives in my bloodstream and the others in my heart
and the one thats in my bloodstream keeps me in the shape im in
and the one thats in my heart has washed me clean of all my sin
all my sin
