cold am i
im beside myself
because theres no one else
have i grown
so blind
only god could save you
if you knew your way to the light

prechorus
so fly away
and leave it behind
just stay awake
theres nowhere to hide

chorus
i see you cause you wont get out of my way
i hear you cause you wont quit screaming my name
i feel you cause you wont stop touching my skin
i need you theyre coming to take you away

verse 2
frail and dry
i could lose it all
but i cannot recall it all
wrong dont cry
clear away this hate
and we can start to make it all right
prechorus
so fly away
and leave it behind
return someday
with red in your eyes

chorus
i see you cause you wont get out of my way
i hear you cause you wont quit screaming my name
i feel you cause you wont stop touching my skin
i need you theyre coming to take you away

chorus
i see you cause you wont get out of my way
i hear you cause you wont quit screaming my name
i feel you cause you wont stop touching my skin
i need you theyre coming to take you awaysee breaking benjamin liveget tickets as low as 117you might also like5embed"
