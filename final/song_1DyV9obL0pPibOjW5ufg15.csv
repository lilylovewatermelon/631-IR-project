with you with you
i wish we had another time i wish we had another place

verse 1
now romeo and juliet
bet they never felt the way we felt
bonnie and clyde never had to hide like we do we do
you and i both know it cant work
its all fun and games til someone gets hurt
and i dont i wont let that be you

prechorus
now you dont wanna let go and i dont wanna let you know
that there might be something real between us two who knew
now we dont want to fall but were tripping in our hearts
and its reckless and clumsy
cause i know you cant love me here

chorus
i wish we had another time i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and theres nothing my heart can do can do
to fight with time and space
cause im still stuck in the moment with you

like sonny and cher i dont care ive got you baby
see we both fighting every inch of our fiber
cause aint no way its going to end right but we are both too foolish to stop

prechorus
now you dont wanna let go and i dont wanna let you know
there might be something real between us two who knew

cause i know you cant love me here

chorus
i wish we had another time i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment

cause im still stuck in the moment with you

bridge
you see like just because this cold cruel world saying we cant be
baby we both have the right to disagree
and i aint with it
and i dont want to be so old and grey reminiscing bout these better days
but conventions telling us to let go
so well never know
breakdown
i wish we had another time i wish we had another place
cause everything we did and everything we have is stuck in the moment yeah

chorus
i wish we had another time i wish we had another place
but everything we have is stuck in the moment
and theres nothing my heart can do nothing my heart can do
to fight with time and space and space
cause im still stuck in the moment with you
