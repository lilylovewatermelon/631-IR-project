hypocrites

verse 1
weeping rose of jeremiah
drops of blood drip off your petals
representing all our tears
in a ring of burning metal

how you wanna be
what you gonna say it
it doesnt bother me
who you gonna pay

sorcerers and sadists come
to define the what and why
people travel cross this earth
over water land and sky
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likehow you wanna be
what you gonna say it
it doesnt bother me
who you gonna pay

prechorus
pay the ferryman pay the fucking driver
pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars
pay the bitches theyre charging all their dates stand by
im not gonna pay its already mine

chorus

verse 2
weeping rose of jeremiah
purity unlike no other
offers hope to those who need it
dont forget care to thy brother
how you wanna be
what you gonna say it
it doesnt bother me
who you gonna pay

little old lady at home
writing out a check to send
its all the money that she owns
she believes the world might end

how you wanna be
what you gonna say it
it doesnt bother me
who you gonna pay

prechorus
pay the ferryman pay the fucking driver
pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars
pay the bitches theyre charging all their dates stand by
im not gonna pay its already mine
