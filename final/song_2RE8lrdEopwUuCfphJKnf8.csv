guns drawn slow down
its a battle over something stupid
theyre all the rage right now
you dont know the truth
its a battle that i think im winning
something makes me think you think that too

prechorus
i was trying to be honest
you dont make that easy to do

chorus
its not that important
its none of your concern
but you got angry
and said some angry words
its not that i hate you
i hate that it hurt
theres nothing else to it
i cant do anything more mm

verse 2
sharp knife loaded gun
there are two ways we can do this
i know which would be more fun
i wont go first wont apologize
pretty sure that its an ego thing
but i cant stand a compromise
