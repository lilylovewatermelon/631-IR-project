verse 1
cold and black inside this coffin
cause you all try to keep me down
how it feels to be forgotten
but youll never forget me now

prechorus
enemies clawing at my eyes i
scratch and bleed just to stay alive yeah
the zombies come out at night
theyll never catch me
theyll never catch me

chorus
light it up light it up now im burning
feel the rush feel the rush of adrenaline
we are young we are strong we will rise
cause im back back back from the dead tonight
to the floor to the floor hit the red line
flying high flying high at the speed of light
full of love full of light full of fight
cause im back back back from the dead tonight
