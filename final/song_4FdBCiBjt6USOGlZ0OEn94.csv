verse 1 cassie
did you really think that you would keep this secret from me
when i know you like the back of my hand come on now
i can tell when youre on the low tryna hide something
tryna hide something you cant hide nothing
i been watching you for a minute i already know
what youre doing you cant hide it from me come on now
i can tell when youre on the low tryna hide something
tryna hide something you cant hide nothing
