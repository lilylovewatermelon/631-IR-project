i paid my dues now im really on
prince to the sea put my city on

everything clean like my chicken bones
i work hard i work hard for it
had to go back to the chalkboard
we was tourin countries all foreign

so say whats up to my haters at the club tonight
ill be busy singing my daughter lullabies
when she sleep i hit the booth and get super lit
living my dreams i can sleep in another life
living my dreams i can sleep in another life yeah
the tensions so thick you can cut with a butter knife yeah
