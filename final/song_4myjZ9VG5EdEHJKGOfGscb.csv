and happiness is just an illusion
and your world around is tumbling down

and you feel the world has grown cold
and youre drifting out all on your own
and you need a hand to hold

darling reach out

ill be there to love and comfort you
ill be there with a love that will see you through

i can tell the way you hang your head
youre without love and now youre afraid
and through your tears you look around
but theres no peace of mind to be found
i know what youre thinking
without love and now youre alone
