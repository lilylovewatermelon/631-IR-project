hammerin a nail stackin them bales
im dog tired by the 5 oclock hour
but im ready to raise some hell
and jesses gettin ready im gassin up the chevy
im gonna pick her up at six
i hope shes gonna wear the jeans with the tear
that her mama never fixed

chorus
the moon comes up and the sun goes down
we find a little spot on the edge of town
twist off sip a little pass it around
dance in the dust turn the radio up
and that fireball whiskey whispers
temptation in my ear
its a feelin alright saturday night
and thats how we do it round here
yeah thats how we do it round here

verse 2
mud on the grips wild cherry on her lips
ive been workin and tryin and flirtin and dyin
for an all night kinda kiss
and country on the boombox candles on the tool box
im doin everything right got the country boy charm
