verse 1 drake
uh you getting ready so i know we gon be here awhile
in the bathroom flat irons and nail files
spending hours in salons on your hairstyle
in the mall steady racking up the air miles
hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
you say you droppin 10 pounds preparin for summer
and you dont do it for the man men never notice
you just do it for yourself you the fucking coldest
intelligent too ooh you my sweetheart
ive always liked my women book and street smart
long as they got a lil class like half days
and the confidence to overlook my past ways
time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
but they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
and look i really think nobody does it better
i love the way that you put it together uh

verse 2 ti
well arent you a breath of fresh air
from all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
they get a baller figure they aint got to pick a career
guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
like “voilà” you do it right he just might buy you a car
man she play these suckers just like bob play the guitar
now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
i say im buying you decline that is kinda bizarre
independent with the demeanor of an rb singer
naked ring finger m3 bimmer
champagne range triplewhite jag
closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
alexander mcqueen prada gucci chanel
dg bcbg versace louis and bebe
you aint needy greedy or easy as these other breezys
who fuck for bottles of riesling and bowls of baked ziti

verse 3 drake
uh 5 and a half in boys ass is off the hook
cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
and when i find it is when i find you
and we can do the things we never got the time to
better late than never but never late is better
they tell me time is money well well spend it together
im down for whatever you just lead the way
we go to dinner you dont even look at me to pay
mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
and jason had this girl tammy with a purple bentley
how she got it i aint never get to ask
i just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
yeah but shout out to the homeowners
the girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
a little something extra should we ever need it
if it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it
