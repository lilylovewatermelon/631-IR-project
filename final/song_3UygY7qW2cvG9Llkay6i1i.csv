now i will tell you what ive done for you
fifty thousand tears ive cried
screaming deceiving and bleeding for you
and you still wont hear me going under

verse 2
dont want your hand this time ill save myself
maybe ill wake up for once wake up for once
not tormented daily defeated by you
just when i thought id reached the bottom

prechorus
im
dying again

chorus
im going under going under
drowning in you drowning in you
im falling forever falling forever
ive got to break through
im going under

verse 3
blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
so i dont know whats real
so i dont know whats real and whats not
dont know whats real and whats not
always confusing the thoughts in my head oh
so i cant trust myself anymore
