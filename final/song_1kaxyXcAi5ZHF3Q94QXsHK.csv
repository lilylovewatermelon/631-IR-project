sleepin with the enemy my demons are too intimate
shes sleepin very gently so now theyre startin to enter it
and now theyre startin to mentor me geekin’ like brittany
tweakin my energy eat and die sympathy
scream and cry infamy come alive mentally
and love die physically my love cry miserably
hugs gettin looser her tongue tied kissin me
she fucked thy niggas see now they both iggin me
but demons got dignity demons got memories
i had a lil revenge in me so now im at sentencin
bout to stop gigglin and dinner start sizzlin
