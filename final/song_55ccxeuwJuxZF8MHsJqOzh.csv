we took a uturn down on 42nd street
almost hit another car
spilled my coffee on my jeans and i said
aw theyre ruined now
she said
naw theyre better now its just a matter of perspective
she kissed my cheek
its the little imperfections that make em unique
i dont know how she does it but she could

chorus
see the stars in the city
she sees a diamond when the world sees dust
finds the glitter in the gritty
i know i aint much but
that girl sees something nobody else can see
maybe she sees something in me
if she could see the stars in the city

verse 2
the more i hang with her the more i realize
there can be beauty in the broken if you open up your mind
she says thinks like
aint this rain nice and
dont sad songs make you smile
well if shes crazy
i wanna be crazy too
shes the kinda girl that can break up a band
i wanna see the way that she can
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likechorus
see the stars in the city
she sees a diamond when the world sees dust
finds the glitter in the gritty
i know i aint much but
that girl sees something nobody else can see
maybe she sees something in me
if she could see the stars in the city

that girl sees something nobody else can see
maybe she sees something in me
if she could see the stars in the city
in the city

chorus
see the stars in the city
the stars in the city
she sees a diamond when the world sees dust
finds the glitter in the gritty
so pretty she can break your heart
yeah she sees the stars in the city

outro
in the city
she sees the stars in the city
