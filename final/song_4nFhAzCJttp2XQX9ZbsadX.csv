good morning dont you let it pass you by
we laugh we cry and then we dry our eyes
we fall we rise ready for another try

when life gets tough remember we were never born to die
when times get tough remember we were born to be alive

good morning wake up and live the life
and dont forget to dream the dreams the dreams
and dont forget to live the dreams and dream
and dont forget to dream the wonderful thingsyou might also like1embed"
