tell my niggas quit the bitchin we gon make it in a second

swagger so impressive and i dont need a necklace
but these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7

raf simons rick owens usually what im dressed in
blowing blunts rolling doobies up smoking sections
groupies rush hold they boobies up in my direction
quit with all the fronting you aint round my clique for nothing
cause our presence is a present just to kick it is a blessing
