ah ah yeah
uhhuh

verse 1
staring in the mirror as i
start to carefully contemplate
just really how deep is this thing i have for you
its wearin on my heart
and from the start you know i tried steadily deny
friendship turned to love
i know you probably think that im so strange
stuttering on every word when you look my way oh why
and maybe its all in my mind
but when we hugged goodbye butterflies
i just died yeah yeah yeah yeah

chorus
i just died in your arms tonight
dont want nobody bring me back to life
i just died in your arms tonight hey
i just died in your arms
i just died in your arms tonight tonight listen

verse 2
your fingers hushed my lips
as i try to explain maybe why you and i
should hide from such a love affair
my friends think that im so insane
to fight this feeling
but my lifes at stake
your embrace thoughts wont erase your embrace thoughts wont erase
every hour minute of the day im waiting hope and pray
that you might stay
and now youre movin oh so closely
killin me so softly so softly
i just died
