you make me dizzy runnin circles in my head
one of these days ill chase you down
well look whos goin crazy now
were face to face my friend
better get out better get out

chorus
you know you make me break out
make me break out
i dont wanna look like that
i dont wanna look like that
you know you make me break out
make me break out
i dont wanna look like that
i dont wanna look like that
you know you make me break out

bridge
you can see this on my face its all for you
the more and more i take i break right through
and therapy still scares me put me on my back again

verse 2
i may be crazy little frayed around the ends
one of these days ill phase you out
burn it in the blast off burn it in the blast off
watchin me crawl away
try to get out try to get out
