its probably whats best for you
i only want the best for you
and if im not the best then youre stuck
i tried to sever ties and i ended up with wounds to bind
like youre pouring salt in my cuts

chorus
and i just ran out of bandaids
i dont even know where to start
cause you can bandage the damage
you never really can fix a heart

verse 2
even though i know whats wrong
how could i be so sure if you never say what you feel feel
i mustve held your hand so tight
you didnt have the will to fight
i guess you needed more time to heal

chorus
baby i just ran out of bandaids
i dont even know where to start
cause you can bandage the damage
you never really can fix a heart
