there’s been a miracle
i’m living proof
cause i was dead in the spiritual
but i walked out the tomb
i’ve been raised to life
by the power of christ
that amazing grace has made me brand new

chorus
so if you’re looking for the old me brother
he’s not here
i heard that resurrection calling for me
loud and clear
now i’m wide awake
check that empty grave
if you’re looking looking for the old me
he’s not here
no hes not here

verse 2
now listen
it’s unbelievable
this love i’ve found
that forgave this criminal
and tore the prison down
i’ve moved past the past
i’m free at last
hallelujah nothings holding me down

so if you’re looking for the old me brother
he’s not here
i heard that resurrection calling for me
loud and clear
now i’m wide awake
check that empty grave
if you’re looking looking for the old me
he’s not here

bridge
hallelujah christ is risen
left the tomb and took me with him
he’s not here
brought my soul from grave to glory
i’m alive like sunday morning
he’s not here
hallelujah christ is risen
left the tomb and took me with him
he’s not here
brought my soul from grave to glory
i’m alive like sunday morning
he’s not here

chorus
so if you’re looking for the old me brother
