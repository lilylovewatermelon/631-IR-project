a 40 hp johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
coke cans and bb guns barbed wire and old fence posts
8point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
one arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

chorus
some things just go better together and probably always will
like a cup of coffee and a sunrise sunday drives and time to kill
whats the point of this ol guitar if it aint got no strings
or pourin your heart into a song that you aint gonna sing
its a match made up in heaven like good ol boys and beer
and me as long as youre right here

verse 2
your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
your lipsticks stained every coffee cup that i got in this house
the way you say i love you too is like rain on an old tin roof
and your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

chorus
some things just go better together and probably always will
like a cup of coffee and a sunrise sunday drives and time to kill
whats the point of this ol guitar if it aint got no strings
or pourin your heart into a song that you aint gonna sing
its a match made up in heaven like good ol boys and beer
and me as long as youre right here
see luke combs liveget tickets as low as 33you might also likebridge
sometimes were oil and water
but i wouldnt have it any other way
and if im being honest
your first and my last name

chorus
would just sound better together and probably always will
like a cup of coffee and a sunrise sunday drives and time to kill
whats the point of this ol guitar if it aint got no strings
or pourin your heart into a song that you aint gonna sing
its a match made up in heaven like good ol boys and beer
and me as long as youre right here
and me as long as youre right here18embed"
