you could have told me you was the cheating kind
id be out on the town running around
seeing what else i could find
instead of sitting here without you
and with you on my mind

im all alone in the night
and i know you aint coming back to me
theres a moon over me so bright
it lights up my sorrow for everyone to see

you could have told me you didnt care about me
you could have told me you was the cheating kind
id be out on the town running around
seeing what else i could find
instead of sitting here without you
and with you on my mind

dont have to tell nobody how im feeling
dont have to tell nobody how i cry
its written on my face cause i know youre out there stealing
all them sweet sweet kisses from all them other guysyou might also likeembed"
