im growing so distant
nothing makes sense to me anymore
im learning to resist
becoming more than you ever were

cant explain whats come over me
come over me
cant explain why its so hard for me
so hard to see your side

the walls are closing in
i dare you to walk in my shoes

cant explain whats come over me
come over me
cant explain why its so hard for me
so hard to see your side
