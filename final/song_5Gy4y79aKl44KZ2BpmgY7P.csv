i made my share of empty promises
not like you care anymore
i wish you did but ive done all i can do
baby i aint gonna chase you out that door

verse 2
if you dont know by now that youre the one i love
clearly we were never meant to be
if youll take the words out of someone elses mouth
before you take mine well i got nothin left to say

chorus
oh ill stand alone
it wont be the first time or the last time that im gonna make it on my own
oh ill stand alone
dont be sorry dont call me cause i wont pick up the phone
im standin alone

verse 3
just the other day drivin down the highway
seen a chevrolet reminded me of you
i almost called but im sure glad i didnt
i just shook it off and drank some mountain dew
you always said that it was bad for my health
well baby you can go to hell
see morgan wallen liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likechorus
while i stand alone
it wont be the first time or the last time that im gonna make it on my own
oh ill stand alone
dont be sorry dont call me cause i wont pick up the phone
im standin alone

bridge
the waves will crash and the winds will blow
but ill be standin here on my tip toes

chorus
oh ill stand alone
it wont be the first time or the last time that im gonna make it on my own
oh ill stand alone
dont be sorry dont call me cause i wont pick up the phone
im standin alone
im standin alone
im standin alone
standin aloneembed"
