yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah

verse 1
when i was a young buck
i tried to be liked by
everyone
everyone
i tried so hard to be funny and nice
i tried so hard to be sugar and spice
didnt work for me
got old quickly
but now im not losing sleep at night
cause no ones calling me on the telephone
to see if im at home
cause now ive got everything that i have ever wanted
or so it seems
yeah so it seems yeah

chorus
you dont have to like me anymore
i got money now
i dont care what you say about me anymore
i got money now
see pnk liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likeverse 2
but when i got a little older i realized its all lies
there is no prize
there is no prize
there is no heartache if you can afford
everything delivered right to your door
responsibilities
this life is easy
so now the girl with everything
how could she complain
cause shes got it made
yeah shes got it made
i dont need to be tucked in at night
and told that everything is gonna be alright
is gonna be alright
cause i dont have to fight

chorus
you dont have to like me anymore
i got money now
i dont care what you say about me anymore
i got money now

verse 3
i wouldnt trade a dollar for some sense
i wouldnt trade a lifetime for some friends
cause ive got everything
and all is what it seems
i worked so hard all of my life
just to have things i could call mine
so i dont need no love
cause i have got enough
so now i dont mind being alone all the time
its alright
cause i got money now
thats what its all about
and im so busy buyin things and traveling the world
i dont have time for friends
or family
and thats fine with me
or so it seems
chorus
you dont have to like me anymore
i got money now oh
i dont care what you say about me anymore
i got money now yeah
you dont have to like me anymore anymore
i got money now i got money now
i dont care what you say about me anymore
cause i got money nowembed"
