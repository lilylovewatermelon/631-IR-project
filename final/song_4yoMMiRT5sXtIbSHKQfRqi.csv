my own reflections making me sick
ive been this way since my faith quit

its making me colder oh

is this heartache we could fix
in the morning when we wake
when im sober would you stay
if i broke it would you quit
is this heartache we could fix
in the morning when we wake
when im sober

chorus
please just go easy on me baby
go easy on me baby
can you understand it
i cant keep living for the damage
please just go easy on me baby
go easy on me baby
can you understand it
i cant keep living for the damage oh
