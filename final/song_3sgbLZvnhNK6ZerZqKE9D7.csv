lost in stereo lost in stereo

verse 1
she works for the weekend mixtape of her favorite bands
tearing up the radio lost in the stereos sound
shes trouble in a tanktop pretty little timebomb
blowing up  take you down
living in the radio lost in the stereos sound

chorus
shes dancing alone im ready to go but shes so
lost in stereo lost in stereo
shes outta control so beautiful
in stereo lost in stereo
and ive been waiting for so long but shell never know
im losing hope cause shes so
lost in stereo lost in stereo
lost in stereo lost in stereo

verse 2
shakedown on a saturday
sit back gotta catch my breath
cause every time i see her
know shes gonna take it back somehow
tattoos and a switchblade attitude
snakebite heart with a bubblegum smile
sex in stereo dont turn the radio dial
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likechorus
shes dancing alone im ready to go but shes so
lost in stereo lost in stereo
shes out of control so beautiful
in stereo lost in stereo
and ive been waiting for so long but shell never know
im losing hope cause shes so
lost in stereo lost in stereo

bridge
and im just like cellophane
cause she sees right through me
i know shes glitter and gold
and thats just the price i pay
when i dont even know her name
shes slipping away

verse 3
she works for the weekend mixtape of her favorite bands
tearing up the radio lost in the stereos sound

chorus
shes dancing alone im ready to go but shes so
lost in stereo lost in stereo
shes out of control so beautiful
in stereo lost in stereo
and ive been waiting for so long but shell never know
im losing hope cause shes so
lost in stereo lost in stereo
shes dancing alone im ready to go but shes so
lost in stereo lost in stereo
shes out of control so beautiful
