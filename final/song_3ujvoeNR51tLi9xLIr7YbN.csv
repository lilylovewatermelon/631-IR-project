jack frost nipping at your nose
yuletide carols being sung by a choir
and folks dressed up like eskimos

everybody knows a turkey and some
mistletoe help to make the season bright
tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
will find it hard to sleep tonight

they know that santas on his way
hes loaded lots of toys and goodies
on his sleigh
and evry mothers
child is gonna spy to see if
reindeer really know how to fly

and so im offering this
simple phrase to kids from
one to ninetytwo
altho its been said many times
many ways
merry christmas to youyou might also likeembed"
