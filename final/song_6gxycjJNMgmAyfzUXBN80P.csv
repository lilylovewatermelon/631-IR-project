did i disappoint you or let you down
should i be feeling guilty or let the judges frown
cause i saw the end before wed begun
yes i saw you were blinded and i knew i had won

verse 2
so i took whats mine by eternal right
took your soul out into the night
it may be over but it wont stop there
i am here for you if youd only care

prechorus
you touched my heart you touched my soul
you changed my life and all my goals
and love is blind but that i knew when
my heart was blinded by yours
ive kissed your lips and held your hand
shared your dreams and shared your bed
i know you well i know your smell
ive been addicted to you

chorus
goodbye my lover goodbye my friend
you have been the one you have been the one for me
goodbye my lover goodbye my friend
you have been the one you have been the one for me

i am a dreamer and when i wake
you cant break my spirit  its my dreams you take
and as you move on remember me
remember us and all we used to be

prechorus
ive seen you cry ive seen you smile
ive watched you sleeping for a while
id be the father of your child
id spend a lifetime with you
i know your fears and you know mine
weve had our doubts but now were fine
and i love you i swear thats true
i cannot live without you

chorus
goodbye my lover goodbye my friend
you have been the one you have been the one for me
goodbye my lover goodbye my friend
you have been the one you have been the one for me

bridge
and i still hold your hand in mine
in mine when im asleep
and i will bare my soul in time
when im kneeling at your feet
chorus
goodbye my lover goodbye my friend
you have been the one you have been the one for me
goodbye my lover goodbye my friend
you have been the one you have been the one for me
