its hard for me to say the things i want to say sometimes
theres no one here but you and me and that broken old street light
lock the doors well leave the world outside
all ive got to give to you are these five words tonight

chorus
thank you for loving me
for being my eyes when i couldnt see
for parting my lips when i couldnt breathe
thank you for loving me
thank you for loving me

verse 2
i never knew i had a dream until that dream was you
when i look into your eyes the skys a different blue
cross my heart i wear no disguise
if i tried youd make believe that you believed my lies

chorus
thank you for loving me
for being my eyes when i couldnt see
for parting my lips when i couldnt breathe
thank you for loving me

you pick me up when i fall down
you ring the bell before they count me out
if i was drowning you would part the sea
and risk your own life to rescue me yeah
