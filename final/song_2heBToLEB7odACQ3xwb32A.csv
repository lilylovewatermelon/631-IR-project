well he came from northern ireland
searching for the free mans ground
and he came to bet his fortune
on a west virginia plow
he built a house of timber
and raised a redhead son
then they worked the land together
and prayed the rain would come

chorus
theres a scarecrow in the garden
that looks like lucifer
and ive been reading revelations
with my bare feet in the dirt

verse 2
well the redhead son got older
and took a brown eyed wife
and the fields were green as dollars
cause the dirt was black as night
i came in late september
the youngest one of three
and my sisters off and married
so the land was left to me

theres a scarecrow in the garden
that looks like lucifer
and ive been reading revelations
with my bare feet in the dirt

bridge
i know every single fencepost
every rock that goes around
ive been staring at the red oak
where i know theyll lay me down

verse 3
the fields aint what they once were
the rains just seem to flood
and ive been thinking about that river
wondering how it turned to blood

outro
ive been sitting here all morning
i was sitting here all night
theres a bible in my left hand
and a pistol in my right2embed"
