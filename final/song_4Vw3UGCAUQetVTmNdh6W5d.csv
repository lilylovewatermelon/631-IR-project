broke down thought that i would drown
hope that id be found fore i hit the ground
some days out the corner of my eye hey
saw you weeping saw you creeping
saw you sneaking in the shadows long
the fear so strong
saw you out the corner of my eye

prechorus
dont come for me today reaper

dont come for me today reaper

chorus
you came to take me away
so close i was to heavens gates
but no baby no baby not today
oh you tried to track me down
you followed me like the darkest cloud
but no baby no baby not today
but no baby no baby not today reaper

feel the wind in my hair hear the ocean sing
i got good things to feel in my life yeah
