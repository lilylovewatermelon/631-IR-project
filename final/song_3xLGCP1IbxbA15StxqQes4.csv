youre a modern day miracle
anything but a typical girl
mona lisa on a sidewalk stand
superstar in a common man world
nothings been so beautiful

chorus
want to stop and ask your name
take a picture of your pretty face
shot to heaven steal a kiss
leave the world at your throne
i want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
but instead i catch my breath shake my head and i walk on

verse 2
i know ive seen you somewhere before
in my mind behind door number 3
youre a pray youre a gift from god
but theres a bridge i cannot cross
it seems your distant dream
i will never hold you

chorus
want to stop and ask your name
take a picture of your pretty face
shot to heaven steal a kiss
leave the world at your throne
i want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
but instead i catch my breath shake my head and i walk on
see billy currington liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likebridge
i put one foot in front of another
i walk on
knowing there will never be another

chorus
want to stop and ask your name
take a picture of your pretty face
shot to heaven steal a kiss
leave the world at your throne
i want to beg you to be mine for the rest of both our lives
but instead i catch my breath shake my head and i walk onembed"
