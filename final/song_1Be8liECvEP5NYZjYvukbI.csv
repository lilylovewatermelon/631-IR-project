appreciate your call
means a lot and all
yeah i got a minute
you and me can talk
about anything you want
long as she aint in it

verse 2
say its been at least a month
since ive had any fun
buddy ill admit it
yeah im into going out
think im ready for a crowd
long as she aint in it

chorus
dont wanna hear her name
i dont wanna see her face i swear
i know its gonna hurt
if i run into her somewhere

verse 3
we could hit that place
down by the interstate
out past the city limits
hang out all night long
hear a country song
long as she aint in it
see jon pardi liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likechorus
dont wanna hear her name
i dont wanna see her face i swear
i know its gonna hurt
if i run into her somewhere

outro
i can drink and i can dance
i can party i can laugh
but no matter how you spin it
everything has changed
my life wont be the same
as long as she aint in it
as long as she aint in it
no mmembed"
