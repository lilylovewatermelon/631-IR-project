you learn a couple things when you get to my age
like friends dont lie and it all tastes the same in the dark
when your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times
youre getting spiritually enlightened at twentynine

chorus
so just give yourself a try
wont you give yourself a try
wont you give yourself a try
wont you give

verse 2
i found a grey hair in one of my zoots
like context in a modern debate i just took it out
the only apparatus required for happiness is your pain and fucking going outside
and getting stds at twentyseven really isnt the vibe
jane took her own life at sixteen
she was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm
and i was twentyfive and afraid to go outside
a millennial that baby boomers like

chorus
wont you give yourself a try
wont you give yourself a try
wont you give yourself a try
wont you give
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likeverse 3
and what would you say to your younger self
growing a beards quite hard and whiskey never starts to taste nice
and youll make a lot of money and its funny
cause youll move somewhere sunny and get addicted to drugs
and spend obscene amounts on fucking seeds and beans online

chorus
so just give yourself a try
wont you give yourself a try
wont you give yourself a try
wont you give73embed"
