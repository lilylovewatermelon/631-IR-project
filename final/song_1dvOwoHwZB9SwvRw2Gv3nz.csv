verse 1 yukimi nagano
waitin by the mailbox by the train
passin by the hills til i hear the name
im looking for a saw to cut the chains in half and all i want is
someone to rely on as thunder comes arolling down
someone to rely on as the lightning comes astaring in again

verse 2 2d
ill wait to be forgiven maybe i never will
my star has left me to take the bitter pill
that shattered feeling well the cause of its a lesson learned
just dont know if i could roll into the sea again
just dont know if i could do it all again she saidâ€”its true

verse 3 yukimi nagano
waiting in my room and i lock the door
i watch the coloured animals across the floor
and im looking from a distance and im listening to the whispers
and oh it aint the same when youre falling out of feeling
and youre falling in and caught again
cauauauaught again

verse 4 2d
im caught again in the mystery
youre by my side but are you still with me
the answers somewhere deep in it im sorry that youre feeling it
but i just have to tell you that i love you so much these days
have to tell you that i love you so much these days its true

my heart is in economy
due to this autonomy im just
rolling in and caught again
cauauauaught again
cauauauaught again
cauauauaught agaiain
cauauauaught again my heart is in economy
due to this autonomy im just cauauauaught again
rolling in and caught again
cauauauaught again
