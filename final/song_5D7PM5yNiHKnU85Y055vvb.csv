i need to lean on a truck with five old friends
tell old lies and then tell em again
ride 33 til it hits the river
throw cans in the bed til the moons just a sliver
wanna see my name on a dive bar wall
where the ceilings aint but the beers are tall
theres something bout a city like this
makes me miss what i grew up with

chorus
rednecks red letters red dirt
one light one bar one church
where the lord gеts thanked and the shine gеts drank
while an out back brush pile burns
yeah ive been away way too long
but tonight im headed back home
cause when i need to find me
theres only three things thatll work
rednecks red letters red dirt

verse 2
i need to hear mama pray til the rolls get cold
for them hometown folks that she says i know
my souls a little dirty cause my boots are too clean
its been too long since ive seen
