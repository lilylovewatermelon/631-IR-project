ive been burnin yes ive been burnin
such a burden this flame on my chest
no insurance to pay for the damage
yeah ive been burnin up since you left

verse 1
ive been smokin oh more than twenty a day
blame it on rebellion dont blame it on me
wish i was younger back to the nineteenth of may
i had an open mind swore to never change

prechorus
funny how time goes by
had respect for myself that river ran dry
you reached a limit i wasnt enough
its like the fire replaced all the love

chorus
ive been burnin yes ive been burnin
such a burden this flame on my chest
no insurance to pay for the damage
yeah ive been burnin up since you left

verse 2
oh if you ever called i will run straight back
give you my forgiveness and the shirt off my back
no friends to turn to yeah i messed up that
wish we could smoke again just for a day oh
