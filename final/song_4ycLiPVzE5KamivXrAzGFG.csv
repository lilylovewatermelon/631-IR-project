lyrics


i got credit cards like fraud now
you dont know how far i came
went from serving rerock
to that pure cocaine
x2

every verse got caution tape
looking for your body
but your body in the lake
look me up on instagram
cuz im bout to drop a tape
stone cold with a toe tag just in case
cant identify his face
check his molars check for tattoos
but his tattoos from a gang
swastikas and german ranks
this the new world order i aint say this shit was safe
i aint say this shit is plain but i fly like every day
and i keep my mary jane she keep me high like every day
she my wedding ring twin flame namaste
married to the game
married to the fame andele
never change
married to that og kush im married to a strain
smoking wiz khalifa i got cookies on my brain
you might also like
i got credit cards like fraud now
you dont know how far i came
went from serving rerock
to that pure cocaine
x2


smoking on mike tyson like im trippin on that toad
this some real lsd i dont got no nbomes
she wanna bone
blow me like a trombone
and if that pussy really good i might buy the bitch a home
but if she hate turn fake imma leave the snake alone
medusa only got power if she see you from her clothes
our sex feel like a saxophone
went from rage to riches i found nemo
fish scale chips on my shoulder but they doritos
young hero my problems zero
i walk the block like d bo
fuck you ceelo
green to black thats how it be tho

acting like my senior year

im like popeye with the spinach
when i pop a top and burn
i been stacking up my lettuce
i been growing like a fern
x2
still not so dramatic but i really like to start shit
stars in my ceiling when we just pull up i dont park bitch

came up serving white girl in apartments
now im smoking joker like a card trick
rosin in my cartridge
i just concentrate on moon rocks im a star bitch
im 25 and every day is christmas like a partridge
white trash competition i take out the garbage

star ship
i be flying like im kirk
cobain came back
death dont hurt

when you walk through a door do you think bout where you were
no i focus on my target practice like im shopping for a shirt


i got credit cards like fraud now
you dont know how far i came
went from serving rerock
to that pure cocaine
