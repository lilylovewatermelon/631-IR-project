you and me we made a vow
for better or for worse
i cant believe you let me down
but the proofs in the way it hurts
for months on end ive had my doubts
denyin every tear
i wish this would be over now
but i know that i still need you here

chorus
and you say im crazy
cause you dont think i know what youve done
but when you call me baby
i know im not the only one

verse 2
youve been so unavailable
now sadly i know why
your heart is unobtainable
even though lord knows you kept mine

chorus
and you say im crazy
cause you dont think i know what youve done
but when you call me baby
i know im not the only one

youve made me realise my deepest fear
by lyin and tearin us up

chorus
and you say im crazy
cause you dont think i know what youve done
but when you call me baby

but when you call me baby
i know im not the only one
