nice to meet you where you been
i could show you incredible things
magic madness heaven sin
saw you there and i thought
oh my god look at that face
you look like my next mistake
loves a game wanna play ayy
new money suit and tie
i can read you like a magazine
aint it funny rumors fly
and i know you heard about me
so hey lets be friends
im dying to see how this one ends
grab your passport and my hand
i can make the bad guys good for a weekend

chorus
so its gonna be forever
or its gonna go down in flames
you can tell me when its over mm
if the high was worth the pain
got a long list of exlovers
theyll tell you im insane
cause you know i love the players
and you love the game
cause were young and were reckless
well take this way too far
itll leave you breathless mm
or with a nasty scar
got a long list of exlovers
theyll tell you im insane
but ive got a blank space baby
and ill write your name

stolen kisses pretty lies

wait the worst is yet to come oh no
screaming crying perfect storms

rose garden filled with thorns
keep you second guessing like

i get drunk on jealousy
but youll come back each time you leave
cause darling im a nightmare dressed like a daydream

or its gonna go down in flames
