my song is love
love to the loveless shown
and it goes on
you dont have to be alone

your heavy heart
is made of stone
and its so hard to see you clearly
you dont have to be on your own
you dont have to be on your own

and im not gonna say i dont mean that
youre the target that im aiming at
can i get that message home

verse 3
