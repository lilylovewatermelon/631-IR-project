when im at the pearly gates
thisll be on my videotape my videotape
when mephistopheles is just beneath
and hes reaching up to grab me
this is one for the good days
and i have it all here
in red blue green
in red blue green
you are my centre when i spin away
out of control on videotape
on videotape on videotape on videotape
on videotape on videotape on videotape

verse 2
this is my way of saying goodbye
because i cant do it face to face
so im talking to you before
no matter what happens now
you shouldnt be afraid
because i know today has been
the most perfect day
