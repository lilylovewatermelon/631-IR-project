you and me we have no faces
soon our lives will be erased
do you think they will remember
or will we just be replaced

oh i wish that i could see
how i wish that i could fly
far from things that hang above me
to a place where i can cry

prechorus
so why can it be
no one hears me call
echoes back at me
no ones there

chorus
to all these nameless feelings
i cant deal with in my life
to all these greedy people
trying to feed on what is mine

youve got to fill your hunger
and stop fucking with my mind
i know its time
to leave these places far behind
see korn liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likeverse 2
you and me we have no faces
they dont see us anymore
without love as they had promised
and no faith for whats in store

oh i wish that i could see
how i wish that i could fly
far from things that hang above me
to a place where i can cry

prechorus
so why can it be
no one hears me call
echoes back at me
no ones there

chorus
to all these nameless feelings
i cant deal with in my life
to all these greedy people
trying to feed on what is mine

youve got to fill your hunger
and stop fucking with my mind
i know its time
to leave these places far behind
bridge
where are all these feelings hiding
dancing in and out my mind
burning up all that i long for
feeding me to my decline

where are you my soul is bleeding
i am searching am i blind
all alone and bound forever
trapped inside me for all time

chorus
to all these nameless feelings
i cant deal with in my life
to all these greedy people
trying to feed on what is mine

youve got to fill your hunger
and stop fucking with my mind
i know its time
to leave these places far behind

to all these nameless feelings
i cant deal with in my life
to all these greedy people
trying to feed on what is mine
youve got to fill your hunger
and stop fucking with my mind
i know its time
to leave these places far behind3embed"
