if i had eyes in the back of my head
i would have told you that you looked good as i walked away
if you could have tried to trust the hand that fed
you wouldve never been hungry but you never really be
the more of this or less of this or is there any difference
or are we just holding onto the things we dont have anymore

chorus
sometimes time doesnt heal
no not at all
just stand still
while we fall
in or out of love again i doubt
im going to win you back when you got eyes like that
it wont let me in
always looking out

backing vocals and claps

verse 2
lot of people spend their time just floating
we were victims together but lonely
you got hungry eyes that just cant look forward
cant give them enough but we just cant start over
building with bent nails were falling but holding
i dont want to take up anymore of your time
time time time

sometimes time doesnt heal
no not at all
just stand still
while we fall
in or out of love again i doubt
im going to win you back when you got eyes like that
it wont let me in
always looking out

outro
always looking
always looking out
always looking out
always looking out6embed"
