i am a one in ten even though i dont exist
nobody knows me but im always there
a statistic a reminder of a world that doesnt care

my arms enfold the dole queue
malnutrition dulls my hair
my eyes are black and lifeless
with an underprivileged stare
im the beggar on the corner
will noone spare a dime
im the child that never learns to read
because no one spared the time

i am a one in ten a number on a list
i am a one in ten even though i dont exist
nobody knows me but im always there
a statistic a reminder of a world that doesnt care

im the murderer and the victim
the licence with the gun
im a sad and bruised old lady
in an ally in a slum
im a middle aged businessman
with chronic heart disease
im another teenage suicide
in a street that has no trees
see ub40 liveget tickets as low as 44you might also likei am a one in ten a number on a list
i am a one in ten even though i dont exist
nobody knows me but im always there
a statistic a reminder of a world that doesnt care

im a starving third world mother
a refugee without a home
im a house wife hooked on valium
im a pensioner alone
im a cancer ridden spectre
covering the earth
im another hungry baby
im an accident of birth

i am a one in ten a number on a list
i am a one in ten even though i dont exist
nobody knows me but im always there
a statistic a reminder of a world that doesnt careembed"
