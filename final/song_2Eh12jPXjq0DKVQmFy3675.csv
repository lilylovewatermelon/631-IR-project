errant heat to the star
and the rain let in
and the hawser rolls the vessels whole
and christ its thin

chorus 1
well id know that youd offer
would reveal it though its soft and flat
wont repeat it cull and coffers that
for the soffit hang this homeward
pry it open with your love
sending lost and alone standing offers

verse 2
it is steep it is stone
such recoverya cavalry
from the daily press the deepest nest
in keepers keep

verse 3
all the news at the door
such a revelry
well its hocked inside
of everything you said to me
you might also likechorus 2
it was found what we orphaned
didnt mention it would serve us picked
said your love is known im standing up on it
arent we married
i aint living in the dark no more
its not a promise im just gonna call it

verse 4
heavy mitted love our love is a star
sure some hazardry
for the light before and after
most indefinitely

bridge
ooh
ooh
danger has been stole away


outro
this is axiom
