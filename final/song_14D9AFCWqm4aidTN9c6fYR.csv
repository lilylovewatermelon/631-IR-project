where the penitents used to live
theres a crack in the hull
where the penitents used to live
and we can make it right if we row all night
give all that we can give
theres a crack in the hull
where the penitents used to live

theres a leak in the hold
where the infantry used to sleep
theres a leak in the hold
where the infantry used to sleep
and we can make it right if we roll all night
baby dust off your knees
theres a leak in the hold
where the infantry used to be

little monsters on the table
crazies here to play
little monsters on the boat parade

theres a hole in the hat
where the captian kept his dreams
theres a hole in the hat
where the captian kept his dreams
and we can make it right
if we sail all night
better pray for a breeze
theres a hole in the hat
where the captian used to besee five for fighting liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likeembed"
