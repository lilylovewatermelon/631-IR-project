its a full moon at midnight
running fast
out of time
its a feeling you cant describe
floating past
a pale skyline
and here you look reflective
but youre so disconnected
just think about it
whats really on your mind
and for you i would steal time
suspicion suspicion

chorus
youre a daydreamer
and its the same thing
over and over
were running for our lives
in a slipstream
youll wake up someday
and realize you were
dreaming of a life
youll forget

verse 2
its so affected
that color corrected night
but youre falling fast
through plastic skies
and here you look reflective
so disconnected
its not real life
open your eyes and breathe
everythings in its right place
but nothing gold can stay
just tell me you know my face

youre a daydreamer
and its the same thing
over and over
were running for our lives
in a slipstream
youll wake up someday
and realize you were
dreaming of a life
youll forget

bridge
when the moon was high
you couldnt describe
oh lucid sky

we just might die
but we feel so alive

chorus
youre a daydreamer
and its the same thing
over and over
were running for our lives

in a slipstream
youll wake up someday
and realize you were
dreaming up a life
you forget4embed"
