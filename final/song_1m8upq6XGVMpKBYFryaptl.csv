well i hate this town hate this place
there ain’t nothin’ to do
except go down to the bar each night
and drink ‘til 2
i hate my job
i’m always in a bad mood
i fear i’m comin’ down with a case
of the tall city blues
well i’m a cpa i got my bba from ttu
i crunch numbers in a highrise
countin’ barrels o’ crude
me and my buddies bitch in the breakroom
‘cause our boss went golfin’ this afternoon
left us to fend for ourselves
in the tall city blues

chorus
tall city dreamin’ is the difference
in believin’ in makin’ a livin’
or lovin’ what you do
raisin’ a family among strangers
and wildcatters who
were brought here by the boom
we’ll all be strangers soon
with tall city blues

this one bedroom apartment
is takin’ all my dough
fifteen hundred a month
for venetian blinds and stained concrete floors
lay back in my king size bed
each night where i sleep alone
dreamin’ about my next move
outta these tall city blues

chorus
tall city dreamin’ is the difference
in believin’ and makin’ a livin’
or lovin’ what you do
raisin’ a family among strangers
and wildcatters who were
brought here by the boom
we’ll all be strangers soon
with tall city blues

verse 3
got laid off this morning
did you not hear the news
we took too much out of the ground
we knew what to do
tonight no one gives a damn
whether your collars white or blue
we’ll drain our glasses by the masses
and make a toast
to the tall city blues
let’s drain our glasses by the masses
and make a toast
to the tall city blues
oh
chorus
tall city dreamin’ is the difference
in believin in makin a living
or lovin’ what you do
raisin’ a family among strangers
and wildcatters who were
brought here by the boom
we’ll all be strangers soon
with tall city blues
we’ll all be strangers soon
with tall city bluesembed"
