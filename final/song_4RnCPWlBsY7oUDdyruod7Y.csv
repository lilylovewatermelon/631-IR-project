i wanna be drunk when i wake up
on the right side of the wrong bed
and never an excuse i made up
tell you the truth i hate
what didnt kill me it never made me stronger at all
love will scar your makeup lipsticks to me
so now ill maybe lean back there
im sat here wishin i was sober
i know ill never hold you like i used to

prechorus
but our house gets cold when you cut the heating
without you to hold ill be freezin
cant rely on my heart to beat it
cause you take part of it every evenin
take words out of my mouth just from breathin
replace with phrases like when you leavin me
should i should i

chorus
maybe ill get drunk again
ill be drunk again
ill be drunk again
to feel a little love
see ed sheeran liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 2
i wanna hold your heart in both hands
not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
and i got no plans for the weekend
so should we speak then keep it between friends
though i know youll never love me like you used to
there may be other people like us
well see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
flames just create us burns dont heal like before
you dont hold me anymore

prechorus
on cold days cold plays out like the bands name
i know i cant heal things with a handshake
you know i cant change as i began saying
you cut me wide open like a landscape
open bottles of beer but never champagne
to applaud you with the sound that my hands make
should i should i

chorus
maybe ill get drunk again
ill be drunk again
ill be drunk again
to feel a little love
bridge
all by myself
im here again
all by myself
you know ill never change
all by myself
all by myself

chorus
im just drunk again
ill be drunk again
ill be drunk again
to feel a little love36embed"
