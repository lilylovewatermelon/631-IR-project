is this wrong of me
ive come so far so fast
im in the dark about a lot of things
seems so real to me
ive consecrated
i wish that i could hate it
i saw my bloody hands come clean
before my eyes

chorus
and i hear my wants and needs again
can you help me
and i hear a different kind again
someone stop me
and i feel the strain inside my mind
am i crazy
and i need to shed my skin
reveal this monolith within

my hands are bloody again
