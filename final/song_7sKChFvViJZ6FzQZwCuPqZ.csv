act one

the back yard of the keller home in the outskirts of an american town  august of our era
the stage is hedged on right and left by tall closely planted poplars which lend the yard a secluded
atmosphere  upstage is filled with the back of the house and its open unroofed porch which extends
into the yard some six feet  the house is two stories high and has seven rooms  it would have cost
perhaps fifteen thousand in the early twenties when it was built  now it is nicely painted looks tight
and comfortable and the yard is green with sod here and there plants whose season is gone  at the
right beside the house the entrance of the driveway can be seen but the poplars cut off view of its
continuation downstage  in the left corner downstage stands the four‐foot‐high stump of a slender
apple tree whose upper trunk and branches lie toppled beside it fruit still clinging to its branches
downstage right is a small trellised arbor shaped like a sea shell with a decorative bulb hanging from
its forward‐curving roof  carden chairs and a table are scattered about  a garbage pail on the ground
next to the porch steps a wire leaf‐burner near it
on the rise  it is early sunday morning  joe keller is sitting in the sun reading the want ads of the
sunday paper the other sections of which lie neatly on the ground beside him  behind his back inside
the arbor doctor jim bayliss is reading part of the paper at the table
keller is nearing sixty  a heavy man of stolid mind and build a business man these many years but with
the imprint of the machine‐shop worker and boss still upon him  when he reads when he speaks when
he listens it is with the terrible concentration of the uneducated man for whom there is still wonder in
many commonly known things a man whose judgements must be dredged out of experience and a
peasant‐like common sense  a man among men   
doctor bayliss is nearly forty  a wry self‐controlled man an easy talker but with a wisp of sadness that
clings even to his self‐effacing humor
at curtain jim is standing at left staring at the broken tree  he taps a pipe on it blows through the
pipe feels in his pockets for tobacco then speaks
jim  wheres your tobacco
keller i think i left it on the table
jim goes slowly to table on the arbor fings a pouch and sits there on the bench filling his pipe
keller gonna rain tonight
jim paper says so
keller yeah right here
jim then it cant rain
frank lubey enters through a small space between the poplars  frank is thirty two but balding  a
pleasant opinionated man uncertain of himself with a tendency toward peevishness when crossed but
always wanting it pleasantly and neighborly  he rather saunters in leisurely nothing to do  he does not
notice jim in the arbor  on his greeting jim does not bother looking up
frank hya
keller hello frank  whats doin
frank nothin  walking off my breakfast looks up at the sky that beautiful  not a cloud in the sky
keller looking up yeah nice
frank every sunday ought to be like this
keller indicating the sections beside him want the paper

keller i dont know i dont read the news part anymore  its more interesting in the want ads

two newfoundland dogs  now whats he want with two newfoundland dogs

keller shaking his head all the kind of business goin on  in my day either you were a lawyer or a
doctor or you worked in a shop now
frank well i was going to be a forester once
keller well that shows you  in my day there was no such think  scanning the page sweeping it with
his hand you look at a page like this you realize how ignorant you are  softly with wonder as he scans

wants
keller oh kate asked you to amke a horoscope
frank yeah what she wants to find out is whther november twenty‐fifth was a favorable day for larry
keller what is that favorable day
frank well a favorable day for a person is a fortunate day according to the stars  in other words it
would be practically impossible for him to have died on his favorable day
keller well was that his favorable day november twenty‐fifth
frank thats what im working on to find out  it takes time  see the point is if november twenty‐fifth
was his favorable day then its completely possible hes alive somewhere because i mean its possible

keller laughing i got all the kids crazy
chris one of these days theyll all come in here and beat your brains out
keller whats she going to say maybe we ought to tell her before she sees it
chris she saw it
keller how could she see it  i was the first one up  she was still in bed
chris she was out here when it broke
keller when
chris about four this morning indicating window above them i heard it cracking and i woke up and
looked out  she was standing right there when it cracked
keller what was she doing out here four in the morning
chris i dont know  when it cracked she ran back into the house and cried in the kitchen
keller did you talk to her
chris no i i figured the best thing was to leave her alone
pause
keller deeply touched she cried hard
chris i could hear her right through the floor of my room
keller after slight pause what was she doing out here at that hour chris silent  with an undertone
of anger showing shes dreaming about him again  shes walking around at night
chris i guess she is
keller shes getting just like after he died slight pause whats the meaning of that
chris i dont know the meaning of it slight pause but i know one thing dad  weve made a terrible
mistake with mother
keller what
chris being dishonest with her  that kind of thing always pays off and now its paying off
keller what do you mean dishonest
chris you know larrys not coming back and i know it  why do we allow her to go on thinking that we
believe with her
keller what do you want to do argue with her
chris i dont want to argue with her but its time she realized that nobody believes larry is alive any
more  keller simply moves away thinking looking at the ground  why shouldnt she dream of him
walk the nights waiting for him  do we contradict her  do we say straight out that we have no hope
any more  that we havent had any home for years now
keller frightened at the thought you cant say that to her
chris weve got to say it to her
keller howre you going to prove it  can you prove it
chris for gods sake three years  nobody comes back after three years  its insane
keller to you it is and to me  but not to her  you can talk yourself blue in the face but theres no body
and no grave so where are you
chris sit down dad  i want to talk to you
keller looks at him searchingly a moment
keller the trouble is the goddam newspapers  every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the
next one is going to be larry so
chris all right all right listen to me slight pause  keller sits on settee you know why i asked annie
here dont you
keller he knows but why
chris you know
keller well i got an idea but whats the story
chris im going to ask her to marry me slight pause  keller nods
keller well thats only your business chriss
chris you know its not only my business
keller what do you want me to do  youre old enough to know your own mind
chris asking annoyed then its all right ill go ahead with it
keller well you want to be sure mother isnt going to
chris then it isnt just my business
keller im just sayin 
chris sometimes you infuriate me you know that isnt it your business too if i tell this to mother and
she throws a fit about it  you have such a talent for ignoring things
keller i ignore what i gotta ignore  the girl is larrys girl
chris shes not larrys girl
keller from mothers point of view he is not dead and you have no right to take his girl slight pause
now you can go on from there if you know where to go but im tellin you i dont know where to go  
see  i dont know  now what can i do for you
chris i dont know why it is but every time i reach out for something i want i have to pull back because
other people will suffer  my whole bloody life time after time after time
keller  youre a considerate fella theres nothing wrong in that
chris to hell with that
keller did you ask annie yet
chris i wanted to get this settled first
keller how do you know shell marry you maybe she feels the same way mother does
chris well if she does then thats the end of it  from her letters i think shes forgotten him  ill find
out  and then well thrash it out with mother  right dad dont avoid me
keller the trouble is you dont see enough women  you never did
chris so what  im not fast with women
keller i dont see why it has to be annie
chris because it is
keller thats a good answer but it dont answer anything  you havent seen her since you went to war  
its five years
chris i cant help it  i know her best  i was brought up next door to her  these years when i think of
someone for my wife i think of annie  what do you want a diagram
keller i dont want a diagram iim she thinks hes coming back chris  you marry that girl and
youre pronouncing him dead  now whats going to happen to mother  do you know  i dont  pause
chris all right then dad
keller thinking chris has retreated give it some more thougth
chris ive given it three years of thought  id hoped that if i waited mother would forget larry and then
wed have a regular wedding and everything happy  but if that cant happen here then ill have to get
out
keller what the hell is this
chris ill get out  ill get married and live some place else  maybe in new york
keller are you crazy
chris ive been a good son too long a good sucker  im through with it
keller youve got a business here  what the hell is this

in the middle of that  now  where to i find it
keller you mean goes to him tell me something you mean youd leave the business

keller putting a fist up to chriss jaw but dont think that way you hear me
chris i am thinking that way
keller lowering his hand i dont understand you do i
chris no you dont  im a pretty tough guy
keller yeah i can see that
mother appears on porch  she is in her early fifties a woman of uncontrolled inspirations and an
overwhelming capacity for love
mother joe
chris going toward porch hello mom
mother indicating house behind her  to keller did you take a bag from under the sink
keller yeah i put it in the pail
mother well get it out of the pail  thats my potatoes
chris bursts out laughing  goes up into alley
keller laughing i thought it was garbage
mother  will you do me a favor joe  dont be helpful
keller i can afford another bag of potatoes
mother minnie scoured that pail in boiling water last night  its cleaner than your teeth
keller and i dont understand why after i worked forty years and i got a maid why i have to take out
the garbage
mother if you would make up your mind that every back in the kitchen isnt full of garbage you
wouldnt be throwing out my vegetables  last time it was the onions
chris comes on hands her bag
keller i dont like garbage in the house
mother then dont eat she goes into the kitchen with bag
chris that settles you for today
keller yeah im in last place again i dont know once upon a time i used to think that when i got
money again i would have a maid and my wife would take it easy  now i got money and i got a maid
and my wife is workin for the maid  he sits in one of the chairs
mother comes out on last line  she carries a pot of string beans
mother its her day off what are you crabbing about
chris to mother isnt annie finished eating
mother looking around preoccupiedly at yard shell be right out moves that wid did some job on
this place  of the tree so much for that thank got
keller indicating chair beside him sit down take it easy
mother pressing her hand to top of her head ive got such a funny pain on the top of my head
chris can i get you an aspirin
mother picks a few petals off ground stands there smelling them in her hand then sprinkles them over
plants
mother no more roses  its so funny everything decides to happen at the same time  this month is is
birthday his tree blows down annie comes  everything that happened seems to be coming back  i was
just down the cellar and what do i stumble over  his baseball glove  i havent seen it in a century
chris dont you think annie looks well
mother fine  theres no question about it  shes a beauty i still dont know what brought her here  
not that im not glad to see her but
chris i just thought wed all like to see each other again mother just looks at him nodding ever so
slightly almost as though admitting something and i wanted to see her myself
mother as her nods halt to keller the only think is i think her nose got longer  but ill always love that
girl  shes one that didnt jump into bed with somebody else as soon as it happened with her fella
keller as though that were impossible for annie oh whatre you
mother never mind  most of them didnt waid till the telegrams were opened  im just glad she came
so you can see im not completely out of my mind  sits and rapidly breaks string beans in the pot
chris just because she isnt married doesnt mean shes been mourning larry
mother with an undercurrent of observation why then isnt she
chris a little flustered well it could have been any number of things
mother directly at him like what for instance
chris embarrassed but standing his ground i dont know  whatever it is  can i get you an aspirin
mother puts her hand to her head  she gets up and goes aimlessly toward the trees on rising
mother its not like a headache
keller you dont sleep thats why  shes wearing out more bedroom slippers than shoes
mother i had a terrible night she stops moving i never had a night like that
chris looking at keller what was it mom did you dream
mother more more than a dream
chris hesitantly about larry
mother i was fast asleep and raising her arm over the audience remember the way he used to fly
low past the house when he was in training  when we used to see his face in the cockpit going by  
thats the way i saw him  only high up  way way up where the clouds are  he was so real i could
reach out and touch him  and suddenly he started to fall  and crying crying to memom mom  i
could hear him like he was in the room mom it was his voice  if i could touch him i knew i could stop
him if i could only breaks off allowing her outstretched hand to fall   i woke up and it was so funny  
the wind it was like the roaring of his engine  i came out here i mustve still been half asleep  i
could hear that roaring like he was going by  the tree snapped right in front of me and i like came
awake  she is looking at tree  she suddenly realizes something turns with a reprimanding finger
shaking slightly at keller  see  we should never have planted that tree  i said so in the first place  it
was too soon to plant a tree for him
chris alarmed too soon
mother angering we rushed into it everybody was in such a hurry to bury him  i sad not to plant it
yet to keller i told you to
chris mother mother she looks into his face the wind blew it down  what significance has that got  
what are you talking about  mother please dont go through it all again will you  its no good it
doesnt accomplish anything  ive been thinking yknow maybe we ought to put our minds to
forgetting him
mother thats the third time youve said that this week
chris because its not right  we never took up our lives again  were like at a railroad station waiting
for a train that never comes in
mother pressing the top of her head  get me an aspirin heh
chris sure and lets break out of this heh mom  i thought the four of us might go out to dinner a
couple of nights maybe go dancing out at the shore
mother fine to keller we can do it tonight
keller swell with me
chris sure lets have some fun to mother youll start with this aspirin  he goes up and into the
house with new spirit  her smile vanishes
mother with an accusing undertone why did he invite her here
keller why does that bother you
mother shes been in new york three and a half years why all of a sudden
keller well maybe maybe he just wanted to see her
mother nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see
keller what do you mean he lived next door to the girl all his life why shouldnt he want to see her
again mother looks at him critically dont look at me like that he didnt tell me any more than he told
you
mother a warning and a question hes not going to marry her
keller how do you know hes even thinking about it
mother its got that about it
keller sharply watching her reaction well so what
mother alarmed whats going on here joe
keller now listen kid
mother avoiding contact with him shes not his girl joe  she knows shes not
keller you cant read her mind
mother then why is she still single  new york is full of men why isnt she married pause probably a
hundred people told her shes foolish but shes waited
keller how do you know why she waited
mother she knows what i know thats why  shes faithful as a rock  in my worst moments i think of
her waiting and i know again that im right
keller  look its a nice day what are we arguing for
mother warningly nobody in this house dast take her faith away joe  strangers might  but not his
father not his brother
keller exasperated what do you want me to do what do you want

ann you mean  theyre larrys
mother didnt you recognize them
ann slowly rising a little embarrassed well it never occurred to me that youd  i mean the shoes are
all shined
mother yes dear  slight pause  ann cant stop staring at her  mother breaks it by speaking with the
relish of gossip putting her arm around ann and walking with her for so long ive been aching for a nice
conversation with you annie tell me something
ann what
mother i dont know something nice
chris wryly she means do you go out much
mother oh shut up
keller and are any of them serious
mother laughing sits in her chair why dont you both choke
keller annie you cant go into a restaurant with that woman any more in five minutes thirty nine
strange people are sitting at the table telling her their life storie
mother if i cant ask annie a personal question 
keller asking her is all right but dont beat her over the head  youre beatin her youre beatin her  
they are laughing
ann takes pan of beans off the stool buts them on floor under chair and sits
ann to mother dont let them bulldoze you  ask me anything you like  what do you want to know

ann i dont care  she can take him back if she likes
mother and you you  shakes her head negatively go out much slight pause
ann delicately you mean am i still waiting for him

ann kindly but thats what you meant isnt it
mother well  yes
ann well im not kate
mother faintly youre not
ann isnt it ridiculous  you dont really imagine hes 
mother i know dear but dont say its ridiculous because the papers were full of it  i dont know about
new york but there was half a page about a man missing even longer than larry and he turned up in
burma
chris coming to ann he couldnt have wanted to come home very badly mom
mother dont be so smart
chris you can have a helluva time in burma
ann rises and swings around in back of chris so ive heard

you dont know  all of you  and ill tell you one of them annie  deep deep in your heart youve always
been waiting for him
ann resolutely no kate
mother with increasing demand but deep in your heart annie
chris she ought to know shouldnt she
mother dont let them tell you what to think  listen to your heart  only your heart
ann why does your heart tell you hes alive
mother because he has to be
ann but why kate
mother going to her because certain things have to be and certain things can never be  like the sun
has to rise it has to be  thats why theres got  otherwise anything could happen  but theres god so
certain things can never happen  i would know annie  just like the day he indicates chris went into
that terrible battle  did he write me  was it in the papers  no but that morning i couldnt raise my
head off the pillow  ask joe  suddenly i knew  i knew  and he was nearly killed that day  ann you

ann stands there in silence then turns trembling going upstage
ann no kate

frank appears carrying a ladder
ann taking his hand why frank youre loosing your hair

ann abruptly fine  ill be in to see lydia
frank sympathetically how about it does dad expect a parole soon
ann with growing ill‐ease  i realy dont know i 
frank  staunchly defending her father for her sake  i mean because i feel yknow that if an intelligent
man like your father is put in prison there ought to be a law that says either you execute him or let him
go after a year
chris interrupting want a hand with that ladder frank
frank taking cue  thats all right ill  picks up ladder  ill finish the horoscope tonight kate  
embarrassed see you later ann you look wonderful  he exits  they look at ann
ann to chris as she sits slowly on stool havent they stopped talking about dad
chris comes down and sits on arm of chair nobody talks about him any more
keller gone and forgotten kid
ann tell me  because i dont want to meet anybody on the block if theyre going to 
chris i dont want you to worry about it
ann to keller do they still remember the case joe  do they talk about you
keller the only one still talks about it is my wife
mother thats because you keep on playing policeman with the kids  all their parents hear out of you is
jail jail jail
keller actually what happened was that when i got home from the penitentiary the kids get very
interested in me you know kids  i was laughs like the expert on the jail situation  and as time passed
they got it confused and  i ended up a detective  laughs
mother  except that they didnt get it confused  to ann he hands out police badges from the post
toasties boxes  they laugh   
ann rises and comes to keller putting her arm around his shoulder
ann  wonderously at them happy gosh its wonderful to hear you laughing about it
chris why whatd you expect
ann the last thing i remember on this block was one word  murderers  remember that kate  mrs
hammond standing in front of our house yelling that word  shes still around i suppose
mother theyre all still around
keller  dont listen to her  every saturday night the whole gang is playin poker in this arbor  all the
ones who yelled murderer takin my money now
mother dont joe  shes a sensitive girl dont fool her  to ann they still remember about dad  its
different with him indicates joe he was exonerated your fathers still there  thats why i wasnt so
enthusiastic about your coming  honestly i know how sensitive you are and i told chris i said
keller  listen you do like i did and youll be all right  the day i come home i got out of my car  but
not in front of the house on the corner  you shouldve been here annie and you too chris  youda
seen something  everybody know i was getting out that day  the porches were loaded  picture it now  
none of them believed i was innocent  the story was i pulled a fast one getting myself exonerated  so i
get out of my car and i walk  down the street  but very slow  and with a smile  the beast  i was the
beast  the guy who sold cracked cylinder heads to the army air force  the guy who made twenty one
p‐40s crash in australia  kid walkin down the street that day i was guilty as hell  except i wasnt and
there as a court apper in my pocket to prove i wasnt and i walked  past  the porches  result  
fourteen months later i had one of the best shops in the state again a respected man again bigger than
ever
chris with admiration joe mcguts
keller  now with great force thats the only way you lick em is guts to ann  the worst thing yoiu
did was to move away from here  you made it tough for your father when he gets out  thats why i tell
you i like to see him move back right on this block
mother pained how could they move back
keller it aint gonna end till they move back  to ann till people play cards with him again and talk
with him and smile with him  you play cards with a man you know he cant be a murderer  and the
next time you write him i like you to tell him just what i said ann simply stares at him  you hear me
ann surprised dont you hold anything against him
keller annie i never believed in crucifying people
ann mystified but he was your partner he dragged you through the mud
keller well he aint my sweetheart but you gotta forgive dont you
ann you either kate  dont you feel any 
keller to ann the next ime you write dad 
ann  i dont write him
keller struck well every now and then you 
ann a little shamed but determined no ive never written to him  neither has my brother  to chris
say do you feel this way too
chris he murdered twenty one pilots
keller what the hell kinda talk is that
mother thats not a thing to say about a man
ann  what else can you say  when they took him away i followed him went to him every visiting day  
i was crying all the time  until the news came about larry  then i realized  its wrong to pity a man like
that  father or no father theres only one way to lookat him  he knowingly shipped out parts what
would crash an airplane  and how do you know larry wasnt one of them   
mother  i was waiting for that  going to her as long as youre here annie i want to ask you never to
say that again
ann you surprise me  i thought youd be mad at him
mother  what your father did had nothing to do with larry  nothing
ann  but we cant know that
mother striving for control as long as youre here
ann perplexed but kate
mother put that out of your head
keller because
mother quickly to keller thats all thats enough  places her hand on her head come inside now
and have some tea with me she turns and goes up steps
keller to ann the one thing you 
mother sharply hes not dead so theres no argument now come
keller angrily in a minute mother turns and goes into house now look annie
chris  all right dad forget it
keller no she dasnt feel that way  annie
chris im sick of the whole subject now cut it out
keller you want her to go on like this to ann those cylinder heads when into p‐40s only  whats the
matter with you  you know larry never flew a p‐40
chris so who flew those p‐40s pigs
keller the man was a fool but dont make a murderer out of him  you got no sense  look what is does
to her  to ann listen you gotta appreciate what was doin in that shop in the war  the both of you  it
was a madhouse  every half hour the major callin for cylinder heads they were whippin us with the
telephone  the trucks were hauling them away hot damn near  i mean just try to see it human see it
human  all of a sudden a batch comes out with a crack  that happens thats the business  a fine
hairline crack  all right soso hes a little man your father always scared of loud voices  whatll the
major say half a days production shot whatll i say  you know what i mean  human he pauses  
so he take out his tools and he  covers over the cracks  alright  thats bad its wrong but thats what
a little man does  if i could have gone in that day id a told him junk em steve we can afford it  but
alone he was afraid  but i know he meant no harm  he believed theyd hold up a hundred percent  
thats a mistake but it aint murder  you mustnt feel that way about him  you understand me  it aint
right
ann she regards him a moment joe lets forget it
keller annie the day the news came out about larry he was in the next cell to minedad  and he
cried anniehe cried half the night
ann touched he shoulda cried all night  slight pause
keller almost angered annie i do not understand why you

keller clasps her around the waist smiling thats my sentiments  can you stand steak
chris and champagne

exits laughing into the house
chris calling after him drink your tea casanova he turns to ann isnt he a great guy

chris hopefully youre not sorry you came
ann not sorry no  but im  not going to stay
chris why
ann in the first place your mother as much as told me to go
chris well
ann you saw that and then you youve been kind of
chris what
ann well kind of embarrassed ever since i got here
chris  the trouble is i planned on kind of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so  but they
take it for granted that were all set
ann  i know they would  your mother anyway
chris how did you know
ann from her point of view why else would i come
chris well would you want to  ann still studies him i guess you know this is why i asked you to
come
ann i guess this is why i came
chris ann i love you  i love you a great deal  finally i love you  pause she waits i have no
imagination  thats all i know to tell you  ann is waiting ready im embarrassing you  i didnt want
to tell it to you here i wanted some place wed never been a place where wed be brand new to each
other you feel its wrong here dont you  this yard this chair  i want you to be ready for me  i dont
want to win you away from anything  
ann putting her arms around him oh chris ive been ready a long long time
chris  then hes gone for ever  youre sure
ann  i almost got married two years ago
chris why didnt you
ann you started to write me slight pause
chris you felt something that far back
ann every day since
chris ann why didnt you let me know
ann i was waiting for you  chris  till then you never wrote and when you did what did you say  you
sure can be ambiguous you know
chris looks toward house then at her trembling give me a kiss ann give me a they kiss god i
kissed you annie i kissed anni how long how long ive been waiting to kiss you
ann  ill never forgive you why did you wait all these years all ive done is sit and wonder if i was crazy
for thinking of you
chris annie were going to live now  im going to make you so happy he kisses her but without their
bodies touching
ann a little embarrassed not like that youre not
chris i kissed you
ann like larrys brother  do it like you chris he breaks away from her abruptly what is it chris
chris lets drive some place i want to be alone with you
ann no what is it chris your mother
chris no nothing like that
ann then whats wrong even in your letters there was something ashamed
chris yes  i suppose i have been  but its going from me
ann youve got to tell me
chris i dont know how to start he takes her hand
ann it wouldnt work this way slight pause
chris speaks quietly factually at first its all mixed up with so many other things you remember
overseas i was in command of a company
ann yeah sure
chris well i lost them
ann how many
chris just about all
ann oh gee
chris it take a little time to toss that off because they werent just men for instance one time itd
been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks  put them in
my pocket  thats only a little thing but thats the kind of guys i hd  they didnt die they killed
themselves for each other  i mean that exactly  a little more selfish and theydve been here today  and
i got an idea watching them go down  everything was being destroyed see but it seemed to me that
one new thing was made  a kind of responsibility  man for man  you understand me  to show that
to bring that onto the earth again like some kind of a monument and everyone would feel it standing
there behind him and it would make a difference to him pause and then i came home and it was
incredible  i there was no meaning in it here  the whole thing to them was a kind of a  bus
accident i went to work with dad and that rat‐race again  i felt what you said ashamed somehow  
because nobody was chaged at all  it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys  i felt wrong to be
alive to open the bank‐book to drive the new car to see the new refrigerator  i mean you can take
those things out of a war but when you drive that car youve got to know that it came out of the love a
man can have for a man youve got to be a little better because of that  otherwise what you have is
really loot and theres blood on it  i didnt want to take any of it  and i gues that included you
ann and you still feel that way
chris i want you know annie
ann because you mustnt feel that way any more  because you have a right to whatever you have  
everything chris understand that to me too and the money theres nothing wrong in your money  
your father put hundereds of planes in the air you should be proud  a man should be paid for that
chris oh annie annie im going to make a fortune for you
keller offstage hello  yes sure
ann laughing softly whatll i do with a fortune they kiss keller enters from house
keller thumbing toward house hey ann your brother they step apart shyly keller comes down
and wryly whats this labor day

ann you shouldnt burst out like that
keller well nobody told me it was labor day looks around wheres the hot dogs
chris loving it all right you said it once
keller well as long as i know its labor day from now on ill wear a bell around my neck

keller asking uncomfortably chris you you think you know her pretty good
chris hurt and apprehensive what kind of question

comes here
chris well what about it
keller its crazy but it comes to my mind she dont hold nothin against me does she
chris angry i dont know what youre talking about
keller a little more combatively im just talkin to his last day in court the man blamed it all on me
and his is his daughter  i mean if she was sent here to find out something
chris angered why whats there to find out

you to spread out chris i want you to use what i made for you he is close to him now i mean with
joy chris without shame with joy
chris touched i will dad
keller with deep emotion say it to me
chris why
keller because sometimes i think youre ashamed of the money
chris no dont feel that
keller because its good money theres nothing wrong with that money
chris a little frightened dad you dont have to tell me this
keller with overriding affection and self‐confidence now  he grips chris by the back of the neck and
with laughter between his determined jaws look chris ill go to work on mother for you well get her
so drunk tonight well all get married steps away with a wide hesture of his arm theres gonna be a
wedding kid like there never was seen champagne tuxedos
he breaks off as anns voice comes out loud from the house where she is still talking on the phone

well what did he tell you for gods sake pause all right come then pause yes theyll all be here

keller in hopeless fury looks at her turns around goes up to porch and into house slamming screen
door violently behind him mother sits in chair downstage stiffly staring seeing
curtain
as twilight falls that evening
on the rise chris is discovered sawing the broken‐off tree leaving stump standing alone  he is dressed
in good pants white shoes but without a shirt he disappears with tree up the alley when mother
appears on porch she comes down and stands watching him she has on a dressing gown carries a tray
of grape juice drink in a pitcher and glasses with sprigs of mint in them
mother calling up alley did you have to put on good pants to do that she comes downstage and puts
tray on table in the arbor then looks around uneasily then feels pitcher for coolness  chris enters from
alley brushing off his hands you notice there more light with that thing gone
chris my arent you dressing
mother its suffocating upstairs i made a grape drink for georgie  he always liked grape  come and
have some
chris impatiently well come on get dressed and whats dad sleeping so much for he goes to table
and pours a glass of juice
mother to his last day in court steve never gave up the idea that dad made him do it  if theyre going
to open the case again i wont live through it
chris george is just a damn fool mother how can you take him seriously
mother that family hates us maybe even annie
chris oh now mother
mother you think just because you like everbody they like you
chris all right stop working yourself up  just leave everything to me
mother when george goes home tell her to go with him
chris noncommittally dont worry about annie
mother steve is her father too
chris are you going to cut it out now come
mother going upstage with him you dont realize how people can hate chris they can hate so much
theyll tear the world to pieces
ann dressed up appears on the porch
chris look shes dressed already as he and mother mount porch ive just got to put on a shirt
ann in a preoccupied way are you feeling well kate
mother whats the difference dear  there are certain people yknow the sicker they get the longer
they live she goes into the house
chris you look nice
ann were going to tell her tonight
chris absolutely dont worry about it
ann i wish we could tell her now i cant stand scheming  my stomach gets hard
chris its not scheming well just get her in a better mood
mother offstage in the house joe are you going to sleep all day
ann laughing the only one whos relaxed is your father  hes fast asleep
chris im relaxed
ann are you
chris look he holds out his hand and makes it shake let me know when george gets here
he goes into the house  ann moves aimlessly and then is drawn toward tree stump  she goes to it
hesitantly touches broken top in the hush of her thoughts  offstage lydia calls johnny come get your
supper sue enters and halts seeing ann
sue is my husband
ann turns startled oh
sue im terribly sorry
ann its all right i  im jst a little silly about the dark
sue looks about its getting dark
ann are you looking for your husband
sue as usual  laughs tiredly he spends so much time here theyll be charging him rent
ann nobody was dressed so he drove over to the depot to pick up my brother
sue oh your brothers in
ann yeah they ought to be here any minute now  will you have a cold drink
sue i will thanks  ann goes to table and pours my husband  too hot to drive me to the beach  men
are like little boys for the neighbors theyll always cut the grass
ann people like to do things for the kellers  been that way since i can remember
sue its amazing  i gues your brothers coming to give you away heh
ann giving her drink i dont know i suppose
sue you must be all nerved up
ann its always a problem getting yourself married isnt it
sue that depends on your shape of course  i dont see why you should have had a problem
ann ive had chances
sue ill bet  its romantic its very unusual to me marrying the brother of your sweetheart
ann i dont know  i think its mostly that whenever i need somebody to tell me the truth ive always
thought of chris when he tells you something you know its so  he relaxes me
sue and hes got money  thats important you know
ann it wouldnt matter to me
sue youd be surprised  it makes all the difference  i married an intern  on my salary  and that was
bad because as soon as a woman supports a man he owes her something  you can never owe
somebody without resenting them ann laughs thats true you know
ann underneath i think the doctor is very devoted
sue oh certainly but its bad when a man always sees the bars in front of him  jim thinks hes in jail all
the time
ann oh
sue thats why ive been intending to ask you a small favor ann  its something very important to me
ann certainly if i can do it
sue you can  when you take up housekeeping try to find a place away from here
ann are you fooling
sue im very serious my husband is unhappy with chris around
ann how is that
sue jims a successful doctor  but hes got an idea hed like to do medical research discover things you
see
ann well isnt that good
sue research pays twenty five dollars a week minus laundering the hair shirt  youve got to give up
your life to go into it
ann how does chris
sue with growing feeling chris makes people want to be better that its possible to be  he does that
to people
ann is that bad
sue my husband has a family dear  everytime he has a session with chris he feels as though hes
compromising by not giving up everyting for research as though chris or anybody else isnt
compromising  it happens with jim every couple of years he meets a man and makes a statue out of
him
ann maybe hes right  i dont mean that chris is a statue but
sue now darling you know hes not right
ann i dont agree with you  chris
sue lets face it dear  chris is working with his father isnt he hes taking money out of that business
every week in the year
ann what of it
sue you ask me what of it
ann i certainly do  she seems about to burst out you oughtnt cast aspersions like that im surprised
at you
sue youre surprised at me
ann hed never take five cents out of that plant if there was anything wrong with it
sue you know that
ann  i know it  i resent everything youve said
sue moving toward her you know what i resent dear
ann please i dont want to argue
sue i resent living next to the holy family it makes me look like a bum you understand
ann  i cant do anything about that
sue who is he to ruin a mans life  everybody knows joe pulled a fast one to get out of jail
ann thats not true
sue then why dont you go out and talk to people go on talk to them  theres not a person on the
block who doesnt know the truth
ann thats a lie  people come here all the time for cards and
sue so what  they give him credit for being smart i do too ive got nothing against joe  but if chris
wants people to put on the hair shirt let him take off the broadcloth  hes driving my husband crazy
with that phony idealism of his and im at the end of my rope on it chris enters on porch wearing shirt
and tie now  she turns quickly hearing with a smile hello darling hows mother
chris i thought george came
sue no it was just us
chris coming down to them susie do me a favor heh go up to mother and see if you can calm her  
shes all worked up
sue she still doesnt know about you two
chris laughs a little well she senses it i guess  you know my mother
sue going up to porch oh yeah shes psychic
chris maybe theres something in the medicine chest
sue ill give her one of everything  on porch dont worry about kate couple of drinks dance her
around a little shell love ann  to ann because youre the female version of him  chris laughs dont
be alarmed i said version  she goes into house
chris interesting woman isnt she
ann yeah shes very interesting
chris shes a great nurse you know she
ann in tension but trying to control it are you still doing that
chris sensing something wrong but still smiling doing what
ann as soon as you get to know somebody you find a distinction for them how do you know shes a
great nurse
chris whats the matter ann
ann the woman hates you  she despises you
chris hey whats hit you
ann gee chris
chat happened here
ann you never why didnt you tell me
chris tell you what
ann she says they think joe is guilty
chris what difference does it make what they think
ann i dont care what they think i just dont understand why you took the trouble to deny it you said it
was all forgotten
chris i didnt want you to feel there was anything wrong in you coming here thats all  i know a lot of
people think my father was guilty and i assumed there might be some question in your mind
ann but i never once suspected him
chris nobody says it
ann chris i know how much you love him but it could never  
chris do you think i could forgive him if hed done that thing
ann im not here out of blue sky chris  i turned my back on my father if theres anything wrong here
now
chris i know that ann
ann george is coming from dad and i dont think its with a blessing
chris hes welcome here youve got nothing to fear from george
ann tell me that just tell me that
chris the man is innocent ann  remember he was falsely accused once and it put him through hell  
how would you behave if you were faced with the same thing again annie believe me theres nothing
wrong for you here believe me kid

him
keller every time i come out here it looks like playland they break and laugh in embarrassment
chris i thought you were going to shave
keller sitting on bench in a minute  i just woke up i cant see nothin
ann you look shaved
keller oh no massages his jaw gotta be extra special tonight big night annie so hows it feel to be a
married woman

george breathlessly my life turned upside down since then i couldnt go back to work when you left  
i wanted to go to dad and tell him you were going to be married it seemed impossible not to tell him

ann afraid of course i know
george you cant know you wouldnt be here dad came to work that day the night foreman came to
him and showed him the cylinder heads they were coming out of the process with defects  there was
something wrong with the process so dad went directly to the phone and called here and told joe to
come down right away  but the morning passed no sign of joe  so dad called again  by this time he
had over a hundred defectives  the army was screaming for stuff and dad didnt have anything to ship  
so joe told him on the phone he told him to weld cover up the cracks in any way he could and ship
them out
chris are you through now
george surging back at him im not through now back to ann dad was afraid he wanted joe there if
he was going to do it  but joe cant come down hes sick sick he suddenly gets the flu suddenly but
he promised to take responsibility  do you understand what im saying on the telephone you cant
have responsibility in a court you can always deny a phone call and thats exactly what he did they
know he was a liar the first time but in the appeal they believed the rotten lie and now joe is a big shot
and your father is the patsy he gets up now whatre you going to do eat his food sleep in his bed

george turning to chris with deliberation ill ask you something and look me in the eye when you
answer me
chris ill look you in the eye
george you know your father
chris  i know him well
george and hes the kind of boss to let a hundred and twenty one cylinder heads be repaired and
shipped out of his shop without even knowing it
chris hes that kind of boss
george and thats the same joe keller who never left his shop without first going aroiund to see that all
the lights were out
chris with growing anger the same joe keller
george the same man who knows how many minutes a day his workers spend in the toilet
chris the same man
george any my father that frightened mouse whod never buy a shirt without somebody along that
man would do such a thing on his own
chris on his own and because hes a frightened mouse this is another thing hed do throw the blame
on somebody else in court but it didnt work but with a fool like you it works
ann deeply shaken dont talk like that
chris sits facing george  tell me george what happened the court record was good enough for you
all these years why isnt it good now  why did you believe it all these years
george after a slight pause because you believed it thats the truth chris i believed everything
because i thought you did but today i heard it from his mouth from his mouth its altogether different
than the record anyone who knows him and knows your father will believe it from his mouth  your
dad took everything we have i cant beat that but shes one item hes not going to grab  he turns to
ann get your things everything they have is covered with blood  youre not the kind of girl who can
live with that get your things
chris ann youre not going to believe that are you
ann goes to him you know its not true dont you
george how can he tell you its his father to chris none of these things ever even cross your mind

keller the force of his nature rising but under control im sad to see he hasnt changed as long as i
know him twenty five years the man never learned how to take the blame you know that george
george he does well i
keller but you do know it because the way you come in here you dont look like you remember it i
mean in nineteen thirty seven when we had the shop on flood street and he damn near blew us all up
with that heater he left burning for two days without water he wouldnt admit that was his fault either
i had to fire a mechanic to save his face you remember that
george yes but
keller im just mentioning it george because this is just another one of a lot of things like when he
gave frank that money to invest in oil stock
george distressed i know that i
keller driving in but restrained but its good to remember those things kid the way he cursed frank
because the stock went down was that franks fault to listen to him frank was a swindler and all the
man did was to give him a bad tip   
george gets up moves away i know those things
keller then remember them remember them  ann comes out of house there are certain men in the
world who rather see everybody hung before theyll take blame you understand me george
they stand facing each other george trying to judge him
ann coming downstage the cabs on its way would you like to wash

curtain  
two oclock the following morning mother is discovered on the rise rocking ceaselessly in a chair
staring at her thoughts  it is an intense slight sort of rocking a light shows from upstairs bedroom
lower floor windows being dark the moon is strong and casts its bluish light
presently jim dressed in jacked and hat appears and seeing her goes up beside her
jim any news
mother no news
jim gently you cant sit up all night dear why dont you go to bed
mother im waiting for chris dont worry about me jim im perfectly all right
jim but its almost two oclock
mother i cant sleep slight pause you had an emergency
jim tiredly somebody had a headache and thought he was dying slight pause half of my patients are
quite mad nobody realizes how many people are walking loose and theyre cracked as coconuts
money money‐money‐money‐money you say it long enough it doesnt mean anything she smiles
makes a silent laugh oh how id love to be around when that happens
mother shaking her head youre so childish jim sometimes you are
jim looks at her a moment kate pause what happened
mother i told you he had an argument with joe then he got in the car and drove away
jim what kind of an argument
mother an argument joe he was crying like a child before
jim they argued about ann

come out of that room since he left all night in that room
jim looks up at window then at her whatd joe do tell him
mother stops rocking tell him what
jim dont be afraid kate i know ive always known
mother how
jim it occurred to me a long time ago
mother i always had the feeling that in the back of his head chris almost knew i didnt think it would
be such a shock
jim gets up chris would never know how to live with a thing like that it takes a certain talent for
lying you have it and i do but not him
mother what do you mean hes not coming back
jim oh no hell come back we all come back kate these private little revolutions always die the
compromise is always made in a peculiar way frank is right every man does have a star the star of
ones honesty and you spend your life groping for it but once its out it never lights again i dont think
he went very far he probably just wanted to be alone to watch his star go out
mother just as long as he comes back
jim i wish he wouldnt kate one year i simply took off went to new orleans for two months i lived on
bananas and milk and studied a certain disease and then she came and she cried and i went back
home with her and now i live in the usual darkness i cant find myself its hard sometimes to
remember the kind of man i wanted to be im a good husband chris is a good son hell come back
keller comes out on porch in dressing gown and slippers he goes upstageto alley jim goes to him
jim i have the feeling hes in the park ill look for him put her to bed joe this is no good for what shes
