if i told you things i did before
told you how i used to be
would you go along with someone like me
if you knew my story word for word
had all of my history
would you go along with someone like me

verse 2 victoria bergsman
i did before and had my share
it didnt lead nowhere
i would go along with someone like you
it doesnt matter what you did
who you were hanging with
we could stick around and see this night through

chorus peter morén  victoria bergsman
and we dont care about the young folks
talking bout the young style
and we dont care about the old folks
talking bout the old style too
and we dont care about their own faults
talking bout our own style
all we care bout is talking
talking only me and you

usually when things has gone this far
people tend to disappear
no one will surprise me unless you do
i can tell theres something going on
hours seems to disappear
everyone is leaving im still with you
it doesnt matter what we do
where we are going too
we can stick around and see this night through

chorus victoria bergsman  peter morén
and we dont care about the young folks
talking bout the young style
and we dont care about the old folks
talking bout the old style too
and we dont care about their own faults
talking bout our own style
all we care bout is talking
talking only me and you
and we dont care about the young folks
talking bout the young style
and we dont care about the old folks
talking bout the old style too
and we dont care about their own faults
talking bout our own style
all we care bout is talking
talking only me and you
talking only me and you
