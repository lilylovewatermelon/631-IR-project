i can see it in your eyes youre angry
regret got shit on what youre feelin now
mad cause he aint like me
oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
all the care i would take
all the love that we made
now youre trying to find somebody to replace what i gave to you
its a shame you didnt keep it

bitch im the man dont you forget it
the way you walk thats me
the way you talk thats me
the way you got your hair up did you forget thats me
and the voice in your speaker right now thats me

okay look im honest girl i cant lie i miss you
you and the music were the only things that id commit to
i never cheated for the record back when i was with you
but you believed in everything but me girl i dont get you
she says i know you changed
i never see you cause youre always busy doin things
i really wish she had a different way of viewin things
i think the city that were from just kinda ruined things
its such a small place not much to do but talk and listen
the men are jealous and the women all in competition
and all your friends tellin you stories that you often misinterpret
and taint all the images of your mr perfect
i could tell that you been cryin all night drinkin all summer
prayin for your happiness hope that you recover uh
this is one i know you hated when you heard it
and its worse because you know that i deserve it

chorus
take a shot for me ohohohoh ohohohoh
take a shot for me ohohohoh ohohohoh
take a shot for me ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
a shot for me ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
a shot for me
outro
yeah
may your neighbors respect you
trouble neglect you
angels protect you
and heaven accept you136embed"
