i was striking suave ambitious
feet to beak so birdylicious
now im vile i am villainous and vicious
oh and malicious
i had it all a tv show women too
i was tall over 1 foot 2
then they got a pretty parakeet to fill my shoes
thats why i am so evil why i do what i do

he was a superstar so young and vital
hes nasty a south american idol
hes a suspicious bird who said that about me
a very vicious bird ill have you rotisseried

i was the king of telenovelas
the envy of all the other fellas
then i was pushed out
for a pretty polly parakeet from paraguay
they called patricious

common paraguayan name

hes a nasty bird im insidious
hes ghastly oh im hideous
he was a real macaw im a cockatoo
an obscene bird yes that words true
you might also likeim a feathery freak with a beak a bird murderer
you think youre badder than me i never heard of ya
im evil i fill your cheese ball with weevils
i poop on people and i blame it on the seagulls

it was him

hes a nasty bird im invincible
hes ghastly im unminceable
im unwashable unrinseable
like an abandoned school i have no principle
all of you brazilian birds
all 80 million birds
ill tell you what im going to do
im going to make you

shut up now shut up its just me 
i will make you ugly too

did you hear how dramatic that was
with the endembed"
