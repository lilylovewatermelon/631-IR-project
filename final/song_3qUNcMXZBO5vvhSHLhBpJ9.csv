yeah i cant wait for the moment you can take off
i pray you dont have to cut my time short
i would rather not say much
but if i do it will be forward
i cant pull no punches baby doll
the gods have approved
the universe is in tune with me and you
thats why we here involved
im too in love
what you do this for
your body moves in fluid motion
hands in two and two im open
whos it for ooh its yours
i dont know if im the one you want to stay with
but i know that im the only one who makes you cum

hook
and as soon as i break down the wall
im riding the wave of your waterfall
as soon as i break down the wall
im riding the wave of your waterfall
as soon as i break down the wall
im riding the wave of your waterfall
