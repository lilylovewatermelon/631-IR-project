i i hope she makes you smile
the way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
in the middle of a highway driving alone
oh baby i i hope you hear a song
that makes you sing along and gets you thinking bout her
then the last several miles turn into a blur yeah

chorus
i hope youre both feelin sparks by the end of the drive
i hope you know shes the one by the end of the night
i hope you never ever felt more free
tell your friends that youre so happy
i hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
i hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
i hope shes wilder than your wildest dreams
shes everything youre ever gonna need
and then i hope she cheats
like you did on me
and then i hope she cheats
like you did on me

verse 2
yeah babe i hope she shows up in a 2 am pic from her friend
hanging on to a guy and you just aint him
i hope you stay up all night all alone waitin by the phone
and then she calls
and baby i i hope you work it out
forgive and just about forget
and take her on a first date again
and when you lean in for a kiss
