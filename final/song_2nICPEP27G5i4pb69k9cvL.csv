say what you mean
do what you say
i dont wanna be sold another piece of your dream
so take it take it save it

i just dont know how i can take it
cause my heart is breakin

i would never no take they words gainst yours oh no
i rather let you yeah make your promise

said you would step up said you was ready ready
but i shouldve listened
