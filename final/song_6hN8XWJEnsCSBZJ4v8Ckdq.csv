coming back into the city
driving homeward slow
shimmer like you do to me
we laugh at all those changing trees
autumn is falling down again
out of this blue sunday dream

come to me with your smoky mouth
raindrops fall on this old town
its been me and you whove been falling round
well i lied to you when i knocked upon your door
see i was nowhere near your neighborhood
but if this all in our mind
if this is all just in our minds
honey would you mind
getting out of mine
this is all just in our head
and now its screaming red
watching the leaves fall down and laugh at us insteadsee gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likeembed"
