please dont try to find me through my dealer
he wont pick up his phone
please dont try my father either
he aint been home for years
i know im no spiritseeker
i cant sleep through the tears
i get lost in the ether

chorus lana del rey lana del rey  miles kane
i check in i wreck it i turn it around
i gave you all my money gave you all my money
gave you all my money gave you all my money
i dont wanna live
i dont wanna give you nothing
cause you never give me nothing back
why cant you be good for something
not one shirt off your back
why cant you be good for something
not one shirt off your back

verse 2 miles kane
please dont try to find me through my dealer
he wont pick up his phone
please dont try my doctor either
he wont take any calls
hes no fucking spirit healer
he just comes door to door
but hes gone now for the weekend

i check in i wreck it and ill explain
i gave you all my money gave you all my money
gave you all my money gave you all my money
i dont wanna live
i dont wanna give you nothing
cause you never give me nothing back
why cant you be good for something
not one shirt off your back
why cant you be good for something
not one shirt off your back
