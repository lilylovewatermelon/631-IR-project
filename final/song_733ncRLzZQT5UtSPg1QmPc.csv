i dont wanna be the girl that laughs the loudest
or the girl who never wants to be alone
i dont wanna be that call at four oclock in the morning
cause im the only one you know in the world that wont be home

prechorus
ah sun is blinding
i stayed up again
oh i am finding
thats not the way i want my story to end

chorus
im safe up high
nothing can touch me
why do i feel this partys over
no pain inside
youre my protection
but how do i feel this good sober

verse 2
i dont wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence
the quiet scares me cause it screams the truth
please dont tell me that we had that conversation i know we did
cause i wont remember save your breath cause whats the use ooh
