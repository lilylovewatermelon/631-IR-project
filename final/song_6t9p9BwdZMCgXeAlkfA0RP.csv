theres a woman at a table
keeps looking at her phone
and the fella sitting with her
its like hed rather be alone
theyre hangin on by a thread
and that threads bout to go
this might not need to be said
but i just wanna let you know

chorus
i dont wanna fight i dont wanna let you go
baby i dont wanna know what its like to lose you lose you
oh cause people break up fall in and outta love
but giving this up somehow just wont do wont do
and i dont wanna give you a reason to leave me
watch you drive off in the night
i never wanna feel that freedom that people say they find
i dont wanna know i dont wanna know
i dont wanna know what its like to losе you to lose you

verse 2
yeah i know im gonna say things that should nevеr leave my mouth
when your worlds flyin off the handle ill try keep you on the ground
it wont always be roses even though you deserve em
