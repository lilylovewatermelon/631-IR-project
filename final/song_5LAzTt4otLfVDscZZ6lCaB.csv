and i i know even if your hope is gone
you belong you belong to me to me
im coming home and i know it wont be long
before you belong you belong to me

verse 1
im building a castle
on the beaches where the oceans
turtles come to rest under the sun
you bury your head in the sand
waiting for your boy to understand
how to be a man cause love is not enough
ive combed the ocean floors
for the dreams that we lost
the fears that we buried
the world just feels so small
i leave it all behind because

chorus
and i i know even if your hope is gone
you belong you belong to me to me
im coming home and i know it wont be long
before you belong you belong to me

verse 2
i dont even know how i let you run so far
but ill run after you until your legs give up
and ill carry you all the way home
back where we belong
youve given up but ive still got enough hope for us
in the desert glow
i saw a man without any clothes and his heart in his hands
he said all you need to know is never let go
never let go

and i i know even if your hope is gone
you belong you belong to me to me
im coming home and i know it wont be long
before you belong you belong to me

verse 3
dont turn away just show me your face again
cause im starting to forget
i cant live with this regret
the time will come when we will find our place again
into my arms back where you belong
into my arms back where you belong again

chorus
and i i know even if your hope is gone
you belong you belong to me to me
im coming home and i know it wont be long
before you belong you belong to meembed"
