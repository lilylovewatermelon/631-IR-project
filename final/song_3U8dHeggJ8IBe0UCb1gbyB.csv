shed trade colorado if hed take her with him
closes the door fore the winter lets the cold in
and wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
shes answered by the taillights shinin through the window pane

chorus
he said i want to see you again
but im stuck in colder weather
maybe tomorrow will be better
can i call you then
she said youre ramblin man
and you aint ever gonna change
youve got a gypsy soul to blame
and you were born for leavin

verse 2
at a truck stop diner just outside of lincoln
the night is black as the coffee he was drinkin
and in the waitress eyes he sees the same old light is shinin
he thinks of colorado and the girl he left behind him

chorus
he said i want to see you again
but im stuck in colder weather
maybe tomorrow will be better
can i call you then
she said youre ramblin man
and you aint ever gonna change
youve got a gypsy soul to blame
and you were born for leavin
born for leavin

well its a windin road
when youre in the lost and found
youre a lover im a runner
and we go round and round
and i love you but i leave you
i dont want you but i need you
you know its you that calls me back here baby

alternate chorus
oh i want to see you again
but im stuck in colder weather
maybe tomorrow will be better
can i call you then
cause im a ramblin man
i aint ever gonna change
ive got a gypsy soul to blame
and i was born for leavin
born for leavin

outro
when i close my eyes i see you
no matter where i am
i can smell your perfume through these whisperin pines
im with your ghost again
its a shame about the weather
but i know soon well be together
and i cant wait til then
i cant wait til then16embed"
