one track mind like a goldfish
stuck inside my petridish
i cant breathe and i cant smile
this better be worth my while

prechorus
i feel numb most of the time
lower i get the higher
ill climb and i will wonder why
i got dark only to

chorus
shine looking for the golden light
oh its a reasonable sacrifice
burn burn burn bright

verse 2
forego families forego friends
its how it started how it ends
i cant open up and cry
cause ive been silent all my life

prechorus
i feel numb most of the time
lower i get the higher
ill climb and i will wonder why
i got dark only to

shine looking for the golden light
oh its a reasonable sacrifice
burn burn burn bright
burn burn burn bright

bridge
ooh i get dark
oh and im in hell
i need a friend
ooh but i cant yell
yeah im no good
no good to anyone
cause all i care about
is being number one

chorus
shine looking for the golden light
oh its a reasonable sacrifice
shine looking for the golden light
oh its a reasonable sacrifice sacrifice

outro
i feel numb most of the time
lower i get the higher
ill climb and i will wonder why
i got dark only to shine
and ill light up the sky
stars that burn the brightest
fall so fast and pass you by
cough like empty lighters
i feel numb most of the time
lower i get the higher
ill climb and i will wonder why
i get dark only to shine
and ill light up the sky
stars that burn the brightest
fall so fast and pass you by
spark like empty lighters17embed"
