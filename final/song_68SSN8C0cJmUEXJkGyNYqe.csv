catch the rain even on a sunny day
i swear im not excusing ill cross my heart to prove it
but she seems tired cause weve been through this

chorus
and i know you said that were not a thing
but youre here thats the thing
and im not trying to give you a ring
well maybe on the phone if you let it sing
youre overcomplicating everything
when the lights go down dont say i didnt warn ya
i dont think thats legal in the state of california

verse 2
ive got you wrapped around my finger like a piece of ribbon
you just wont admit it that youre smitten
hold on a minute plеase wont you listen
cause im not surе if youre into me like how im into you
i said a lot of stupid things in the winter once the ice got thinner
but somehow we managed through the fall
so i guess its not that bad at all

chorus
that were not a thing
but youre here thats the thing
and im not trying to give you a ring
well maybe on the phone if you let it sing
youre overcomplicating everything
when the lights go down dont say i didnt warn ya
i dont think thats legal in the state of california
you might also likebridge
im going away
did i forget to mention how long id stay
is that a question for another day
but while were away

chorus
and i know you said that were not a thing
but youre here thats the thing
and im not trying to give you a ring
well maybe on the phone if you let it sing
youre overcomplicating everything
when the lights go down dont say i didnt warn ya
i dont think thats legal in the state of california2embed"
