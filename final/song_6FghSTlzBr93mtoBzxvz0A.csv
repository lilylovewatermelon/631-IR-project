you said enough you never loved the thought of us
youre too good to be true yeah
i gotta go gotta run
you dont want me the way that i want you no

chorus
you walked too close to the rails
i picked you up when you fell
how can you live with yourself
youre lost but i couldnt tell
fooled me and you did it well
thought you were somebody else

verse 2
no way to right these wrongs
either way im feeling it might just cost somethin in the millions
i know that i cant resist
you know i cant just stop but i dont wanna hear
every night youre off walkin on the ceiling
thinkin about what you did

chorus
you walked too close to the rails
i picked you up when you fell
how can you live with yourself
youre lost but i couldnt tell
fooled me and you did it well
thought you were somebody else
see bad omens liveget tickets as low as 53you might also likebridge
i know we said that sex isnt love
but it seems like enough for us
i know we said that were having fun
but im getting too numb to your touch

chorus
you walked too close to the rails
i picked you up when you fell
how can you live with yourself
youre lost but i couldnt tell
fooled me and you did it well
thought you were somebody elseembed"
