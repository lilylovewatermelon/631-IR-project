hook  2x big moe
i stay flossing in that candy paint
blowin dank
sippin drank tearin up a lane
tearin up the lane tearin up the laaaaaaaane

verse 1 mike jones
lil daddy you can tell im ballin
from the way im flossin 84s i am crawlin
screens fallin as i slide up and down your block
with a chain full of rocks and princess cuts in my watch
mike jones
im hot now a lot of people callin
but back then they left mike jones crawlin
im rising they fallin
cause i stayed up on my grind
didnt have time to whine
had to put it dine down

verse 2 mike jones
i pull up in a drop top holding grain
parking lot pimpin mayne
i aint even trippin mayne
screens rain as i slide up and down the block

ride daily holding glock
cause i know haters plot
you might see me suv on 24s
or i might be flippin tippin on four vogues
mike jones
a lot people now mad cause im hot
but they gone be even madder when that jag leave the lot
i stay grindin so i can stay ballin
cause lord knows i cant picture me fallin
im crawlin
candy paint on fours
doggin all these hoes
