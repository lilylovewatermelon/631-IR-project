in the spring we made a boat
out of feathers out of bones
we set fire to our homes
walking barefoot in the snow
distant rhythm of the drum
as we drifted towards the storm
baby lion lost his teeth
now theyre swimming in the sea

verse 2 ragnar
troubled spirits on my chest
where they laid to rest
the birds all left my tall friend
as your body hit the sand
million stars up in the sky
formed a tigers eye
that looked down on my face
out of time and out of place

chorus nanna bryndís hilmarsdóttir  ragnar
so hold on
hold on to
what we are
hold on to
your heart

verse 3 ragnar
awakened by the sound
of a screaming owl
chasing leaves in the wind
going where weve never been
said goodbye to you my friend
as the fire spread
all thats left are your bones
that will soon sink like stones

chorus nanna  ragnar
so hold on
hold on to
what we are
hold on to
your heart
