i can lift you up
your  body is mostly blood
like  water a perfect flood
engulfing me again oh
and i can tell you wont
remember  my cracking bones
the  trauma we cant regrow
just as you leave again no

chorus
will  you levitate
up where the angels inhabit
will you levitate
where i wont reach you

verse 2
and  we imitate
a story of perfect days
a ballad we fabricate
as you forget your words again oh
and is that all you need
to merely pretend to be
falling in love with me
forgetting the agony again oh
see sleep token liveget tickets as low as 68you might also likechorus
will you levitate
up where the angels inhabit
will you levitate
where i wont reach you
will you levitate
up where my love doesnt matter
will you levitate
where i wont reach you

outro
will you levitate
will you levitate
will you levitate1embed"
