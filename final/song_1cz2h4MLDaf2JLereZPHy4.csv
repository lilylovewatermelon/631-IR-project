how many men could you kill let me count all the bullets i got
how many bricks could move you can say twenty a block
how many niggasll ride you could fill a football field
how much money you got youd think i signed a football deal

and im kill six of your niggas six different ways
and we still got xl rhymes still gangsta
try to run up on the guy ill send your legs to your mom
and we still got kilos of coke
ruff ryders to the death ride or die nigga we know the oath
thats why im tryin to send this metal through your head
cause you got me curious you probably look better when you dead
nine by the spine fifth in the holst
scum bag its them dblock boys daddy kiss and the ghost

double clip in your mug then have sp hit it with mace

verse 2 fabolous paul cain  both
we your favorite gangstas favorite gangstas and duke better bolt
before these slugs sink in his waves like anchors
we dont own clean guns all our skets is dirty
i toss bullets new york niggas jet like testaverde
i dont keep the scope on the ratchet for the dope ill attach it
make sure the joint aim point blank so they cant open your casket
my whole crew got glocks on em
in a hurry to shoot like they put shot clocks on em
all that gossip you blast better see if they possibly has
a v12 ambulance that get you to a hospital fast
they let cain out the cages and shackles
i aint call a pager to track you im loadin up gauges to whack you
we been riding together and us back and forth
its like putting saddam hussein and bin laden together
soon as you get a crumb they wanna bury ya
thats why i travel with a semi like eddie in coming to america
silencers it sound like its humming when im airing ya
wont know you hit til your body numbing in that area
the kids dont want to see the toast to mom and daddy
plus we rather be roastin trauma fatties in a toasted almond caddy
and we come through with chains glisten and thangs spitting
hollow shotsll leave your brain missing
ghetto fab and paul cain nigga
we gettin heaps of complaints for keepin it gangsta
chorus fabolous
yall know who keepin it gangsta
we come through keepin it gangsta
yall know how we do keepin it gangsta
