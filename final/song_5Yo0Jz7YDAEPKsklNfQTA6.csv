hello august moon where are the stars of the night
you promised me too soon cause its been cloudy all night
and the weatherman said if youre not well stay in bed
and ive been feeling down and blue and its cloudy in my head
instead of going out to some restaurant ill stay home instead

chorus 1
but ill be loving you thats what i wanna do
ill be loving you thats what i wanna do

verse 2
hello midnight lover youre the one i adore
and ill be thinking of ya til the stars are no more
if its cloudy or blue ill stay here with you
well make a wish and then well kiss our love forever true
instead of going out to some restaurant ill stay here with you

chorus 2
and ill be loving you thats what i wanna do
ill be loving you thats what i wanna do

it seems you dont know we reached the highest mountain
every time i seem to disappear
and together we will fly well dance up in the heavens
i can really feel it when youre near ohhooo
and the weatherman said if youre not well stay in bed
cause ive been feeling down and blue and its cloudy in my head
instead of going out to some restaurant ill stay home in bed
