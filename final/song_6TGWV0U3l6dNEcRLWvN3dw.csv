6TGWV0U3l6dNEcRLWvN3dw,Large Industrial Air Conditioner,"Brown Noise for Babies, White Noise for Deeper Sleep, Appliances for Meditation",04jm22tp63AElcz2oH0uyc,"1 contributorman and superman act 3 lyricsevening in the sierra nevada rolling slopes of brown with olive trees instead of apple trees in the cultivated patches and occasional prickly pears instead of gorse and bracken in the wilds higher up tall stone peaks and precipices all handsome and distinguished no wild nature here rather a most aristocratic mountain landscape made by a fastidious artistcreator no vulgar profusion of vegetation even a touch of aridity in the frequent patches of stones spanish magnificence and spanish economy everywhere

not very far north of a spot at which the high road over one of the passes crosses a tunnel on the railway from malaga to granada is one of the mountain amphitheatres of the sierra looking at it from the wide end of the horseshoe one sees a little to the right in the face of the cliff a romantic cave which is really an abandoned quarry and towards the left a little hill commanding a view of the road which skirts the amphitheatre on the left maintaining its higher level on embankments and on an occasional stone arch on the hill watching the road is a man who is either a spaniard or a scotchman probably a spaniard since he wears the dress of a spanish goatherd and seems at home in the sierra nevada but very like a scotchman for all that in the hollow on the slope leading to the quarrycave are about a dozen men who as they recline at their cave round a heap of smouldering white ashes of dead leaf and brushwood have an air of being conscious of themselves as picturesque scoundrels honoring the sierra by using it as an effective pictorial background as a matter of artistic fact they are not picturesque and the mountains tolerate them as lions tolerate lice an english policeman or poor law guardian would recognize them as a selected band of tramps and ablebodied paupers

this description of them is not wholly contemptuous whoever has intelligently observed the tramp or visited the ablebodied ward of a workhouse will admit that our social failures are not all drunkards and weaklings some of them are men who do not fit the class they were born into precisely the same qualities that make the educated gentleman an artist may make an uneducated manual laborer an ablebodied pauper there are men who fall helplessly into the workhouse because they are good far nothing but there are also men who are there because they are strongminded enough to disregard the social convention obviously not a disinterested one on the part of the ratepayer which bids a man live by heavy and badly paid drudgery when he has the alternative of walking into the workhouse announcing himself as a destitute person and legally compelling the guardians to feed clothe and house him better than he could feed clothe and house himself without great exertion when a man who is born a poet refuses a stool in a stockbrokers office and starves in a garret spunging on a poor landlady or on his friends and relatives rather than work against his grain or when a lady because she is a lady will face any extremity of parasitic dependence rather than take a situation as cook or parlormaid we make large allowances for them to such allowances the ablebodied pauper and his nomadic variant the tramp are equally entitled

further the imaginative man if his life is to be tolerable to him must have leisure to tell himself stories and a position which lends itself to imaginative decoration the ranks of unskilled labor offer no such positions we misuse our laborers horribly and when a man refuses to be misused we have no right to say that he is refusing honest work let us be frank in this matter before we go on with our play so that we may enjoy it without hypocrisy if we were reasoning farsighted people four fifths of us would go straight to the guardians for relief and knock the whole social system to pieces with most beneficial reconstructive results the reason we do got do this is because we work like bees or ants by instinct or habit not reasoning about the matter at all therefore when a man comes along who can and does reason and who applying the kantian test to his conduct can truly say to us if everybody did as i do the world would be compelled to reform itself industrially and abolish slavery and squalor which exist only because everybody does as you do let us honor that man and seriously consider the advisability of following his example such a man is the ablebodied ableminded pauper were he a gentleman doing his best to get a pension or a sinecure instead of sweeping a crossing nobody would blame him for deciding that so long as the alternative lies between living mainly at the expense of the community and allowing the community to live mainly at his it would be folly to accept what is to him personally the greater of the two evils

we may therefore contemplate the tramps of the sierra without prejudice admitting cheerfully that our objects—briefly to be gentlemen of fortune—are much the same as theirs and the difference in our position and methods merely accidental one or two of them perhaps it would be wiser to kill without malice in a friendly and frank manner for there are bipeds just as there are quadrupeds who are too dangerous to be left unchained and unmuzzled and these cannot fairly expect to have other mens lives wasted in the work of watching them but as society has not the courage to kill them and when it catches them simply wreaks on them some superstitious expiatory rites of torture and degradation and than lets them loose with heightened qualifications for mischief it is just as well that they are at large in the sierra and in the hands of a chief who looks as if he might possibly on provocation order them to be shot

this chief seated in the centre of the group on a squared block of stone from the quarry is a tall strong man with a striking cockatoo nose glossy black hair pointed beard upturned moustache and a mephistophelean affectation which is fairly imposing perhaps because the scenery admits of a larger swagger than piccadilly perhaps because of a certain sentimentality in the man which gives him that touch of grace which alone can excuse deliberate picturesqueness his eyes and mouth are by no means rascally he has a fine voice and a ready wit and whether he is really the strongest man in the party or not he looks it he is certainly the best fed the best dressed and the best trained the fact that he speaks english is not unexpected in spite of the spanish landscape for with the exception of one man who might be guessed as a bullfighter ruined by drink and one unmistakable frenchman they are all cockney or american therefore in a land of cloaks and sombreros they mostly wear seedy overcoats woollen mufflers hard hemispherical hats and dirty brown gloves only a very few dress after their leader whose broad sombrero with a cocks feather in the band and voluminous cloak descending to his high boots are as unenglish as possible none of them are armed and the ungloved ones keep their hands in their pockets because it is their national belief that it must be dangerously cold in the open air with the night coming on it is as warm an evening as any reasonable man could desire
except the bullfighting inebriate there is only one person in the company who looks more than say thirtythree he is a small man with reddish whiskers weak eyes and the anxious look of a small tradesman in difficulties he wears the only tall hat visible it shines in the sunset with the sticky glow of some sixpenny patent hat reviver often applied and constantly tending to produce a worse state of the original surface than the ruin it was applied to remedy he has a collar and cuff of celluloid and his brown chesterfield overcoat with velvet collar is still presentable he is preeminently the respectable man of the party and is certainly over forty possibly over fifty he is the corner man on the leaders right opposite three men in scarlet ties on his left one of these three is the frenchman of the remaining two who are both english one is argumentative solemn and obstinate the other rowdy and mischievous

the chief with a magnificent fling of the end of his cloak across his left shoulder rises to address them the applause which greets him shows that he is a favorite orator

the chief
friends and fellow brigands i have a proposal to make to this meeting we have now spent three evenings in discussing the question have anarchists or socialdemocrats the most personal courage we have gone into the principles of anarchism and socialdemocracy at great length the cause of anarchy has been ably represented by our one anarchist who doesnt know what anarchism means laughter—

the anarchist
rising a point of order mendoza—

mendoza
forcibly no by thunder your last point of order took half an hour besides anarchists dont believe in order

the anarchist
mild polite but persistent he is in fact the respectable looking elderly man in the celluloid collar and cuffs that is a vulgar error i can prove—
mendoza
order order

the others shouting order order sit down chair shut up
the anarchist is suppressed

mendoza
on the other hand we have three socialdemocrats among us they are not on speaking terms and they have put before us three distinct and incompatible views of socialdemocracy

the majority
shouting assent hear hear so we are right

the rowdy socialdemocrat
smarting under oppression you aint no christian youre a sheeny you are

mendoza
with crushing magnanimity my friend i am an exception to all rules it is true that i have the honor to be a jew and when the zionists need a leader to reassemble our race on its historic soil of palestine mendoza will not be the last to volunteer sympathetic applause—hear hear etc but i am not a slave to any superstition i have swallowed all the formulas even that of socialism though in a sense once a socialist always a socialist

the socialdemocrats
hear hear

mendoza
but i am well aware that the ordinary man—even the ordinary brigand who can scarcely be called an ordinary man hear hear—is not a philosopher common sense is good enough for him and in our business affairs common sense is good enough for me well what is our business here in the sierra nevada chosen by the moors as the fairest spot in spain is it to discuss abstruse questions of political economy no it is to hold up motor cars and secure a more equitable distribution of wealth

the sulky socialdemocrat
all made by labor mind you
mendoza
urbanely undoubtedly all made by labor and on its way to be squandered by wealthy vagabonds in the dens of vice that disfigure the sunny shores of the mediterranean we intercept that wealth we restore it to circulation among the class that produced it and that chiefly needs it—the working class we do this at the risk of our lives and liberties by the exercise of the virtues of courage endurance foresight and abstinence—especially abstinence i myself have eaten nothing but prickly pears and broiled rabbit for three days

the sulky socialdemocrat
stubbornly no more aint we

mendoza
indignantly have i taken more than my share

the sulky socialdemocrat
unmoved why should you

the anarchist
why should he not to each according to his needs from each according to his means

the frenchman
shaking his fist at the anarchist fumiste

mendoza
diplomatically i agree with both of you

the genuinely english brigands
hear hear bravo mendoza

mendoza
what i say is let us treat one another as gentlemen and strive to excel in personal courage only when we take the field
the rowdy socialdemocrat
derisively shikespear
a whistle comes from the goatherd on the hill he springs up and points excitedly forward along the road to the north

the goatherd
automobile automobile he rushes down the hill and joins the rest who all scramble to their feet

mendoza
in ringing tones to arms who has the gun

the sulky socialdemocrat
handing a rifle to mendoza here

mendoza
have the nails been strewn in the road

the rowdy socialdemocrat
two ahnces of em

mendoza
good to the frenchman with me duval if the nails fail puncture their tires with a bullet he gives the rifle to duval who follows him up the hill mendoza produces an opera glass the others hurry across to the road and disappear to the north

mendoza
on the hill using his glass two only a capitalist and his chauffeur they look english

duval
angliche aoh yess cochons handling the rifle faut tire nestcepas

mendoza
no the nails have gone home their tire is down they stop

duval
shouting to the others fondez sur eux nom de dieu

mendoza
rebuking his excitement du calme duval keep your hair on they take it quietly let us descend and receive them

mendoza descends passing behind the fire and coming forward whilst tanner and straker in their motoring goggles leather coats and caps are led in from the road by brigands

tanner
is this the gentleman you describe as your boss does he speak english

the rowdy socialdemocrat
course he does ydont suppowz we hinglishmen lets ahrselves be bossed by a bloomin spenniard do you

mendoza
with dignity allow me to introduce myself mendoza president of the league of the sierra posing loftily i am a brigand i live by robbing the rich

tanner
promptly i am a gentleman i live by robbing the poor shake hands
t

he english socialdemocrats
hear hear
general laughter and good humor tanner and mendoza shake hands the brigands drop into their former places

straker
ere where do i come in

tanner
introducing my friend and chauffeur
the sulky socialdemocrat suspiciously well which is he friend or showfoor it makes all the difference you know

mendoza
explaining we should expect ransom for a friend a professional chauffeur is free of the mountains he even takes a trifling percentage of his princpals ransom if he will honor us by accepting it

straker
i see just to encourage me to come this way again well ill think about it

duval
impulsively rushing across to straker mon frere he embraces him rapturously and kisses him on both cheeks

straker
disgusted ere git out dont be silly who are you pray

duval
duval socialdemocrat

straker
oh youre a socialdemocrat are you

the anarchist
he means that he has sold out to the parliamentary humbugs and the bourgeoisie compromise that is his faith

duval
furiously i understand what he say he say bourgeois he say compromise jamais de la vie miserable menteur—

straker
see here captain mendoza ow much o this sort o thing do you put up with here are we avin a pleasure trip in the mountains or are we at a socialist meetin

the majority
hear hear shut up chuck it sit down etc etc the socialdemocrats and the anarchist are hurtled into the background straker after superintending this proceeding with satisfaction places himself on mendozas left tanner being on his right

mendoza
can we offer you anything broiled rabbit and prickly pears—

tanner
thank you we have dined

mendoza
to his followers gentlemen business is over for the day go as you please until morning
the brigands disperse into groups lazily some go into the cave others sit down or lie down to sleep in the open a few produce a pack of cards and move off towards the road for it is now starlight and they know that motor cars have lamps which can be turned to account for lighting a card party

straker
calling after them dont none of you go fooling with that car dye hear

mendoza
no fear monsieur le chauffeur the first one we captured cured us of that

straker
interested what did it do

mendoza
it carried three brave comrades of ours who did not know how to stop it into granada and capsized them opposite the police station since then we never touch one without sending for the chauffeur shall we chat at our ease

tanner
by all means
tanner mendoza and straker sit down on the turf by the fire mendoza delicately waives his presidential dignity of which the right to sit on the squared stone block is the appanage by sitting on the ground like his guests and using the stone only as a support for his back

mendoza
it is the custom in spain always to put off business until tomorrow in fact you have arrived out of office hours however if you would prefer to settle the question of ransom at once i am at your service

tanner
tomorrow will do for me i am rich enough to pay anything in reason

mendoza
respectfully much struck by this admission you are a remarkable man sir our guests usually describe themselves as miserably poor

tanner
pooh miserably poor people dont own motor cars

mendoza
precisely what we say to them

tanner
treat us well we shall not prove ungrateful

straker
no prickly pears and broiled rabbits you know dont tell me you cant do us a bit better than that if you like

mendoza
wine kids milk cheese and bread can be procured for ready money

straker
graciously now youre talking

tanner
are you all socialists here may i ask

mendoza
repudiating this humiliating misconception oh no no no nothing of the kind i assure you we naturally have modern views as to the justice of the existing distribution of wealth otherwise we should lose our selfrespect but nothing that you could take exception to except two or three faddists

tanner
i had no intention of suggesting anything discreditable in fact i am a bit of a socialist myself

straker
drily most rich men are i notice

mendoza
quite so it has reached us i admit it is in the air of the century

straker
socialism must be looking up a bit if your chaps are taking to it

mendoza
that is true sir a movement which is confined to philosophers and honest men can never exercise any real political influence there are too few of them until a movement shows itself capable of spreading among brigands it can never hope for a political majority

tanner
but are your brigands any less honest than ordinary citizens

mendoza
sir i will be frank with you brigandage is abnormal abnormal professions attract two classes those who are not good enough for ordinary bourgeois life and those who are too good for it we are dregs and scum sir the dregs very filthy the scum very superior

straker
take care some o the dregsll hear you

mendoza
it does not matter each brigand thinks himself scum and likes to hear the others called dregs

tanner
come you are a wit mendoza inclines his head flattered may one ask you a blunt question

mendoza
as blunt as you please

tanner
how does it pay a man of your talent to shepherd such a flock as this on broiled rabbit and prickly pears i have seen men less gifted and ill swear less honest supping at the savoy on foie gras and champagne

mendoza
pooh they have all had their turn at the broiled rabbit just as i shall have my turn at the savoy indeed i have had a turn there already—as waiter

tanner
a waiter you astonish me

mendoza
reflectively yes i mendoza of the sierra was a waiter hence perhaps my cosmopolitanism with sudden intensity shall i tell you the story of my life

straker
apprehensively if it aint too long old chap—

tanner
interrupting him tshsh you are a philistine henry you have no romance in you to mendoza you interest me extremely president never mind henry he can go to sleep

mendoza
the woman i loved—

straker
oh this is a love story is it right you are go on i was only afraid you were going to talk about yourself

mendoza
myself i have thrown myself away for her sake that is why i am here no matter i count the world well lost for her she had i pledge you my word the most magnificent head of hair i ever saw she had humor she had intellect she could cook to perfection and her highly strung temperament made her uncertain incalculable variable capricious cruel in a word enchanting

straker
a six shillin novel sort o woman all but the cookin er name was lady gladys plantagenet wasnt it

mendoza
no sir she was not an earls daughter photography reproduced by the halftone process has made me familiar with the appearance of the daughters of the english peerage and i can honestly say that i would have sold the lot faces dowries clothes titles and all for a smile from this woman yet she was a woman of the people a worker otherwise—let me reciprocate your bluntness—i should have scorned her

tanner
very properly and did she respond to your love

mendoza
should i be here if she did she objected to marry a jew

tanner
on religious grounds

mendoza
no she was a freethinker she said that every jew considers in his heart that english people are dirty in their habits

tanner
surprised dirty

mendoza
it showed her extraordinary knowledge of the world for it is undoubtedly true our elaborate sanitary code makes us unduly contemptuous of the gentile

tanner
did you ever hear that henry

straker
ive heard my sister say so she was cook in a jewish family once

mendoza
i could not deny it neither could i eradicate the impression it made on her mind i could have got round any other objection but no woman can stand a suspicion of indelicacy as to her person my entreaties were in vain she always retorted that she wasnt good enough for me and recommended me to marry an accursed barmaid named rebecca lazarus whom i loathed i talked of suicide she offered me a packet of beetle poison to do it with i hinted at murder she went into hysterics and as i am a living man i went to america so that she might sleep without dreaming that i was stealing upstairs to cut her throat in america i went out west and fell in with a man who was wanted by the police for holding up trains it was he who had the idea of holding up motors cars—in the south of europe a welcome idea to a desperate and disappointed man he gave me some valuable introductions to capitalists of the right sort i formed a syndicate and the present enterprise is the result i became leader as the jew always becomes leader by his brains and imagination but with all my pride of race i would give everything i possess to be an englishman i am like a boy i cut her name on the trees and her initials on the sod when i am alone i lie down and tear my wretched hair and cry louisa—

straker
startled louisa

mendoza
it is her name—louisa—louisa straker—

tanner straker

straker
scrambling up on his knees most indignantly look here louisa straker is my sister see wot do you mean by gassin about her like this wot she got to do with you

mendoza
a dramatic coincidence you are enry her favorite brother

straker
oo are you callin enry what call have you to take a liberty with my name or with hers for two pins id punch your fat ed so i would

mendoza
with grandiose calm if i let you do it will you promise to brag of it afterwards to her she will be reminded of her mendoza that is all i desire

tanner
this is genuine devotion henry you should respect it

straker
fiercely funk more likely

mendoza
springing to his feet funk young man i come of a famous family of fighters and as your sister well knows you would have as much chance against me as a perambulator against your motor car

straker
secretly daunted but rising from his knees with an air of reckless pugnacity i aint afraid of you with your louisa louisa miss straker is good enough for you i should think

mendoza
i wish you could persuade her to think so

straker
exasperated here—

tanner
rising quickly and interposing oh come henry even if you could fight the president you cant fight the whole league of the sierra sit down again and be friendly a cat may look at a king and even a president of brigands may look at your sister all this family pride is really very old fashioned

straker
subdued but grumbling let him look at her but wot does he mean by makin out that she ever looked at im reluctantly resuming his couch on the turf ear him talk one ud think she was keepin company with him he turns his back on them and composes himself to sleep

mendoza
to tanner becoming more confidential as he finds himself virtually alone with a sympathetic listener in the still starlight of the mountains for all the rest are asleep by this time it was just so with her sir her intellect reached forward into the twentieth century her social prejudices and family affections reached back into the dark ages ah sir how the words of shakespear seem to fit every crisis in our emotions

                i loved louisa 40000 brothers

                could not with all their quantity of love

                make up my sum

and so on i forget the rest call it madness if you will—infatuation i am an able man a strong man in ten years i should have owned a firstclass hotel i met her and you see i am a brigand an outcast even shakespear cannot do justice to what i feel for louisa let me read you some lines that i have written about her myself however slight their literary merit may be they express what i feel better than any casual words can he produces a packet of hotel bills scrawled with manuscript and kneels at the fire to decipher them poking it with a stick to make it glow

tanner
clapping him rudely on the shoulder put them in the fire president

mendoza
startled eh

tanner
you are sacrificing your career to a monomania

mendoza
i know it

tanner
no you dont no man would commit such a crime against himself if he really knew what he was doing how can you look round at these august hills look up at this divine sky taste this finely tempered air and then talk like a literary hack on a second floor in bloomsbury

mendoza
shaking his head the sierra is no better than bloomsbury when once the novelty has worn off besides these mountains make you dream of women—of women with magnificent hair

tanner
of louisa in short they will not make me dream of women my friend i am heartwhole

mendoza
do not boast until morning sir this is a strange country for dreams

tanner
well we shall see goodnight he lies down and composes himself to sleep
mendoza with a sigh follows his example and for a few moments there is peace in the sierra then mendoza sits up suddenly and says pleadingly to tanner—

mendoza
just allow me to read a few lines before you go to sleep i should really like your opinion of them

tanner
drowsily go on i am listening

mendoza
i saw thee first in whitsun week louisa louisa—

tanner
roaring himself my dear president louisa is a very pretty name but it really doesnt rhyme well to whitsun week

mendoza
of course not louisa is not the rhyme but the refrain

tanner
subsiding ah the refrain i beg your pardon go on

mendoza
perhaps you do not care for that one i think you will like this better he recites in rich soft tones and to slow time
                louisa i love thee
                i love thee louisa
                louisa louisa louisa i love thee
                one name and one phrase make my music
                louisa louisa louisa louisa i love thee
                mendoza thy lover
                thy lover mendoza
                mendoza adoringly lives for louisa
                theres nothing but that in the world for mendoza
                louisa louisa mendoza adores thee
affected there is no merit in producing beautiful lines upon such a name louisa is an exquisite name is it not

tanner
all but asleep responds with a faint groan

mendoza
                 o wert thou louisa
                the wife of mendoza
                mendozas louisa louisa mendoza
                how blest were the life of louisas mendoza
                how painless his longing of love for louisa

that is real poetry—from the heart—from the heart of hearts dont you think it will move her
no answer
resignedly asleep as usual doggrel to all the world heavenly music to me idiot that i am to wear my heart on my sleeve he composes himself to sleep murmuring louisa i love thee i love thee louisa louisa louisa louisa i—
straker snores rolls over on his side and relapses into sleep stillness settles on the sierra and the darkness deepens the fire has again buried itself in white ash and ceased to glow the peaks show unfathomably dark against the starry firmament but now the stars dim and vanish and the sky seems to steal away out of the universe instead of the sierra there is nothing omnipresent nothing no sky no peaks no light no sound no time nor space utter void then somewhere the beginning of a pallor and with it a faint throbbing buzz as of a ghostly violoncello palpitating on the same note endlessly a couple of ghostly violins presently take advantage of this bass
a staff of music is supplied here
and therewith the pallor reveals a man in the void an incorporeal but visible man seated absurdly enough on nothing for a moment he raises his head as the music passes him by then with a heavy sigh he droops in utter dejection and the violins discouraged retrace their melody in despair and at last give it up extinguished by wailings from uncanny wind instruments thus—
more music
it is all very odd one recognizes the mozartian strain and on this hint and by the aid of certain sparkles of violet light in the pallor the mans costume explains itself as that of a spanish nobleman of the xvxvi century don juan of course but where why how besides in the brief lifting of his face now hidden by his hat brim there was a curious suggestion of tanner a more critical fastidious handsome face paler and colder without tanners impetuous credulity and enthusiasm and without a touch of his modern plutocratic vulgarity but still a resemblance even an identity the name too don juan tenorio john tanner where on earth—or elsewhere—have we got to from the xx century and the sierra
another pallor in the void this time not violet but a disagreeable smoky yellow with it the whisper of a ghostly clarionet turning this tune into infinite sadness
here there is another musical staff
the yellowish pallor moves there is an old crone wandering in the void bent and toothless draped as well as one can guess in the coarse brown frock of some religious order she wanders and wanders in her slow hopeless way much as a wasp flies in its rapid busy way until she blunders against the thing she seeks companionship with a sob of relief the poor old creature clutches at the presence of the man and addresses him in her dry unlovely voice which can still express pride and resolution as well as suffering

the old woman
excuse me but i am so lonely and this place is so awful

don juan
a new comer

the old woman
yes i suppose i died this morning i confessed i had extreme unction i was in bed with my family about me and my eyes fixed on the cross then it grew dark and when the light came back it was this light by which i walk seeing nothing i have wandered for hours in horrible loneliness

don juan
sighing ah you have not yet lost the sense of time one soon does in eternity

the old woman
where are we

don juan in hell
the old woman
proudly hell i in hell how dare you

don juan
unimpressed why not senora

the old woman
you do not know to whom you are speaking i am a lady and a faithful daughter of the church

don juan
i do not doubt it

the old woman
but how then can i be in hell purgatory perhaps i have not been perfect who has but hell oh you are lying

don juan
hell senora i assure you hell at its best that is its most solitary—though perhaps you would prefer company

the old woman
but i have sincerely repented i have confessed

don juan
how much

the old woman
more sins than i really committed i loved confession

don juan
ah that is perhaps as bad as confessing too little at all events senora whether by oversight or intention you are certainly damned like myself and there is nothing for it now but to make the best of it

the old woman
indignantly oh and i might have been so much wickeder all my good deeds wasted it is unjust

don juan
no you were fully and clearly warned for your bad deeds vicarious atonement mercy without justice for your good deeds justice without mercy we have many good people here

the old woman
were you a good man

don juan
i was a murderer

the old woman
a murderer oh how dare they send me to herd with murderers i was not as bad as that i was a good woman there is some mistake where can i have it set right

don juan
i do not know whether mistakes can be corrected here probably they will not admit a mistake even if they have made one

the old woman
but whom can i ask

don juan
i should ask the devil senora he understands the ways of this place which is more than i ever could

the old woman
the devil i speak to the devil

don juan
in hell senora the devil is the leader of the best society

the old woman
i tell you wretch i know i am not in hell

don juan
how do you know

the old woman
because i feel no pain

don juan
oh then there is no mistake you are intentionally damned

the old woman
why do you say that

don juan
because hell senora is a place for the wicked the wicked are quite comfortable in it it was made for them you tell me you feel no pain i conclude you are one of those for whom hell exists

the old woman
do you feel no pain

don juan
i am not one of the wicked senora therefore it bores me bores me beyond description beyond belief

the old woman
not one of the wicked you said you were a murderer

don juan
only a duel i ran my sword through an old man who was trying to run his through me

the old woman
if you were a gentleman that was not a murder

don juan
the old man called it murder because he was he said defending his daughters honor by this he meant that because i foolishly fell in love with her and told her so she screamed and he tried to assassinate me after calling me insulting names

the old woman
you were like all men libertines and murderers all all all

don juan
and yet we meet here dear lady

the old woman
listen to me my father was slain by just such a wretch as you in just such a duel for just such a cause i screamed it was my duty my father drew on my assailant his honor demanded it he fell that was the reward of honor i am here in hell you tell me that is the reward of duty is there justice in heaven

don juan
no but there is justice in hell heaven is far above such idle human personalities you will be welcome in hell senora hell is the home of honor duty justice and the rest of the seven deadly virtues all the wickedness on earth is done in their name where else but in hell should they have their reward have i not told you that the truly damned are those who are happy in hell

the old woman
and are you happy here

don juan
springing to his feet no and that is the enigma on which i ponder in darkness why am i here i who repudiated all duty trampled honor underfoot and laughed at justice

the old woman
oh what do i care why you are here why am i here i who sacrificed all my inclinations to womanly virtue and propriety

don juan
patience lady you will be perfectly happy and at home here as with the poet hell is a city much like seville

the old woman
happy here where i am nothing where i am nobody

don juan
not at all you are a lady and wherever ladies are is hell do not be surprised or terrified you will find everything here that a lady can desire including devils who will serve you from sheer love of servitude and magnify your importance for the sake of dignifying their service—the best of servants

the old woman
my servants will be devils

don juan
have you ever had servants who were not devils

the old woman
never they were devils perfect devils all of them but that is only a manner of speaking i thought you meant that my servants here would be real devils

don juan
no more real devils than you will be a real lady nothing is real here that is the horror of damnation

the old woman
oh this is all madness this is worse than fire and the worm

don juan
for you perhaps there are consolations for instance how old were you when you changed from time to eternity

the old woman
do not ask me how old i was as if i were a thing of the past i am 77

don juan
a ripe age senora but in hell old age is not tolerated it is too real here we worship love and beauty our souls being entirely damned we cultivate our hearts as a lady of 77 you would not have a single acquaintance in hell

the old woman
how can i help my age man

don juan
you forget that you have left your age behind you in the realm of time you are no more 77 than you are 7 or 17 or 27

the old woman
nonsense

don juan
consider senora was not this true even when you lived on earth when you were 70 were you really older underneath your wrinkles and your grey hams than when you were 30

the old woman
no younger at 30 i was a fool but of what use is it to feel younger and look older

don juan
you see senora the look was only an illusion your wrinkles lied just as the plump smooth skin of many a stupid girl of 17 with heavy spirits and decrepit ideas lies about her age well here we have no bodies we see each other as bodies only because we learnt to think about one another under that aspect when we were alive and we still think in that way knowing no other but we can appear to one another at what age we choose you have but to will any of your old looks back and back they will come

the old woman
it cannot be true

don juan
try

the old woman
seventeen

don juan
stop before you decide i had better tell you that these things are a matter of fashion occasionally we have a rage for 17 but it does not last long just at present the fashionable age is 40—or say 37 but there are signs of a change if you were at all goodlooking at 27 i should suggest your trying that and setting a new fashion
the old woman
i do not believe a word you are saying however 27 be it whisk the old woman becomes a young one and so handsome that in the radiance into which her dull yellow halo has suddenly lightened one might almost mistake her for ann whitefield

don juan
dona ana de ulloa

ana what
you know me

don juan
and you forget me

ana
i cannot see your face he raises his hat don juan tenorio monster you who slew my father even here you pursue me

don juan
i protest i do not pursue you allow me to withdraw going

ana
reining his arm you shall not leave me alone in this dreadful place

don juan
provided my staying be not interpreted as pursuit

ana
releasing him you may well wonder how i can endure your presence my dear dear father

don juan
would you like to see him

ana
my father here

don juan
no he is in heaven

ana
i knew it my noble father he is looking down on us now what must he feel to see his daughter in this place and in conversation with his murderer

don juan
by the way if we should meet him—

ana
how can we meet him he is in heaven

don juan
he condescends to look in upon us here from time to time heaven bores him so let me warn you that if you meet him he will be mortally offended if you speak of me as his murderer he maintains that he was a much better swordsman than i and that if his foot had not slipped he would have killed me no doubt he is right i was not a good fencer i never dispute the point so we are excellent friends

ana
it is no dishonor to a soldier to be proud of his skill in arms

don juan
you would rather not meet him probably

ana
how dare you say that

don juan
oh that is the usual feeling here you may remember that on earth—though of course we never confessed it—the death of anyone we knew even those we liked best was always mingled with a certain satisfaction at being finally done with them

ana
monster never never

don juan
placidly i see you recognize the feeling yes a funeral was always a festivity in black especially the funeral of a relative at all events family ties are rarely kept up here your father is quite accustomed to this he will not expect any devotion from you

ana
wretch i wore mourning for him all my life

don juan
yes it became you but a life of mourning is one thing an eternity of it quite another besides here you are as dead as he can anything be more ridiculous than one dead person mourning for another do not look shocked my dear ana and do not be alarmed there is plenty of humbug in hell indeed there is hardly anything else but the humbug of death and age and change is dropped because here we are all dead and all eternal you will pick up our ways soon

ana
and will all the men call me their dear ana

don juan
no that was a slip of the tongue i beg your pardon

ana
almost tenderly juan did you really love me when you behaved so disgracefully to me

don juan
impatiently oh i beg you not to begin talking about love here they talk of nothing else but love—its beauty its holiness its spirituality its devil knows what—excuse me but it does so bore me they dont know what theyre talking about i do they think they have achieved the perfection of love because they have no bodies sheer imaginative debauchery faugh

ana
has even death failed to refine your soul juan has the terrible judgment of which my fathers statue was the minister taught you no reverence

don juan
how is that very flattering statue by the way does it still come to supper with naughty people and cast them into this bottomless pit

ana
it has been a great expense to me the boys in the monastery school would not let it alone the mischievous ones broke it and the studious ones wrote their names on it three new noses in two years and fingers without end i had to leave it to its fate at last and now i fear it is shockingly mutilated my poor father

don juan
hush listen two great chords rolling on syncopated waves of sound break forth d minor and its dominant a round of dreadful joy to all musicians ha mozarts statue music it is your father you had better disappear until i prepare him she vanishes

from the void comes a living statue of white marble designed to represent a majestic old man but he waives his majesty with infinite grace walks with a featherlike step and makes every wrinkle in his war worn visage brim over with holiday joyousness to his sculptor he owes a perfectly trained figure which he carries erect and trim and the ends of his moustache curl up elastic as watchsprings giving him an air which but for its spanish dignity would be called jaunty he is on the pleasantest terms with don juan his voice save for a much more distinguished intonation is so like the voice of roebuck ramsden that it calls attention to the fact that they are not unlike one another in spite of their very different fashion of shaving

don juan
ah here you are my friend why dont you learn to sing the splendid music mozart has written for you

the statue
unluckily he has written it for a bass voice mine is a counter tenor well have you repented yet

don juan
i have too much consideration for you to repent don gonzalo if i did you would have no excuse for coming from heaven to argue with me

the statue
true remain obdurate my boy i wish i had killed you as i should have done but for an accident then i should have come here and you would have had a statue and a reputation for piety to live up to any news

don juan
yes your daughter is dead

the statue
puzzled my daughter recollecting oh the one you were taken with let me see what was her name

don juan
ana

the statue
to be sure ana a goodlooking girl if i recollect aright have you warned whatshisname—her husband

don juan
my friend ottavio no i have not seen him since ana arrived
ana comes indignantly to light

ana
what does this mean ottavio here and your friend and you father have forgotten my name you are indeed turned to stone

the statue
my dear i am so much more admired in marble than i ever was in my own person that i have retained the shape the sculptor gave me he was one of the first men of his day you must acknowledge that

ana
father vanity personal vanity from you

the statue
ah you outlived that weakness my daughter you must be nearly 80 by this time i was cut off by an accident in my 64th year and am considerably your junior in consequence besides my child in this place what our libertine friend here would call the farce of parental wisdom is dropped regard me i beg as a fellow creature not as a father

ana
you speak as this villain speaks

the statue
juan is a sound thinker ana a bad fencer but a sound thinker

ana
horror creeping upon her i begin to understand these are devils mocking me i had better pray

the statue
consoling her no no no my child do not pray if you do you will throw away the main advantage of this place written over the gate here are the words leave every hope behind ye who enter only think what a relief that is for what is hope a form of moral responsibility here there is no hope and consequently no duty no work nothing to be gained by praying nothing to be lost by doing what you like hell in short is a place where you have nothing to do but amuse yourself don juan sighs deeply you sigh friend juan but if you dwelt in heaven as i do you would realize your advantages

don juan
you are in good spirits today commander you are positively brilliant what is the matter

the statue
i have come to a momentous decision my boy but first where is our friend the devil i must consult him in the matter and ana would like to make his acquaintance no doubt

ana
you are preparing some torment for me

don juan
all that is superstition ana reassure yourself remember the devil is not so black as he is painted

the statue
let us give him a call
at the wave of the statues hand the great chords roll out again but this time mozarts music gets grotesquely adulterated with gounods a scarlet halo begins to glow and into it the devil rises very mephistophelean and not at all unlike mendoza though not so interesting he looks older is getting prematurely bald and in spite of an effusion of goodnature and friendliness is peevish and sensitive when his advances are not reciprocated he does not inspire much confidence in his powers of hard work or endurance and is on the whole a disagreeably selfindulgent looking person but he is clever and plausible though perceptibly less well bred than the two other men and enormously less vital than the woman

the devil
heartily have i the pleasure of again receiving a visit from the illustrious commander of calatrava coldly don juan your servant politely and a strange lady my respects senora

ana
are you—

the devil
bowing lucifer at your service

ana
i shall go mad

the devil
gallantly ah senora do not be anxious you come to us from earth full of the prejudices and terrors of that priestridden place you have heard me ill spoken of and yet believe me i have hosts of friends there

ana
yes you reign in their hearts

the devil
shaking his head you flatter me senora but you are mistaken it is true that the world cannot get on without me but it never gives me credit for that in its heart it mistrusts and hates me its sympathies are all with misery with poverty with starvation of the body and of the heart i call on it to sympathize with joy with love with happiness with beauty

don juan
nauseated excuse me i am going you know i cannot stand this

the devil
angrily yes i know that you are no friend of mine

the statue
what harm is he doing you juan it seems to me that he was talking excellent sense when you interrupted him

the devil
warmly shaking the statues hand thank you my friend thank you you have always understood me he has always disparaged and avoided me

don juan
i have treated you with perfect courtesy

the devil
courtesy what is courtesy i care nothing for mere courtesy give me warmth of heart true sincerity the bond of sympathy with love and joy—

don juan
you are making me ill

the devil
there appealing to the statue you hear sir oh by what irony of fate was this cold selfish egotist sent to my kingdom and you taken to the icy mansions of the sky

the statue
i cant complain i was a hypocrite and it served me right to be sent to heaven

the devil
why sir do you not join us and leave a sphere for which your temperament is too sympathetic your heart too warm your capacity for enjoyment too generous

the statue
i have this day resolved to do so in future excellent son of the morning i am yours i have left heaven for ever

the devil
again grasping his hand ah what an honor for me what a triumph for our cause thank you thank you and now my friend—i may call you so at last—could you not persuade him to take the place you have left vacant above

the statue
shaking his head i cannot conscientiously recommend anybody with whom i am on friendly terms to deliberately make himself dull and uncomfortable

the devil
of course not but are you sure he would be uncomfortable of course you know best you brought him here originally and we had the greatest hopes of him his sentiments were in the best taste of our best people you remember how he sang he begins to sing in a nasal operatic baritone tremulous from an eternity of misuse in the french manner

                vivan le femmine
                viva il buon vino

the statue
taking up the tune an octave higher in his counter tenor
                sostegno a gloria
                dumanita

the devil
precisely well he never sings for us now

don juan
do you complain of that hell is full of musical amateurs music is the brandy of the damned may not one lost soul be permitted to abstain

the devil
you dare blaspheme against the sublimest of the arts

don juan
with cold disgust you talk like a hysterical woman fawning on a fiddler

the devil
i am not angry i merely pity you you have no soul and you are unconscious of all that you lose now you senor commander are a born musician how well you sing mozart would be delighted if he were still here but he moped and went to heaven curious how these clever men whom you would have supposed born to be popular here have turned out social failures like don juan

don juan
i am really very sorry to be a social failure

the devil
not that we dont admire your intellect you know we do but i look at the matter from your own point of view you dont get on with us the place doesnt suit you the truth is you have—i wont say no heart for we know that beneath all your affected cynicism you have a warm one

don juan
shrinking dont please dont

the devil
nettled well youve no capacity for enjoyment will that satisfy you

don juan
it is a somewhat less insufferable form of cant than the other but if youll allow me ill take refuge as usual in solitude

the devil
why not take refuge in heaven thats the proper place for you to ana come senora could you not persuade him for his own good to try a change of air

ana
but can he go to heaven if he wants to

the devil
whats to prevent him

ana
can anybody—can i go to heaven if i want to

the devil
rather contemptuously certainly if your taste lies that way

ana
but why doesnt everybody go to heaven then

the statue
chuckling i can tell you that my dear its because heaven is the most angelically dull place in all creation thats why

the devil
his excellency the commander puts it with military bluntness but the strain of living in heaven is intolerable there is a notion that i was turned out of it but as a matter of fact nothing could have induced me to stay there i simply left it and organized this place

the statue
i dont wonder at it nobody could stand an eternity of heaven

the devil
oh it suits some people let us be just commander it is a question of temperament i dont admire the heavenly temperament i dont understand it i dont know that i particularly want to understand it but it takes all sorts to make a universe there is no accounting for tastes there are people who like it i think don juan would like it

don juan
but—pardon my frankness—could you really go back there if you desired to or are the grapes sour

the devil
back there i often go back there have you never read the book of job have you any canonical authority for assuming that there is any barrier between our circle and the other one

ana
but surely there is a great gulf fixed

the devil
dear lady a parable must not be taken literally the gulf is the difference between the angelic and the diabolic temperament what more impassable gulf could you have think of what you have seen on earth there is no physical gulf between the philosophers class room and the bull ring but the bull fighters do not come to the class room for all that have you ever been in the country where i have the largest following—england there they have great racecourses and also concert rooms where they play the classical compositions of his excellencys friend mozart those who go to the racecourses can stay away from them and go to the classical concerts instead if they like there is no law against it for englishmen never will be slaves they are free to do whatever the government and public opinion allows them to do and the classical concert is admitted to be a higher more cultivated poetic intellectual ennobling place than the racecourse but do the lovers of racing desert their sport and flock to the concert room not they they would suffer there all the weariness the commander has suffered in heaven there is the great gulf of the parable between the two places a mere physical gulf they could bridge or at least i could bridge it for them the earth is full of devils bridges but the gulf of dislike is impassable and eternal and that is the only gulf that separates my friends here from those who are invidiously called the blest

ana
i shall go to heaven at once

the statue
my child one word of warning first let me complete my friend lucifers similitude of the classical concert at every one of those concerts in england you will find rows of weary people who are there not because they really like classical music but because they think they ought to like it well there is the same thing in heaven a number of people sit there in glory not because they are happy but because they think they owe it to their position to be in heaven they are almost all english

the devil
yes the southerners give it up and join me just as you have done but the english really do not seem to know when they are thoroughly miserable an englishman thinks he is moral when he is only uncomfortable

the statue
in short my daughter if you go to heaven without being naturally qualified for it you will not enjoy yourself there

ana
and who dares say that i am not naturally qualified for it the most distinguished princes of the church have never questioned it i owe it to myself to leave this place at once

the devil
offended as you please senora i should have expected better taste from you

ana
father i shall expect you to come with me you cannot stay here what will people say

the statue
people why the best people are here—princes of the church and all so few go to heaven and so many come here that the blest once called a heavenly host are a continually dwindling minority the saints the fathers the elect of long ago are the cranks the faddists the outsiders of today
the devil
it is true from the beginning of my career i knew that i should win in the long run by sheer weight of public opinion in spite of the long campaign of misrepresentation and calumny against me at bottom the universe is a constitutional one and with such a majority as mine i cannot be kept permanently out of office

don juan
i think ana you had better stay here

ana
jealously you do not want me to go with you

don juan
surely you do not want to enter heaven in the company of a reprobate like me

ana
all souls are equally precious you repent do you not

don juan
my dear ana you are silly do you suppose heaven is like earth where people persuade themselves that what is done can be undone by repentance that what is spoken can be unspoken by withdrawing it that what is true can be annihilated by a general agreement to give it the lie no heaven is the home of the masters of reality that is why i am going thither

ana
thank you i am going to heaven for happiness i have had quite enough of reality on earth

don juan
then you must stay here for hell is the home of the unreal and of the seekers for happiness it is the only refuge from heaven which is as i tell you the home of the masters of reality and from earth which is the home of the slaves of reality the earth is a nursery in which men and women play at being heros and heroines saints and sinners but they are dragged down from their fools paradise by their bodies hunger and cold and thirst age and decay and disease death above all make them slaves of reality thrice a day meals must be eaten and digested thrice a century a new generation must be engendered ages of faith of romance and of science are all driven at last to have but one prayer make me a healthy animal but here you escape the tyranny of the flesh for here you are not an animal at all you are a ghost an appearance an illusion a convention deathless ageless in a word bodiless there are no social questions here no political questions no religious questions best of all perhaps no sanitary questions here you call your appearance beauty your emotions love your sentiments heroism your aspirations virtue just as you did on earth but here there are no hard facts to contradict you no ironic contrast of your needs with your pretensions no human comedy nothing but a perpetual romance a universal melodrama as our german friend put it in his poem the poetically nonsensical here is good sense and the eternal feminine draws us ever upward and on—without getting us a step farther and yet you want to leave this paradise

ana
but if hell be so beautiful as this how glorious must heaven be
the devil the statue and don juan all begin to speak at once in violent protest then stop abashed

don juan
i beg your pardon

the devil
not at all i interrupted you

the statue
you were going to say something

don juan
after you gentlemen

the devil
to don juan you have been so eloquent on the advantages of my dominions that i leave you to do equal justice to the drawbacks of the alternative establishment

don juan
in heaven as i picture it dear lady you live and work instead of playing and pretending you face things as they are you escape nothing but glamor and your steadfastness and your peril are your glory if the play still goes on here and on earth and all the world is a stage heaven is at least behind the scenes but heaven cannot be described by metaphor thither i shall go presently because there i hope to escape at last from lies and from the tedious vulgar pursuit of happiness to spend my eons in contemplation—

the statue
ugh

don juan
senor commander i do not blame your disgust a picture gallery is a dull place for a blind man but even as you enjoy the contemplation of such romantic mirages as beauty and pleasure so would i enjoy the contemplation of that which interests me above all things namely life the force that ever strives to attain greater power of contemplating itself what made this brain of mine do you think not the need to move my limbs for a rat with half my brains moves as well as i not merely the need to do but the need to know what i do lest in my blind efforts to live i should be slaying myself

the statue
you would have slain yourself in your blind efforts to fence but for my foot slipping my friend

don juan
audacious ribald your laughter will finish in hideous boredom before morning

the statue
ha ha do you remember how i frightened you when i said something like that to you from my pedestal in seville it sounds rather flat without my trombones

don juan
they tell me it generally sounds flat with them commander

ana
oh do not interrupt with these frivolities father is there nothing in heaven but contemplation juan

don juan
in the heaven i seek no other joy but there is the work of helping life in its struggle upward think of how it wastes and scatters itself how it raises up obstacles to itself and destroys itself in its ignorance and blindness it needs a brain this irresistible force lest in its ignorance it should resist itself what a piece of work is man says the poet yes but what a blunderer here is the highest miracle of organization yet attained by life the most intensely alive thing that exists the most conscious of all the organisms and yet how wretched are his brains stupidity made sordid and cruel by the realities learnt from toil and poverty imagination resolved to starve sooner than face these realities piling up illusions to hide them and calling itself cleverness genius and each accusing the other of its own defect stupidity accusing imagination of folly and imagination accusing stupidity of ignorance whereas alas stupidity has all the knowledge and imagination all the intelligence

the devil
and a pretty kettle of fish they make of it between them did i not say when i was arranging that affair of fausts that all mans reason has done for him is to make him beastlier than any beast one splendid body is worth the brains of a hundred dyspeptic flatulent philosophers

don juan
you forget that brainless magnificence of body has been tried things immeasurably greater than man in every respect but brain have existed and perished the megatherium the icthyosaurus have paced the earth with sevenleague steps and hidden the day with cloud vast wings where are they now fossils in museums and so few and imperfect at that that a knuckle bone or a tooth of one of them is prized beyond the lives of a thousand soldiers these things lived and wanted to live but for lack of brains they did not know how to carry out th
eir purpose and so destroyed themselves

the devil
and is man any the less destroying himself for all this boasted brain of his have you walked up and down upon the earth lately i have and i have examined mans wonderful inventions and i tell you that in the arts of life man invents nothing but in the arts of death he outdoes nature herself and produces by chemistry and machinery all the slaughter of plague pestilence and famine the peasant i tempt today eats and drinks what was eaten and drunk by the peasants of ten thousand years ago and the house he lives in has not altered as much in a thousand centuries as the fashion of a ladys bonnet in a score of weeks but when he goes out to slay he carries a marvel of mechanism that lets loose at the touch of his finger all the hidden molecular energies and leaves the javelin the arrow the blowpipe of his fathers far behind in the arts of peace man is a bungler i have seen his cotton factories and the like with machinery that a greedy dog could have invented if it had wanted money instead of food i know his clumsy typewriters and bungling locomotives and tedious bicycles they are toys compared to the maxim gun the submarine torpedo boat there is nothing in mans industrial machinery but his greed and sloth his heart is in his weapons this marvellous force of life of which you boast is a force of death man measures his strength by his destructiveness what is his religion an excuse for hating me what is his law an excuse for hanging you what is his morality gentility an excuse for consuming without producing what is his art an excuse for gloating over pictures of slaughter what are his politics either the worship of a despot because a despot can kill or parliamentary cockfighting i spent an evening lately in a certain celebrated legislature and heard the pot lecturing the kettle for its blackness and ministers answering questions when i left i chalked up on the door the old nursery saying—ask no questions and you will be told no lies i bought a sixpenny family magazine and found it full of pictures of young men shooting and stabbing one another i saw a man die he was a london bricklayers laborer with seven children he left seventeen pounds club money and his wife spent it all on his funeral and went into the workhouse with the children next day she would not have spent sevenpence on her childrens schooling the law had to force her to let them be taught gratuitously but on death she spent all she had their imagination glows their energies rise up at the idea of death these people they love it and the more horrible it is the more they enjoy it hell is a place far above their comprehension they derive their notion of it from two of the greatest fools that ever lived an italian and an englishman the italian described it as a place of mud frost filth fire and venomous serpents all torture this ass when he was not lying about me was maundering about some woman whom he saw once in the street the englishman described me as being expelled from heaven by cannons and gunpowder and to this day every briton believes that the whole of his silly story is in the bible what else he says i do not know for it is all in a long poem which neither i nor anyone else ever succeeded in wading through it is the same in everything the highest form of literature is the tragedy a play in which everybody is murdered at the end in the old chronicles you read of earthquakes and pestilences and are told that these showed the power and majesty of god and the littleness of man nowadays the chronicles describe battles in a battle two bodies of men shoot at one another with bullets and explosive shells until one body runs away when the others chase the fugitives on horseback and cut them to pieces as they fly and this the chronicle concludes shows the greatness and majesty of empires and the littleness of the vanquished over such battles the people run about the streets yelling with delight and egg their governments on to spend hundreds of millions of money in the slaughter whilst the strongest ministers dare not spend an extra penny in the pound against the poverty and pestilence through which they themselves daily walk i could give you a thousand instances but they all come to the same thing the power that governs the earth is not the power of life but of death and the inner need that has nerved life to the effort of organizing itself into the human being is not the need for higher life but for a more efficient engine of destruction the plague the famine the earthquake the tempest were too spasmodic in their action the tiger and crocodile were too easily satiated and not cruel enough something more constantly more ruthlessly more ingeniously destructive was needed and that something was man the inventor of the rack the stake the gallows and the electrocutor of the sword and gun above all of justice duty patriotism and all the other isms by which even those who are clever enough to be humanely disposed are persuaded to become the most destructive of all the destroyers

don juan
pshaw all this is old your weak side my diabolic friend is that you have always been a gull you take man at his own valuation nothing would flatter him more than your opinion of him he loves to think of himself as bold and bad he is neither one nor the other he is only a coward call him tyrant murderer pirate bully and he will adore you and swagger about with the consciousness of having the blood of the old sea kings in his veins call him liar and thief and he will only take an action against you for libel but call him coward and he will go mad with rage he will face death to outface that stinging truth man gives every reason for his conduct save one every excuse for his crimes save one every plea for his safety save one and that one is his cowardice yet all his civilization is founded on his cowardice on his abject tameness which he calls his respectability there are limits to what a mule or an ass will stand but man will suffer himself to be degraded until his vileness becomes so loathsome to his oppressors that they themselves are forced to reform it

the devil
precisely and these are the creatures in whom you discover what you call a life force

don juan
yes for now comes the most surprising part of the whole business

the statue
whats that

don juan
why that you can make any of these cowards brave by simply putting an idea into his head

the statue
stuff as an old soldier i admit the cowardice its as universal as sea sickness and matters just as little but that about putting an idea into a mans head is stuff and nonsense in a battle all you need to make you fight is a little hot blood and the knowledge that its more dangerous to lose than to win

don juan
that is perhaps why battles are so useless but men never really overcome fear until they imagine they are fighting to further a universal purpose—fighting for an idea as they call it why was the crusader braver than the pirate because he fought not for himself but for the cross what force was it that met him with a valor as reckless as his own the force of men who fought not for themselves but for islam they took spain from us though we were fighting for our very hearths and homes but when we too fought for that mighty idea a catholic church we swept them back to africa

the devil
ironically what you a catholic senor don juan a devotee my congratulations

the statue
seriously come come as a soldier i can listen to nothing against the church

don juan
have no fear commander this idea of a catholic church will survive islam will survive the cross will survive even that vulgar pageant of incompetent schoolboyish gladiators which you call the army

the statue
juan you will force me to call you to account for this

don juan
useless i cannot fence every idea for which man will die will be a catholic idea when the spaniard learns at last that he is no better than the saracen and his prophet no better than mahomet he will arise more catholic than ever and die on a barricade across the filthy slum he starves in for universal liberty and equality

the statue
bosh

don juan
what you call bosh is the only thing men dare die for later on liberty will not be catholic enough men will die for human perfection to which they will sacrifice all their liberty gladly

the devil
ay they will never be at a loss for an excuse for killing one another

don juan
what of that it is not death that matters but the fear of death it is not killing and dying that degrade us but base living and accepting the wages and profits of degradation better ten dead men than one live slave or his master men shall yet rise up father against son and brother against brother and kill one another for the great catholic idea of abolishing slavery

the devil
yes when the liberty and equality of which you prate shall have made free white christians cheaper in the labor market than by auction at the block

don juan
never fear the white laborer shall have his turn too but i am not now defending the illusory forms the great ideas take i am giving you examples of the fact that this creature man who in his own selfish affairs is a coward to the backbone will fight for an idea like a hero he may be abject as a citizen but he is dangerous as a fanatic he can only be enslaved whilst he is spiritually weak enough to listen to reason i tell you gentlemen if you can show a man a piece of what he now calls gods work to do and what he will later on call by many new names you can make him entirely reckless of the consequences to himself personally

ana
yes he shirks all his responsibilities and leaves his wife to grapple with them

the statue
well said daughter do not let him talk you out of your common sense

the devil
alas senor commander now that we have got on to the subject of woman he will talk more than ever however i confess it is for me the one supremely interesting subject

don juan
to a woman senora mans duties and responsibilities begin and end with the task of getting bread for her children to her man is only a means to the end of getting children and rearing them

ana
is that your idea of a womans mind i call it cynical and disgusting materialism

don juan
pardon me ana i said nothing about a womans whole mind i spoke of her view of man as a separate sex it is no more cynical than her view of herself as above all things a mother sexually woman is natures contrivance for perpetuating its highest achievement sexually man is womans contrivance for fulfilling natures behest in the most economical way she knows by instinct that far back in the evolutional process she invented him differentiated him created him in order to produce something better than the singlesexed process can produce whilst he fulfils the purpose for which she made him he is welcome to his dreams his follies his ideals his heroisms provided that the keystone of them all is the worship of woman of motherhood of the family of the hearth but how rash and dangerous it was to invent a separate creature whose sole function was her own impregnation for mark what has happened first man has multiplied on her hands until there are as many men as women so that she has been unable to employ for her purposes more than a fraction of the immense energy she has left at his disposal by saving him the exhausting labor of gestation this superfluous energy has gone to his brain and to his muscle he has become too strong to be controlled by her bodily and too imaginative and mentally vigorous to be content with mere selfreproduction he has created civilization without consulting her taking her domestic labor for granted as the foundation of it

ana
that is true at all events

the devil
yes and this civilization what is it after all

don juan
after all an excellent peg to hang your cynical commonplaces on but before all it is an attempt on mans part to make himself something more than the mere instrument of womans purpose so far the result of lifes continual effort not only to maintain itself but to achieve higher and higher organization and completer selfconsciousness is only at best a doubtful campaign between its forces and those of death and degeneration the battles in this campaign are mere blunders mostly won like actual military battles in spite of the commanders

the statue that is a dig at me no matter go on go on

don juan
it is a dig at a much higher power than you commander still you must have noticed in your profession that even a stupid general can win battles when the enemys general is a little stupider

the statue
very seriously most true juan most true some donkeys have amazing luck

don juan
well the life force is stupid but it is not so stupid as the forces of death and degeneration besides these are in its pay all the time and so life wins after a fashion what mere copiousness of fecundity can supply and mere greed preserve we possess the survival of whatever form of civilization can produce the best rifle and the best fed riflemen is assured
the devil
exactly the survival not of the most effective means of life but of the most effective means of death you always come back to my point in spite of your wrigglings and evasions and sophistries not to mention the intolerable length of your speeches

don juan
oh come who began making long speeches however if i overtax your intellect you can leave us and seek the society of love and beauty and the rest of your favorite boredoms

the devil
much offended this is not fair don juan and not civil i am also on the intellectual plane nobody can appreciate it more than i do i am arguing fairly with you and i think utterly refuting you let us go on for another hour if you like

don juan
good let us

the statue
not that i see any prospect of your coming to any point in particular juan still since in this place instead of merely killing time we have to kill eternity go ahead by all means

don juan
somewhat impatiently my point you marbleheaded old masterpiece is only a step ahead of you are we agreed that life is a force which has made innumerable experiments in organizing itself that the mammoth and the man the mouse and the megatherium the flies and the fleas and the fathers of the church are all more or less successful attempts to build up that raw force into higher and higher individuals the ideal individual being omnipotent omniscient infallible and withal completely unilludedly selfconscious in short a god

the devil
i agree for the sake of argument

the statue
i agree for the sake of avoiding argument

ana
i most emphatically disagree as regards the fathers of the church and i must beg you not to drag them into the argument

don juan
i did so purely for the sake of alliteration ana and i shall make no further allusion to them and now since we are with that exception agreed so far will you not agree with me further that life has not measured the success of its attempts at godhead by the beauty or bodily perfection of the result since in both these respects the birds as our friend aristophanes long ago pointed out are so extraordinarily superior with their power of flight and their lovely plumage and may i add the touching poetry of their loves and nestings that it is inconceivable that life having once produced them should if love and beauty were her object start off on another line and labor at the clumsy elephant and the hideous ape whose grandchildren we are

ana
aristophanes was a heathen and you juan i am afraid are very little better

the devil
you conclude then that life was driving at clumsiness and ugliness

don juan
no perverse devil that you are a thousand times no life was driving at brains—at its darling object an organ by which it can attain not only selfconsciousness but selfunderstanding

the statue
this is metaphysics juan why the devil should—to the devil i beg your pardon
the devil
pray dont mention it i have always regarded the use of my name to secure additional emphasis as a high compliment to me it is quite at your service commander

the statue
thank you thats very good of you even in heaven i never quite got out of my old military habits of speech what i was going to ask juan was why life should bother itself about getting a brain why should it want to understand itself why not be content to enjoy itself

don juan
without a brain commander you would enjoy yourself without knowing it and so lose all the fun

the statue
true most true but i am quite content with brain enough to know that im enjoying myself i dont want to understand why in fact id rather not my experience is that ones pleasures dont bear thinking about

don juan
that is why intellect is so unpopular but to life the force behind the man intellect is a necessity because without it he blunders into death just as life after ages of struggle evolved that wonderful bodily organ the eye so that the living organism could see where it was going and what was coming to help or threaten it and thus avoid a thousand dangers that formerly slew it so it is evolving today a minds eye that shall see not the physical world but the purpose of life and thereby enable the individual to work for that purpose instead of thwarting and baffling it by setting up shortsighted personal aims as at present even as it is only one sort of man has ever been happy has ever been universally respected among all the conflicts of interests and illusions

the statue
you mean the military man

don juan
commander i do not mean the military man when the military man approaches the world locks up its spoons and packs off its womankind no i sing not arms and the hero but the philosophic man he who seeks in contemplation to discover the inner will of the world in invention to discover the means of fulfilling that will and in action to do that will by the sodiscovered means of all other sorts of men i declare myself tired theyre tedious failures when i was on earth professors of all sorts prowled round me feeling for an unhealthy spot in me on which they could fasten the doctors of medicine bade me consider what i must do to save my body and offered me quack cures for imaginary diseases i replied that i was not a hypochondriac so they called me ignoramus and went their way the doctors of divinity bade me consider what i must do to save my soul but i was not a spiritual hypochondriac any more than a bodily one and would not trouble myself about that either so they called me atheist and went their way after them came the politician who said there was only one purpose in nature and that was to get him into parliament i told him i did not care whether he got into parliament or not so he called me mugwump and went his way then came the romantic man the artist with his love songs and his paintings and his poems and with him i had great delight for many years and some profit for i cultivated my senses for his sake and his songs taught me to hear better his paintings to see better and his poems to feel more deeply but he led me at last into the worship of woman

ana
juan

don juan
yes i came to believe that in her voice was all the music of the song in her face all the beauty of the painting and in her soul all the emotion of the poem

ana
and you were disappointed i suppose well was it her fault that you attributed all these perfections to her

don juan
yes partly for with a wonderful instinctive cunning she kept silent and allowed me to glorify her to mistake my own visions thoughts and feelings for hers now my friend the romantic man was often too poor or too timid to approach those women who were beautiful or refined enough to seem to realize his ideal and so he went to his grave believing in his dream but i was more favored by nature and circumstance i was of noble birth and rich and when my person did not please my conversation flattered though i generally found myself fortunate in both

the statue
coxcomb

don juan
yes but even my coxcombry pleased well i found that when i had touched a womans imagination she would allow me to persuade myself that she loved me but when my suit was granted she never said i am happy my love is satisfied she always said first at last the barriers are down and second when will you come again

ana
that is exactly what men say

don juan
i protest i never said it but all women say it well these two speeches always alarmed me for the first meant that the ladys impulse had been solely to throw down my fortifications and gain my citadel and the second openly announced that henceforth she regarded me as her property and counted my time as already wholly at her disposal

the devil
that is where your want of heart came in

the statue
shaking his head you shouldnt repeat what a woman says juan

ana
severely it should be sacred to you

the statue
still they certainly do always say it i never minded the barriers but there was always a slight shock about the other unless one was very hard hit indeed

don juan
then the lady who had been happy and idle enough before became anxious preoccupied with me always intriguing conspiring pursuing watching waiting bent wholly on making sure of her prey—i being the prey you understand now this was not what i had bargained for it may have been very proper and very natural but it was not music painting poetry and joy incarnated in a beautiful woman i ran away from it i ran away from it very often in fact i became famous for running away from it

ana
infamous you mean

don juan
i did not run away from you do you blame me for running away from the others

ana
nonsense man you are talking to a woman of 77 now if you had had the chance you would have run away from me too—if i had let you you would not have found it so easy with me as with some of the others if men will not be faithful to their home and their duties they must be made to be i daresay you all want to marry lovely incarnations of music and painting and poetry well you cant have them because they dont exist if flesh and blood is not good enough for you you must go without thats all women have to put up with fleshandblood husbands—and little enough of that too sometimes and you will have to put up with fleshandblood wives the devil looks dubious the statue makes a wry face i see you dont like that any of you but its true for all that so if you dont like it you can lump it

don juan
my dear lady you have put my whole case against romance into a few sentences that is just why i turned my back on the romantic man with the artist nature as he called his infatuation i thanked him for teaching me to use my eyes and ears but i told him that his beauty worshipping and happiness hunting and woman idealizing was not worth a dump as a philosophy of life so he called me philistine and went his way

ana
it seems that woman taught you something too with all her defects

don juan
she did more she interpreted all the other teaching for me ah my friends when the barriers were down for the first time what an astounding illumination i had been prepared for infatuation for intoxication for all the illusions of loves young dream and lo never was my perception clearer nor my criticism more ruthless the most jealous rival of my mistress never saw every blemish in her more keenly than i i was not duped i took her without chloroform

ana
but you did take her

don juan
that was the revelation up to that moment i had never lost the sense of being my own master never consciously taken a single step until my reason had examined and approved it i had come to believe that i was a purely rational creature a thinker i said with the foolish philosopher i think therefore i am it was woman who taught me to say i am therefore i think and also i would think more therefore i must be more

the statue
this is extremely abstract and metaphysical juan if you would stick to the concrete and put your discoveries in the form of entertaining anecdotes about your adventures with women your conversation would be easier to follow

don juan
bah what need i add do you not understand that when i stood face to face with woman every fibre in my clear critical brain warned me to spare her and save myself my morals said no my conscience said no my chivalry and pity for her said no my prudent regard for myself said no my ear practised on a thousand songs and symphonies my eye exercised on a thousand paintings tore her voice her features her color to shreds i caught all those telltale resemblances to her father and mother by which i knew what she would be like in thirty years time i noted the gleam of gold from a dead tooth in the laughing mouth i made curious observations of the strange odors of the chemistry of the nerves the visions of my romantic reveries in which i had trod the plains of heaven with a deathless ageless creature of coral and ivory deserted me in that supreme hour i remembered them and desperately strove to recover their illusion but they now seemed the emptiest of inventions my judgment was not to be corrupted my brain still said no on every issue and whilst i was in the act of framing my excuse to the lady life seized me and threw me into her arms as a sailor throws a scrap of fish into the mouth of a seabird

the statue
you might as well have gone without thinking such a lot about it juan you are like all the clever men you have more brains than is good for you

the devil
and were you not the happier for the experience senor don juan

don juan
the happier no the wiser yes that moment introduced me for the first time to myself and through myself to the world i saw then how useless it is to attempt to impose conditions on the irresistible force of life to preach prudence careful selection virtue honor chastity—

ana
don juan a word against chastity is an insult to me

don juan
i say nothing against your chastity senora since it took the form of a husband and twelve children what more could you have done had you been the most abandoned of women

ana
i could have had twelve husbands and no children thats what i could have done juan and let me tell you that that would have made all the difference to the earth which i replenished

the statue
bravo ana juan you are floored quelled annihilated

don juan
no for though that difference is the true essential difference—dona ana has i admit gone straight to the real point—yet it is not a difference of love or chastity or even constancy for twelve children by twelve different husbands would have replenished the earth perhaps more effectively suppose my friend ottavio had died when you were thirty you would never have remained a widow you were too beautiful suppose the successor of ottavio had died when you were forty you would still have been irresistible and a woman who marries twice marries three times if she becomes free to do so twelve lawful children borne by one highly respectable lady to three different fathers is not impossible nor condemned by public opinion that such a lady may be more law abiding than the poor girl whom we used to spurn into the gutter for bearing one unlawful infant is no doubt true but dare you say she is less selfindulgent

ana
she is less virtuous that is enough for me

don juan
in that case what is virtue but the trade unionism of the married let us face the facts dear ana the life force respects marriage only because marriage is a contrivance of its own to secure the greatest number of children and the closest care of them for honor chastity and all the rest of your moral figments it cares not a rap marriage is the most licentious of human institutions—

ana
juan

the statue
protesting really—

don juan
determinedly i say the most licentious of human institutions that is the secret of its popularity and a woman seeking a husband is the most unscrupulous of all the beasts of prey the confusion of marriage with morality has done more to destroy the conscience of the human race than any other single error come ana do not look shocked you know better than any of us that marriage is a mantrap baited with simulated accomplishments and delusive idealizations when your sainted mother by dint of scoldings and punishments forced you to learn how to play half a dozen pieces on the spinet which she hated as much as you did—had she any other purpose than to delude your suitors into the belief that your husband would have in his home an angel who would fill it with melody or at least play him to sleep after dinner you married my friend ottavio well did you ever open the spinet from the hour when the church united him to you

ana
you are a fool juan a young married woman has something else to do than sit at the spinet without any support for her back so she gets out of the habit of playing

don juan
not if she loves music no believe me she only throws away the bait when the bird is in the net

ana
bitterly and men i suppose never throw off the mask when their bird is in the net the husband never becomes negligent selfish brutal—oh never

don juan
what do these recriminations prove ana only that the hero is as gross an imposture as the heroine

ana
it is all nonsense most marriages are perfectly comfortable

don juan
perfectly is a strong expression ana what you mean is that sensible people make the best of one another send me to the galleys and chain me to the felon whose number happens to be next before mine and i must accept the inevitable and make the best of the companionship many such companionships they tell me are touchingly affectionate and most are at least tolerably friendly but that does not make a chain a desirable ornament nor the galleys an abode of bliss those who talk most about the blessings of marriage and the constancy of its vows are the very people who declare that if the chain were broken and the prisoners left free to choose the whole social fabric would fly asunder you cannot have the argument both ways if the prisoner is happy why lock him in if he is not why pretend that he is

ana
at all events let me take an old womans privilege again and tell you flatly that marriage peoples the world and debauchery does not

don juan
how if a time comes when this shall cease to be true do you not know that where there is a will there is a way—that whatever man really wishes to do he will finally discover a means of doing well you have done your best you virtuous ladies and others of your way of thinking to bend mans mind wholly towards honorable love as the highest good and to understand by honorable love romance and beauty and happiness in the possession of beautiful refined delicate affectionate women you have taught women to value their own youth health shapeliness and refinement above all things well what place have squalling babies and household cares in this exquisite paradise of the senses and emotions is it not the inevitable end of it all that the human will shall say to the human brain invent me a means by which i can have love beauty romance emotion passion without their wretched penalties their expenses their worries their trials their illnesses and agonies and risks of death their retinue of servants and nurses and doctors and schoolmasters

the devil
all this senor don juan is realized here in my realm

don juan
yes at the cost of death man will not take it at that price he demands the romantic delights of your hell whilst he is still on earth well the means will be found the brain will not fail when the will is in earnest the day is coming when great nations will find their numbers dwindling from census to census when the six roomed villa will rise in price above the family mansion when the viciously reckless poor and the stupidly pious rich will delay the extinction of the race only by degrading it whilst the boldly prudent the thriftily selfish and ambitious the imaginative and poetic the lovers of money and solid comfort the worshippers of success art and of love will all oppose to the force of life the device of sterility

the statue
that is all very eloquent my young friend but if you had lived to anas age or even to mine you would have learned that the people who get rid of the fear of poverty and children and all the other family troubles and devote themselves to having a good time of it only leave their minds free for the fear of old age and ugliness and impotence and death the childless laborer is more tormented by his wifes idleness and her constant demands for amusement and distraction than he could be by twenty children and his wife is more wretched than he i have had my share of vanity for as a young man i was admired by women and as a statue i am praised by art critics but i confess that had i found nothing to do in the world but wallow in these delights i should have cut my throat when i married anas mother—or perhaps to be strictly correct i should rather say when i at last gave in and allowed anas mother to marry me—i knew that i was planting thorns in my pillow and that marriage for me a swaggering young officer thitherto unvanquished meant defeat and capture

ana
scandalized father

the statue
i am sorry to shock you my love but since juan has stripped every rag of decency from the discussion i may as well tell the frozen truth

ana
hmf i suppose i was one of the thorns

the statue
by no means you were often a rose you see your mother had most of the trouble you gave

don juan
then may i ask commander why you have left heaven to come here and wallow as you express it in sentimental beatitudes which you confess would once have driven you to cut your throat

the statue
struck by this egad thats true

the devil
alarmed what you are going back from your word to don juan and all your philosophizing has been nothing but a mask for proselytizing to the statue have you forgotten already the hideous dulness from which i am offering you a refuge here to don juan and does your demonstration of the approaching sterilization and extinction of mankind lead to anything better than making the most of those pleasures of art and love which you yourself admit refined you elevated you developed you

don juan
i never demonstrated the extinction of mankind life cannot will its own extinction either in its blind amorphous state or in any of the forms into which it has organized itself i had not finished when his excellency interrupted me

the statue
i begin to doubt whether you ever will finish my friend you are extremely fond of hearing yourself talk

don juan
true but since you have endured so much you may as well endure to the end long before this sterilization which i described becomes more than a clearly foreseen possibility the reaction will begin the great central purpose of breeding the race ay breeding it to heights now deemed superhuman that purpose which is now hidden in a mephitic cloud of love and romance and prudery and fastidiousness will break through into clear sunlight as a purpose no longer to be confused with the gratification of personal fancies the impossible realization of boys and girls dreams of bliss or the need of older people for companionship or money the plainspoken marriage services of the vernacular churches will no longer be abbreviated and half suppressed as indelicate the sober decency earnestness and authority of their declaration of the real purpose of marriage will be honored and accepted whilst their romantic vowings and pledgings and untildeathdouspartings and the like will be expunged as unbearable frivolities do my sex the justice to admit senora that we have always recognized that the sex relation is not a personal or friendly relation at all

ana
not a personal or friendly relation what relation is more personal more sacred more holy

don juan
sacred and holy if you like ana but not personally friendly your relation to god is sacred and holy dare you call it personally friendly in the sex relation the universal creative energy of which the parties are both the helpless agents overrides and sweeps away all personal considerations and dispenses with all personal relations the pair may be utter strangers to one another speaking different languages differing in race and color in age and disposition with no bond between them but a possibility of that fecundity for the sake of which the life force throws them into one anothers arms at the exchange of a glance do we not recognize this by allowing marriages to be made by parents without consulting the woman have you not often expressed your disgust at the immorality of the english nation in which women and men of noble birth become acquainted and court each other like peasants and how much does even the peasant know of his bride or she of him before he engages himself why you would not make a man your lawyer or your family doctor on so slight an acquaintance as you would fall in love with and marry him

ana
yes juan we know the libertines philosophy always ignore the consequences to the woman

don juan
the consequences yes they justify her fierce grip of the man but surely you do not call that attachment a sentimental one as well call the policemans attachment to his prisoner a love relation

ana
you see you have to confess that marriage is necessary though according to you love is the slightest of all the relations

don juan
how do you know that it is not the greatest of all the relations far too great to be a personal matter could your father have served his country if he had refused to kill any enemy of spain unless he personally hated him can a woman serve her country if she refuses to marry any man she does not personally love you know it is not so the woman of noble birth marries as the man of noble birth fights on political and family grounds not on personal ones

the statue
impressed a very clever point that juan i must think it over you are really full of ideas how did you come to think of this one

don juan
i learnt it by experience when i was on earth and made those proposals to ladies which though universally condemned have made me so interesting a hero of legend i was not infrequently met in some such way as this the lady would say that she would countenance my advances provided they were honorable on inquiring what that proviso meant i found that it meant that i proposed to get possession of her property if she had any or to undertake her support for life if she had not that i desired her continual companionship counsel and conversation to the end of my days and would bind myself under penalties to be always enraptured by them and above all that i would turn my back on all other women for ever for her sake i did not object to these conditions because they were exorbitant and inhuman it was their extraordinary irrelevance that prostrated me i invariably replied with perfect frankness that i had never dreamt of any of these things that unless the ladys character and intellect were equal or superior to my own her conversation must degrade and her counsel mislead me tha t her constant companionship might for all i knew become intolerably tedious to me that i could not answer for my feelings for a week in advance much less to the end of my life that to cut me off from all natural and unconstrained relations with the rest of my fellow creatures would narrow and warp me if i submitted to it and if not would bring me under the curse of clandestinity that finally my proposals to her were wholly unconnected with any of these matters and were the outcome of a perfectly simple impulse of my manhood towards her womanhood

ana
you mean that it was an immoral impulse

don juan
nature my dear lady is what you call immoral i blush for it but i cannot help it nature is a pandar time a wrecker and death a murderer i have always preferred to stand up to those facts and build institutions on their recognition you prefer to propitiate the three devils by proclaiming their chastity their thrift and their loving kindness and to base your institutions on these flatteries is it any wonder that the institutions do not work smoothly

the statue
what used the ladies to say juan

don juan
oh come confidence for confidence first tell me what you used to say to the ladies

the statue
i oh i swore that i would be faithful to the death that i should die if they refused me that no woman could ever be to me what she was—

ana
she who

the statue
whoever it happened to be at the time my dear i had certain things i always said one of them was that even when i was eighty one white hair of the woman i loved would make me tremble more than the thickest gold tress from the most beautiful young head another was that i could not bear the thought of anyone else being the mother of my children

don juan
revolted you old rascal

the statue
stoutly not a bit for i really believed it with all my soul at the moment i had a heart not like you and it was this sincerity that made me successful

don juan
sincerity to be fool enough to believe a ramping stamping thumping lie that is what you call sincerity to be so greedy for a woman that you deceive yourself in your eagerness to deceive her sincerity you call it

the statue
oh damn your sophistries i was a man in love not a lawyer and the women loved me for it bless them

don juan
they made you think so what will you say when i tell you that though i played the lawyer so callously they made me think so too i also had my moments of infatuation in which i gushed nonsense and believed it sometimes the desire to give pleasure by saying beautiful things so rose in me on the flood of emotion that i said them recklessly at other times i argued against myself with a devilish coldness that drew tears but i found it just as hard to escape in the one case as in the others when the ladys instinct was set on me there was nothing for it but lifelong servitude or flight

ana
you dare boast before me and my father that every woman found you irresistible

don juan
am i boasting it seems to me that i cut the most pitiable of figures besides i said when the ladys instinct was set on me it was not always so and then heavens what transports of virtuous indignation what overwhelming defiance to the dastardly seducer what scenes of imogen and iachimo

ana
i made no scenes i simply called my father

don juan
and he came sword in hand to vindicate outraged honor and morality by murdering me

the statue
murdering what do you mean did i kill you or did you kill me

don juan
which of us was the better fencer

the statue
i was

don juan
of course you were and yet you the hero of those scandalous adventures you have just been relating to us you had the effrontery to pose as the avenger of outraged morality and condemn me to death you would have slain me but for an accident

the statue
i was expected to juan that is how things were arranged on earth i was not a social reformer and i always did what it was customary for a gentleman to do

don juan
that may account for your attacking me but not for the revolting hypocrisy of your subsequent proceedings as a statue

the statue
that all came of my going to heaven

the devil
i still fail to see senor don juan that these episodes in your earthly career and in that of the senor commander in any way discredit my view of life here i repeat you have all that you sought without anything that you shrank from

don juan
on the contrary here i have everything that disappointed me without anything that i have not already tried and found wanting i tell you that as long as i can conceive something better than myself i cannot be easy unless i am striving to bring it into existence or clearing the way for it that is the law of my life that is the working within me of lifes incessant aspiration to higher organization wider deeper intenser selfconsciousness and clearer selfunderstanding it was the supremacy of this purpose that reduced love for me to the mere pleasure of a moment art for me to the mere schooling of my faculties religion for me to a mere excuse for laziness since it had set up a god who looked at the world and saw that it was good against the instinct in me that looked through my eyes at the world and saw that it could be improved i tell you that in the pursuit of my own pleasure my own health my own fortune i have never known happiness it was not love for woman that delivered me into her hands it was fatigue exhaustion when i was a child and bruised my head against a stone i ran to the nearest woman and cried away my pain against her apron when i grew up and bruised my soul against the brutalities and stupidities with which i had to strive i did again just what i had done as a child i have enjoyed too my rests my recuperations my breathing times my very prostrations after strife but rather would i be dragged through all the circles of the foolish italians inferno than through the pleasures of europe that is what has made this place of eternal pleasures so deadly to me it is the absence of this instinct in you that makes you that strange monster called a devil it is the success with which you have diverted the attention of men from their real purpose which in one degree or another is the same as mine to yours that has earned you the name of the tempter it is the fact that they are doing your will or rather drifting with your want of will instead of doing their own that makes them the uncomfortable false restless artificial petulant wretched creatures they are

the devil
mortified senor don juan you are uncivil to my friends

don juan
pooh why should i be civil to them or to you in this palace of lies a truth or two will not hurt you your friends are all the dullest dogs i know they are not beautiful they are only decorated they are not clean they are only shaved and starched they are not dignified they are only fashionably dressed they are not educated they are only college passmen they are not religious they are only pewrenters they are not moral they are only conventional they are not virtuous they are only cowardly they are not even vicious they are only frail they are not artistic they are only lascivious they are not prosperous they are only rich they are not loyal they are only servile not dutiful only sheepish not public spirited only patriotic not courageous only quarrelsome not determined only obstinate not masterful only domineering not selfcontrolled only obtuse not selfrespecting only vain not kind only sentimental not social only gregarious not considerate only polite not intelligent only opinionated not progressive only factious not imaginative only superstitious not just only vindictive not generous only propitiatory not disciplined only cowed and not truthful at all—liars every one of them to the very backbone of their souls

the statue
your flow of words is simply amazing juan how i wish i could have talked like that to my soldiers

the devil
it is mere talk though it has all been said before but what change has it ever made what notice has the world ever taken of it

don juan
yes it is mere talk but why is it mere talk because my friend beauty purity respectability religion morality art patriotism bravery and the rest are nothing but words which i or anyone else can turn inside out like a glove were they realities you would have to plead guilty to my indictment but fortunately for your selfrespect my diabolical friend they are not realities as you say they are mere words useful for duping barbarians into adopting civilization or the civilized poor into submitting to be robbed and enslaved that is the family secret of the governing caste and if we who are of that caste aimed at more life for the world instead of at more power and luxury for our miserable selves that secret would make us great now since i being a nobleman am in the secret too think how tedious to me must be your unending cant about all these moralistic figments and how squalidly disastrous your sacrifice of your lives to them if you even believed in your moral game enough to play it fairly it would be interesting to watch but you dont you cheat at every trick and if your opponent outcheats you you upset the table and try to murder him

the devil
on earth there may be some truth in this because the people are uneducated and cannot appreciate my religion of love and beauty but here—

don juan
oh yes i know here there is nothing but love and beauty ugh it is like sitting for all eternity at the first act of a fashionable play before the complications begin never in my worst moments of superstitious terror on earth did i dream that hell was so horrible i live like a hairdresser in the continual contemplation of beauty toying with silken tresses i breathe an atmosphere of sweetness like a confectioners shopboy commander are there any beautiful women in heaven

the statue
none absolutely none all dowdies not two pennorth of jewellery among a dozen of them they might be men of fifty

don juan
i am impatient to get there is the word beauty ever mentioned and are there any artistic people

the statue
i give you my word they wont admire a fine statue even when it walks past them

don juan
i go

the devil
don juan shall i be frank with you

don juan
were you not so before

the devil
as far as i went yes but i will now go further and confess to you that men get tired of everything of heaven no less than of hell and that all history is nothing but a record of the oscillations of the world between these two extremes an epoch is but a swing of the pendulum and each generation thinks the world is progressing because it is always moving but when you are as old as i am when you have a thousand times wearied of heaven like myself and the commander and a thousand times wearied of hell as you are wearied now you will no longer imagine that every swing from heaven to hell is an emancipation every swing from hell to heaven an evolution where you now see reform progress fulfilment of upward tendency continual ascent by man on the stepping stones of his dead selves to higher things you will see nothing but an infinite comedy of illusion you will discover the profound truth of the saying of my friend koheleth that there is nothing new under the sun vanitas vanitatum—

don juan
out of all patience by heaven this is worse than your cant about love and beauty clever dolt that you are is a man no better than a worm or a dog than a wolf because he gets tired of everything shall he give up eating because he destroys his appetite in the act of gratifying it is a field idle when it is fallow can the commander expend his hellish energy here without accumulating heavenly energy for his next term of blessedness granted that the great life force has hit on the device of the clockmakers pendulum and uses the earth for its bob that the history of each oscillation which seems so novel to us the actors is but the history of the last oscillation repeated nay more that in the unthinkable infinitude of time the sun throws off the earth and catches it again a thousand times as a circus rider throws up a ball and that the total of all our epochs is but the moment between the toss and the catch has the colossal mechanism no purpose

the devil
none my friend you think because you have a purpose nature must have one you might as well expect it to have fingers and toes because you have them

don juan
but i should not have them if they served no purpose and i my friend am as much a part of nature as my own finger is a part of me if my finger is the organ by which i grasp the sword and the mandoline my brain is the organ by which nature strives to understand itself my dogs brain serves only my dogs purposes but my brain labors at a knowledge which does nothing for me personally but make my body bitter to me and my decay and death a calamity were i not possessed with a purpose beyond my own i had better be a ploughman than a philosopher for the ploughman lives as long as the philosopher eats more sleeps better and rejoices in the wife of his bosom with less misgiving this is because the philosopher is in the grip of the life force this life force says to him i have done a thousand wonderful things unconsciously by merely willing to live and following the line of least resistance now i want to know myself and my destination and choose my path so i have made a special brain—a philosophers brain—to grasp this knowledge for me as the husbandmans hand grasps the plough for me and this says the life force to the philosopher must thou strive to do for me until thou diest when i will make another brain and another philosopher to carry on the work

the devil
what is the use of knowing

don juan
why to be able to choose the line of greatest advantage instead of yielding in the direction of the least resistance does a ship sail to its destination no better than a log drifts nowhither the philosopher is natures pilot and there you have our difference to be in hell is to drift to be in heaven is to steer

the devil
on the rocks most likely

don juan
pooh which ship goes oftenest on the rocks or to the bottom—the drifting ship or the ship with a pilot on board

the devil
well well go your way senor don juan i prefer to be my own master and not the tool of any blundering universal force i know that beauty is good to look at that music is good to hear that love is good to feel and that they are all good to think about and talk about i know that to be well exercised in these sensations emotions and studies is to be a refined and cultivated being whatever they may say of me in churches on earth i know that it is universally admitted in good society that the prince of darkness is a gentleman and that is enough for me as to your life force which you think irresistible it is the most resistible thing in the world for a person of any character but if you are naturally vulgar and credulous as all reformers are it will thrust you first into religion where you will sprinkle water on babies to save their souls from me then it will drive you from religion into science where you will snatch the babies from the water sprinkling and inoculate them with disease to save them from catching it accidentally then you will take to politics where you will become the catspaw of corrupt functionaries and the henchman of ambitious humbugs and the end will be despair and decrepitude broken nerve and shattered hopes vain regrets for that worst and silliest of wastes and sacrifices the waste and sacrifice of the power of enjoyment in a word the punishment of the fool who pursues the better before he has secured the good

don juan
but at least i shall not be bored the service of the life force has that advantage at all events so fare you well senor satan

the devil
amiably fare you well don juan i shall often think of our interesting chats about things in general i wish you every happiness heaven as i said before suits some people but if you should change your mind do not forget that the gates are always open here to the repentant prodigal if you feel at any time that warmth of heart sincere unforced affection innocent enjoyment and warm breathing palpitating reality—

don juan
why not say flesh and blood at once though we have left those two greasy commonplaces behind us

the devil
angrily you throw my friendly farewell back in my teeth then don juan

don juan
by no means but though there is much to be learnt from a cynical devil i really cannot stand a sentimental one senor commander you know the way to the frontier of hell and heaven be good enough to direct me

the statue
oh the frontier is only the difference between two ways of looking at things any road will take you across it if you really want to get there

don juan
good saluting dona ana senora your servant

ana
but i am going with you

don juan
i can find my own way to heaven ana but i cannot find yours he vanishes

ana
how annoying

the statue
calling after him bon voyage juan he wafts a final blast of his great rolling chords after him as a parting salute a faint echo of the first ghostly melody comes back in acknowledgment ah there he goes puffing a long breath out through his lips whew how he does talk theyll never stand it in heaven

the devil
gloomily his going is a political defeat i cannot keep these life worshippers they all go this is the greatest loss i have had since that dutch painter went—a fellow who would paint a hag of 70 with as much enjoyment as a venus of 20

the statue
i remember he came to heaven rembrandt

the devil
ay rembrandt there a something unnatural about these fellows do not listen to their gospel senor commander it is dangerous beware of the pursuit of the superhuman it leads to an indiscriminate contempt for the human to a man horses and dogs and cats are mere species outside the moral world well to the superman men and women are a mere species too also outside the moral world this don juan was kind to women and courteous to men as your daughter here was kind to her pet cats and dogs but such kindness is a denial of the exclusively human character of the soul

the statue
and who the deuce is the superman

the devil
oh the latest fashion among the life force fanatics did you not meet in heaven among the new arrivals that german polish madman—what was his name nietzsche

the statue
never heard of him

the devil well he came here first before he recovered his wits i had some hopes of him but he was a confirmed life force worshipper it was he who raked up the superman who is as old as prometheus and the 20th century will run after this newest of the old crazes when it gets tired of the world the flesh and your humble servant
the statue
superman is a good cry and a good cry is half the battle i should like to see this nietzsche

the devil
unfortunately he met wagner here and had a quarrel with him

the statue
quite right too mozart for me

the devil
oh it was not about music wagner once drifted into life force worship and invented a superman called siegfried but he came to his senses afterwards so when they met here nietzsche denounced him as a renegade and wagner wrote a pamphlet to prove that nietzsche was a jew and it ended in nietzsches going to heaven in a huff and a good riddance too and now my friend let us hasten to my palace and celebrate your arrival with a grand musical service

the statue
with pleasure youre most kind

the devil
this way commander we go down the old trap he places himself on the grave trap

the statue
good reflectively all the same the superman is a fine conception there is something statuesque about it he places himself on the grave trap beside the devil it begins to descend slowly red glow from the abyss ah this reminds me of old times

the devil
and me also

ana
stop the trap stops

the devil
you senora cannot come this way you will have an apotheosis but you will be at the palace before us

ana
that is not what i stopped you for tell me where can i find the superman

the devil
he is not yet created senora

the statue
and never will be probably let us proceed the red fire will make me sneeze they descend

ana
not yet created then my work is not yet done crossing herself devoutly i believe in the life to come crying to the universe a father—a father for the superman
she vanishes into the void and again there is nothing all existence seems suspended infinitely then vaguely there is a live human voice crying somewhere one sees with a shock a mountain peak showing faintly against a lighter background the sky has returned from afar and we suddenly remember where we were the cry becomes distinct and urgent it says automobile automobile the complete reality comes back with a rush in a moment it is full morning in the sierra and the brigands are scrambling to their feet and making for the road as the goatherd runs down from the hill warning them of the approach of another motor tanner and mendoza rise amazedly and stare at one another with scattered wits straker sits up to yawn for a moment before he gets on his feet making it a point of honor not to show any undue interest in the excitement of the bandits mendoza gives a quick look to see that his followers are attending to the alarm then exchanges a private word with tanner

mendoza
did you dream

tanner
damnably did you

mendoza
yes i forget what you were in it

tanner
so were you amazing

mendoza

duval

anarchist

the rowdy socialdemocrat
stampeding across the amphitheatre run everybody

mendoza

the sulky socialdemocrat

mendoza

the rowdy one

the sulky one two armored cars full o soldiers at the end o the valley
anarchist the shot was fired in the air it was a signal
straker whistles his favorite air which falls on the ears of the brigands like a funeral march

tanner
it is not an escort but an expedition to capture you we were advised to wait for it but i was in a hurry

the rowdy one
in an agony of apprehension and ow my good lord ere we are wytin for em luts tike to the mahntns

straker i gev my and to nobody see

mendoza
turning on him impressively young man if i am tried i shall plead guilty and explain what drove me from england home and duty do you wish to have the respectable name of straker dragged through the mud of a spanish criminal court the police will search me they will find louisas portrait it will be published in the illustrated papers you blench it will be your doing remember

straker
with baffled rage i dont care about the court its avin our name mixed up with yours that i object to you blackmailin swine you

mendoza
language unworthy of louisas brother but no matter you are muzzled that is enough for us he turns to face his own men who back uneasily across the amphitheatre towards the cave to take refuge behind him as a fresh party muffled for motoring comes from the road in riotous spirits ann who makes straight for tanner comes first then violet helped over the rough ground by hector holding her right hand and ramsden her left mendoza goes to his presidential block and seats himself calmly with his rank and file grouped behind him and his staff consisting of duval and the anarchist on his right and the two socialdemocrats on his left supporting him in flank

ann
its jack

tanner
caught

hector
why certainly it is i said it was you tanner weve just been stopped by a puncture the road is full of nails

violet
what are you doing here with all these men

ann
why did you leave us without a word of warning

hector
i want that bunch of roses miss whitefield to tanner when we found you were gone miss whitefield bet me a bunch of roses my car would not overtake yours before you reached monte carlo

tanner
but this is not the road to monte carlo
hector
no matter miss whitefield tracked you at every stopping place she is a regular sherlock holmes

tanner
the life force i am lost

octavius
bounding gaily down from the road into the amphitheatre and coming between tanner and straker i am so glad you are safe old chap we were afraid you had been captured by brigands

ramsden
who has been staring at mendoza i seem to remember the face of your friend here mendoza rises politely and advances with a smile between ann and ramsden

hector
why so do i

octavius
i know you perfectly well sir but i cant think where i have met you

mendoza
to violet do you remember me madam

violet
oh quite well but i am so stupid about names

mendoza
it was at the savoy hotel to hector you sir used to come with this lady violet to lunch to octavius you sir often brought this lady ann and her mother to dinner on your way to the lyceum theatre to ramsden you sir used to come to supper with dropping his voice to a confidential but perfectly audible whisper several different ladies

ramsden
angrily well what is that to you pray

octavius
why violet i thought you hardly knew one another before this trip you and malone

violet
vexed i suppose this person was the manager

mendoza
the waiter madam i have a grateful recollection of you all i gathered from the bountiful way in which you treated me that you all enjoyed your visits very much

violet
what impertinence she turns her back on him and goes up the hill with hector

ramsden
that will do my friend you do not expect these ladies to treat you as an acquaintance i suppose because you have waited on them at table

mendoza
pardon me it was you who claimed my acquaintance the ladies followed your example however this display of the unfortunate manners of your class closes the incident for the future you will please address me with the respect due to a stranger and fellow traveller he turns haughtily away and resumes his presidential seat

tanner
there i have found one man on my journey capable of reasonable conversation and you all instinctively insult him even the new man is as bad as any of you enry you have behaved just like a miserable gentleman

straker
gentleman not me

ramsden
really tanner this tone—

ann
dont mind him granny you ought to know him by this time she takes his arm and coaxes him away to the hill to join violet and hector octavius follows her doglike

violet
calling from the hill here are the soldiers they are getting out of their motors

duval
panicstricken oh nom de dieu

the anarchist
fools the state is about to crush you because you spared it at the prompting of the political hangerson of the bourgeoisie

the sulky socialdemocrat
argumentative to the last on the contrary only by capturing the state machine—

the anarchist
it is going to capture you

the rowdy socialdemocrat
his anguish culminating ow chock it wot are we ere for wot are we wytin for

mendoza
between his teeth goon talk politics you idiots nothing sounds more respectable keep it up i tell you

the soldiers line the road commanding the amphitheatre with their rifles the brigands struggling with an overwhelming impulse to hide behind one another look as unconcerned as they can mendoza rises superbly with undaunted front the officer in command steps down from the road in to the amphitheatre looks hard at the brigands and then inquiringly at tanner

the officer
who are these men senor ingles

tanner
my escort
mendoza
with a mephistophelean smile bows profoundly an irrepressible grin runs from face to face among the brigands they touch their hats except the anarchist who defies the state with folded armsembed"
