im working hard
fifty hours a week paying for the car
and the house we had built on the boulevard
and as soon as you get home you wanna start
with something negative
besides physical harm what do you give
and you make lots of noise for someone who sits
at home all day watching one life to live

chorus
you aint right you aint right no no no
i i thought you loved me yeah
you aint right no no no ooh hoo

verse 2
were supposed to be a team
at least you could do things like cook and clean
but i ask you whats up you start looking mean
smackin your lips like youre still a teenager
and im sick of this but i end up in this predicament
i would rather go somewhere and pitch a tent
than to stay here with you acting ignorant

chorus
you aint right you aint right no no no no
i thought you loved me yeah
you aint right no but you aint right no
no no no no no no
