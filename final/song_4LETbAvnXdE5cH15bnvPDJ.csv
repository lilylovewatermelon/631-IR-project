you gave me chances and i let you down
you waited for words that i couldnt get out
i have no excuses for the way that i am
i was clueless and i couldnt understand

chorus
that all that you wanted
and all that you needed
was a side of me i never let you see
and i wish i could love you
and make you believe it
because thats all you ever wanted
its all you ever wanted
from me from me

verse 2
could i be selfish or lost in my pride
afraid to be forward or just too scared to try
and now im without you and it took distance to see
that losing you means losing everything

chorus
when all that you wanted
and all that you needed
was a side of me i never let you see
and i wish i could love you
and make you believe it
because thats all you ever wanted
its all you ever wanted from me

to turn around and let me be

chorus
all that you wanted
and all that you needed
ill show the side of me i never let you see
i wish i could love you
and make you believe it
because thats all you ever wanted
thats all you ever wanted
and thats all you ever wanted
its all you ever wanted
from me
