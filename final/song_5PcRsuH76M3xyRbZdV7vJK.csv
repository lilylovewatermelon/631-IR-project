you you called me out
you said youre done with me but i cant seem
to remember anything at 3 am
am i that guy the one thats happy hanging with my friends
and five drinks in im in love again

chorus
so if i get drunk and call you up
dont get pissed and dont hang up
i know its late but its never too late to be
another last call casualty

verse 2
i cant remember what i said
but i swear i meant no harm
i tried to knock on your window
but i set off your alarm
and the days dragged on like a tail pipe
and the nights they aint so long
and the taxi cab im riding in
is blaring our favorite song again

chorus
so if i get drunk and call you up
dont get pissed and dont hang up
i know its late but its never too late to be
another last call casualty
see bowling for soup liveget tickets as low as 52you might also likebridge
im sorry a guy picked up the phone
my mind couldnt leave well enough alone
and after the seventh time he hit starsixtynine
he said if he finds me ill be dead
but im already in my head
since hes the one thats lying with you in your bed

chorus
so if i get drunk and call you up
dont get pissed and dont hang up
i know its late but its never too late to be
another last call casualty

chorus
so if i get drunk and call you up
dont get pissed and dont hang up another last call casualty
i know its late but its never too late to be
another last call casualty
another last call casualty

outro
so if i get drunk and call you up
dont get pissed and dont hang up another last call casualty
so if i get drunk and call you up
dont get pissed and dont hang up another last call casualty
so if i get drunk and call you up
dont get pissed and dont hang up another last call casualtyembed"
