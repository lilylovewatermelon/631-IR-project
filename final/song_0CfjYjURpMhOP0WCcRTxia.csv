its always more fun
to share with everyone
its always more fun
to share with everyone

verse
if you have two
give one to your friend
if you have three
give one to your friend and me

chorus
its always more fun
to share with everyone
its always more fun
to share with everyone

if you have one
here is something you can learn
you can still share
just by taking turns

if youve got a ball
bounce it to the gang
if there is a new kid
invite him out to hang
see jack johnson liveget tickets as low as 95you might also likeif youve got one sandwich
cut that thing in half
if you know a secret joke
tell it and share a laugh

if youve got one drumstick
give one to your friend
make one beautiful rhythm
share a beat that never ends

and if youre feeling lonely
share time with your mom
share some milk and cookies
and sing the sharing song

chorus
its always more fun
to share with everyone
its always more fun
to share with everyone
its always more fun
to share with everyone
its always more fun
to share with everyoneembed"
