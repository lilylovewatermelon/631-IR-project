theres so many things that i could say
but im sure it would come out all wrong
youve got something that i cant explain
still ill try and try and let you know
the first summer we spents one will never forget
looking for any kind of reason to escape all the mess
that we thought was what made us aint it funny now
we can see were who were meant to be

chorus
you still have all of my
you still have all of my
you still have all my heart

verse 2
theres too many times i have to say
i could have been better and stronger for you and me
you always make me feel okay
those late summers we spent stay up talking all night
id ask you think wed ever make it you say im sure if its right
aint it funny to think just how stupid i used to be
hope you always believe

you still have all of my
you still have all of my
you still have all my heart

chorus
you still have all of my
you still have all of my

bridge
let them talk and talk and talk let them say what they want
we will laugh at the thought they dont know what we got
every year that goes by a year older we are
youll still be beautiful then bless your beautiful heart
well talk and talk and talk how crazy is it
someone could waste their whole life helplessly
just patiently waiting for a love like you and me

chorus
you still have all of my
you still have all of my
you still have all my heart

outro
you still have all of my heart
you still have all of my you still have all of my heart
you still have all of my you still have all of my heart
you still have all my heart you still have all of my heart
you still have all of my ive been waiting my whole life for something to save me
you still have all of my i still cant believe that you are mine
you still have all my heart you still have all of my heart9embed"
