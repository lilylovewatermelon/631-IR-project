baby go go go
or as we natives say fa subito

if youre ever gonna kiss me
it had better be tonight
while the mandolins are playing
and stars are bright
mmmm
if youve anything to tell me
it had better be tonight
or somebody else may tell me
and whisper the words just right

meglio stasera
baby go go go
or as we natives say fa subito

if youre ever gonna hold me
it had better be tonight
or somebody else may hold me
they might make me feel just right

meglio stasera
baby go go go
or as we natives say fa subito

who knows little of your speech
be a nice italiana
and start to teach
mmmm
go ahead

show me how in old milano
lovers hold each other oh so tight
but i warn you sweet paesana
but it had better be tonight

meglio stasera
baby go go go
or as we natives say fa subitoembed"
