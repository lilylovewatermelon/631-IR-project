verse
it’s a full tank in the getaway get away
so before i break your heart you should get the engine started
there’s nothing like a nice drive in the summertime
sunshine with the groove goin’ to help you move on
so get a move on get your mood right maybe start a new life

prehook
and you’re wondering
what to do and where to go
tell me not to do it babe
i don’t feel the same about you anymore

chorus
dont get caught up lovin me
i know it dont make sense
you’re perfect on paper baby
but something’s missing
don’t get caught up lovin me
girl i’m no good for you
it has nothing to do with us it’s just another season

interlude
i don’t wanna be without you babe
i don’t wanna be without you babe
i don’t wanna be without you babe
i don’t wanna be without you babe

i just think i’m way too young to fall in love
sign of the times i guess
maybe in another season ima be
trying to find someone like you

interlude
don’t get caught up lovin’ me
don’t get caught up lovin’ me

bridge
i just think i’m way too young to fall in love
sign of the times i guess
maybe in another season
imma be trying to find someone like you

she only wanna get down
