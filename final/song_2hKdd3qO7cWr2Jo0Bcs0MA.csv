now that shes back in the atmosphere
with drops of jupiter in her hair
she acts like summer and walks like rain
reminds me that theres time to change hey
since the return of her stay on the moon
she listens like spring and she talks like june hey
hey yeah

chorus
but tell me did you sail across the sun
did you make it to the milky way to see the lights all faded
and that heaven is overrated
tell me did you fall for a shooting star
one without a permanent scar
and did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

verse 2
now that shes back from that soul vacation
tracin her way through the constellation hey mmm
she checks out mozart while she does taebo
reminds me that theres room to grow hey yeah
now that shes back in the atmosphere im afraid that she might think of me as
plain ol jane told a story about a man who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

chorus
but tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
and head back to the milky way
and tell me did venus blow your mind
was it everything you wanted to find
and did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there
see train liveget tickets as low as 24you might also likebridge
can you imagine no love pride deepfried chicken
your best friend always sticking up for you
even when i know youre wrong
can you imagine no first dance freezedried romance
fivehour phone conversation
the best soy latte that you ever had and me

chorus
but tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet feet
did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day light of day
and head back toward the milky way
and tell me did you sail across the sun
did you make it to the milky way to see the lights all faded
and that heaven is overrated
tell me did you fall for a shooting star
one without a permanent scar
and did you miss me while you were looking for yourself
