where does it come from
when everything was outside
busted and blue
how in the universe
through the lithium
busted and blue

verse 2 2d
i was asked by a computer
a shadow on the wall
an image made by virgil
to rule over us all
so amplify the sirens
and to find real amends
im through the echochambers
to other worlds i went

chorus 2d  kelela
all my life
all my life
beam a light
on me i am a satellite
and i cant get back without you
be my love
be my light
be my love
be my light

where do they come from
the wires that connect to us
weightless and fall on your body
til were invisible
im with you through altitudes
busted and blue

chorus 2d  kelela
all my life
all my life
beam a light
on me i am a satellite
and i cant get back without you
be my love
be my light
be my love
be my light
