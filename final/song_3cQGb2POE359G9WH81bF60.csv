like shining oil this night is dripping down
stars are slipping down glistening
and im tryin not to think what im leaving now
no deceiving now its time you let me know
let me know

chorus chester bennington
when the lights go out and we open our eyes
out there in the silence ill be gone
ill be gone
let the sun fade out and another one rise
climbing through tomorrow ill be gone
ill be gone

verse 2 chester bennington
this air between us is getting thinner now
into winter now bittersweet
and cross that horizon this sun is setting down
youre forgetting now its time you let me go
let me go

chorus chester bennington
when the lights go out and we open our eyes
out there in the silence ill be gone
ill be gone
let the sun fade out and another one rise
climbing through tomorrow ill be gone
ill be gone

and tell them i couldnt help myself
and tell them i was alone
oh tell me i am the only one
and theres nothing left to stop me

chorus chester bennington
when the lights go out and we open our eyes
out there in the silence ill be gone
ill be gone
let the sun fade out and another one rise
climbing through tomorrow ill be gone
ill be gone
ill be gone ill be gone15embed"
