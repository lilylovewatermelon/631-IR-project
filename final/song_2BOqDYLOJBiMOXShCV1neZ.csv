somebody said you got a new friend
but does she love you better than i can
and theres a big black sky over my town
i know where youre at i bet shes around
and yeah i know its stupid but i just gotta see it for myself

chorus
im in the corner watching you kiss her oh oh oh
and im right over here why cant you see me oh oh oh
and im giving it my all
but im not the guy youre taking home oooh
i keep dancing on my own

verse 2
i just wanna dance all night
and i’m all messed up i’m so out of line yeah
stilettos and broken bottles
i’m spinning around in circles

chorus
and im in the corner watching you kiss her oh oh oh
and im right over here why cant you see me oh oh oh
and im giving it my all
but im not the guy youre taking home ooh
i keep dancing on my own
