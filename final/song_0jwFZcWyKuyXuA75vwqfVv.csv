verse 3 phil ade
now im the one she callin
let it go to voicemail once she got a problem
roof castle boulevardin
yeah now im in the hills feelin like hillary rodham
presidential suite yeah i made it boy
tryna see the position that you aint ready for
i could hold you down in the meantime
dont need to think twice like a metaphor
you could play the main you could play the side yeah
you could come and go you could stay and ride
either way you know i make it to it
i seen better days since you get through it
its for the vibe my mama team and my state
i been in my prime like im on the tv at 8
yeah i been gone a while on my island cause niggas fake
it aint really jimmy fallon on calenders niggas late just my time nigga
