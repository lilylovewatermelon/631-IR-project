angels smoking cigarettes on rooftops in fishnets in the morning with the
moon still glowing
and here comes jesus in an astrovan rolling down the strip again
hes stoned while jerry plays

chorus
life aint ever what it seems
these dreams are more than paper things
and its alright mama youre afraid
ill be poor along the way
i dont wanna see those tears again
you know jesus drives an astrovan
yes he does i say whoo

verse 2
and in my heart theres a holy ghost writhing on the floor from an overdose
you know the best ones never come down
so if i love at the tip of my toes reaching out for the great unknown
every addict has illusions

chorus
life aint ever what it seems
these dreams are more than paper things
and its alright mama youre afraid
ill be here along the way
i dont wanna see those tears again
you know jesus drives an astrovan
yes he does i say whoo
see mt joy liveget tickets as low as 35you might also likebridge
and when i see those angels on the roof
ill know ive made it when my
doobie smoking jesus puts my name upon his guestlist
and says son youre famous in heaven
maybe youre famous in heaven
and maybe there is no heaven
maybe were all alone together now
but i dont wanna see those tears again
you know jesus drives an astrovan

outro
i dont wanna see those tears again
you know jesus drives an astrovan6embed"
