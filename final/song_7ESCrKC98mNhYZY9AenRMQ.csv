go to sleep you little babe
go to sleep you little baby
go to sleep you little babe
your mamas gone away and your daddys gonna stay
didnt leave nobody but the baby

go to sleep you little baby
go to sleep you little babe
go to sleep you little baby
go to sleep you little babe
everybodys gone in the cotton and the corn
didnt leave nobody but the baby
youre a sweet little baby
youre a sweet little babe
youre a sweet little baby
youre a sweet little babe
honey in the rock and the sugar dont stop
gonna bring a bottle to the baby

dont you weep pretty baby
dont you weep pretty babe
dont you weep pretty baby
dont you weep pretty babe
shes long gone with her red shoes on
gonna need another lovin baby
you might also likego to sleep little baby
go to sleep you little babe
go to sleep little baby
go to sleep you little babe
you and me and the devil makes three
dont need no other lovin baby
go to sleep you little baby
go to sleep you little babe
go to sleep you little baby
go to sleep you little babe
come and lay your bones on the alabaster stones
and be my everlovin babyembed"
