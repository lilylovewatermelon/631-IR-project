all dressed up and nowhere to go
i think im taking this trip alone
thirty seconds till i pass
the questions you will never ask
your regrets will haunt you
you know i never had to

chorus
but im saving myself from you
and did you notice anything
the change is me
now its safe to say
you will never change your ways

verse 2
i went to your house but you werent home
im sure you conveniently shut off your phone
i dont think that ill ever be
the person that you want of me
when all that i can think about
its you i have to figure out

chorus

bridge
you would give up anything
to prove your point
theres nothing left to say
you will never change your ways
im saving myself from you
yeah im saving myself from you
