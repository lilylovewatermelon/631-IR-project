im goin down to the railway station gonna get a ticket to ride
find a big fat lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
ride til the sun comes up and down around me bout two or three times
smokin cigarettes in the last seat
tryin to hide my sorrow from the people i meet

verse 1
and get along with it all
go down where the people say yall
sing a song with a friend
change the shape that im in
and get back in the game
and start playin again

verse 2
id like to stay but i might have to go to start over again
might go back down to texas might go to somewhere that ive never been
and get up in the mornin and go out at night
and i wont have to go home
get used to bein alone
change the words to this song
and start singin again

verse 3
im tired of runnin round lookin for answers to questions that i already know
i could build me a castle of memories just to have somewhere to go
count the days and the nights that it takes to get back in the saddle again
feed the pigeons some clay
turn the night into day
start talkin again when i know what to say

smokin cigarettes in the last seat

and get along with it all
