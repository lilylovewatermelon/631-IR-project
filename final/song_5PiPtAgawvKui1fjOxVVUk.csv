universally that persons acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high minds ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipotent natures incorrupted benefaction for who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no natures boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminutions menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined

some man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at nights oncoming of israels folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared stark ruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house

loth to irk in hornes hall hat holding the seeker stood on her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face hers so young then had looked light swift her eyes kindled bloom of blushes his word winning

as her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared glad after she was that ere adread was her he asked if ohare doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that ohare doctor in heaven was sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful all she there told him ruing death for friend so young algate sore unwilling gods rightwiseness to withsay she said that he had a fair sweet death through god his goodness with masspriest to be shriven holy housel and sick mens oil to his limbs the man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in mona island through bellycrab three year agone come childermas and she prayed to god the allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness he heard her sad words in held hat sad staring so stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other
therefore everyman look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mothers womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came
the man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed the nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be she said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that womans birth then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house the man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder womens woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless
and whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat and there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept dixon and the traveller leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery

and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so and these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain and they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead
and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile thanked be almighty god
this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time hied fast sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel said he that it be not come or now meseems it dureth overlong and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently but said he or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long and the franklin that had drunken said expecting each moment to be her next also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and now drink said he fully delectably and he quaffed as far as he might to their boths health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup womans woe with wonder pondering

now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might there was a sort of scholars along either side the board that is to wit dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciables with other his fellows lynch and madden scholars of medicine and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa one crotthers and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested and of all them reserved young stephen he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sir leopold but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner ruth red him love led on with will to wander loth to leave

for they were right witty scholars and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in hornes house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case and they said farther she should live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy a redress god grant this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay by our virgin mother the wife should live and the babe to die in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved to whom young stephen had these words following murmur sirs is eke oft among lay folk both babe and parent now glorify their maker the one in limbo gloom the other in purgefire but gramercy what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise which is the sin against the holy ghost very god lord and giver of life for sirs he said our lust is brief we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachis praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom of law of canons of lilith patron of abortions of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or as virgilius saith by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with effectu secuto or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for gods greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fishermans seal even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and laying hand to jaw he said dissembling as his wont was that as it was informed him who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions that is truth pardy said dixon and or i err a pregnant word which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons

but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lambs wool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friends son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for all accounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores

about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray now drink we quod he of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my souls bodiment leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay see ye here and he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had he said for a song which he writ they all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore his words were then these as followeth know all men he said times ruins build eternitys mansions what means this desires wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a bramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time mark me now in womans womb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh that passes becomes the word that shall not pass away this is the postcreation omnis caro ad te veniet no question but her name is puissant who aventried the dear corse of our agenbuyer healer and herd our mighty mother and mother most venerable and bernardus saith aptly that she hath an omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem that is to wit an almightiness of petition because she is the second eve and she won us saith augustine too whereas that other our grandam which we are linked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all seed breed and generation for a penny pippin but here is the matter now or she knew him that second i say and was but creature of her creature vergine madre figlia di tuo figlio or she knew him not and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with peter piscator who lives in the house that jack built and with joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages parceque m léo taxil nous a dit que qui lavait mise dans cette fichue position cétait le sacre pigeon ventre de dieu entweder transubstantiality oder consubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality and all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word a pregnancy without joy he said a birth without pangs a body without blemish a belly without bigness let the lewd with faith and fervour worship with will will we withstand withsay

hereupon punch costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch staboo stabella about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in almany which he did straightways now attack the first three months she was not well staboo when here nurse quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard it was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently punch costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him a murrain seize the dolt what a devil he would be at thou chuff thou puny thou got in peasestraw thou losel thou chitterling thou spawn of a rebel thou dykedropt thou abortion thou to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of god ape the good sir leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet margerain gentle advising also the times occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred in hornes house rest should reign
to be short this passage was scarce by when master dixon of mary in eccles goodly grinning asked young stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friars vows and he answered him obedience in the womb chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days master lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how as he heard hereof counted he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too waxing merry and toasting to his fathership but he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses as the priests use in madagascar island she to be in guise of white and saffron her groom in white and grain with burning of nard and tapers on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium till she was there unmaided he gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets master john fletcher and master francis beaumont that is in their maids tragedy that was writ for a like twining of lovers to bed to bed was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals an exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative suadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the paranymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial communion well met they were said master dixon joyed but harkee young sir better were they named beau mount and lecher for by my troth of such a mingling much might come young stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it greater love than this he said no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend go thou and do likewise thus or words to that effect saith zarathustra sometime regius professor of french letters to the university of oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind was more beholden bring a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but thou wilt have the secondbest bed orate fratres pro memetipso and all the people shall say amen remember erin thy generations and thy days of old how thou settedst little by me and by my word and broughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my sight and to wax fat and kick like jeshurum therefore hast thou sinned against my light and hast made me thy lord to be the slave of servants return return clan milly forget me not o milesian why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the roman and to the indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously look forth now my people upon the land of behest even from horeb and from nebo and from pisgah and from the horns of hatten unto a land flowing with milk and money but thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk my moon and my sun thou hast quenched for ever and thou hast left me alone for ever in the dark ways of my bitterness and with a kiss of ashes hast thou kissed my mouth this tenebrosity of the interior he proceeded to say hath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as mentioned for the orient from on high which brake hells gates visited a darkness that was foraneous assuefaction minorates atrocities as tully saith of his darling stoics and hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of combustion the adiaphane in the noon of life is an egypts plague which in the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their most proper ubi and quomodo and as the ends and ultimates of all things accord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals that same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth accomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and ablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with our subsolar being the aged sisters draw us into life we wail batten sport clip clasp sunder dwindle die over us dead they bend first saved from waters of old nile among bulrushes a bed of fasciated wattles at last the cavity of a mountain an occulted sepulchre amid the conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage and as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to tophet or to edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness

behold the mansion reared by dedal jack see the malt stored in many a refluent sack in the proud cirque of jackjohns bivouac
a black crack of noise in the street here alack bawled back loud on left thor thundered in anger awful the hammerhurler came now the storm that hist his heart and master lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry and he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm then did some mock and some jeer and punch costello fell hard again to his yale which master lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour but the braggart boaster cried that an old nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead but this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in hornes hall he drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that master madden being godly certain whiles knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and master bloom at the braggarts side spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead look you having taken place and all of the order of a natural phenomenon
but was young boasthards fear vanquished by calmers words no for he had in his bosom a spike named bitterness which could not by words be done away and was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other he was neither as much as he would have liked to be either but could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle holiness that then he lived withal indeed no for grace was not there to find that bottle heard he then in that clap the voice of the god bringforth or what calmer said a hubbub of phenomenon heard why he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube understanding which he had not done for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away by no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book law then wotted he nought of that other land which is called believeonme that is the land of promise which behoves to the king delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it yes pious had told him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name she said is birdinthehand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as ho you pretty man turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named twointhebush or by some learned carnal concupiscence

this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore birdinthehand which was within all foul plagues monsters and a wicked devil they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her for regarding believeonme they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for first twointhebush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them pickaback and topsyturvy and shameface and cheek by jowl and second for that foul plague allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and third that they might take no hurt neither from offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named killchild so were they all in their blind fancy mr cavil and mr sometimes godly mr ape swillale mr false franklin mr dainty dixon young boasthard and mr cautious calmer wherein o wretched company were ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a very grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and spill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them contrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth

with this came up lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that nights gazette and he made a show to find it about him for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it but on stephens persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk he was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat to tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps ostlers bookies

or a tale faith no he says frank that was his name tis all about kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague but they can go hang says he with a wink for me with their bully beef a pox on it theres as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset mort aux vaches says frank then in the french language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in bordeaux and he spoke french like a gentleman too from a child this frank had been a donought that his father a headborough who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes one time he would be a playactor then a sutler or a welsher then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk kidnapping a squires heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids linen or choking chicken behind a hedge he had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him what says mr leopold with his hands across that was earnest to know the drift of it will they slaughter all i protest i saw them but this day morning going to the liverpool boats says he i can scarce believe tis so bad says he and he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers greasy hoggets and wether wool having been some years before actuary for mr joseph cuffe a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by mr gavin lows yard in prussia street i question with you there says he more like tis the hoose or the timber tongue mr stephen a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperors chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality that was sending over doctor rinderpest the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns come come says mr vincent plain dealing hell find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull thats irish says he irish by name and irish by nature says mr stephen and he sent the ale purling about an irish bull in an english chinashop i conceive you says mr dixon it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emerald ring in his nose true for you says mr vincent cross the table and a bullseye into the bargain says he and a plumper and a portlier bull says he never shit on shamrock he had horns galore a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island leaving doughballs and rollingpins followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains what for that says mr dixon but before he came over farmer nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself so be off now says he and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmers blessing and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly but the slap and the blessing stood him friend says mr vincent for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid wife abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland another then put in his word and they dressed him says he in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his hearts content by this time the father of the faithful for so they called him was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind uarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls language and they all after him ay says another and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice saying by the lord harry green is the grass that grows on the ground and says mr dixon if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out hed run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harrys orders there was bad blood between them at first says mr vincent and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and ill meddle in his matters says he ill make that animal smell hell says he with the help of that good pizzle my father left me but one evening says mr dixon when the lord harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the romans bos bovum which is good bog latin for boss of the show after that says mr vincent the lord harry put his head into a cows drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name then with the water running off him he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat in short he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt they were says mr stephen and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as the ungrate women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect manned the yards sprang their luff heaved to spread three sheets in the wind put her head between wind and water weighed anchor ported her helm ran up the jolly roger gave three times three let the bullgine run pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of america which was the occasion says mr vincent of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty

our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered a young gentleman his name alec bannon who had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnells bearing a legend printed in fair italics mr malachi mulligan fertiliser and incubator lambay island his project as he went on to expound was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed well let us hear of it good my friend said mr dixon i make no doubt it smacks of wenching come be seated both tis as cheap sitting as standing mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and expatiating upon his design told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility both the inhibitory and the prohibitory whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired it grieved him plaguily he said to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures a prey to the vilest bonzes who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weep to curb this inconvenient which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of lambay island from its holder lord talbot de malahide a tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural money was no object he said nor would he take a penny for his pains the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions would find in him their man for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it they both it seems had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water as might be observed by mr mulligans smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of marys excepted to it asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which as it dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi o quirites ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach the buck and doe of the forest glade the farmyard drake and duck

valuing himself not a little upon his elegance being indeed a proper man of person this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced the young gentleman his friend overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour mr mulligan now perceiving the table asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and seeing the stranger he made him a civil bow and said pray sir was you in need of any professional assistance we could give who upon his offer thanked him very heartily though preserving his proper distance and replied that he was come there about a lady now an inmate of hornes house that was in an interesting condition poor body from womans woe and here he fetched a deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet taken place mr dixon to turn the table took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence upon which he rallied him betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due as with the noted physician mr austin meldon to a wolf in the stomach for answer mr mulligan in a gale of laughter at his smalls smote himself bravely below the diaphragm exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan the most excellent creature of her sex though tis pity shes a trollop theres a belly that never bore a bastard this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight the spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber
here the listener who was none other than the scotch student a little fume of a fellow blond as tow congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and interrupting the narrative at a salient point having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it mais bien sûr noble stranger said he cheerily et mille compliments that you may and very opportunely there wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity but gracious heaven was i left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well my god i would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the giver of good things with these words he approached the goblet to his lips took a complacent draught of the cordial slicked his hair and opening his bosom out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness ah monsieur he said had you but beheld her as i did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily in such an artless disorder of so melting a tenderness pon my conscience even you monsieur had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever i declare i was never so touched in all my life god i thank thee as the author of my days thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours a sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and having replaced the locket in his bosom he wiped his eye and sighed again beneficent disseminator of blessings to all thy creatures how great and universal must be that sweetest of thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond the simple swain and the polished coxcomb the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years but indeed sir i wander from the point how mingled and imperfect are all our sublunary joys maledicity he exclaimed in anguish would to god that foresight had but remembered me to take my cloak along i could weep to think of it then though it had poured seven showers we were neither of us a penny the worse but beshrew me he cried clapping hand to his forehead tomorrow will be a new day and thousand thunders i know of a marchand de capotes monsieur poyntz from whom i can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the french fashion as ever kept a lady from wetting tut tut cries le fecondateur tripping in my friend monsieur moore that most accomplished traveller i have just cracked a half bottle avec lui in a circle of the best wits of the town is my authority that in cape horn ventre biche they have a rain that will wet through any even the stoutest cloak a drenching of that violence he tells me sans blague has sent more than one luckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world pooh a livre cries monsieur lynch the clumsy things are dear at a sou one umbrella were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom is worth ten such stopgaps no woman of any wit would wear one my dear kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for as she reminded me blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies dame nature by the divine blessing has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that il y a deux choses for which the innocence of our original garb in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties is the fittest nay the only garment the first said she and here my pretty philosopher as i handed her to her tilbury to fix my attention gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear the first is a bath but at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge
amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and while all were conjecturing what might be the cause miss callan entered and having spoken a few words in a low tone to young mr dixon retired with a profound bow to the company the presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry strike me silly said costello a low fellow who was fuddled a monstrous fine bit of cowflesh ill be sworn she has rendezvoused you what you dog have you a way with them gads bud immensely so said mr lynch the bedside manner it is that they use in the mater hospice demme does not doctor ogargle chuck the nuns there under the chin as i look to be saved i had it from my kitty who has been wardmaid there any time these seven months lawksamercy doctor cried the young blood in the primrose vest feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body how you do tease a body drat the man bless me im all of a wibbly wobbly why youre as bad as dear little father cantekissem that you are may this pot of four half choke me cried costello if she aint in the family way i knows a lady whats got a white swelling quick as i claps eyes on her the young surgeon however rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was enceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy i want patience said he with those who without wit to enliven or learning to instruct revile an ennobling profession which saving the reverence due to the deity is the greatest power for happiness upon the earth i am positive when i say that if need were i could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of her noble exercitations which so far from being a byword should be a glorious incentive in the human breast i cannot away with them what malign such an one the amiable miss callan who is the lustre of her own sex and the astonishment of ours and at an instant the most momentous that can befall a puny child of clay perish the thought i shudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice have been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and maid in house of horne having delivered himself of this rebuke he saluted those present on the by and repaired to the door a murmur of approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker without more ado a design which would have been effected nor would he have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his transgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation for he swore a round hand that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew breath stap my vitals said he them was always the sentiments of honest frank costello which i was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what i always looks back on with a loving heart
to revert to mr bloom who after his first entry had been conscious of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity the young sparks it is true were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice their testiness and outrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf but the word of mr costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity born out of wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world which the dint of the surgeons pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creations chain desiderated by the late ingenious mr darwin it was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and by intercepting them with the readiest precaution foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable to those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy a habit of mind which he never did hold with to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding while for such that having lost all forbearance can lose no more there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe is ever as the chaste fancy of the holy writer expresses it for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions to conclude while from the sisters words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was however it must be owned not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to the bounty of the supreme being
accordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour saying that to express his notion of the thing his opinion who ought not perchance to express one was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not to be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement since she had been in such pain through no fault of hers the dressy young blade said it was her husbands that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another ephesian matron i must acquaint you said mr crotthers clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis old glory allelujurum was round again today an elderly man with dundrearies preferring through his nose a request to have word of wilhelmina my life as he calls her i bade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon slife ill be round with you i cannot but extol the virile potency of the old bucko that could still knock another child out of her all fell to praising of it each after his own fashion though the same young blade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had been the man in the gap a clerk in orders a linkboy virtuous or an itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household singular communed the guest with himself the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest but he further added it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in common oppress them for i have more than once observed that birds of a feather laugh together

but with what fitness let it be asked of the noble lord his patron has this alien whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted to civic rights constituted himself the lord paramount of our internal polity where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have counselled during the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary advantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that moment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant at will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents has he forgotten this as he forgets all benefits received or is it that from being a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is if report belie him not his own and his only enjoyer far be it from candour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady the daughter of a gallant major or to cast the most distant reflections upon her virtue but if he challenges attention there as it was indeed highly his interest not to have done then be it so unhappy woman she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate he says this a censor of morals a very pelican in his piety who did not scruple oblivious of the ties of nature to attempt illicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata of society nay had the hussys scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel it had gone with her as hard as with hagar the egyptian in the question of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in mr cuffes hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing retort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic it ill becomes him to preach that gospel has he not nearer home a seedfield that lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare a habit reprehensible at puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life if he must dispense his balm of gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste to restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his practice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him his marital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant to adduce the lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for a consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and healer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which when rooted in its native orient throve and flourished and was abundant in balm but transplanted to a clime more temperate its roots have lost their quondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant acid and inoperative
the news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial usage of the sublime porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born when he had betaken himself to the womens apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier broke out at once into a strife of tongues in vain the voice of mr canvasser bloom was heard endeavouring to urge to mollify to refrain the moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers the caesarean section posthumity with respect to the father and that rarer form with respect to the mother the fratricidal case known as the childs murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of mr advocate bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused the rights of primogeniture and kings bounty touching twins and triplets miscarriages and infanticides simulated or dissimulated the acardiac foetus in foetu and aprosopia due to a congestion the agnathia of certain chinless chinamen cited by mr candidate mulligan in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that as he said one ear could hear what the other spoke the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid as exemplified in the actual case with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix artificial insemination by means of syringes involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape that distressing manner of delivery called by the brandenburghers sturzgeburt the recorded instances of multiseminal twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parentsin a word all the cases of human nativity which aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations the gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest by her movement the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning ardently and ineffectually entertained to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation the abnormalities of harelip breastmole supernumerary digits negros inkle strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a prima facie and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded the case of madame grissel steevens was not forgotten or doghaired infants occasionally born the hypothesis of a plasmic memory advanced by the caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human an outlandish delegate sustained against both these views with such heat as almost carried conviction the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the minotaur which the genius of the elegant latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his metamorphoses the impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived it was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from mr candidate mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man contemporaneously a heated argument having arisen between mr delegate madden and mr candidate lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one siamese twin predeceasing the other the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to mr canvasser bloom for instant submittal to mr coadjutor deacon dedalus hitherto silent whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice he delivered briefly and as some thought perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what god has joined

however as a matter of fact though the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character was not the case at all the individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop during the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one bass bottled by messrs bass and co at burtonontrent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyones remark on account of its scarlet appearance he was simply and solely as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings after the moment befores observations about boyhood days and the turf recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn eventually however both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same time however a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place

the debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life neither place nor council was lacking in dignity the debaters were the keenest in the land the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital the high hall of hornes house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic a gallant scene in truth it made crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking highland garb his face glowing from the briny airs of the mull of galloway there too opposite to him was lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom next the scotchman was the place assigned to costello the eccentric while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of madden the chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of bannon in explorers kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of malachi roland st john mulligan lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator fresh from the hippodrome and that vigilant wanderer soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come
it had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which mr s dedalus div scep contentions would appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to accepted scientific methods science it cannot be too often repeated deals with tangible phenomena the man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can there may be it is true some questions which science cannot answerat presentsuch as the first problem submitted by mr l bloom pubb canv regarding the future determination of sex must we accept the view of empedocles of trinacria that the right ovary the postmenstrual period assert others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it as most embryologists incline to opine such as culpepper spallanzani blumenbach lusk hertwig leopold and valenti a mixture of both this would be tantamount to a cooperation one of natures favourite devices between the nisus formativus of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position succubitus felix of the passive element the other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital infant mortality it is interesting because as he pertinently remarks we are all born in the same way but we all die in different ways mr m mulligan hyg et eug doc blames the sanitary conditions in which our greylunged citizens contract adenoids pulmonary complaints etc by inhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust these factors he alleged and the revolting spectacles offered by our streets hideous publicity posters religious ministers of all denominations mutilated soldiers and sailors exposed scorbutic cardrivers the suspended carcases of dead animals paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennasthese he said were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of the race kalipedia he prophesied would soon be generally adopted and all the graces of life genuinely good music agreeable literature light philosophy instructive pictures plastercast reproductions of the classical statues such as venus and apollo artistic coloured photographs of prize babies all these little attentions would enable ladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months in a most enjoyable manner mr j crotthers disc bacc attributes some of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers subjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in the home but by far the vast majority to neglect private or official culminating in the exposure of newborn infants the practice of criminal abortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide although the former we are thinking of neglect is undoubtedly only too true the case he cites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity is too rare to be normative in fact when one comes to look into it the wonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they do all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which often baulk nature in her intentions an ingenious suggestion is that thrown out by mr v lynch bacc arith that both natality and mortality as well as all other phenomena of evolution tidal movements lunar phases blood temperatures diseases in general everything in fine in natures vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun to the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our public parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood though other children of the same marriage do not must certainly in the poets words give us pause nature we may rest assured has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development an arrangement which though productive of pain to some of our feelings notably the maternal is nevertheless some of us think in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest mr s dedalus div scep remark or should it be called an interruption that an omnivorous being which can masticate deglute digest and apparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect imperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females emaciated by parturition corpulent professional gentlemen not to speak of jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns might possibly find gastric relief in an innocent collation of staggering bob reveals as nought else could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to for the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother in a recent public controversy with mr l bloom pubb canv which took place in the commons hall of the national maternity hospital 29 30 and 31 holles street of which as is well known dr a horne lic in midw f k q c p i is the able and popular master he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag an esthetes allusion presumably to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all natures processesthe act of sexual congress she must let it out again or give it life as he phrased it to save her own at the risk of her own was the telling rejoinder of his interlocutor none the less effective for the moderate and measured tone in which it was delivered

there are sins or let us call them as the world calls them evil memories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart but they abide there and wait he may suffer their memory to grow dim let them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself that they were not or at least were otherwise yet a chance word will call them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the most various circumstances a vision or a dream or while timbrel and harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the evening or at the feast at midnight when he is now filled with wine not to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under her wrath not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded in the piteous vesture of the past silent remote reproachful
the stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of that false calm there imposed as it seemed by habit or some studied trick upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an unhealthiness a flair for the cruder things of life a scene disengages itself in the observers memory evoked it would seem by a word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present there as some thought with their immediate pleasures a shaven space of lawn one soft may evening the wellremembered grove of lilacs at roundtown purple and white fragrant slender spectators of the game but with much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over the sward or collide and stop one by its fellow with a brief alert shock and yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times in thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood floey atty tiny and their darker friend with i know not what of arresting in her pose then our lady of the cherries a comely brace of them pendent from an ear bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily against the cool ardent fruit a lad of four or five in linseywoolsey blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long the bowls are gathered and hutched is standing on the urn secured by that circle of girlish fond hands he frowns a little just as this young man does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but must needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the piazzetta giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness or of reproach alles vergangliche in her glad look
