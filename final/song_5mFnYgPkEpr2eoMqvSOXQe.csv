verse 1
floating around in a wraith every day out in space
smoked the first blunt in the day
i feel omega today i feel colossal today
floating around outer space
speed of light dont wanna race
keeping the opps on the chase
i see stars all in my cake
superstar i need a cape
how you feel trip i feel great
laser beam open your face
and it wont leave a trace
thats why im feeling so safe

jump out the whip and just float
i got some things you should know
always keep faith and keep hope

hope the solar system dont leave you blinded
