you wanna hang with a rockstar live a fast life and get high
we gon come through shut the block down
make em lay low like drivebys
i dont fuck with them they dont fuck with me
it gets to their heads but not mines
im my own man i dont need no hands
who go switch with me and change sides
woah its lit milk the game like a tit
i put my bitch in rick now she gon ride this dick
my gang official no you dont want this issue
blast off hard like a missile real diamonds these arent crystals
lil shawty go crazy pull up in black mercedes
thank god my momma made me boy yous a mommas baby
the throne was set for taking i press reset on patience
the percs make her amazing soak it up like a raisin

se√±orita she a eater my bitch a queen like latifah
roll ten woods of that reefer smoke kk wiz khalifa
got music blastin through my speakers
in the game you was on the bleachers
i dont text her back i dont need her
man you really thought she was a keeper woah
not sorry flexed up with my posse
tattoos all on my body diamonds is playing hockey cold brr
let me go up her skirt louis v on her purse
sunday she go to church
she fragile but worth it i know nobodys perfect
not lying in my verses take credit like a merchant
immortal bandit bitch im not from this planet
i need that lettuce sandwich dont think they understand it
