you with your words like knives
and swords and weapons that you use against me
you have knocked me off my feet again
got me feeling like im nothing
you with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
calling me out when im wounded
you pickin on the weaker man

prechorus
well you can take me down
with just one single blow
but you dont know what you dont know

chorus
someday ill be livin in a big ole city
and all youre ever gonna be is mean
someday ill be big enough so you cant hit me
and all youre ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean

verse 2
you with your switching sides
and your wildfire lies and your humiliation
you have pointed out my flaws again
as if i dont already see them
i walk with my head down trying to block you out
cause ill never impress you
i just wanna feel okay again

i bet you got pushed around
somebody made you cold
but the cycle ends right now
cause you cant lead me down that road
and you dont know what you dont know

chorus
someday ill be livin in a big ole city
and all youre ever gonna be is mean
someday ill be big enough so you cant hit me
and all youre ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean

bridge
and i can see you years from now in a bar
talking over a football game
with that same big loud opinion
but nobodys listening
washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
drunk and grumblin on about how i cant sing
but all you are is mean

buildup
all you are is mean
and a liar and pathetic
and alone in life and mean
and mean and mean and mean
chorus
but someday ill be livin in a big ole city
and all youre ever gonna be is mean
yeah someday ill be big enough so you cant hit me
and all youre ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean
someday ill be livin in a big ole city
why you gotta be so mean
and all youre ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean
someday ill be big enough so you cant hit me
why you gotta be so mean
and all youre ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean40embed"
