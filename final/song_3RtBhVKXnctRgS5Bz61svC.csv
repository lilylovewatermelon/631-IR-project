come one come all
youre just in time to witness my first breakdown
cause theres a mile gone for every minute passed
when im stuck in this town

verse 1
ive got a bone to pick with you mr dj
the traffic and the sound is just as bad as it is in la
so go on and lock me up you better throw away that key
before i find out where you broadcast from
because your playlist is killing me

prechorus
ill change that station
light it up like the 4th of july
its me im caller fifteen
time to play my last request

chorus
come one come all
youre just in time to witness my first breakdown
cause theres a mile gone for every minute passed
when im wasting space in this town
dont call the doctors i dont need no medication
i just need one more vacation and make it last
see all time low liveget tickets as low as 114you might also likeverse 2
hear me out please judge and jury
im an innocent man
and it would be such a terrible injustice
to put me away without thinking about
all the terrible mistakes
that goddamn radio jockey makes
i swear hes out to get me
oh i swear hes out to get me

prechorus
ill change that station
light it up like the 4th of july
its me im caller fifteen
but its too late for explanations
this broadcast will be your last

chorus
come one come all
youre just in time to witness my first breakdown
cause theres a mile gone for every minute passed
when im wasting space in this town
dont call the doctors i dont need no medication
i just need one more vacation and make it last

bridge
hear me out please judge and jury
and i swear hes out to get me
oh i swear hes out to get me
go on and lock me up
you better throw away that key
i swear hes out to get me
oh i swear hes out to get me
ive got a bone to pick with you mr dj
you really ought to lock me up
because your playlist is killing me
chorus
come one come all
youre just in time to witness my first breakdown
cause theres a mile gone for every minute passed
when im wasting space in this town
dont call the doctors i dont need no medication
i just need one more vacation and make it last1embed"
