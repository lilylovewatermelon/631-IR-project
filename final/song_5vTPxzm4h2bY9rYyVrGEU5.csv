you wanna play you wanna stay you wanna have it all
you started messing with my head until i hit a wall
maybe i shouldve known maybe i shouldve known
that you would walk you would walk out the door hey
said we were done then met someone and rubbed it in my face
cut to the part she broke your heart and then she ran away
i guess you shouldve known i guess you shouldve known
that i would talk i would talk

chorus demi lovato
but even if the stars and moon collide
i never want you back into my life
you can take your words and all your lies
ohohoh i really dont care
even if the stars and moon collide
i never want you back into my life
you can take your words and all your lies
ohohoh i really dont care
ohohoh i really dont care

verse 2 demi lovato
i cant believe i ever stayed up writing songs about you
you dont deserve to know the way i used to think about you
oh no not anymore oh no not anymore
you had your shot had your shot but you let go
now if we meet out on the street i wont be running scared
ill walk right up to you and put one finger in the air
and make you understand and make you understand
you had your chance had your chance

but even if the stars and moon collide
i never want you back into my life
