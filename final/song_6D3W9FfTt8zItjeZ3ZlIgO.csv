ayo neyo wassup son what it do baby
its your boy ghos
i need you to tell me something real quick
check the joint im single right
but you know i keep mad wizzes around me and all that
you know and im not one to be fresh though
but i got my eye on this one chick
you know what i mean
and i dont want to be bothered by them wizzes
like that you know
to have the chance to be up under my wing though
you know what i mean
lemme hear how you would handle the situation
real quick hit me

verse 1 neyo
when im single it dont really matter who it is
or how many i decide to kick it with
long as she can understand how i do it
im a man with a very healthy appetite for chicks
but when i settle down find a woman to live for
still may be a couple cuties at my door
thinking we could get down like we did before
and get mad when i tell them it cant be like that no more
see neyo liveget tickets as low as 54you might also likechorus neyo
girl you know i got a girl
i just dont get down like that
i dont get down like that
baby you fine baby yous a dime
i just dont get down like that
i dont get down like that

verse 2 neyo
understand baby girl im a totally new man
i dont live to crush as many as i can
no more type of girl that changed my whole game plan
she the one she the one only one that i wont sin
and i know girl i know that you really want it bad
id be lying if i said i wasnt tempted
all the things we used to do i kinda missed it
there aint nothing you can give thats as good as this

chorus neyo
girl you know i got a girl
i just dont get down like that
i dont get down like that
baby you fine baby yous a dime
i just dont get down like that
i dont get down like that
verse 3 ghostface killah
ayo im laid back on the couch chain out
watching the rain hit the window pane my lotto numbers came up
just last night i told my boo listen take off your scarf
gloves and hat i got things i gots to air out
see remember that time up in the grand marquis
we was poppin mad pain up in the grandpa suite
and in that night we made love the phone rang twice
and uh you answered it and you asked me who the bitch was
stephanie i met her at the coffee shop
spare what you need we connected from the gate we popped
i swear to god theres no other woman that made me feel what i feel
see what i see this girl brought chills to me
uh and the thought of losing you yo is killing me
your babys father be hogging getting all my time
you see i love you yp you my nigga for life
but if it wasnt for scrams word to my momma you would probably be my wife

bridge neyo
baby all i can say is im sorry
since ive found me my baby
thinking about cheating would be crazy
i dont get down
baby all i can say is im sorry
since ive found me my baby
thinking about cheating would be crazy
and i dont get down
chorus neyo

i just dont get down like that i dont get down like that
baby you fine baby yous a dime
i just dont get down like that i dont get down like that
girl you know i got a girl
i just dont get down like that i dont get down like that
baby you fine baby yous a dime
i just dont get down like that i dont get down like that1embed"
