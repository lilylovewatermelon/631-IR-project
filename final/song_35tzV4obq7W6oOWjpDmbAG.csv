on a moonshine still
copper line hiding in the side of a hill
itll get you there
itll get you there quicker
fruit jar full of that good corn liquor
now when i was young
bout five or six
daddy lost a job and my mama took sick
and the times got tough
and mama got sicker
daddy started running that good corn liquor

well the sun dont shine
on a moonshine still
copper line hiding in the side of a hill

itll get you there
itll get you there quicker
fruit jar full of that good corn liquor

i remember that night
it was a blood red moon
and daddy was doing what he had to do
when the shots rang out
and the sheriff pulled the trigger
and daddy stopped running that good corn liquor

well the sun dont shine
on a moonshine still
copper line hiding in the side of a hill

itll get you there
itll get you there quicker
fruit jar full of that good corn liquorsee the steeldrivers liveget tickets as low as 43you might also likeembed"
