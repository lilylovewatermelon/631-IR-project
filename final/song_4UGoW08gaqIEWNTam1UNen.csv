yes i know that love is like ghosts
oh few have seen it but everybody talks
spirits follow everywhere i go
oh they sing all day and they haunt me in the night
oh they sing all day and they haunt me in the night

verse 2
yes i know that love is like ghosts
oh and what aint living can never really die
you dont want me baby please dont lie
oh but if youre leaving i gotta know why
i said if youre leaving i gotta know why
oh i sing all day and i love you through the night

verse 3
yes i know that love is like ghosts
oh and the moonlight baby shows you whats real
there aint language for the things i feel
and if i cant have you then no one ever will
oh if i cant have you then no one ever will

chorus
i dont feel it till it hurts sometimes
oh go on baby hurt me tonight
i want ours to be an endless song
baby in my eyes you do no wrong
i dont feel it till it hurts sometimes
so go on baby hurt me tonight
all the spirits that i know i saw
do you see no ghost in me at all
