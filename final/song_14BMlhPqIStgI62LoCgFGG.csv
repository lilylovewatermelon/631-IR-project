wont you bury me beneath the tree
where my family lies where my family lies
let the fog lay low on the mountain high
hear the willow cry hear the willow cry

verse 1
aint no redemption for the things that i have done
the devil owns you once the bullets left the gun
all i can think of with this rope around my neck
is id be much abliged if you grant me one request

chorus
wont you bury me beneath the tree
where my family lies where my family lies
let the fog lay low on the mountain high
hear the willow cry hear the willow cry

verse 2
my soul turned black as coal when i walked the streets at night
cause in my heart i knew that somethin wasnt right
and i went crazy when i found her with that man
but i felt better once the blood was on my hands

chorus
wont you bury me beneath the tree
where my family lies where my family lies
let the fog lay low on the mountain high
hear the willow cry hear the willow cry

wont you bury me beneath the tree
where my family lies where my family lies
let the fog lay low on the mountain high
hear the willow cry hear the willow cry
hear the willow cry hear the willow cryembed"
