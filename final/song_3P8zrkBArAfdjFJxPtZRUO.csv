my heart is on my sleeve wear it like a bruise or black eye
my badge my witness
means that i believed every single lie
you said

prechorus
cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
negates the pains i went through to avoid you
and every little pat on the shoulder for attention
fails to mention i still hate you

chorus
but theres a light on in chicago
and i know i should be home
all the colors of the street signs they remind me of the
pickup truck out in front of your neighbors house

verse 2
she took me down and said boys like you are overrated
so save your breath
loaded words and loaded friends are loaded guns to our
heads

prechorus
cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
negates the pains i went through to avoid you
and every little pat on the shoulder for attention
fails to mention i still hate you
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likechorus
but theres a light on in chicago
and i know i should be home
all the colors of the street signs they remind me of the
pickup truck out in front of your neighbors house

bridge
you want apologies girl you might hold your breath
until your breathing stops forever forever
the only thing youll get is this curse on your lips
i hope they taste of me forever

chorus
every pane of glass theres a light on in chicago
every pane of and i know i should be home
every pane of glass and all the colors of the street signs they remind me of the
pickup truck out in front of your neighbors

outro
with every breath i wish your body will be broken again again
with every breath i wish your body would be broken again again
but theres a light on
with every breath i wish your body will be broken again again
with every breath i wish your body would be broken again10embed"
