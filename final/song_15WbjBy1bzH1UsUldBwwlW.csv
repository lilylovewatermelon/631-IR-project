well i met you at the blood bank
we were looking at the bags
wondering if any of the colors
matched any of the names we knew on the tags
you said see look it thats yours
stacked on top with your brothers
see how they resemble one anothers
even in their plastic little covers

chorus
and i said i know it well
that secret that you know
that you dont know how to tell
it fucks with your honor
and it teases your head
but you know that its good girl
cause its running you with red

verse 2
then the snow started falling
we were stuck out in your car
you were rubbing both my hands
chewing on a candy bar
you said aint this just like the present
to be showing up like this
as the moon waned to crescent
we started to kiss
you might also likechorus
and i said i know it well
that secret that we know
that we dont know how to tell
im in love with your honor
im in love with your cheeks
whats that noise up the stairs babe
is that christmas morning creaks

outro
and i know it well
i know it well
and i know it well
i know it well
and i know it well
i know it well
and i know it well
i know it well30embed"
