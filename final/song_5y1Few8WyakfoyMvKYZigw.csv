when you say its dead and gone
yes i know youre wrong
cut and slash sharpest knife
it wont die yeah
poison cup drank it up
it wont die
no fire no gun no rope no stone
it wont die oh

chorus 1
why you gotta shove it in my face
as if you put me in my place
cause i dont care if you or me is wrong or right
not going to spend another night
in your bed in your bed

verse 2
the laws of men are just pretend
they aint mine
love so good love so bad
it wont die oh
some talk too long they know it all
well i just smile and move on
words aint free like you and me
i dont mind yeah
see queens of the stone age liveget tickets as low as 51you might also likechorus 2
whyd you have to be so mean and cruel
the dogs are loose im on to you
you ball and chained together from the dawn to dusk
cant call it leavin cause its just
i never came i never came
i never came i never came
i never came i never came1embed"
