if money grew on hackberry trees
if time wasnt such a luxury
if love was lovesick over me
thatd be alright
if i could keep the wind in my sails
keep a hold of the tiger by the tail
a half a ham sandwich in my lunch pail
thatd be alright

chorus
yeah thatd be alright
thatd be alright
if everybody everywhere
had a lighter load to bear
and a little bigger piece of the pie
wed be living us a pretty good life
and thatd be alright

verse 2
hey go heavy on the good and light on the bad
a hair more happy and a shade less sad
turn all that negative down just a tad
thatd be alright
if my dear old dog never got old
if my family farm never got sold
if another bad joke never got told
thatd be alright

if everybody everywhere
