light that smoke that one for giving up on me
and one just cause theyll kill you sooner than my expectations
to my favorite liar to my favorite scar to my favorite scar
i could have died with you
i hope you choke on those words that kiss that bottle
confess so bury me in memory
now ask yourself yeah out of the insides
said i loved you but i lied

prechorus
lets play this game called when you catch fire
i wouldnt piss to put you out
stop burning bridges and drive off of them
so i can forget about you

chorus
so bury me in memory his smiles your rope
so wrap it tight around your throat

verse 2
on the drive home joke about the kid you used to see
and his jealousy
breaking hearts has never looked so cool
as when you wrap your car around a tree
your makeup looks so great next to his teeth his teeth
see fall out boy liveget tickets as low as 20you might also likeprechorus

stop burning bridges and drive off of them

chorus
so bury me in memory his smiles your rope
so wrap it tight around your throat
so bury me in memory his smiles your rope
so wrap it tight around your throat
