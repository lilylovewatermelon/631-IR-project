stockings are hung with care
as children sleep with one eye open
well now theres more than toys at stake
cause im older now but not done hoping

verse 2
the twinkling of the lights
the scent of candles fill the household
ol saint nick has taken flight
with a heart on board so please be careful

prechorus
each year i ask for many different things
but now i know what my heart wants you to bring

chorus
so please just fall in love with me this christmas
theres nothing else that i will need this christmas
wont be wrapped under a tree
i want something that lasts forever
so kiss me on this cold december night

verse 3
a tree that smells of pine
a house thats filled with joy and laughter
the mistletoe says stand in line
loneliness is what ive captured
you might also likeprechorus
oh but this evening can be a holy night
so cozy on up by the fireplace
and dim those christmas lights

chorus
so please just fall in love with me this christmas
theres nothing else that we will need this christmas
wont be wrapped under a tree
i want something that lasts forever
so kiss me on this cold december night

bridge
they call it the season of giving
im here im yours for the taking
they call it the season of giving
im here im yours

chorus
just fall in love with me this christmas
theres nothing else that we will need this christmas
wont be wrapped under a tree
i want something that lasts forever
cause i dont want to be alone tonight
ill wear you like a christmas sweater
walk proudly to the mistletoe tonight
i want something to last forever
so kiss me on this cold december night
closing
call it the season of giving
im here im yours for the taking
call it the season of giving
im here im yours2embed"
