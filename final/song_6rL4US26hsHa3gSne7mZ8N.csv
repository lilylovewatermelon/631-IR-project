verse 1 tyga
ah they say what dont break a nigga make a nigga
i woke up out my dream said i gotta get it
this whole city full of thieves gotta watch my pivot
cause on the block niggas never seen good living
only lived in jail cells or prison
drivebys little homies hit the store for liquor
i gotta steer my life different where to begin with
mama told me go back to school i said im finished
theres only one way a nigga gon learn mayne
you gotta take risks and do things the hard way
stole the hall pass now im running through the hallways
only thing in my memory from those days
you couldnt save a nigga even on a sunday
monday new day shit still the same
gotta switch the rhythm up like kwame when things change
watch people do the same as i hear a voice sing

verse 2 tyga
uh big boy grown cant leave the streets alone
wanna be a king but youre too young for the throne
why you riding in the car that you cant afford
cant move forward in the fourdoor chrome
all that cheap talk i never did
my walk is billie jean my shoesll never slip
notice how close he is gold his goals that approachin him
they cant stop a win losings not an option
first place locked in get my trophy ready bitch
turn your back on me only gon leave you bent
fuck that bullshit i got common sense
im ready for my limelight put my mic in hand
theyll dissolve when the moneys gone
so motherfucker dont appear when the moneys home
lil homie done grew into a big dog
if you barking in my way you gettin chewed on
