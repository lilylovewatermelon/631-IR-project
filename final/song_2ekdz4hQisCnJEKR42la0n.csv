king of what
they say every mans a king
a king of what
i got my bullets bag and stone dont wake me up im in the zone
and i believe the trees not those innuendo seeds
everything is light see no voodoo in the night
hear no evil fear no evil whats the reason for the fight
if every mans a king
a king of what
they say every mans a king
a king of what

i can hear you on the other line tell stories from another time
lawsuit love is all we know like fleeing dogs in heavy snow
wait in wonder watch in awe
who we were is all we are

its getting dangerous dangerous
its getting dangerous

you say every mans a king
king of what
you say every mans a king
a king of what
of every step that he will take
every move that he must make
every waking moment hes alive
every thought and spoken word
laughter sob or sigh he heard
every ounce of love thats in his heart
hes a king
we are kingssee the revivalists liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeembed"
