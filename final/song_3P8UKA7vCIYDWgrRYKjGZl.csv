sick and tired and you wanna see a change
but you dont wanna change for me
be so kind to explain whats on your mind
youre the riddle of the century
im afraid your words are lying in the shade
on a hammock hanging from my tree

chorus
lazy lies today lazy lies today
lazy lies today lazy lies today
tomorrow you might change
but its lazy lies today lazy lies today
lazy lies today lazy lies today
tomorrow you might change
but lazy lies today

verse 2
please explain what you think there is to gain
when you treat me like a magazine
just a picture im a temporary fixture
like a moment in your make believe
my prediction strange as fiction
ill get over this addiction too

chorus
lazy lies today lazy lies today
lazy lies today lazy lies today
tomorrow you might change
but its lazy lies today lazy lies today
lazy lies today lazy lies today
tomorrow you might change
but lazy lies today
