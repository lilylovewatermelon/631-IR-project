you give me a heart attack
you look like the summertime
you call me an artifact
but ill save that for another time
i could be rich or poor
i dont need anymore
keep your love inside the kitchen
you can feed me anything
leave the feathers on the chicken
peel the leather from your skin

prechorus 1
i could be young or old
sweet or sad hot or cold

chorus
man or animal i dont care at all
find the antidote underneath the dose
man or animal obedient out of control

verse 2
i will love you more than money
i will breathe you in the smoke
i will drink you in my honey
sweet and golden down my throat
when youre right when youre wrong
head is near eyes are gone
you can drown my appetite
i will sip your tears at night
you can tie me to a chair
skin and bones i dont care

i could be rich or poor
i dont need anymore

chorus
man or animal i dont care at all

outro
you give me a heart attack
you give me a heart attack
i will give you more than that
i will give you more than that
you give me a heart attack
you give me a heart attack
