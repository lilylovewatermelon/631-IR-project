this is how is should be done

verse 1 left eye
this is how it should be done comin out of the black shade
fightin to lighten a path made back
lets go way back to the beginnin
thats when an idea took part from the start
and listen to another marley beat
im impatient
i gotta leave my seat for motivation
pump the bass whats next
kickin the steps me and the mirrors havin wreck
so hard that i cracked my neck
and im poppin sweat now im soakin wet
but i feel it
grab the beat cause i must
defeat its a funky groove
so i steal it
to improve what could
soon be the left eye move
pin it down and snatch a sample to loop it up
and start makin my own example cause

chorus tlc chilli marley marl
this is how it should be done
this is how it should be done yeah yeah
this is how it should be done
this is how it should be done
this style is identical to none
see tlc liveget tickets as low as 130you might also likeverse 2 left eye
this is how it should be done steppin into a shade a bit lighter
now its time to write a rhyme a rhythmic type of memo
ticktack it to the track it is now my demokay
whats ta do wheres to go yo i dont know
whos to see see ya at the local show
me and mo takin a chance and hes dancin
round and round the deck as i flow
but what an awkward situation
cause theres not much crowd participation
for checkin me out im too new
it gots to be somethin else another way to do it
so i sit back and think for a minute
which city needs a little more talent in it
maybe atl is the place packed up left philly gotta hit laface

chorus tlc chilli marley marl
