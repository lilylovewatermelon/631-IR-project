poem kendrick lamar
i remember you was conflicted misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same

intro kendrick lamar  anna wise
woman moaning
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk—
sex
verse 1 anna wise  kendrick lamar
she just want to close her eyes and sway
with you with you with you ah come on
exercise her right to work it out
its true its true its true
shout out to the birthday girls
say hey hey say hey hey ah girl
everyone deserves a night to play play
she plays only when you tell her no
see kendrick lamar liveget tickets as low as 246you might also likechorus anna wise thundercat  bilal
if these walls could talk
i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
if these walls could talk
i love it when im in it i love it when im in it
oh oh oh oh ohh

verse 2 kendrick lamar
if these walls could talk theyd tell me to swim good
no boat i float better than he would
no life jacket im not the god of nazareth
but your flood can be misunderstood
walls telling me they full of pain resentment
need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
me im just a tenant
landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
these walls are vulnerable exclamation
interior pink color coordinated
i interrogated every nook and cranny
i mean its still amazing before they couldnt stand me
these walls want to cry tears
these walls happier when im here
these walls never could hold up
every time i come around demolition might crush

chorus anna wise thundercat  bilal
if these walls could talk
i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
if these walls could talk
i love it when im in it i love it when im in it
oh oh oh oh ohh
verse 3 kendrick lamar
if these walls could talk theyd tell me to go deep
yelling at me continuously i can see
your defense mechanism is my decision
knock these walls down thats my religion
walls feeling like they ready to close in
i suffocate then catch my second wind
i resonate in these walls
i dont know how long i can wait in these walls
ive been on the streets too long
looking at you from the outside in
they sing the same old song
about how they walls always the cleanest
i beg to differ i mustve missed them
im not involved id rather diss em
id rather call on you put your wall up
cause when i come around demolition gon crush

chorus anna wise thundercat  bilal
if these walls could talk
i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
if these walls could talk
i love it when im in it i love it when im in it
oh oh oh oh ohh
instrumental break
verse 4 kendrick lamar
if your walls could talk theyd tell you its too late
your destiny accepted your fate
burn accessories and stash them on the yard
take the recipe the bible and god
wall telling you that commissary is low
race wars happening no calling co
no calling your mother to save you
homies to say youre irrepetible not acceptable
your behavior is sammy the bull like
a killer that turned snitch
walls is telling me you a bitch
you pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
that sentence so important
walls telling you to listen to sing about me
retaliation is strong you even dream bout me
killed my homeboy and god spared your life
dumb criminal got indicted same night
so when you play this song rewind the first verse
about me abusing my power so you can hurt
about me and her in the shower whenever she horny
about me and her in the after hours of the morning
about her baby daddy currently serving life
and how she think about you until we meet up at night
about the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
and how she fuckin on a famous rapper
walls can talk talk

poem kendrick lamar
i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in a hotel room285embed"
