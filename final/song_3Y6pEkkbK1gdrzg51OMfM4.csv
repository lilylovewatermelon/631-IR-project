if youre going to go and tell me goodbye
why you gotta go and wear your jeans so tight
you dont need those boots to just get gone
and in the end its my heart youre walkin on

chorus
thats gonna to leave a memory thats gonna to hurt a while
long nights going crazy every morning ill be
crying like a baby baby cant you see
thats gonna leave a memory the way youre leaving me

verse 2
i dont wanna watch a ten walk away
i could maybe take a seven or an eight
theres some things that just dont go together like
never wear a short dress for a long goodbye

chorus
thats gonna to leave a memory thats gonna to hurt a while
long nights going crazy every morning ill be
crying like a baby baby cant you see
thats gonna leave a memory the way youre leaving me
