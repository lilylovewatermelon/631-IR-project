havent seen the sun since they hauled me away
the boss man says theres no use in tryin
he wont let me color outside of the lines

got these chains on me
and theyre draggin me down
got these chains on me
hear that clankin sound
got these chains on me
mister hear my song
dont say imagination is morally wrong

mmhmmhmm
drink of water boss

as long as ive been here i got nothin to show
try to make somethin but the boss says no
wanna be creative but the man wont hear it
that big boss man is tryin to crush my spirit

got these chains on me
they wont let me fly
got these chains on me
wont tell me why
got these chains on me
mister hear my song
dont say imagination is morally wrong
no they wont let us dance or bang that gong
cause they say imagination is morally wrongyou might also likeembed"
