everything i want i have
money notoriety and rivieras
i even think i found god
in the flashbulbs of the pretty cameras
pretty cameras pretty cameras
am i glamorous tell me am i glamorous

chorus
hello hello cacan you hear me
i can be your china doll if you wanna see me fall
boy youre so dope your love is deadly
tell me life is beautiful they all think i have it all
i have nothing without you
all my dreams and all the lights mean
nothing without you

verse 2
summertime is nice and hot
and my life is sweet like vanilla is
gold and silverlined my heart
but burned into my brain all these stolen images
stolen images baby stolen images
can you picture it babe that life we couldve lived

chorus
hello hello cacan you hear me
i can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
boy youre so dope your love is deadly
tell me life is beautiful they all think i have it all
i have nothing without you
all my dreams and all the lights mean
nothing without you

we were two kids just tryin to get out
lived on the dark side of the american dream
we would dance all night play our music loud
when we grew up nothing was what it seemed

chorus
hello hello cacan you hear me
i can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
boy youre so dope your love is deadly
tell me life is beautiful they think that i have it all
i have nothing without you
all my dreams and all the lights mean
nothing without you
hello hello cacan you hear me
i can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
boy youre so dope your love is deadly
tell me life is beautiful they think that i have it all
i have nothing without you
all my dreams and all the lights mean
nothing without you
