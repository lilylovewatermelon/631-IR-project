a cement building
white cinderblocks
and faded red letters
the sign read cold spot
he worked behind the counter
to them he was an old man
when my world was crumbling
my grandpa gave me his hand

chorus
it was crickets minnows and kerosene
rc moonpies and a softball team
learned about life learned about girls
learned about livin in this cold cruel world
its where you bought your tag for your whitetailed deer
where the southern baptist bought the most beer
a hole in the wall with holes in the wall
from behind this counter you saw it all
at the cold spot

verse 2
it was cool in july
warm in december
if i live a hundred years
ill always remember
the song and the hum to that old ceiling fan
and his north georgia voice saying buddy you can
out here im just a kid trying to make a name
i am who i am because he raised kane
see kane brown liveget tickets as low as 19you might also likechorus
selling crickets minnows and kerosene
rc moonpies and a softball team
learned about life learned about girls
learned about livin in this cold cruel world
its where you bought your tag for your whitetailed deer
where the southern baptist bought the most beer
a hole in the wall with holes in the wall
from behind this counter you saw it all
at the cold spot
oh yeah
at the cold spot

chorus
it was crickets minnows and kerosene
rc moonpies and a softball team
learned about life learned about girls
learned about livin in this cold cruel world
it was heaven on earth when my world was hell
and the big stores came and the business failed
but all my memories are alive and well
at the cold spot
oh yeah
at the cold spot
take me back to the cold spotembed"
