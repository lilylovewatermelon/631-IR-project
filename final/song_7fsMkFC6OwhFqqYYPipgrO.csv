woke up at six six pray to a 9 9
twelve twelve was already runnin from twelve a nigga was flyin
ayy i got the time today bitch i got the time
ayy i got the time today bitch i got the time time

verse 1 jid  kenny mason
time is of the essence im progressively improvin
impressive and im pressin if you secondguess my movements
first to the bullshit
who tryna hang with me i brought the nooses
i draw the stainless like you draw conclusions
its a ball of confusion
the writings on the wall was all illusion
you got the drip but that shit all pollution
i shot the clip and had another for the audible
all the bullshit aside boy i got plenty time
ive been ready for whatever anytime
from a city where niggas on killin time
in your pockets for nickels or penny dimes
nigga shot him but shit he got minimized
we was livin by ma would go inside behind the window hide
feefifo niggas slide
tryna dodge bullets from a dodge
god left when the winter came then the summer died
rain rain come another time
ill be rappin til im mummified
tell your favorite rapper its pajama time
he a ugly bastard but a son of mine
its over for you but its underlined
i come before you with a humble mind
and a stomach growl plus i smell foul
takin big shits from the humble pies ayy ayy ayy

verse 2 lil wayne
time is of the essence im a blessin in balenciaga
diamonds are impressive but their best friends are expensive drama
i was a perfection no protection im with and without it
why am i so reckless is a question that dont get responses
tie em down inspect em disconnect em if theres any power
cowards talk excessive pissterine is what i rinse they mouth with
tired of contestants invest in the winners column
im so timeless but i got plenty time
no sinus but i got plenty slimes
more commas than a long sentence slime
no problem to kill em thats killin time
i done did my time
but you know they still be tryna give me time til the end of time
since the beginnin of time i put in the time
and thats all the time thats in time
put it on the line til the finish line
never crossed the line stay within the lines
i dont marginalize i dont sympathize
and if its on his mind i help him decide
if thats your homies side then defend his side
or we gon storm your side and then rinse you dry
thats homicide thats genocide
im large in size they minimized
im armed this time cant miss this time
i got time today and you just in time yeah
verse 3 jid
im at the line of scrimmage know the scrimmage line
with a large spliff its decriminalized
i gotta party like the nigga on timbas side
he got a stick and a rod he said get in the ride
theres no thinkin about it til the finish line
we got plenty time we got plenty rhymes
tell tim and swizz to hit the insta live
i put a milli on us vers anybody
thats plenty dimes niggas been advised
thats a warnin sign i just got into the game to gentrify
whats a modern rapper to a renaissance
nigga ill be snappin til the end of time time3embed"
