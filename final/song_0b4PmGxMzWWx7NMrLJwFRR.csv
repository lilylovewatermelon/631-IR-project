liar liar
no you dont ever tell the truth
liar liar
cant nobody say youre fireproof

verse 1 blondfire
follow you to dust
leavin footprints on the clouds as were walkin home
iron hearts all turn to rust
by tears and the days on a diamond street
kiss these apocalips
chasin shadows livin dreams that dont exist
anymore
we need to find a way

prechorus blondfire
well we are who we are and were all goin under
were the past were the last and well last until were under

chorus aloe blacc

verse 2 blondfire
all closed and in your head
counting heartbeats til the feelings good and gone
on a dull path in a rush
sky clears all the rain over everything
hear these apocalips
where the whispers and the sand and the sun eclipse
forevermore
we need to find a way

prechorus blondfire
well we are who we are and were all goin under
were the past were the last and well last until were under

chorus aloe blacc
liar liar
no you dont ever tell the truth
liar liar
cant nobody say youre fireproof

outro blondfire
people talkin but i cant hear them no
i just sit there and watch them come and go
there might be somethin underneath it all
but at least ill find well all find out in the end
at least ill find well all find out in the end13embed"
