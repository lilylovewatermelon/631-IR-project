ima be paid forever
i look up finally famous nigga

chorus
i woke up working like im mexican
that mean i work from 10 to 10
then 10 to 10 then 10 again
nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

verse 1
all this bread can’t be too good for my cholesterol
don’t come round talking loudly fucking up my repertoire dawg
i can’t lie bruh lately i’ve been stressing heavily
im sipping popping smoking on whatever take the pressure off
you bitch you ff imperial
til my burial dodging every bullet and venereal
antifuckboy material til i’m dead i’m living proof
if you focus on what’s in front of ya and not what’s in the peripheral
it’s gone word boy i seen drama on drama
drama on drama over comma on comma
i’m bringing home dead prez my house done feel like its haunted
i put the city on my back right along with my garments
went to sleep snoring

chorus
i woke up working like im mexican
that mean i work from 10 to 10
then 10 to 10 then 10 again
nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

i got three jobs like im jamaican though
i need three wives like i was haitian though
one cook one clean the other pms’ing
no hablo inglés if police ask questions
we don’t know what that mean nigga
they say detroit going through the great depression
still it’s been depressed so long i can’t even tell depression here
my homeboy still gon’ pull up on them rims big as a ferris wheel
so many rides up on the curb my lil cuz thought the fair was here
like oh im primo top spot redeemed ho
for who my team
and we might take a trip to jamaica montego
pussy and flamingos
got me thinking fuck i need to sleep for huh

chorus
i woke up working like im mexican
that mean i work from 10 to 10
then 10 to 10 then 10 again
nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

outro
nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline
