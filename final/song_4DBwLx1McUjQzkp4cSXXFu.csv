its a gentle touch but more than enough
she can stop this ole world from spinning too much
its a natural thing and i do believe
i found my reason to be

chorus
shes got a way with me
shes got a way with me

verse 2
im not the same man since shes been around
theres more to this life ive suddenly found
i look at myself now so differently
its her love that brings me peace

chorus
shes got a way with me
shes got a way with me

verse 3
whatever it is ill always be under her spell
shell always be all ill ever need
i could search the whole world
and i know id never find
someone perfect as her for me
suddenly its something
you just cant live without
oh you know you found love
beyond any doubt
with a simple mans words
i can never convey all that i feel when i say
