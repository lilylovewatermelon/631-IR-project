you had your heart on your sleeve the last time
took it so seriously the last time
gave everybody a piece the last time
yeah you said it would be the last time

chorus
if you find that silver lining you should know what that means
youve been movin fast splittin at the seams
if you find that silver lining youre already in deep
theres another piece that was buried underneath

verse 2
you were out of your league the last time
didnt expect еm to see your bad side
you told em they could bеlieve in you believe in you
now you just gotta believe it too oh woah yeah

chorus
if you find that silver lining you should know what that means
youve been movin fast splittin at the seams
if you find that silver lining youre already in deep
this could be your last hope that might be all you need
