you say you wander your own land
but when i think about it i dont see how you can
youre aching youre breaking
and i can see the pain in your eyes
says everybodys changing and i dont know why

chorus
so little time
try to understand that im
trying to make a move just to stay in the game
im trying to stay awake and remember my name
but everybodys changing and i dont feel the same

verse 2
youre gone from here soon youll disappear
fading into beautiful light
cause everybodys changing and i dont feel right

chorus
so little time
try to understand that im
trying to make a move just to stay in the game
im trying to stay awake and remember my name
but everybodys changing and i dont feel the same

chorus
so little time
try to understand that im
trying to make a move just to stay in the game
im trying to stay awake and remember my name
but everybodys changing and i dont feel the same
