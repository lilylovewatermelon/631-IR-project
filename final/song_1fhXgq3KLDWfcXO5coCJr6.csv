so many eyes i can see
im static and i cant move my feet
from the moment that you stood next to me
feeling manic i forgot how to speak

prechorus
theres a rhythm inside that i cant slow down
in this moment in time no i wont stop now
or give up my hands up for love
and theres a rhythm inside that i cant slow down
in this moment in time no i wont stop now
give up my hands up for love

chorus
it feels like i can be the one for your love
come show me what youre feeling
it feels like i can be the one for your love
come show me how youre feeling
come show me
come show me what youre feeling
come show me how youre feeling
show me what youre feeling

verse 2
time only knows how to heal
feels like magic i dont know if this is real
when the lights go out and my feet
dont even wanna touch the ground
i feel the panic of my world turned upside down

and theres a rhythm inside that i cant slow down

chorus
it feels like i can be the one for your love
come show me what youre feeling
it feels like i can be the one for your love
come show me how youre feeling
come show me
