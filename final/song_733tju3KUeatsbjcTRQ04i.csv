you might also likehamilton
i imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
this is where it gets me on my feet
the enemy ahead of me
if this is the end of me at least i have a friend with me
weapon in my hand a command and my men with me
then i remember my elizas expecting me
not only that my elizas expecting
we gotta go gotta get the job done
gotta start a new nation gotta meet my son
take the bullets out your gun

ensemble
what

hamilton
the bullets out your gun

ensemble
what

hamilton
we move under cover and we move as one
through the night we have one shot to live another day
we cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
we will fight up close seize the moment and stay in it
its either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
the code word is rochambeau dig me
ensemble
rochambeau

hamilton
you have your orders now go man go
and so the american experiment begins
with my friends all scattered to the winds
laurens is in south carolina redefining bravry

hamilton  laurens
well never be free until we end slavery

hamilton
when we finally drive the british away
lafayette is there waiting—

hamilton  lafayette
in chesapeake bay

hamilton
how did we know that this plan would work
we had a spy on the inside thats right

hamilton  company
hercules mulligan

mulligan
a tailor spyin on the british government
i take their measurements information and then i smuggle it

company
up

mulligan
to my brothers revolutionary covenant
im runnin with the sons of liberty and i am lovin it
see thats what happens when you up against the ruffians
we in the shit now somebody gotta shovel it
hercules mulligan i need no introduction
when you knock me down i get the fuck back up again
company
left right hold

what what what
hamilton
after a week of fighting a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

lafayette
we lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

mulligan
and just like that its over we tend to our wounded we count our dead
laurens
black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

washington
not yet

hamilton
we negotiate the terms of surrender
i see george washington smile
we escort their men out of yorktown
they stagger home single file
tens of thousands of people flood the streets
there are screams and church bells ringing
and as our fallen foes retreat
i hear the drinking song theyre singing…

all men
the world turned upside down
company
the world turned upside down
the world turned upside down
the world turned upside down
down
down down down

lafayette
freedom for america freedom for france

company

hamilton
