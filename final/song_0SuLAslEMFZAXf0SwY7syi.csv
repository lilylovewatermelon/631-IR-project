i was the knight in shining armor in your movie
would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
now im a ghost i call your name you look right through me
youre the reason im alone and masturbate

but that shits broken that shits broken
lie lie llie i tried to hide
but now you know it

i was the prototype like 3 stacks on that cd
an example of the perfect candidate
now all your girlfriends say that you dont want to see me
youre the reason that i just cant concentrate
