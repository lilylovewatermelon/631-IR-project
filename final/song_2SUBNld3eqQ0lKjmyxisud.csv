i keep losing my socks
where the hell do they go
i bet theyre finally free
floating somewhere in the sea
do they miss my feet
i keep losing my socks
i got nothing to wear
i bet theyre at her place
a house where i cant show my face
how i wanna be there

chorus
holy moly its a real donothing day
i could change address and try another state
i could change my name it wont do anything
adventure is out there adventure is out there
so why am i in hеre so why am i in here today

verse 2
think im losing my mind
apathеtic and tired 
think where they could be
some hotel in germany
hope theyre loving the ride

verse 3
i bought me some new socks
i wont lose them im sure
and someday hopefully
ill slip away and theyll lose me
and ill be seeing the world
