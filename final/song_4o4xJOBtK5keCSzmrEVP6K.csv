repress and restrain
steal the pressure and the pain
wash the blood off your hands
this time she wont understand
chorus
change in the air
and theyll hide everywhere
and no one knows whos in control

verse 2
youre working so hard
and youre never in charge
your death creates success
rebuild and suppress
chorus
change in the air
and theyll hide everywhere
and no one knows whos in control
piano solo
chorus
change in the air
and theyll hide everywhere
and no one knows whos in control
