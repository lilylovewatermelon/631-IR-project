its an empty shell i live in
the doors are always closed
and i spend my weeks
losing my head resting my bones
and they say that nothings given
so i guess ill get nothing at all
and ill accept defeat
cause you cant swing
when the fights lost
you know

prechorus
cant see the grass getting greener cause
out here aint nothing but blue
and your eyes blood red the high helps a little
but everyone you meets just passing through
white lies take all of the color from you
most nights you dont sleep at all
and you black out blind you hide
is there any wonder no one ever really tries to call
and you say

chorus
ooh sometimes i feel like an animal
ooh i climb so high just to feel a fall and let it go
so look me in the eyes am i someone else
ooh sometimes i feel like an animal
an animal an animal
see noah kahan liveget tickets as low as 102you might also likeverse 2
and i always have a vision
but i always watch it go
and then i feel too weak
and its too much and its too close

prechorus
cant see the grass getting greener cause
out here aint nothing but blue
and your eyes blood red the high helps a little
but everyone you meets just passing through
white lies take all of the color from you
most nights you dont sleep at all
and you black out blind you hide
is there any wonder no one ever really tries to call
you say

chorus
ooh sometimes i feel like an animal
ooh i climb so high just to feel a fall and let it go
so look me in the eyes am i someone else
ooh sometimes i feel like an animal
an animal an animal

prechorus
cant see the grass getting greener cause
out here aint nothing but blue
and your eyes blood red the high helps a little
but everyone you meets just passing through
you say
chorus
ooh sometimes i feel like an animal
ooh i climb so high just to feel a fall and let it go
so look me in the eyes am i someone else
ooh sometimes i feel like an animal
an animal an animal
ooh
