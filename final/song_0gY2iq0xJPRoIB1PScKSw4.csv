girl i been thinking bout us
and you know i aint good at this stuff
these feelings piling up wont give me no rest
this might come out a little crazy
a little sideways yeah maybe
i dont know how long itll take me but ill do my best

chorus 1
youll be my soft and sweet
ill be your strong and steady
youll be my glass of wine
ill be your shot of whiskey
youll be my sunny day
ill be your shade tree
youll be my honeysuckle
ill be your honey bee

verse 2
yeah that came out a little country
but every word was right on the money
and i got you smiling honey right back at me
now hold on cause i aren’t done
theres more where that came from
well you know im just having fun but seriously

if youll be my louisiana
ill be your mississippi
youll be my little loretta
ill be your conway twitty
youll be my sugar baby
ill be your sweet iced tea
youll be my honeysuckle
ill be your honey bee

verse 3
your kiss just said it all
im glad we had this talk
nothing left to do but fall in each other’s arms
i could have said i love you
could have wrote you a line or two
baby all i know to do is speak right from the heart

chorus 1
youll be my soft and sweet
ill be your strong and steady
youll be my glass of wine
ill be your shot of whiskey
youll be my sunny day
ill be your shade tree
youll be my honeysuckle
ill be your honey bee
chorus 2
if youll be my louisiana
ill be your mississippi
youll be my little loretta
ill be your conway twitty
youll be my sugar baby
ill be your sweet iced tea
youll be my honeysuckle
ill be your honey bee
