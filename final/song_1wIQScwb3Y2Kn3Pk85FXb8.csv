remember boys never let a lady open the door
and be there with a lighter if she wants a smoke
remember boys never let her go to sleep crying
when she tells you bout her dreams
you gotta fill em up with hope

chorus 1
cause i dont wanna be a one night boy
i dont wanna be an aint right boy
i dont wanna be a had a ball wait it out no call kinda love song boy
i dont wanna be a regret or the one that she forgets
i dont wanna be a june to september
i wanna be one of those remember boys

verse 2
remember boys always open her beer first
and tell her that you love her even when she makes you mad
and remember boys no matter what you make it work
you want her and need her and fight to keep her
let her know you know what you have
