skit 6
enough you talk of the peoples rights
the people have only those rights which i choose to give them
and thats for their own good believe me
i do doom
they disappoint me they must work faster
but the prisoner
ah yes the young traitor who has tried to turn my people against me
watch him i have special plans for that one

verse 1
beef rap could lead to getting teeth capped
or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap
i suggest you change your diet
it can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it
or even a stroke heart attack heart disease
it aint no starting back once arteries start to squeeze
take the easy way out phony until then
they know they wouldnt be talking that bologna in the bullpen
so disgusting pardon self as i discuss this
they talk a wealth of shit and they aint never seen injustice
bust this like a cold milk from out the toilet
two batteries some brillo and some foil heatll boil it
he be better off on pc glued
and its a feud so dont be in no tv mood
every week its mystery meat seaweed stewed
food we need food
verse 2
he wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh
a rather ugly brother with flows thats gorgeous
drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit
they need it like a hole in they head or a third tit
her bra smell his card say aw hell
barred from all bars and kicked out the carvel
keep a cooker where the jar fell
and keep a cheap hooker thats off the hook like ma bell
top bleeding maybe fella took the loaded rod gears
stop feeding babies colored sugarcoated lard squares
the odd pair swears and god fears
even when its rotten weve gotten through the hard years
i wrote this note around new years
off a couple of shots and a few beers but who cares
enough about me its about the beats
not about the streets and who food he bout to eat
a rhyming cannibal whos dressed to kill and cynical
whether is it animal vegetable or mineral
its a miracle how he get so lyrical
and proceed to move the crowd like a old negro spiritual
for a mil do a commercial for mello yello
tell them devils hell no sell yall own jello
we hollow krills she swallow pills
he follow flea collar three dollar bills
and squealed for halal veal if yall appeal
dig the real its how the big ballers deal
twirl a l after every meal food
verse 3
what up to all rappers shut up with your shutting up
and keep a shirt on at least a buttonup
yuck is they rhymers or strippin males
outofwork jerks since they shut down chippendales
they chippin nails doom tippin scales
let alone the preorders thats counted off shippin sales
this one goes out to all my peoples skippin bail
dippin jail whippin tail and sippin ale
light the doobie til it glow like a ruby
after which they couldnt find the villain like scooby
hes in the lab on some old buddha monk shit
overproof drunk shit but whoda thunk it
punk try and ask why ours be better
could be the iron mask or the cosby sweater
yes you whos screwed by the dude on the cd nude
we need food59embed"
