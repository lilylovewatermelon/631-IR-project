im just so tired
wont you sing me to sleep
and fly through my dreams
so i can hitch a ride with you tonight
and get away from this place
get a new name and face
i just aint the same without you in my life

verse 2
late night drives
all alone in my car
i cant help but start
singing lines from all our favorite songs
and melodies in the air
singing life just aint fair
sometimes i still just cant believe youre gone

chorus
and im sure the view from heaven
beats the hell out of mine here
and if we all believe in heaven
maybe well make it through one more year
down here

verse 3
feel your fire
when its cold in my heart
and things sorta start
reminding me of my last night with you
i only need one more day
just one more chance to say
i wish that i had gone up with you too
see yellowcard liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likechorus
and im sure the view from heaven
beats the hell out of mine here
and if we all believe in heaven
maybe well make it through one more year
down here

you wont be coming back
and i didnt get to say goodbye goodbye
i really wish id got to say goodbye

chorus
and im sure the view from heaven
beats the hell out of mine here
and if we all believe in heaven
maybe well make it through one more year
down here

outro
i hope that all is well in heaven
cause its all shot to hell down here
i hope that i find you in heaven
cause im so lost without you down here

you wont be coming back
and i didnt get to say goodbye goodbye
i really wish id got to say goodbye1embed"
