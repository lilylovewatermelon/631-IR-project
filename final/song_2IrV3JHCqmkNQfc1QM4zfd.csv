when i was surrounded by the world
you were the only one who came
and you were the only one astounded
which kept me grounded
as the other girls trashed my very name

chorus 1
then i looked over just in time to see her smiling back at me
and saying everythings okay
as long as youre inside my blue veins your blue veins

verse 2
yeah and the feeling that you gave me
no matter what i do or where i go it always will remain
and those who would enslave me
to get to me must get past you and will have no luck
cause youll protect me from all pain
its true you know but

chorus 2
the most beautiful yeah the most beautiful thing
cause anything else cant compare
must be the blood thats running through your blue veins

break
your blue veins

and i know you wont deceive me
like the rest and theres nothing you need to explain
youre always the first one to believe me
when i said to you girl i think its gonna rain
but i could be wrong

chorus 3  outro
yeah but all of these things all these things
theyre all truly nice but aint nothing
aint nothing compared to the love
thats running through your little blue veins your blue veins6embed"
