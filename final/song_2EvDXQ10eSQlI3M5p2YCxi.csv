how far to go
to hell just ask me
if you want to see
the view from your knees
come down and join me
im the final straw
the nail in coffin just by being
who i am is so goddamn

im not the master of the universe
i walk the earth the wrong way
met my potential and fulfilled the worst
my best is cursed the wrong way

the wrong way the wrong way

your glass is half
his glass is full
my glass is empty
youre running short
of not enough
well ive got plenty

ive come a long way
i went the wrong way
you might also likeand who i am is so goddamned

im not the master of the universe
i walk the earth the wrong way
met my potential and fulfilled the worst
my best is cursed the wrong way

and when i die im gonna fly
and come and get you
and when you try and run
ill be the curse above you

its gonna end
its gonna end

in the race for disaster i will come in first
thats what ive learned
the hard way

if you want to know
how far to go
to hell just ask me
if you want to see
the view from your knees
come down and join me
ive come a long way
i went the wrong way
ive come a long way
i went the wrong way
ive come a long way
i went the wrong wayembed"
