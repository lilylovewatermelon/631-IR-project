theres no combination of words i could put on the back of a postcard
no song that i could sing but i can try for your heart
our dreams and they are made out of real things
like a shoebox of photographs with sepiatoned loving
love is the answer at least for most of the questions in my heart
like why are we here and where do we go and how come its so hard
its not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
ill tell you one thing its always better when were together

chorus
mmm its always better when were together
yeah well look at them stars and were together
well its always better when were together
yeah its always better when were together

verse 2
and all of these moments just might find their way into my dreams tonight
but i know that theyll be gone when the morning light sings
or brings new things for tomorrow night you see
that theyll be gone too too many things i have to do
but if all of these dreams might find their way into my day to day scene
id be under the impression i was somewhere in between
with only two just me and you not so many things we got to do
or places we got to be well sit beneath the mango tree now

yeah its always better when were together
mmm were somewhere in between together
well its always better when were together
yeah its always better when were together

outro
i believe in memories
they look so so pretty when i sleep
and i when and when i wake up
you look so pretty sleeping next to me
but there is not enough time
and there is no no song i could sing
and there is no combination of words i could say
but i will still tell you one thing
were better together21embed"
