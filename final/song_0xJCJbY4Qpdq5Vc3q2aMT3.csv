last friday night tgif

verse katy perry
theres a stranger in my bed
theres a pounding in my head
glitter all over the room
pink flamingos in the pool
i smell like a minibar
djs passed out in the yard
barbies on the barbecue
this a hickey or a bruise

prechorus katy perry
pictures of last night ended up online
im screwed oh well
its a blacked out blur but im pretty sure it ruled
damn

chorus​​ katy perry
last friday night
yeah we danced on tabletops
and we took too many shots
think we kissed but i forgot
last friday night
yeah we maxed our credit cards
and got kicked out of the bar
so we hit the boulevard
last friday night
we went streaking in the park
skinny dipping in the dark
then had a ménage à trois
last friday night
yeah i think we broke the law
always say were gonna stopop ohwoah

postchorus katy perry
but this friday night
do it all again
this friday night
do it all again

outro katy perry

et

verse katy perry
youre so hypnotizing
could you be the devil could you be an angel
your touch magnetizing
feels like i am floating leaves my body glowing
they say be afraid
youre not like the others futuristic lover
different dna
they dont understand you

prechorus katy perry
youre from a whole nother world
a different dimension
you open my eyes
and im ready to go lead me into the light

chorus katy perry
kiss me kikikiss me
infect me with your lovin fill me with your poison
take me tatatake me
wanna be your victim ready for abduction
boy youre an alien
your touch so foreign
its supernatural
extraterrestrial

firework

verse katy perry
do you ever feel like a plastic bag
drifting through the wind wanting to start again
do you ever feel feel so paperthin
like a house of cards one blow from cavin in
do you ever feel already buried deep
six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
do you know that theres still a chance for you
cause theres a spark in you

prechorus katy perry
you just gotta ignite the light
and let it shine
just own the night
like the fourth of july

chorus katy perry
cause baby youre a firework
come on show em what youre worth
make em go awe awe awe
as you shoot across the skyyy

outro katy perry
boom boom boom
even brighter than the moon moon moon
boom boom boom
even brighter than the moon moon moon6embed"
