but in the meantime its get swole get clean time
concentrate on gettin green time
and as the years go by they forgot
about the small time soldier from the block huh
to kill the crook they threw the book at me
dont worry be nappy dont even look happy
put me in the hole gave me cold cuts
did pushups until i swole up
and then they offer me a furlough
but what they dont know as soon as i get free im killin five mo
they asked me if i changed much
i told em yeah even though im still the same nut
they started askin me questions about my brother
and makin remarks about my mother hmm
wait a minute hold up
makin jokes about my folksll get yours blown up
they sent me back to the hole for what i told em
i guess he didnt believe me so i showed him
he went home to find a tragedy
nigga thats what you get for tryin to badger me
and anybody else that wanna sweat me
im already in jail so you punks cant get me
you better pray they never see me
cause if they let me free prepare for trouble on the streets
