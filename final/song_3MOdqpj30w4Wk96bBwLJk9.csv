the last time you cared about anything
the last time you allowed yourself to be seen
so pretentious your lies unrelenting disguise
creating tears in your eyes your mind withers and dies
pretending to be something you are not
somewhere in the middle you are now caught
youve never seen who you really are

no life breathes in you
all the time you laugh you wait you cry
no part of your life is true
all the time your life passes you by

the last time you cared about anything
the last time you allowed yourself to be seen
so pretentious your lies unrelenting disguise
creating tears in your eyes your mind withers and dies
pretending to be something you are not
somewhere in the middle you are now caught
youve never seen who you really are

i dont ever want to see
i dont ever want to be like you

i dont care what you give
hollowman you cant live like this

i dont ever want to be like you
hollowman
i dont care what you give
hollowman you cant live like this

your voice is just a whisper
you call upon your blank thoughts as you try
to fit in where you missed her
you missed the chance to stop living a lie

the last time you cared about anything
the last time you allowed yourself to be seen
so pretentious your lies unrelenting disguise
creating tears in your eyes your mind withers and dies
pretending to be something you are not
somewhere in the middle you are now caught
youve never seen who you really are

i dont ever want to see
i dont ever want to be like you
hollowman
i dont care what you give
hollowman you cant live like this

i dont ever want to see
i dont ever want to be like you
hollowman
i dont care what you give
hollowman you cant live like this
i cant remember
the last time you cared about anything
the last time you allowed yourself to be seen
so pretentious your lies unrelenting disguise
creating tears in your eyes your mind withers and dies
pretending to be something you are not
somewhere in the middle you are now caught
youve never seen who you really are

i dont ever want to see
i dont ever want to be like you
hollowman
i dont care what you give
hollowman you cant live like this

i dont ever want to see
i dont ever want to be like you
hollowman
i dont care what you give
hollowman you cant live like this

where is your sanity
where is your sanity
where is your sanityembed"
