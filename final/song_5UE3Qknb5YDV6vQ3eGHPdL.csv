​verse 1 fergie
baby baby when youre lookin deep in my eyes
i know youre seeing past my makeup
into the little girl that used to hide out and cry
when her parents fought trying to be strong dodododo do

prechorus fergie
you can see the hurt in me
the cover ups of secrecy
and all that i aspire to be
youll see youll see dodododo do
you know who i really am
no entourage or caravan
do you even give a damn
about all that now tell me

chorus fergie
would you love me
if i didnt work out or i didnt change my natural hair
and i could be the one you want to grow older with baby
ill give you all that i got woo hoohoo hoo

through sun and rain and heavy snow
