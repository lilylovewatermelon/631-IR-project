ooh ohoh

verse 1
i sit and think about the day that youre gonna die
your wrinkled eyes betray the joy with which you smile
care to see my reason
care to put your life in mine
looking at life from the perspective of a boy
whos learned to love you but has also learned to grow
could we make it better stormy weather
its so hard to know

chorus
oh oh oh
is there anybody home
who will believe me wont deceive me
wont try to change me

oh oh oh
is there anybody home
who wants to have me just to love me
stuck in the middle

verse 2
i look at you you look at me we bite each other
and with your bitter words you kick me in the gutter
but my troops are bigger than yours
youll never stand my fight
see mika liveget tickets as low as 37you might also likeours is a family thats based upon tradition
but with my careless words i tread upon your vision
are five kids better than one
who doesnt like to be gone

chorus
oh oh oh
is there anybody home
who will believe me wont deceive me
wont try to change me

oh oh oh
is there anybody home
who wants to have me just to love me
stuck in the middle

bridge
yeah
yeah
yeah

this is just who i am
this aint a greater plan
to break your heart
of me
i know that what ive started
means that when we have parted
i can live
in honesty

chorus
oh oh oh
is there anybody home
who will believe me wont deceive me
wont try to change me

oh oh oh
is there anybody home
who wants to have me just to love me
stuck in the middle

outro
stuck in the middle
stuck in the middle
