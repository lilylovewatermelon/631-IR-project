verse
shell have california blond hair and california start
shes not from around here but
goodbyes break her heart
she grew up in a sleepy little town
but the parents split up and the marriage went south
and now the kids are mean but the streets are clean
so they dont say a word
leaves for college in about a month shes got
bags to pack and numbers to crunch shes
got a boy with long brown hair
and she seems to be the only thing he cares about

chorus
but whatll he do
for his backpack full of songs
take him with you

instrumental break
