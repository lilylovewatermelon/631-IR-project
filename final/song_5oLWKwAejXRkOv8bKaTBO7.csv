red bull in my hands yeah feels like i got wings
lotta people in my face but i cant hear a thing

verse 3
i got the adrenaline rhyme like im a veteran
fine ive been ahead of the game no way im settlin
drained but ima get it in lame this is a medicine
hey you get the medic kit beats cause i dont let em live
fast better keep pedalin blast you with the pen again
laugh but im ahead of them
act like i dont get it then that is when i enter in rap
until i never can cash it is irrelevant passion is the element
laps around these other men pass em who you runnin with
facts is what im coming with back but i aint never left
snap and i will never get wack you better get a grip
last isnt a medal its glass and ima shatter it
who do you think youre battling
who do you think youre laughing at
i am not a comedian man it dont even matter
if you dont know what im saying you better do what the chorus says
you dont know what the chorus is
turn up on the choruses
