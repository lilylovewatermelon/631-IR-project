stormin through the party like my name was el niño
when im hangin out drinkin in the back of an el camino
as a kid was a skid and no one knew me by name
trashed my own house party cause nobody came

prechorus
well i know im not the one you thought you knew back in high school
never goin never showin up when we had to
attention that we crave dont tell us to behave
im sick of always hearin act your age

chorus
i dont wanna waste my time
become another casualty of society
ill never fall in line
become another victim of your conformity and back down

verse 2
because you dont know us at all we laugh when old people fall
but what would you expect with a conscience so small
heavy metal and mullets its how we were raised
maiden and priest were the gods that we praised

prechorus
cause we like havin fun at other peoples expense and
cuttin people down is just a minor offense then
its none of your concern i guess ill never learn
im sick of being told to wait my turn
see sum 41 liveget tickets as low as 26you might also likechorus
i dont wanna waste my time
become another casualty of society
ill never fall in line
become another victim of your conformity and back down

bridge
dont count on me
to let you know when
dont count on me
ill do it again
dont count on me
its the point youre missin
dont count on me
cause im not listenin

breakdown
well im a nogoodnick lower middle class brat
backpacked and i dont give a shit about nothin
you be standin on the corner talking all that kufuffin
but you dont make sense from all the gas you be huffin
cause if the egg dont stain youll be ringin off the hook
youre on the hit list wanted in the telephone book
i like songs with distortion to drink in proportion
the doctor said my mom shouldve had an abortion
chorus
i dont wanna waste my time
become another casualty of society
ill never fall in line
become another victim of your conformity and back down

outro
waste my time with them
casualty of society
waste my time with them
victim of your conformity and back down29embed"
