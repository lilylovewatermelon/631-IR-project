reintroduction to a feeling i dont wanna know
yeah ive been running but it caught me somehow
the rule was never fall in love i did it anyway
you make my heartbeat keep pumping
why the hell you turn it up so loud

prechorus
cause the fire dont fear the water
and the night dont fear a thief
its just you and me together
here we are we are we are we are we are
here we are we are we found euphoria

chorus
here we are we are we are
and youre glowing from inside
like the dawn is in your eyes
and i see it for the first time
here we are we are we found euphoria

verse 2
i went in all the way i thought i could get in and out
she said relax you gonna be here for a while
but i threw caution to the wind and did it anyway
and the truth is im learning to love it and i aint gonna turn it down

cause the fire dont fear the water
and the night dont fear a thief
once the music sets you over
here we are we are we are we are we are

chorus
here we are we are we are
and youre glowing from inside
like the dawn is in your eyes
and i see it for the first time
here we are we are we found euphoria

bridge
here we are we are we are we are we are
here we are we are we found euphoria

chorus
and youre glowing from inside
like the dawn is in your eyes
and i see it for the first time
here we are we are we found euphoria2embed"
