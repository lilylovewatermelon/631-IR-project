verse 1
god knows it
pure mind and pure soul i possess he knows it
anointed and protected i was chosen
my heart is way too frozen to get broken

prechorus
i seen man turn fool for the money
one too many times
i seen some girls turn their back
on their best friend from time
i heard you say things that you cant take back girl no time
i need you to go easy now and fix up one time

chorus
i cannot tell who is my friend
i need distance between me and them
gonna have to teach me how to love you again
god knows im trying
god knows im trying for you
god knows im trying
