haah ah yeah
haah ah yeah

verse 1
i am your neighbor i can see you
i got these blinds that i peek through
and when youre crying i see your tears fall down
theyre making oceans that in i sink and drown
sink and drown oh no

verse 2
i feel i know you i feel i know you well
i saw you go through i saw you go through hell
i was there when you first let euphoria spill on your bed sheets
i could feel what you felt
what you felt oh no
what you felt
what you felt oh no

chorus
do you feel used
well i would too i would too oh
and would you use me like i did you
oh you would too

haah ah yeah
haah ah yeah

verse 3
i am your neighbor i can hear you
i got this tin can with a string through
and when youre crying i hear your shaky breath
and when youre lying i hear your heart confess
heart confess oh no

bridge
times slipping away
cause i see your moving signs every day
you got your things in your boxes your ovens always cold
youll leave me all alone with just a empty peephole

chorus
and do you feel used
well i would too i would too
and would you use me like i did you
oh you would too
do you feel used
well i would too i would too
and would you use me like i did you
oh you would too
