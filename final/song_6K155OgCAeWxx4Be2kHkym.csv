one two three four

verse 1
well the buildings out in brooklyn are taller than the clouds
and i dont like who i am sunday morning comin down
tequila out in texas is tougher on the tongue
than the devil that i met in oklahoma when is young

verse 2
i miss that old ball cap you stole from me
out in the woods around a fire in eastern tennessee
and the beatin that i got from them boys in baton rouge
was nothin like the beatin that i got from lovin you

chorus
take me back to us then
where the times told true
and the sun does shine on a lawn chair holdin you
take me back to us then
where theres a warm warm light
radiatin off a cheap smile
oh my i could die tonight

verse 3
that creek we jumped in while you were shakin cold
i never thought such heat would grow dry and old
takes blood and guts just to get to where we were
put on your dancin shoes ill be him and you be her
see zach bryan liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likechorus
take me back to us then
where the times told true
and the sun does shine on a lawn chair holdin you
take me back to us then
where theres a warm warm light
radiatin off a cheap smile
oh my i could die tonight

outro
so take me back to us then
theres a warm warm light
radiatin off a cheap smile
oh my i could die tonightembed"
