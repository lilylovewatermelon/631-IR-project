i dont think you understand
that what youre doing is not so cool
you think its funny to mess with my mind
dont you
you know i like you so you just tease me
you give me just enough to hang on and on
when youre just wasting my time

chorus
youre simply wasting my time
so quit wasting my time

bridge 1
do you hear me when i say
ooh ooh ooh oooh

verse 2
so let me ask you something
do you think im pretty or dont you
do you wanna get with me or not and now
or are you just wasting my time

chorus
youre simply wasting my time
so quit wasting my time

and what have you got to say
well things have got to change
see this just isnt right
i dont wanna have to fight
and i think i better go
cause this aint working out anymore
and im sorry sorry sorry

bridge 2

that what you did was
just not so cool baby
youre just not that cool3embed"
