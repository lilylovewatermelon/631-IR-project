had to get my riide on rider
eyes on the prize shawn

had to make moves like olajuwon
started out selling dimes and nicks
graduated to a brick no exaggeration
my infatuation with the strip legendary
like a schoolboy crushin on
merely nearlyeveryevery chick woo

and got left on some just me myself and i

verse 2 jayz
like i never rode in a limo
like i just dropped flows to a demo woo

and i got os in the rental ugh
back in the stu again no problemo
was a whole lot simple when you think back
you thought that you would never make it this far then you—
take advantage of the luck you handed
or the talent you been given
aint no halfsteppin aint no no slippin
aint no different from a block thats hittin
gotta get it while the gettings good
gotta strike while the irons hot
when you stop then you gotta bid it good riddance
goodbye this is my second major breakup
my first was with a pager
with a hoopty a cookpot and the game
this ones with the stu with the stage with the fortune—
well maybe not the fortune—but certainly the fame

and my thirst is the same as when i came ughugh
