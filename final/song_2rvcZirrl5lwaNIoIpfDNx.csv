she said ive been up all night and halfscared to death
i can smell the liquor on your breath
i payed for your rehab with my ira
boy your daddyd be turning in his grave
she said son ive done all mama can do
i can save myself but i cant save you
he said i wished you and jesus would get off my back
they said his truck was doing 90 when he crashed
i bet it gets so quiet in heaven sometimes
even god cries when an angels hands are tied

verse 2
they said honey grownups do this all the time
and tears welled up in their little girls eyes
they said now its not something that youve done
it just that mommy and daddy dont get along
she said do you guys mean that you need a time out
and that daddys gonna move to a different house
they said youll have two bedrooms youre a lucky kid
she said what about checkers wheres he gonna live
i bet it gets so quiet in heaven sometimes
even god cries when an angels hands are tied

verse3
she prays angels watch me through the night
stay by my side until morning light
god bless mama god bless daddy
keep us together and happy
i bet it gets so quiet in heaven sometimes
even god cries when an angels hands are tiedyou might also likeembed"
