dear god do you wanna tear your knuckles down
and hold yourself
dear god can you climb off that tree
meat in the shape of a t
dear god the paper says
you were the king in the black limousine
dear john and all the kings men
cant put your head together again

chorus
before the bullets before the flies
before authorities take out my eyes
the only smiling are you dolls that i made
but you are plastic so are your brains

verse 2
dear god your sky is as blue
as a gunshot wound
dear god if you were alive
you know wed kill you

chorus
before the bullets before the flies
before authorities take out my eyes
the only smiling are you dolls that i made
but you are plastic so are your brainsyou might also like5embed"
