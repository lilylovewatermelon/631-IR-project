where ya at
cold beer sipper
camod out little skoal mint dipper
chicken liver catfish lip ripper
patch on your shirt with your daddys name

carhartt king
ridin around with your marlboro queen
making a big loud mapco scene
with a cloud of smoke when you drive away

prechorus
yeah theres rednecks in the north
hell theres rednecks in the south
and we all got some kinda twang
little country slang coming out our mouth
stacking bales spraying the stetson
raisin hell but saying the blessin
i know youre out there
toting a shotgun i just got one little question

chorus
where ya at
oklahoma to winona mississippi
where ya at
macon georgia california bossier city
country pride is country wide
yeah we all climbing that podunk ladder
so put ya long neck up
if ya got a little hick in your blood
then it really dont matter
where ya at
