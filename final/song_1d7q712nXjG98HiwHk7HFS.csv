the offseason nigga
we offing niggas ayy thats right
fuck you talkin’ bout thats right ayy
offing niggas yeah hey yeah
vocal up a little more hey

verse
uh applying pressure
started my grind where crime festers
and nines showing like they in they second trimesters pregnant
that’s why when niggas throw a shot or two online i pay no mind to their benign gesturеs mm
nigga please i got my mind on much bigger things to say thе least
my latest speeches sound like they was released by david east what up east
verses hit hard never pitched hard or played the streets
these niggas whips hard behind closed doors cant pay the lease uh
aint nothin wrong with livin check to check cause most have to i understand that
instead of cappin why don’t you talk about being a broke rapper i don’t understand that
thats a perspective i respect because it’s real
what its like to be nice as fuck but got to stress to pay the bills
that was me in 08 seein no cake
not even on dates i celebrated my birth
just did the mental math and calculated my worth
shit crazy didn’t know i got more ms than a real slim shady video im the real shady
big boss less rick ross more like a wavy hideo
kojima they tote steamers around the way we tippytoe
round crack vials and coldblooded killers no reptiles
just projectiles from niggas salty you rockin the fresher textiles
i seen best pals grow up and switch i hate to see it
sometimes over a couple dollars more often over a bitch ah i hate to see it
i can cap and say that i never scratched my jealousys itch
but thank god i conquered that cause if not id never be rich
envy keep your pockets empty so just focus on you
if you broke and clownin a millionaire the joke is on you
money aint everything i never say that never
but niggas throw stones knowin they sell they soul to get wherever they at come on man
just know these verses is some shit they gon forever playback nigga come on nigga

hell yeah ooh
fuck you know what it is nigga
dont even dare
niggas try to act like they dont— bitch
thats why i gotta flex sometimes
cause niggas just try to act like you just not that motherfuckin nigga like
like you just really dont do it how you do it
like niggas will really try to act like you dont do what you do
nigga look you dead in your face
and really act like you dont do it to the level that you do it
thats why sometimes you gotta come through and just do it at the level that you do it in front of every nigga face
so they know the difference between you the real niggas and the mothafuckin fraudulent niggas man
dont never get it fucked up
if a nigga cant do it like you do it sometimes you gotta do it in front of his fuckin face so hell know forever
damn that nigga did it how i always wanted to do it and ill never be able to do it like that
bitch its a difference ah
these are the same ones telling our people what we are and we arent because were just not working hard enough
and that mentality is what were up against today
but this is good to know because this time when we march on the capitol
you can go ahead and let em know long before we get there were coming to get that check102embed"
