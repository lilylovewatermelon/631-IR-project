now she wanna fuck with me fuck with me
live a life of luxury models in my money trees
such beautiful company
fuck a 9 to 5 i’m seeing dollar signs
but im still driving around in my old whip still living at home
got issues with my old chick she blowin up my phone hot
talkin ‘bout some old shit like who’s this who’s that
could be worse so to calm her nerves
i just tell her

hook 1
roll up an l and light it let’s go to space
be my co i’ll be the pilot let’s get away
let’s get away let’s get away
let’s get away baby let’s get away

hook 2
if money doesnt fall from trees
maybe we can make believe today
all i need is company
and rest assured i got it babe

verse 2
working for the finer things finer things
getting in all kind of ways pennies all in my champagne
every day we celebrate celebrate
fuck your little funds a million aint enough
but im still driving around in my old whip still living at home
got issues with my new chick she blowin’ up my phone hot
all i hear is womp womp womp womp womp womp
but it could be worse girl calm your nerves
i want you to

hook 2
money doesn’t fall from trees
maybe we can make believe today
all i need is company
and the rest is yours i promise babe
