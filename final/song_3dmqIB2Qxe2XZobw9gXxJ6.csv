she grew up in an indiana town
had a good lookin mama who never was around
but she grew up tall and she grew up right
with them indiana boys on them indiana nights
well she moved down here at the age of eighteen
she blew the boys away was more than theyd seen
i was introduced and we both started groovin
she said i dig you baby but i got to keep movin on
keep movin on

chorus
last dance with mary jane one more time to kill the pain
i feel summer creepin in and im tired of this town again

verse 2
well i dont know but ive been told
you never slow down you never grow old
im tired of screwin up tired of going down
tired of myself tired of this town

refrain
oh my my oh hell yes
honey put on that party dress
buy me a drink sing me a song
take me as i come cause i cant stay long

last dance with mary jane one more time to kill the pain
i feel summer creepin in and im tired of this town again

verse 3
theres pigeons down on market square
shes standin in her underwear
lookin down from a hotel room
the nightfall will be comin soon

refrain
oh my my oh hell yes
you got to put on that party dress
it was too cold to cry when i woke up alone
i hit my last number and walked to the road

chorus
last dance with mary jane one more time to kill the pain
i feel summer creepin in and im tired of this town again7embed"
