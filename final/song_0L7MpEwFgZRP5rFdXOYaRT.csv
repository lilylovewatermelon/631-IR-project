see how i circle
imaginary mind imaginary lines
let the maze of my design carry you on

verse 1 shane maux
just bumped my head and my face turns purple
running through hurdles running in circles
trying to escape from this thing that i fear
everything seems clear like the end is near
in the rear i can see the beast getting close
surrounded by ghosts in a cloud of smoke
the smoke reeks of failure i dont want to fail
but all the stairwells lead straight to hell
so im jumping trap doors in the floor fore they floor me
focus on the love and the light right before me
walls keep spinning and my path keeps turning
patience thinning and my calves keep burning
hotter than a furnace suddenly im learning
maybe i finally reached the point of no return and
east is north and west is south
i feel like ima never get out
im trapped

chorus kaye
see how i circle
imaginary mind imaginary lines
let the maze of my design carry you on
see how i fly away

behind me my exgirls chasing me
in front of me my next girls facing me
awaiting me the lights in my sight
but i cant cross these enemy lines im behind
i can feel the fatigue but im dying to shine
but the road winds i rewind i rewind
got to find a new place to hide for the night
will i ever escape boy i try and i try
everybodys watching me im dying to get out
in the glass labyrinth i am the mouse

chorus kaye shane maux
see how i fly away im trapped
its just a game you
play here in this labyrinth maze im trapped
im trapped
im trapped
im trapped
