when we were in our youth
we had dreams that we could fly
we had friends that were invisible
and love that never died
and as we grew old i felt the pain
we always knew the truth
the love would heal if we stayed true
to the dreams of our youth

verse 1
ive been walking around for hours
holding onto stems of flowers
my chest is feeling all your pain
as it began to rain
and now the end has come to this
the little victories ill miss
of everything wed overcome
and all thats said and done

chorus
im leaving our war behind
life can go on without you
im leaving our war behind
the night that i leave town
you might also likeverse 2
the walls that you helped me take down
are only getting taller now
and ive even forgotten how
to stand on my two feet
i wanna say im on my own
and happier to be alone
but everything i do alone
has every bit of you

chorus
im leaving our war behind
life can go on without you
im leaving our war behind
the night that i leave town
dont tell me to justify
living my life without you
im leaving my our war behind
the night that i leave town

bridge
all my life its always the same thing
all my life its always the same thing
all my life its always the same thing
its always the same
its always the same
its always the same thing
outro
im leaving our war behind
life can go on without youembed"
