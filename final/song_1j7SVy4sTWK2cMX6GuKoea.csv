sounds like a love song sounds like a love song
i already heard your side of the story hear mine
ima tell you why
cause you changed baby you changed
when you got dough you got dough and changed
nah nah nah uhuh no you listen cause i do

verse 1
i remember like yesterday the very day i met you
you were lookin fly i was actin shy
so when you walked on by i ignored you
but then you turned around and asked my name
in an instant my attitude changed
swept me off my feet you were so sweet
full of comedy you amused me
gave you my number next day you called
askin if you can see me see me
so i said alright you can stop on by
it gave me butterflies
thirty minutes knock knock its you
im glad to see you but i keep my cool
from day one i fell in love with you
but now i ask myself who are you
because

you changed you changed
you got dough and changed
you got dough and you changed
baby you changed
it wasnt the same
you got dough and changed
you got dough and you changed
what was i to do

verse 2
you were never there
why should i be there
theres no one there to hold me
im young at heart and age and these are the days
when a girl like me needs lovin
if hes not then someone else is getting what he calls his
he wasnt taking care of home home left me there alone lone
so whats a girl to do when shes feeling in the mood
we were together but we grew apart
thinkin with my mind and not my heart
packed up all my things left the engagement ring
cause from the looks of things i cant do this
live this life that i call my life
if this is what its like being your wife
id rather be your friend then through thick and thin
but now its the end of my sufferin yeah yeah yeah
chorus
you changed you changed
you got dough and changed
you got dough and changed baby
you got dough and you changed it wasnt the same
baby you changed
it wasnt the same
cause you got dough and changed
you got dough and you changed
oh what was i to do what was i to do

bridge
sit around and wait for you to call
when i wanted to be in your arms
missing you every minute you were gone
you were gone too long
doin who knows what who knows where
you act like you didnt care when i told you
i wouldnt be here cause you changed

chorus
you changed you changed
you know you changed yeah
you got dough and changed
you got dough and you changed
baby you changed it wasnt the same
it wasnt the same
you got dough and changed baby
you got dough and you changed
what was i to do
outro
no it aint about the cars with the rims or the rings
no it aint about the lies and houses and minks
perpetrating with the clothes broken promises please
no aint about the life that you given to me
no it aint about it
no it aint about it
oh no what was i to do baby
no it aint about the cars with rims or the rings
no it aint about the lies and houses and minks
perpetrating with the clothes broken promises please
no aint about the hype that you given to me
no it aint about it
youve changed youve changed youve changed youve changed
no it aint about it youve changed4embed"
