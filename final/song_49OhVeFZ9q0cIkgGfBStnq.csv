in new york freedom looks like too many choices
in new york i found a friend to drown out the other voices
voices on the cell phone
voices from home
voices of the hard sell
voices down the stairwell in new york
just got a place in new york

verse 2
in new york summers get hot well into the hundreds
you cant walk around the block without a change of clothing
hot as a hairdryer in your face
hot as a handbag and a can of mace
in new york
i just got a place in new york
new york new york

verse 3
in new york you can forget forget how to sit still
tell yourself you will stay in
but its down to alphaville

chorus
new york
new york new york
new york new york
new york ah ooh
see u2 liveget tickets as low as 450you might also likeverse 4
the irish have been coming here for years
feel like they own the place
they got the airport city hall concrete asphalt
they even got the police
irish italians jews and hispanics
religious nuts political fanatics in the stew
happily not like me and you
thats where i lost you new york

chorus
new york new york
new york
new york new york
new york ah ooh
new york ah ooh

verse 5
in new york i lost it all to you and your vices
still im staying on to figure out my midlife crisis
i hit an iceberg in my life
you know im still afloat
you lose your balance lose your wife
in the queue for the lifeboat
you got to put the women and children first
but youve got an unquenchable thirst for new york
chorus
new york
new york
new york new york

bridge
in the stillness of the evening
when the sun has had its day
i heard your voice whispering
come away now

outro
new new york
new
new york ah ooh
