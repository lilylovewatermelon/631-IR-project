old man wrigley lived in that white house
down the street where i grew up
mama used to send me over with things
we struck a friendship up
i spent a few long summers
out on his old porch swing

verse 2
said he was in the war when in the navy
lost his wife lost his baby
broke down and asked him one time
how you keep from goin crazy
he said ill see my wife and son in just a little while
i asked him what he meant he looked at me and smiled

chorus
said i raise my hands
bow my head
im findin more and more truth
in the words written in red
they tell me that theres more to life
than just what i can see oh i believe

verse 3
a few years later i was off at college
talkin to mom on the phone one night
gettin all caught up on the gossip
the ins and outs of the small town life
she said oh by the way son
old man wrigley has died
see brooks  dunn liveget tickets as low as 30you might also likeverse 4
later on that night
i laid there thinkin back
thought about a couple longlost summers
i didnt know whether to cry or laugh
if there was ever anybody
deserved a ticket to the other side
itd be that sweet old man
who looked me in the eye

chorus
said i raise my hands
bow my head
im findin more and more truth
in the words written in red
they tell me that theres more to life
than just what i can see

bridge
i cant quote the book
the chapter or the verse
you cant tell me it all ends
in a slow ride in a hearse
you know im more and more convinced
the longer that i live
yeah this cant be no this cant be
no this cant be all there is
chorus
lord i raise my hands
bow my head
oh im findin more and more truth
in the words written in red
they tell me that theres more to this
than just what i can see i believe

outro
oh i
