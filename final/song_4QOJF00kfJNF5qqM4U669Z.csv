you walked with me footprints in the sand
and helped me understand where im going
you walked with me when i was all alone
with so much unknown along the way
then i heard you say

chorus
i promise you im always there
when your heart is filled with sorrow and despair
ill carry you when you need a friend
youll find my footprints in the sand

verse 2
i see my life flash across the sky
so many times have i been so afraid
and just when i i thought id lost my way
you gave me strength to carry on
thats when i heard you say

chorus
i promise you im always there
when your heart is filled with sorrow and despair
and ill carry you when you need a friend
youll find my footprints in the sand
you might also likebridge
when im weary
well i know youll be there
and i can feel you when you say

chorus
i promise you
im always there
when your heart is filled with sadness and despair and despair
ill carry you when you need a friend need a friend
youll find my footprints in the sand
i promise you im always there
when your heart is full of sadness and despair and despair
ill carry you when you need a friend
youll find my footprints in the sandembed"
