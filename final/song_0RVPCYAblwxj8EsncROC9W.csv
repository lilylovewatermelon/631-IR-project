same old bedroom floor
same old empty sheets
i hate this haunted bed
so down heres where i sleep

trying to find a place
to hide what you have left
some things never change
my heart hasnt yet

chorus
well i dont want to go out tonight
yeah but i cant be alone
standing underneath this broke streetlight
cant somebody take me home
cant somebody take me home

verse 2
the hope that we had left
wrapped around your ring
that river just rolled on by
when i watched it sink

chorus
well i dont want to go out tonight
yeah but i cant be alone
standing underneath this broke streetlight
cant somebody take me home
cant somebody take me
see kenny chesney liveget tickets as low as 34you might also likeverse 3
out of this bar
out of this heartache
out of this town
that just keeps breaking down
keeps breaking down

chorus
well i dont want to go out tonight
yeah but i cant be alone
standing underneath this broke streetlight
cant somebody take me home

chorus
i dont want to go out tonight
yeah but i cant be alone
standing underneath this broke streetlight
cant somebody take me home
cant somebody take me home
wont you take me homeembed"
