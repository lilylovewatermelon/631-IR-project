sun is melting that ego
you better find a new place to hide it
do you really know who you are
does anybody really care
go purchase your friends at the mall
theyre going on sale soon
meet us at the checkout line
so we can all laugh at you

prechorus
im feeling depressed and real low
no popularity has taken its toll
i know theres no way back from this
so how could life get worse than this

verse 2
they dont even know me
they never even gave me a chance
they threw my ass on the bathroom wall
im thinking bout moving to france
well the last mile is miles away
and im on my way out of the game
you dont know what they made me do
and im not permitted to say

verse 3
theyll chase you on your way back home
slam the door and jump in bed
dont you come out till its safe
i guess that by then youll be dead
oh why must they come after me
why cant they pick on somebody else
its like i did something wrong
but i guess its something i missed
in the eyes of all of them
to nothing ill ever amount
so when i hear people laughing
i know who theyre talking about
