dont get me started love
ive had too much to drink
had too much time to think
so leave me alone
crying when youre by yourself
cause of what they think about you
makes time go slow slow slow yeah
makes time go slow slow slow slow

verse 2
somethings gotta give soon
or im gonna lose it
substance abusing
and never come down down
fall off the deep end
and forget my english
whats the point of language
if you dont say what you feel
so with that being said

chorus
to all the bitch ass hoes that hate me the most
oh yeah i hate you too
to all the punk ass fucks that just want to talk shit
i hate you too
to all the high class ass thats too hard to pass
oh yeah i hate you too
doses and mimosas
champagne and cocaine
help to get me through

ten in the morning
and im skipping breakfast
and drinking a beverage ahh
to ignore it all
guess ignorance is bliss and
ive come to embrace it
its all overrated
except drugs and alcohol
so with that being said

chorus
to all the bitch ass hoes that hate me the most
oh yeah i hate you too
to all the punk ass fucks that just want to talk shit
i hate you too
to all the high class ass thats too hard to pass
oh yeah i hate you too
doses and mimosas
champagne and cocaine
help to get me through67embed"
