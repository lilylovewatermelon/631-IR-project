ill be taking flowers to the cemetery of my heart
for all of my lovers in the present and in the dark
every anniversary ill pay respects and say im sorry
for they never stood a chance as if they could
when no one knows what its like to be us

verse 2
ive never seen the sky this colour before
its like im noticin everythin a little bit more
now that all the dust has settled
i rebut all my rebuttals
no one knows what its likе to be us
