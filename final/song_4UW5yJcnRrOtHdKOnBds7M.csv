lovers in the long grass look above them
only they can see where the clouds are going
only to discover dust and sunlight
ever make the sky so blue

verse 2
afternoon is hazy river flowing
all around the sounds moving closer to them
telling them the story told by flora
dreams they never knew

interlude

verse 3
silver willows tears from persia
those who come from a faroff island
winter chanterelle lies under cover
gloryofthesun in blue

interlude

verse 4
some they know as passion some as freedom
some they know as love and the way it leaves them
summer snowflake for a season
when the sky above is blue
when the sky above is blue

verse 5
lying in the long grass close beside her
giving her the name of the one the moon loves
this will be the day she will remember
when she knew his heart was
loving in the long grass close beside her
whispering of love and the way it leads them
lying in the long grass in the sunlight
they believe its true love
and from all around them floras secret
telling them of love and the way it breathes and
looking up from eyes of amaranthine
they can see the sky is blue
knowing that their love is true
dreams they never knew
and the sky above is blue3embed"
