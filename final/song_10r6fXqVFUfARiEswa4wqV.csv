i dont i dont i dont want to say goodbye
i dont i dont i dont want to say goodbye

verse 1
it only falls into place when youre falling to pieces
you find love that lasts a while til you lose the reasons
sayin god im alive
but the whole place is quiet
you miss something that you cant place but you cant deny it
dont know whether you want a place in the coast or the country
you cant stay here its hard to face and it feels too ugly
you light a fire inside yourself let it burn
stare up at a starless sky and you say

chorus
its like im still here with you
its like im still here with you
i dont i dont i dont want to say goodbye

verse 2
the past coming back with the light in the morning
look down on myself like a patient in surgery
and i used to watch my mother move
like god was in the room
its a bottomless hole ive found out here with a trace of no one
grab a past box of photos i rip myself open
im in bed and im wondering
if im callous but hoping
can i fix what is broken

its like im still here with you
its like im still here with you
i dont i dont i dont want to say goodbye
its like im still here with you
its like im still here with you
i dont i dont i dont want to say goodbye

bridge
ohoh
its like im still here with you
its like im still here with you
i dont i dont i dont want to say goodbye
i dont i dont i dont want to say
i dont i dont i dont want to say
i dont i dont i dont want to say goodbye
i dont i dont i dont want to say
i dont i dont i dont want to say
i dont i dont i dont want to say goodbye

outro
it only falls into place when youre falling to pieces
you find love that lasts a while then you lose the reasons
you say god im alive
but the whole place is quiet
you miss something that you cant place but you cant deny itembed"
