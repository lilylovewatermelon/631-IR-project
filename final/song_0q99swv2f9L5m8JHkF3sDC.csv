i scraped my knees while i was praying
and found a demon in my safest haven
seems like its getting harder to believe in anything
than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts
i wanna know what itd be like
to find perfection in my pride to see nothing in the light
or turn it off in all my spite
in all my spite ill turn it off

chorus
and the worst part is before it gets any better
were headed for a cliff
and in the freefall i will realize im better off
when i hit the bottom

verse 2
the tragedy it seems unending
im watching everyone i looked up to breaking bending
or taking shortcuts and false solutions
just to come out the hero
well i can see behind the curtain i can see now
the wheels are cranking turning its all wrong the way were working
towards a goal thats nonexistent
its nonexistent but we just keep believing

and the worst part is before it gets any better
were headed for a cliff
and in the freefall i will realize im better off
when i hit the bottom

bridge
i wanna know what itd be like
to find perfection in my pride to see nothing in the light
and turn it off in all my spite
in all my spite ill turn it off just turn it off
again
again again

chorus
and the worst part is before it gets any better
were headed for a cliff
and in the freefall i will realize im better off
when i hit the bottom
and the worst part is before it gets any better
were headed for a cliff
and in the freefall i will realize im better off
when i hit the bottom7embed"
