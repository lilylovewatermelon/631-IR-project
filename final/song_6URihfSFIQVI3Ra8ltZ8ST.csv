were covered over now
were covered over now
daylight
sometimes it ends too soon
and i dont want to sleep

til i remember lending softer ears to my lungs
til i remember lending softer ears to my lungs
and maybe if i hold you now would you hold me now
and maybe if i hold you now would you hold me now

night falls
and were getting older too
were getting older too
life
sometimes it ends too soon
sometimes it ends too soon

til i remember lending softer ears to my lungs
til i remember lending softer ears to my lungs
and maybe if i hold you now would you hold me now
and maybe if i hold you now would you hold me now

were getting older
