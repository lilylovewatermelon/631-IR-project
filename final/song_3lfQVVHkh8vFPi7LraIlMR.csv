i need you pure i need you clean
dont try to enlighten me
power to misconstrue
what have they done to you

chorus
infants in infantry
rewrite their history
uproot their colony
youre ripe for harvesting
virgin cells to penetrate
too premature to permeate
they cant elucidate
never thought i was the enemy

postchorus
i am the plague
i am the plague

verse 2

thy gifts dont give to me
now youve been anointed
theyve been asking for it
