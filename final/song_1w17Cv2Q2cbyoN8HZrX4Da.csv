you look like youve been through hell
but came back clean on the other side
lord knows that i didnt treat you well
but youll be treated like a queen tonight

chorus
so darlin wont you lie back
and just let an old flame warm you
i know im not the same me
and lord knows youre not the old you
so babe just pack your things
and i swear that we wont come back
youre about as pretty as those
washington lilacs

verse 2
i roll up with a killer in my hand
and ill never claim to be
better than i am
you look like a killer in that dress
so i guess my aim is to be your man

chorus
so darlin wont you lie back
and just let an old flame warm you
i know im not the same me
and lord knows youre not the old you
so babe just pack your things
and i swear that we wont come back
youre about as pretty as those
