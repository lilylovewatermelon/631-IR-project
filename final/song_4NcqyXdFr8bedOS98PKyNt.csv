i can think of younger days
when living for my life
was everything a man could want to do
i could never see tomorrow
but i was never told about the sorrow

chorus
and how can you mend a broken heart
how can you stop the rain from falling down
how can you stop the sun from shining
what makes the world go round
how can you mend this broken man
how can a loser ever win
please help me mend my broken heart
and let me live again

verse 2
i can still feel the breeze
that rustles through the trees
and misty memories of days gone by
we could never see tomorrow
and no one said a word about the sorrow

chorus
and how can you mend a broken heart
how can you stop the rain from falling down
how can you stop the sun from shining
what makes the world go round
and how can you mend this broken man
how can a loser ever win
please help me mend my broken heart
and let me live again

how can you mend this broken man
how can you mend
how can a loser ever win
how can you win
please help me mend my broken heart
and let me live again
and let me live againembed"
