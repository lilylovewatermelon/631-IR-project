walkin on the pavement i chipped my pride and my teeth on
the girl i grew up with lives a couple houses down
the 8 bus run the same dogs howl when the train
comes like my ex girl and next girl
used to rock the s curl wanted me a nextel
but my mama copped a razr thats why i couldnt blame her
flippin through my past like i used to flip the phone
they kickin out the blacks and all the houses getting clones
friends used to do pills and only eat at dus grill
the food was pretty good but the times was better hmm
these are the only days i missed like the first shawty i kissed
i used to have dreams now i dream

chorus aminé
i look around and i see nothing in my neighborhood
not satisfied dont think ill ever wanna stay for good
packed up my bags told mom and dad ive gotta go go
and once i do theyll finally see the inner me

verse 2 aminé
everybody wanna be a star everybody want a nice car
everybody wanna live great have a good damn time
never trip with the law
the popo up in po dirtier than bo
bullies from the past act like im they fuckin hero uh
livin in la for the weather i facetime mom when i miss her
i got some homies thatll never leave my hometown
when i pull up to the corner it smell like miley cyrus
i told em i dont smoke they say boy you fuckin wildin
innocent and young reckless and we dumb
our heart is like our earth and memories the sun

i look around and i see nothing in my neighborhood
not satisfied dont think ill ever wanna stay for good
packed up my bags told mom and dad ive gotta go go
and once i do theyll finally see the inner me

verse 3 aminé
mentality the same from my folks
momma wanna see me happy she dont wanna see me broke
i sip red wine sauvignon rastafar babylon
my youth will never die if i live it like a prize hey
who knows who i am who knows who i are
most people pretty sketch like a night at echo park
thats why i just keep it cool but my time is in a leisure
everytime im home i catch emotion like a seizure

interlude recording
i cut the first night we fuck around i put my finger in her bootyhole cause you know you gotta test the water with hoes aaand then

break aminé
i slip and slide through the times in my youth
whats age too young to worry too old to dream
whats age imagination to me tragedy to some
whats age i guess well find out when were older touché

chorus charlie wilson  aminé
i look around and i see nothing in my neighborhood
not satisfied dont think ill ever wanna stay for good
packed up my bags told mom and dad ive gotta go go
and once i do theyll finally see the inner me
