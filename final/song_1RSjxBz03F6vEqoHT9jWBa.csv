aint nobody fuckin with me like they used to
open seat in the coupe so i scooped you
i get caught up in my thoughts and i cant think right
caught up in a nightmare so i dont sleep right
i just want them to treat me like they used to ayy
i just want something real that im used to yeah
i just want them to treat me like they—ayy ayy
i just want something real that im—yeah yeah

verse 1 og worry
went from no one to someone at least i thought so
stuck up in a bad dream watching front row
people warnin me that everything is gonna change
never thought that it would be in the worst way
life goin up and goin down at the same time
suicidal thoughts creepin up in my mind
drug dealer pocket reaping the benefits
only thing i fuckin had to get me through this shit
ive been stripped of all i had man
lost relations with my dad damn
lost relations with the fam damn
lost touch of who i am sad
im out seekin peace like im seekin air to breathe
pray to a god that i never thought i would believe
grant me serenity for all the things i cannot change
wisdom to know that what i can aint the same

aint nobody fuckin with me like they used to
open seat in the coupe so i scooped you
i get caught up in my thoughts and i cant think right
caught up in a nightmare so i dont sleep right
i just want them to treat me like they used to
i just want something real that im used to
i just want them to treat me like—uh ayy
i just want something real that im—uh yeah

verse 2 maire de gras ville
all my life ive been waitin til the time right
waitin for the shade of light that make me shine bright
day turn to night yeah weeks turn to months
wishin i could press the pause button just once
hidin in the back tryna catch up to the front
everything i lack i make up for it when i stunt
more bitches more money more drugs more honeys
more stuff the more i want it the more i feel im fuckin stuck
i get by
goin through the motions fuckin barely even growin
i get high
hidin all of my emotions never change im stuck posted
i get by
what a lame excuse to keep doin what i do
i get high
wastin my shine and thats the fuckin truth20embed"
