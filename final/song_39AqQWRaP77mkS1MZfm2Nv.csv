stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
the floor is crackling cold
she took my heart i think she took my soul
with the moon i run
far from the carnage of the fiery sun

driven by the strangle of vein
showing no mercy id do it again
open up your eye
you keep on crying baby ill bleed you dry
the skies they blink at me
i see a storm bubbling up from the sea

and its coming closer

you shimmy shook my bone
leaving me stranded all in love on my own
do you think of me
where am i now baby where do i sleep
feels so good but im old
two thousand years of chasing taking its toll

and its coming closersee kings of leon liveget tickets as low as 117you might also likeembed"
