heard about a little mermaid cast away cast away
saw a little bitty fin and started swimming swimming
she disappeared with the sunlight once again once again

he prayed unto his father
as his lungs filled up with water

oh wont you take me to your paradise i wanna go
can i come play with you under the tide i wanna go
i want to swim inside your ocean eyes i wanna go
oh wont you take me to your paradise i wanna go

when he woke up on the dryland he saw visions visions
of the life with the mermaid cast away what a life what a life it would be
couldnt tell if it was love or just impatience patience
headed back with the black sun hits the waves hits the waves

and there she was in color
and with all his strength he called her

oh wont you take me to your paradise i wanna go
can i come play with you under the tide i wanna go
i want to swim inside your ocean eyes i wanna go
oh wont you take me to your paradise

oh wont you take me to your paradise i wanna go
can i come play with you under the tide i wanna go
i want to swim inside your ocean eyes i wanna go
oh wont you take me to your paradise

oh wont you take me to your paradise i wanna go
ive got to be with you i dont know why i wanna go
oh wont you take me to your paradise i wanna go
ive got to be with you ive got to be with you
