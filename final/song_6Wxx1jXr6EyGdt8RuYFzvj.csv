you cant lie to yourself after lovin somethin true
and ive never loved a soul quite the way that i love you
you told me you despise everything that ive become
how we always turn into everything were runnin from

verse 2
and i miss the way you followed when you jaywalked in the street
how you always talked more trash than any boy bad mouthin me
and the way that the oak creaked when you snuck up from my bed
the way that missin someone will have you seein steady red

chorus
take it slow as you leave me
dont you go home this evenin
with someone that youre actin like is me
and i will try my hardest darlin
wait on a star thats fallin
and i will wait so patiently
one thing i have quickly come to know
nothing kills you slower than lettin someone go

chorus
take it slow as you leave me
dont you go home this evenin
with someone that youre actin like is me
and i will try my hardest darlin
wait on a star thats fallin
and i will wait so desperately
one thing i have quickly come to know
nothing kills you slower than lettin someone go
