i had my first crush in season two
she passed me notes and filled our hands with glue
and in my corduroys wed walk to school
i sat and crossed my legs like jim would do
she moved away i was on season three
it hit my heart so hard id hardly speak
but i could find some peace and privacy
a paper company to sit with me

chorus jack met
who are we to wonder where were going
who am i to tell me who i am
lets take it back and take in every moment
who am i to tell me who i am

verse 2 ryan met
i turned down jameson when i was twelve
i spent that friday night with steve carell
the one where dwight became the head of sales
my eighthgrade graduation wished me well
i lost my grandpa during season six
i watched my mom she cried and held her kids
my mind was broken up i couldnt think
so i just hugged her the way michael did
