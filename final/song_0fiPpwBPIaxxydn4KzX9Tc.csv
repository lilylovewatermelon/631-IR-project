youve been acting awful tough lately
smoking a lot of cigarettes lately
but inside youre just a little baby oh
its okay to say youve got a weak spot
you dont always have to be on top
better to be hated
than loved loved loved for what youre not

prechorus
youre vulnerable youre vulnerable
you are not a robot
youre loveable so loveable
but youre just trouble

chorus
guess what im not a robot a robot
guess what im not a robot a robot

verse 2
youve been hanging with the unloved kids
who you never really liked and you never trusted
but you are so magnetic you pick up all the pins
never committing to anything
you dont pick up the phone when it ring ring rings
dont be so pathetic just open up and sing

i am not a robot
youre loveable so loveable
but youre just trouble

chorus

guess what im not a robot a robot

bridge
can you teach me how to feel real
can you turn my power off
and let the drum beat drop

chorus
guess what i am not a robot
guess what i am not a robot
guess what im not a robot a robot
guess what im not a robot a robot
guess what im not a robot a robot
