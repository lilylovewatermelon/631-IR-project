my trainers are matching my jacket
i’m strapped with that ratchet
i’m strapped with that bape and that ape
i’m gone off these medicals gone off these medicals
maybe one day ima get out the drank
and maybe one day we can fuck in the bank
i made me a porsche out of two and a quarter
i got to morocco and lay in some foreigns
then i come back to onyx and find me that one i can fuck on
and touch on and turn up and turn on
we don’t watch tv we count fettuccine
4 and a half it’s right under my beanie
i made me some snaps then i fucked on a genie
put her in a cab and i jumped in a ghini
you gon’ need yellow tape when i step on the scene
when you send me an invite i come with a biznite
she wrapped up in plastic got coke in the mattress
all of this shit is about living lavish
this money these cars and these bitches these carats
these radical styles i’ma give you a style
you can take it your new style aint gon make you a pile

prechorus
i been waking up to bitches in my hotel suite

verse 2
light skinned bone the same color macaroni
put her hair in a pony hit a note like toni
i know you hoes been lonely now i’m back on my lonely
and im back how you want it and im back and i want it
made a film like sony fuck the fake and the phony
i gots cake in the morning i rock adidas and margielas
i be staying at the telly eat a sandwich out the deli
and my life is like belly young future sincerely

prechorus
