verse 1
mmm shes starin at me
im sittin wonderin what shes thinking
mmm nobodys talkin
cause talkin just turns into screamin oh
and now as im yellin over her she yellin over me
all that that means is neither of us are listening
and whats even worse that we dont
even remember why were fighting

prechorus
so both of us are mad for nothing fighting for
nothing crying for
nothing woah ohoh
but we wont let it go for nothing come back for
nothing it should be nothing
to a love like what we got

chorus
oh baby i know sometimes its gonna rain
but baby can we make up now
cause i cant sleep through the pain cant sleep through the pain
