well im finding it harder
to be a gentleman every day
all the manners that ive been taught
have slowly died away
but if i held the door open for you
it wouldnt make your day

verse 2
you think that i care
about me and only me
when every single girl needs help
climbing up a tree
well i know it dont take much
to satisfy me

bridge
maybe its whatever is in my hand
thats distracting me
but if i could find emotion
to stimulate devotion
well then youd see

verse 3
well im finding it hard to say
that i need you twenty times a day
i feel comfortable so baby why
dont you feel the same
have a doctor come and visit us
and tell us which one is sane

id never said i wouldnt
throw my jacket in the mud for you
but my father gave it to me so
maybe i should carry you
then you said you almost dropped me
so then i did
and i got mud on my shoesembed"
