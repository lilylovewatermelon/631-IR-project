well its hard to love and not be loved
its hard to please your mind
when youve broken the heart of many a poor boy
but youll never break this heart of mine

verse 1
cant you see that lonesome ship that sails
that sails from shore to shore
if i was on that lonesome ship
id sail away no more

chorus
well its hard to love and not be loved
its hard to please your mind
when youve broken the heart of many a poor boy
but youll never break this heart of mine

verse 2
well i wish i was a pretty little bird
i wish i was a pretty little bee
i wish i was so far away
no more youd see of me

chorus
well its hard to love and not be loved
its hard to please your mind
when youve broken the heart of many a poor boy
but youll never break this heart of mine

the blackest crow that ever flew
will never turn to white
if you will prove your love to me
id turn my day to night

chorus
well its hard to love and not be loved
its hard to please your mind
when youve broken the heart of many a poor boy
but youll never break this heart of mine
oh lord
no youll never break this heart of mineembed"
