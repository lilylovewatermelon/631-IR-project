get on your dancing shoes
theres one thing on your mind
hopin theyre lookin for you
sure youll be rummagin through
oh and the shit shock horror
youve seen your future bride
yeah but its oh so absurd
for you to say the first word so youre waitin and waitin and

chorus
the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
well dont you always do the same
its what youre there for dont you know

verse 2
the lights are flashin
down in here tonight
and some might exchange a glance
but keep pretendin to dance
dont act like its not happening
as if its impolite
to go and mention your name
instead youll just do the same as they all do and hope for the best
you might also likechorus
the only reason that you came
so what you scared for
well dont you always do the same
its what youâ€™re there for but no

instrumental break

verse 3
get on your dancing shoes
you sexy little swine
hopin theyre lookin for you

and i said the shit shock horror
youve seen your future bride yeah
yeah but its oh so absurd
for you to say the first word so youre waitin and waitin12embed"
