im tired of being low its time to get high
you got a bad reputation well i do too
and i know you got another round left in you
so turn it up
whoaa dont turn me down
yeah turn it up
dont you turn me down
irons in the fire and notches on your belt
if your workin for hire im in need of some help
i got the gas in tank so what do you thank
i got some coins in my pocket gonna play some hank

you got your plastic wrap on your fresh tattoo
yeah a fire breathing dragon looks good on you
nasty as hell and ring my bell
no time to whisper its time to yell
