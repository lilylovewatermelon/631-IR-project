slim and tall behind me
spinnin me off of my feet
headin for the d
were taking our act to the street
roll around the city leavin our tracks on the ground

refrain
elevator up
baby i dont wanna come down

verse 2
hangin with sinners
the undesirable crowd
tokin on the train
playin our radio loud
got a sweet need for speed that doesnt know no bounds

refrain
elevator up
baby i dont wanna come down

chorus
spend a little time in the back of my mind
now it may be time to pay up to go
ive done it
ive had it
im ready for bed
anywhere at all
any way the wind blows

say hello to molly
shes got a sister as well
such a pleasant girl
as far as your family can tell
hold the camera steady turn the shutter speed way down

refrain
elevator up
baby i dont wanna come down

chorus
spend a little time in the back of my mind
now it may be time to pay up and go
ive done it
ive had it
im ready for bed
anywhere at all
any way the wind blows

bridge

chorus
spend a little time in the back of my mind
now it may be time to pay up and go
ive done it
ive had it
im ready for bed
anywhere at all
any way the wind blowsembed"
