stop makin the eyes at me
ill stop makin the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me
is that i dont really want you to

prechorus
and your shoulders are frozen cold as the night
oh but youre an explosion youre dynamite
your name isnt rio but i dont care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang bbbangoh

chorus
i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
i dont know if youre lookin for romance or
i dont know what youre lookin for
i said i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
dancin to electropop like a robot from 1984
well from 1984

verse 2
i wish youd stop ignorin me
because its sending me to despair
without a sound yeah youre calling me
and i dont think its very fair
you might also likeprechorus
that your shoulders are frozen cold as the night
oh but youre an explosion youre dynamite
your name isnt rio but i dont care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang bbbangoh

chorus
i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
i dont know if youre lookin for romance or
i dont know what youre lookin for
i said i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
dancin to electropop like a robot from 1984
well from 1984

bridge
and no there int no love no
montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness

chorus
well i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
i dont know if youre lookin for romance or
i dont know what youre lookin for
i said i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
dancin to electropop like a robot from 1984
said from 198483embed"
