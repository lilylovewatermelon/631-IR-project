game chose me i aint choose this
empty out the clip before you lose this
if your city on your back and your shoulder
you gotta rally you gotta spray like a soldier
vultures they come with the territory
v12 your motor is mandatory
whipping the soda be cool do the speed
make it on interstate 10 and achieve
this is not regular time you gon bleed
came from the game aint no trust pushing keys
from the cook up to the tour bus
you see how far ambition took us
we bring all the hood niggas with us
they nonbelievers we made em believe us
from my block to your block they love homicides
looking like a foreign dealership outside yeah

flew the dracos out at la on a pj
and were taking off no delay
no delay were taking off the murder rate
everything from chinchos to parquet

we risked it all to get it in
