i cant make my own decisions
or make any with precision
well maybe you should tie me up
so i dont go where you dont want me
you say that ive been changing
that im not just simply aging
yeah how could that be logical
just keep on cramming ideas down my throat

prechorus
woah

chorus
you dont have to believe me
but the way i way i see it
next time you point a finger
i might have to bend it back or break it break it off
next time you point a finger
ill point you to the mirror

verse 2
if gods the game that youre playing
well we must get more acquainted
because it has to be so lonely
to be the only one whos holy
its just my humble opinion
but its one that i believe in
you dont deserve a point of view
if the only thing you see is you

this is the last second chance
ill point you to the mirror
im half as good as it gets
ill point you to the mirror
im on both sides of the fence
ill point you to the mirror
without a hint of regret
ill hold you to it

chorus
i know you dont believe me
but the way i way i see it
next time you point a finger
i might have to bend it back or break it break it off
next time you point a finger
ill point you to the mirror
i know you wont believe me
but the way i way i see it
next time you point a finger
i might have to bend it back or break it break it off
next time you point a finger
ill point you to the mirror16embed"
