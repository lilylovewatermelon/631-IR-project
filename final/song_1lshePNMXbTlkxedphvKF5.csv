silence and quiet again in my life
far from these moments i wish i was
passion and truth we were about
before the shadows stole the beat of our hearts

chorus
after all we have been through
i can only look at you
through the eyes you lied to
im givin up givin up im givin up on you

after all if there is no way out
if you cannot stand beside me
if there isnt love there is only pride
im givin up im givin up this fight

verse 2
undo this leash you say i tied
when only our fears are to blame this time
and what am i to you just spit it out
im not afraid of the words that you hide

chorus
after all we have been through
i can only look at you
through the eyes you lied to
im givin up givin up im givin up on you
see lara fabian liveget tickets as low as 76you might also likeafter all if there is no way out
if you cannot stand beside me
if there isnt love there is only pride
im givin up im givin up this fight

bridge
where do we go where did it all crash
when did it start to fall apart

silence and quiet passion and truth
shadows only shadows

chorus
after all if there is no way out
if you cannot stand beside me
if there isnt love there is only pride
im givin up im givin up

after all we have been through
i can only look at you
with the eyes you lied to
im givin up givin up im givin up on you

after all if there is no way out
if you cannot stand beside me
if there isnt love there is only pride
im givin up im givin up this time
outro
