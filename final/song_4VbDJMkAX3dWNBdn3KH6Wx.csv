sometimes life it takes you by the hair
pulls you down before you know it
its gone and youre dead again
ive been in places and i wont pretend
that id make it out just to fall on my head
wake up strange and take the walk downstairs
hit the pawn up on the corner and pay for my rent
you know that i could not believe my own truth
just show em what i choose got nothing to lose oh

chorus
yeah yeah and its okay
i tie my hands up to a chair so i dont fall that way
yeah yeah and im alright
i took a sip of something poison but ill hold on tight

verse 2
you know those days when you wanna just choose
to not get out of bed youre lost in your head again
you play the game but you kind of cut
cause youre coming down hard your joints are all stuck
ive tried to say that its not the only way
i never knew if i could face myself to change
you were pacing i was insecure
slip and fall im dodging calls hug the prison ive been living in

yeah yeah and its okay
i tie my hands up to a chair so i dont fall that way
yeah yeah and im alright
i took a sip of something poison but ill hold on tight
yeah yeah and its okay
i tie my hands up to a chair so i dont fall that way
yeah yeah and im alright
i took a sip of something poison
took a sip of something poison poison
