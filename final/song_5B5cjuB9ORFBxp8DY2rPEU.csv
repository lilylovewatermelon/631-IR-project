verse 1
rubbing salt in my wounds like it dont hurt
like it dont hurt me
your sweet bitter love songs
that seduce me with a sinister beat hey hey
im bringin out the worst in you
it was never my intention to
that was just unfair to do
salt in my wounds
gettin burned up with the negative heat
oh oh oh oh

prechorus
how can i stay mad with you
when im so in love with you
oh yeah

chorus
oh oh oh
i dont know what we argue about
oh oh oh
when all we do is scream and shout
i still believe in our love right now
and its gonna work out somehow
you and me we got common ground
im not givin up no

are you lookin for a way out
are you lookin for an exit door
seems like all the fuss youre making
is a sign that youre not quite sure
well i dont recommend you do
cause what we gots too good to lose
and i can tell you know that too
or is it just aggravation
youre pickin on me
youre rubbing salt in my wounds

how can i stay mad with you oh had enough had enough
when im so in love with you had enough had enough oh yeah yeah

bridge
maybe just a kind word now and then
could turn it around and make us a happy end
but if this is it and the moment is gone
then oh well then i guess i musta just got it wrong
as wise as it sounds it doesnt make sense
and as long as it takes im gonna keep on tryin oh
cause im not givin up on us
