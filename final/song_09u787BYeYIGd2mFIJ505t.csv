cry your heart out itll clean your face
when youre in doubt go at your own pace
cry your heart out itll clean your face
when youre in doubt go at your own pace

verse 1
when i walk in a room im invisible i feel like a ghost
all my friends keep on tellin me that this feeling wont last mmm
i cant get no relief im so tired of myself i swear im dead in the eyes
i have nothin to feel no more i cant even cry

prechorus
when will i begin to feel like me again
im hanging by a thread
my skins paperthin i cant stop wavering
ive never been more scared

chorus
cry your heart out itll clean your face
when youre in doubt go at your own pace
cry your heart out itll clean your face
when youre in doubt go at your own pace

verse 2
when i wake up im afraid of the idea of facin the day
i would rather stay home on my own drink it all away
please stop callin me its exhausting theres really nothin left to say
i created this storm its only fair i have to sit in its rain

when will i begin to feel like me again
im hanging by a thread
my skins paperthin i cant stop wavering

chorus
cry your heart out itll clean your face
when youre in doubt go at your own pace
cry your heart out itll clean your face
when youre in doubt go at your own pace

bridge
ooh oohoohooh
ooh oohoohooh
all love is devout no feeling is a waste
but give it to yourself now before its too late
in the end its just you stop drowning in wait
your love is useless without it

chorus
cry your heart out cry yeah itll clean your face
when youre in doubt go at your own pace4embed"
