if i come around you can i be myself
wind up in the mirror just to see yourself
if i was in your shoes i would hate myself
left all this behind to be with someone else oh
why should i fake it anymore
if i firm the ting and work that can you take it anymore
this time i have left cannot be wasted anymore
you realize it now and you miss it

chorus
texts go green it hits a little different dont it
know you miss the days when i was grippin on it
know youre in a house tonight just thinkin on it
i moved on so long ago

verse 2
i moved on so long ago
youre still thinking bout me though oh
im still tryna make sensе of it all
youre still saying things to keep me involved
posеd to let me know how you feel now what to do
it shouldnt take a text from me to speak your truth rough

interlude
youre dealing with me rough
i know you like it rough
but this might be too much
youre dealing with me rough
i know you like it rough
but this might be too much
but this might be too much for me

dodging girls on the scene and girls from my dreams
well dont wanna make something from nothing thats where i be
well keep getting nothing from something hows that fair to me
im thinking something for something thats what i need
im too behind in a race to rush for my lead
im not rushing you trust me im
im the last person that needs to rush anything wait
i feel like everything these days leads to nothing wait
i feel like everything these days leads to nothing
its clear that we all get lonely then you call me
all i needed from you was to hold me down when things arent working
for some reason i believed in you

chorus
texts go green it hits a little different dont it
know you missed the days when i was grippin on it
know youre in a house tonight just thinkin on it
i moved on so long ago

verse 4
so long ago
i cant even remember when we lost each other
was it last year this year or some other
been so long since you said things that cover up the lies
we can do it this time
just have some faith we can do it this time
your favorite thing to say we can do it this time
just have some faith we can do it this time
outro
been dealing with me rough
youre dealing with me rough
youre dealing with me rough
youre dealing with me rough
youre dealing with me rough
youre dealing with me rough
youre dealing with me rough
youre dealing with me rough
youre dealing with me
