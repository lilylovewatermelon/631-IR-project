its good to be here
long time no see my dear
i took the run out to the road to find a way
but the loneliness brought me to tears
whoaohoh

verse
i believe i was wrong but baby
now i know your love is not a thing
you throw out in the cold and walk away
im so sorry please say you forgive
whoaohohohooh

hook
whoaohohohohoh
whoaohohohohohoh
whoaohohohohooh

refrain
close your eyes baby and lend me your finger
together we walk out as one
no lonely night broken promise
or fight will return any more
i remember a time i believe i was fine
but inside my heart broke down in two
something inside starts to burn like a fire
and i knew it was you
you might also likechorus
were broken and damned
but together well find a way
and no longer shall hell await
we will seek all the light in the day
cause forever our love will breathe
