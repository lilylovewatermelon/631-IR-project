who am i am i not unique
maybe im not here at all
look the fakers blinding us with lies
the breakers of us all
oh its useless
what could it mean that were here
can we make a difference
if we dont break out of here

chorus 1
wake up get up get out there
raise your voice against liars
feed your anger like fire
why does nobody want change
just imagine youre out there
swatting lies in the making
cant move fast without breaking
if you hold on life wont change

verse 2
the fakers are all sick at heart
their faces hiding their fear
they look down on all the rest of us
like theyre some special breed
whos the high lord
who thinks hes better than us
aint it a crime that
is there a mission for us
who is that high lord
whod kill a million of us
and as the bell tolls
is there no remission for us

wake up get up get out there
theres more to life than their way
if you live you cannot stay
why does nobody want change
let your voices ring out yeah
take the mask off and be free
find yourself in the debris
if you hold on life wont change

chorus 1
wake up get up get out there
raise your voice against liars
feed your anger like fire
why does nobody want change
just imagine youre out there
swatting lies in the making
cant move fast without breaking
if you hold on life wont change4embed"
