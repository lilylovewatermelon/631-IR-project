hey i dont sleep so well at night
waiting up and shivering
heaters gone and moneys tight
in this little home that im living in

youve gotta live your life
while your blood is boiling
those doors wont open
while you stand and watch them

you be the worker ill be the soldier

staring as the stars parade

youve gotta live your life
while your blood is boiling
those doors wont open
while you stand and watch them
