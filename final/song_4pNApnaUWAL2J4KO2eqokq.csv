you said it in a simple way
4 am the second day
how strange that i dont know you at all
stumbled through the long goodbye
one last kiss then catch your flight
right when i was just about to fall

prechorus
i told myself dont get attached
but in my mind i play it back
spinning faster than the plane that took you

chorus
and this is when the feelin sinks in
i dont wanna miss you like this
come back be here
come back be here
i guess youre in new york today
i dont wanna need you this way
come back be here
come back be here

verse 2
the delicate beginnin rush
the feelin you can know so much
without knowing anything at all
and now that i can put this down
if i had known what i know now
i never wouldve played so nonchalant
see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as 172you might also likeprechorus
taxi cabs and busy streets
that never bring you back to me
i cant help but wish you took me with you

chorus
and this is when the feelin sinks in
i dont wanna miss you like this
come back be here
come back be here
i guess youre in london today
and i dont wanna need you this way
come back be here
come back be here

postchorus
oh oh
oh oh
oh oh

bridge
this is falling in love in the cruelest way
this is fallin for you when you are worlds away
in new york be here
but youre in london and i break down
cause its not fair that youre not around
chorus
this is when the feelin sinks in
i dont wanna miss you like this
come back be here
come back be here
i guess youre in new york today
and i dont wanna need you this way
come back be here
come back be here

oh oh
i dont wanna miss you like this
