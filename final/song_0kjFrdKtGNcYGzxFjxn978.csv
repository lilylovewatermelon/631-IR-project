dreamed last night about a time and place
where from our troubles we had escaped
i held your hand then i felt complete
as you turned and said to me

chorus
from now on from now on well be
you and me we will be
from now on from now on well be
you and me you and me we will be

verse 2
years went by and nothing changed
the love we shared just stayed the same
as hair grew grey on top of our heads
every night id quietly say

chorus
from now on from now on well be
you and me we will be
from now on from now on well be
you and me you and me we will be

only a dream
only a dream

from now on only a dream
from now on only a dream
from now on only a dream
from now on you and me we will be3embed"
