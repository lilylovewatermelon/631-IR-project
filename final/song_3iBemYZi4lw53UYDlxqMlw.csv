early one morning
with time to kill
i borrowed jebbs rifle
and sat on the hill
i saw a lone rider
crossing the plain
i drew a bead on him
to practice my aim
my brothers rifle
went off in my hand
a shot rang out
across the land
the horse he kept running
the rider was dead

chorus johnny cash
i hung my head
i hung my head

verse 2 johnny cash
i set off running
to wake from the dream
my brothers rifle
went into the sheen
i kept on running
into the south lands
thats where they found me
my head in my hands
the sheriff he asked me
why had i run
and then it came to me
just what i had done
and all for no reason
just one piece of lead

verse 3 johnny cash
here in the courthouse
the whole town was there
i see the judge
high up in his chair
explain to the courtroom
what went through your mind
and well ask the jury
what verdict they find
i felt the power
of death over life
i orphaned his children
i widowed his wife
i begged their forgiveness
i wish i was dead

chorus johnny cash
i hung my head
i hung my head
i hung my head

verse 4 johnny cash
early one morning
with time to kill
i see the gallows
up on the hill
and out in the distance
a trick of the brain
i see a lone rider
crossing the plain
and hed come to fetch me
to see what theyd done
and well ride together
to kingdom come
i pray for gods mercy
for soon ill be dead

chorus johnny cash
i hung my head
i hung my head
i hung my head
