just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
any old way you choose it
its got a back beat you cant lose it
any old time you use it
its got to be rock and roll music
if you want to dance with me
if you want to dance with me

verse 1
i have no kicks against modern jazz
unless they try to play it too darned fast
and change the beauty of the melody
until it sounds just like a symphony

chorus
thats why i go for that rock and roll music
any old way you choose it
its got a back beat you cant lose it
any old time you use it
its got to be rock and roll music
if you want to dance with me
if you want to dance with me

verse 2
i took my loved one over cross the tracks
so she could hear my man awailing sax
i must admit they have a rocking band
man they was blowing like a hurricane

thats why i go for that rock and roll music
any old way you choose it
its got a back beat you cant lose it
any old time you use it
its got to be rock and roll music
if you want to dance with me
if you want to dance with me

verse 3
way down south they gave a jubilee
i tell you folks they had a jamboree
and drinking beer from a wooden cup
the folks dancing got all shook up

chorus
they started playing that rock and roll music
any old way you choose it
its got a back beat you cant lose it
any old way you use it
its got to be rock and roll music
if you want to dance with me
if you want to dance with me

outro
say if you want to dance with me
if you want to dance with me
if you want to dance with me
its got to be some of that
if you wanna dance with meembed"
