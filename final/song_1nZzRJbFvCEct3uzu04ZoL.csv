days like this i want to drive away
pack my bags and watch your shadow fade

prechorus
you chewed me up and spit me out
like i was poison in your mouth
you took my light you drained me down
but that was then and this is now
now look at me

chorus
this is the part of me
that youre never gonna ever take away from me no
this is the part of me
that youre never gonna ever take away from me no
throw your sticks and your stones
throw your bombs and your blows
but youre not gonna break my soul
this is the part of me
that youre never gonna ever take away from me no

verse 2
i just wanna throw my phone away
find out who is really there for me
