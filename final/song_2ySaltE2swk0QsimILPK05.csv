um… possible uh ending song
that is not finished yet
test take one

verse 1
so long goodbye
ill see you when i see you
you can pick the street
ill meet you on the other side
so long goodbye
do i really have to finish
do returns always diminish
did i say that right
does anybody want to joke
when no ones laughing in the background

chorus
so this is how it ends
i promise to never go outside again

verse 2
so long bye
im slowly losing power
has it only been an hour
no that cant be right
so long goodbye
hey heres a fun idea
how about i sit on the couch
and i watch you next time
i wanna hear you tell a joke
when no onеs laughing in the background

so this is how it ends
i promise to nеver go outside again
bridge
am i going crazy
would i even know
am i right back where i started fourteen years ago
wanna guess the ending
if it ever does
i swear to god that all ive ever wanted was
a little bit of everything all of the time
a bit of everything all of the time
apathys a tragedy and boredom is a crime
im finished playin and im stayin inside

verse 3
if i wake up in a house thats full of smoke
ill panic so call me up and tell me a joke
when im fully irrelevant and totally broken damn it
call me up and tell me a joke
oh shit
youre really joking at a time like this

outro
well well look whos inside again
went out to look for a reason to hide again
well well buddy you found it
now come out with your hands up
weve got you surrounded36embed"
