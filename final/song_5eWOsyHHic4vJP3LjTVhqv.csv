well i was sitting waiting wishing
you believed in superstitions
then maybe youd see the signs
but lord knows that this world is cruel
and i aint the lord no im just a fool
learning loving somebody dont make them love you

chorus 1
must i always be waiting waiting on you
must i always be playing playing your fool

verse 2
i sang your songs i danced your dance
i gave your friends all a chance
but putting up with them wasnt worth never having you
ah maybe youve been through this before
but its my first time so please ignore
the next few lines cause theyre directed at you

chorus 2
i cant always be waiting waiting on you
i cant always be playing playing your fool

bridge 1
i keep playing your part
but its not my scene
want this plot to twist
ive had enough mystery
keep building it up
but then youre shooting me down
but im already down

just wait a minute
just sitting waiting
just wait a minute
just sitting waiting

verse 3
well if i was in your position
id put down all my ammunition
id wonder whyd it taken me so long
but lord knows that im not you
and if i was i wouldnt be so cruel
cause waiting on love aint so easy to do

chorus 1
must i always be waiting waiting on you
must i always be playing playing your fool

chorus 2
no i cant always be waiting waiting on you
i cant always be playing playing your fool
