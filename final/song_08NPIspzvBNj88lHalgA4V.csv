hey white liar
the truth comes out a little at a time
and it spreads just like a fire
slips off of your tongue like turpentine
and i dont know why white liar

verse 1
you better be careful what you do
i wouldnt wanna be in your shoes
if they ever found you out
you better be careful what you say
it never really added up any way
i got friends in this town

chorus
hey white liar
the truth comes out a little at a time
and it spreads just like a fire
slips off of your tongue like turpentine
and i dont know why white liar

verse 2
you said you went out to a bar
and walked some lady to her car
but your face has more to tell
cause my cousin saw you on the street
with a red head named bernice
turns out you dont lie too well
