bite your face to spite your nose
seventeen and a half years old
worrying about my brother finding out
wheres the fun in doing what youre told

prechorus
i said no
oh give it a rest i could persuade you
im not your typical stoned eighteenyearold
give me a night ill make you
i know youre looking for salvation in the secular age
but girl im not your saviour
wrestle to the ground
god help me now

chorus
cause theyre just girls breaking hearts
and eyes bright uptight just girls
but she cant be what you need if shes seventeen
theyre just girls
theyre just girls

verse 2
a pair of frozen hands to hold
oh shes so southern so she feels the cold
one moment i was tearing off your blouse
now youre living in my house
what happened to just messing around
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likeprechorus
i said yo i think i better go
i cant take you
you just sit and get stoned with thirtyyearolds
and you think youve made it
well shouldnt you be fucking with somebody your age
instead of making changes
wrestle to the ground
god help me now

chorus
cause theyre just girls breaking hearts
and eyes bright uptight just girls
but she cant be what you need if shes seventeen
theyre just girls
theyre just girls

bridge
i told her from the start
destined to be hard
i told her from the start
ill break your heart
destined to be hard
break your heart

prechorus
i said yo i think i better go
i cant take you
i know youre looking for salvation in the secular age
but girl im not your saviour
well shouldnt you be fucking with somebody your age
instead of making changes
wrestle to the ground
god help me now
chorus
cause theyre just girls breaking hearts girls
and eyes bright uptight just girls
but she cant be what you need if shes seventeen
theyre just girls
theyre just girls
cause theyre just girls breaking hearts
and eyes bright uptight just girls

cause theyre just girls girls
