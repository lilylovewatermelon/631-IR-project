tides thrash inside baby im high octane
fever in a shock wave
my core vibrates in an opium haze
yet you think we’re the same

chorus
the skyline falls as i try to make sense of it all
i thought id uncovered your secrets but turns out theres more
you adored me before
oh my good looking boy

verse 2
play casino holes of my eyeballs
roll the dice on my thighs
you stopped for breath and i sped up
just to impress you

chorus
the skyline falls as i try to make sense of it all
i thought i’d uncovered your secrets but turns out theres more
you adored me before
oh my good looking boy

refrain
my good looking boy
my good looking boy
my good looking boy
oh my good looking boy

youre not who you are to anyone to anyone
youre not who you are to anyone to anyone these days
im not who i am to anyone no not me at all
im not who i am to anyone these days not at all

chorus
the skyline falls as i try to make sense of it all
i thought i uncovered your secrets but turns out theres more
you adored me before
oh my good looking boyembed"
