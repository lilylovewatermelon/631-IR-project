down a dangerous road i have come to where im standing
with a heavy heart and my hat clutched in my hand
such a foolish man god aint known no greater sinner
i have come in search of jesus hoping he will understand

if i give my soul will he clean these clothes im wearin
if i give my soul will he put new boots on my feet
if i bow my head and beg god for his forgiveness
will he breathe new life within me and bring her back to me

i had a woman once she was kind and she was gentle
had a child by me who grew up to be a man
i had a steady job til i started into drinking
then i started making music travelin with the devils band

oh the years went by like a mighty rush of eagles
our dreams and plans were all scattered in the wind
and its a lonesome life when you lose the ones you live for
if i make my peace with jesus will they take me back again

if i give my soul will he stop my hands from shaking
if i give my soul will my son love me again
if i give my soul and she knows i really mean it
if i give my soul to jesus will she take me back again

if i give my soul will he put new boots on my feet
if i bow my head and beg god for his forgiveness
will he breathe new breath within me and bring her back to meembed"
