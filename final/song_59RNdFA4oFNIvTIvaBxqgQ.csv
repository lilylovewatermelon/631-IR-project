she said hello she was letting me know
we share friends in soho
shes a pain in the nose
im a pain in womens clothes
and youre a walking overdose in a greatcoat
and so she wrote a plan for it on the back of a fag packet
she had to leave because she couldnt hack it
not enough noise and too much racket
i think ive spent all my money and your friends oh

chorus
oh how id love to go to paris again
oh how id love to go to paris again

verse 2
mr serotonin man lend me a gram
you call yourself a friend
i got two left feet and im starting to cheat
on my girlfriend again
i caught her picking her nose
as the crowd cheered for an overdose
and i dont suppose you know where this train goes
there was a party that she had to miss
because her friend kept cutting her wrists
hyperpoliticized sexual trysts
oh i think my boyfriends a nihilist
i said hey kids were all just the same
what a shame
see the 1975 liveget tickets as low as 9you might also likechorus
and oh how id love to go to paris again
and how id love to go to paris again

verse 3
oh stop being an arsehole and counting my eye rolls
theyre like piss holes in the snow uh oh
keeping a tab on my health
man youre putting me up on a shelf
well ill believe youre clean
but only by seeing your face for myself
and then she pointed at the bag of her dreams
in a well posh magazine
i said im done babe im out of the scene
but i was picking up on bethnal green
she said ive been romanticizing heroin

chorus
and oh how id love to go to paris to paris again
and how id love to go to paris again
and how id love to go to paris again
and how id love to go to paris again15embed"
