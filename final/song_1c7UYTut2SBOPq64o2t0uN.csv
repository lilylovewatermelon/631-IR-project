i am driving up 85 in the
kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but
i am tempted to keep the car in drive
and leave it all behind

prechorus
because i wonder sometimes
about the outcome
of a still verdictless life

chorus
am i living it right
am i living it right
am i living it right
why georgia why

verse 2
i rent a room and i fill the spaces with
wood in places to make it feel like home
but all i feels alone
it might be a quarter life crisis
or just the stirring in my soul
see john mayer liveget tickets as low as 99you might also likeprechorus
either wayi wonder sometimes
about the outcome
of a still verdictless life

chorus
am i living it right
am i living it right
am i living it right
why georgia why

bridge
so what so ive got a smile on
but its hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
dont believe me
dont believe me
when i say ive got it down

verse 3
everybody is just a stranger but
thats the danger in going my own way
i guess its the price i have to pay

prechorus 2
still everything happens for a reason
is no reason not to ask myself
chorus
am i living it right
am i living it right
am i living it right
why tell me why
why why georgia why12embed"
