ive been on the cover of the rolling stone
i met the president when i was half stoned
ive been so high ive gotten confused
ive been beat down broke and used motherfucker
i drank with hank talked blues with billy
rocked with run sang with shotgun willy
went from small time philly to big time bobby
from three day old chili to sak√© with wasabi
im home
hey im home

chorus
you never met a motherfucker quite like me
not like me
not like me
hey like me

verse 2
no more being poor drink specials at winners
or being ignored by the think straight sinners
i used to smoke pinners while my moms made dinner
now i smoke bombs and rock with lynyrd skynyrd
no beginners here im a seasoned vet
educated on jazz by my man ahmet
ertegun my friend ive been to the world and back
but im a michigan boy can you feel that
and im home
see kid rock liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likechorus
you never met a motherfucker quite like me
not like me
not like me
hey like me

verse 3
never thought id go as far in life as this
never made par and i could give two shits
never wanted to sell cars because my dad was a dick
never wanted a guitar until i heard a lick like this
and from the depths of dixie to my northern spots
you know its time to rock when old glory drops

verse 4
i pimp through town with the top let back
black hat fine blond
cold pabst in my lap ill adapt
to any and all situations
thats why they call me the pimp of the nation
hey bitch
you best believe
i live in the woods not your world of greed
might a little weed might a little ye
im so proud to be living in the usa
