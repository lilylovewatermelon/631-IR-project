verse 1
im in a 2006 brand new wagon
lookin for a diva to handle the dragon
and even if its two ima move in and bag em
make sure im strapped keep the uz and the magnum
yeah the gun too but im talkin bout the condom
they followin me home with my dog right behind em
have you ever seen a ass clap on a stallion
of a bad bitch half black and italian
i dont know if she likes me or my medallion
think i give a fuck
im just tryna get a nut
i dont need no one to build my selfesteem up

a favor and walk you outside right

verse 2
nah i aint never ate pussy before
but im close to the edge and she pushin me lord
the body language don got a nigga stiff as a sword
so she cant be an angel this bitch is a fraud
head probably sent a nigga on a trip to the morgue
pussy good enough to drive out to michigan for it
as soon as i hit the door shes squeezin my arm
hoppin all on a nigga like christina milion
it might take a couple rounds to make me get her calm
but when she does go to sleep she gon need a alarm cause im gone
she wanna be with a don but im stuck in so ima keep it bout me on this song aint nuttin wrong
with a little bumpin and grindin
especially if if they got somethin behind em
im high as hell pissy drunk when i climb in high in every function that im in

verse 3
shorty looks like shes datin a fashion designer
damn she musta got that from her momma
you know me somewhere in the back with the llama
case one of these cats want the drama ima
get a little close to her ma looks so sweet
she remind me a lot of    monique
but a bird nigga try to holla they wont speak
you be writin a phone number down they wont keep
let me get her i havent burned the haze all week
givin me wop to the music that plays on beat yea
im so street im so cheap im so fly but you already know that i
done been all around the world they dont know that guy
but lil man gon talk too i close that eye
he just mad he aint got the kinda clothes i buy
or ride in the  i drive
chorus
