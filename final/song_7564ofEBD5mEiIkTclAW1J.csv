i know you been needing somebody
mustard on the beat ho
look i know you been needing somebody
nobody really got me like i got me
just tell me what you really want from me
its no problem ima go see if i got it
just tell me what you really want from me

chorus a boogie wit da hoodie
look i know you been needing somebody
nobody really got me like i got me
just tell me what you really want from me
its no problem ima go see if i got it
if i got it then you got it its no problem
hoes plotting thinking that we dont know bout em
i wonder what the fuck they want from me
i know that you been needing somebody

verse 1 a boogie wit da hoodie
i know your head sloppy
you really do it like you care about me
avianne got me feeling like im playing hockey
rap money got me pulling up in big bodies
big bodies little niggas dont know shit about me
call me artie i love to party shooters beside me
left the rari inside the parking lot oh im sorry
ended up with a spanish mami calling me papi
acting cocky when she really dont know shit about me
though they wonder why i always got my clique by me
dont touch me youll be lucky if you sit by me
they dont get it til they really see their bitch by me
got a trophy on my arm i keep my wrist icy
if you want it nigga then you gotta get by me
always wanted a patek now i can get like three
if you think its too late then it just might be

look i know you been needing somebody
nobody really got me like i got me
just tell me what you really want from me
its no problem ima go see if i got it
if i got it then you got it its no problem
hoes plotting thinking that we dont know bout em
i wonder what the fuck they want from me
i know that you been needing somebody

verse 2 don q
we can get it popping for the night though
you know my style red bottoms only the spikes though
yeah its always a light show whenever the ice glow
couple more shots aint no tellin where we might go
take it to marriot or we can take it to the trap
spittin on my mic shoulda put her on the track
fuck around and have you butt naked on my snap
with your legs on the air got you shakin on your back like
wait i think she catchin a seizure
all my old hoes tell me im catchin amnesia
a different kind of beast im not a regular creature
drop twoseater bimmer cranberry its features

nobody really got me like i got me
just tell me what you really want from me
its no problem ima go see if i got it
if i got it then you got it its no problem
