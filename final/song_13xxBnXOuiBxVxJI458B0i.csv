story of my life searching for the right
but it keeps avoiding me
sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
really loves my company
hes more than a man and this is more than love
the reason that the sky is blue
the clouds are rolling in because im gone again
and to him i just cant be true

prechorus
and i know that he knows im unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that i am happy with some other guy
i can see him dying

chorus
i dont wanna do this anymore
i dont wanna be the reason why
every time i walk out the door
i see him die a little more inside
i dont wanna hurt him anymore
i dont wanna take away his life
i dont wanna be a murderer

verse 2
i feel it in the air as im doin my hair
preparing for another date
a kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
asks if im gonna be out late
i say i wont be long just hanging with the girls
a lie i didnt have to tell
because we both know where im about to go
and we know it very well

cause i know that he knows im unfaithful
and it kills him inside
