clever got me this far
then tricky got me in
eye on what im after
i dont need another friend
smile and drop the clich√©
til you think im listening
take just what i came for
then im out the door again

verse 2
peripheral on the package
dont care to settle in
time to feed the monster
i dont need another friend
comfort is a mystery
crawling out of my own skin
just give me what i came for
then im out the door again

chorus
lie to get what i came for
lie to get just what i need
lie to get what i crave
lie and smile to get whats mine
