and i can’t meet you tonight
i can’t meet you tonight
i found the difference between
what i wanted it to be
and what it will always be
the things i used to feel i don’t feel anymore
the things i used to say i don’t say anymore
i drop my hands down slowly
because what i was searching for
cannot be found

verse 2
we were searching for heaven
we were searching for heaven
we were searching for heaven
will we dream again
will we dream againyou might also likeembed"
