ayo congratulations pebbles you did it
you done jumped in your uncle smack lap
you asked whats in his knapsack
he pulled out a box wit a ribbon big enough to fit you in it
but you got hope
cause conversation of the goatyou winnin most likely gets you in it
its just wack
the only nigga that had your back you put a knife in his to get it
you snaked brizz  dont say you didnt
if thats your man why you aint convince him it should be him spittin
you done blindsided your own pupil out his vision
but i eye aint trippin
i bet this the last your stupid ass gon be jumpin in his business
no cap so you dont get none of this shit twisted
this battle it aint about who the fuck is the pen wizard
this is for hardheaded slick niggas
and since you wanted brizz whippin think summer impact again wit it
these punches gon hit different
nigga you a snake
when you talk and i listen i dont hear words i hear hissin
sssthe way you and url set up brizz that shit sad
guess you think your turn next necks
this fastll give me whiplash
you cant be from the trenches cause if you was you would know this shit math
once raw turned into rock it gotta get bagged
this yall king of pop beat it
the whole world saw your bitch ass
all that moonwalkin on stage shit  you did bad
how you gon tell me i eye change but got the nerve to have on contacts
but you didnt have the nerve to put on when it was contact
if you was anywhere next to raw you was supposed to lock up when the fire was on max
but you cut wack
we saw rock in hot waterhe aint come back
another cut another cut another cut
where the fuck was all that
you fitted for this new era nigga you all cap
all that cave gang shit that was all act
when it was live and direct it was quiet for the set
we saw all that violence in your raps they props
and the real movie started soon as the actin stopped
then you got caught lyin in blogs and all that
and yall fans who overlooked that yall fuckin up the format
cause battle rap aint supposed to have the kinda fans that ignore that
i dont give a fuck how good you battle
if you cant be a man i cant be a fan
all forms of respect you shoulda lost that
talkin bout i aint see mook when niggas was fightin
and yall applaud that
where the fuck yall grew up at
dickhead how the fuck you tryin the nigga that tell the nigga who set it off that
but you know what you right
you aint see me in a fight  thats a for sure fact
cause we on stage where the brawl at
you was by the exit playin the floor mat
guess you aint wanna endoor endure that
then the fans ask well mook aint you in breach cause they say its nocontact in the contract
well hows that
when all i did what im advised at
i just crossed t and dotted a eye i black
im a man of little words roc read to find redefine that
john hancock signature right thatll clarify where the line at
then you tried to sell i ran after i swung
who buyin that
first off how he was gon know if i ran iran if he got his eye racked iraq
and please dont even think im glorifyin that
cause im not
listen roc you aint in tune wit the block
nobody know a dude that you shot
the only tecs text you shoot they blue wit the dots
you just a kid that was cool so you rocked
so whether you knew it or not ill lose props for havin you as a opp
porkchop
call docs they examine your body autops
saw him after he walked right past us  thought not
aint seen a sucka haul hall off that fast since cough drops
cough
the fuck yall mean gun bar king
no you the fuck not
i dont wanna hear no heavy metal you blastin
you a punk rock
we saw you in action you wasnt active
all them punches you got and you aint let one drop
you a faggot
you wouldnt square up for a jump shot
yall jack a nigga who took a plea when the plan was to go to trial wit ya code
bellhop roc aint help brizz to pop
i thought rock was supposed to be solid
how you couldnt even send the block cinderblock
niggas that stand next to doors will get you knocked
shit you not you told brizz break a leg so he could cripple his stock before he get too hot
niggas like roc theyll gas you to be loyal
to keep you close til they destroy you
yall dont know how deep the wicket wicked is thatll loom in them aluminum when they not for you
im at hot water boil
or get metal rounds break the coil
ida saw you at the door ajar and ida broke rock down to the oil
brizz and his niggas shouldve caught you and beat the brakes off you
cause you a coward
and if you from the street you already know the time im on if thats somethin ill call you
coward
the reason why your raps tonight aint gon stack against this
cause they packed wit a lotta hypothetically clappin niggas and mad opinions
my shit is shit people actually witnessed
thats the difference
you powertrippin
my fans get the entire picture
but your fans they need proof
thats why im glad everybody got to witness the tommy turn ghost
heh you james st patrick roc you bout to die on your own truth
nigga you heard it first
this the goat givin out that curry work
you bout to get 30d probly jersey wit the wave and the rafters
be worried surf
you a bati boy and i know what ya makin jamaican for you to whip a verse
you gettin burnt
how you dont care bein caribbean the one always gettin your chicken jerked
the butt of the gun pon roc top watch his bomboclaat
the chop feed this pussy the whole fuckin stock
lift him out his fuckin socks
100 shots make him helicop
lift a faggot off the floor
that blade musta spun a lot
and them bars hit if you love the shot
look doublebarrel
a pairll leave you in peril
battlewise a pair of liesll paralyze legal impair you
that a pair of legal thats for paralegals to handle
keep it street i dare you
pair of eagles underneath my pparel
before you even get to blink ill air you
nigga you a bitch
you gon forever be a bitch
and you aint never gon forget
this the statue of liberty roc forever gon be lit
fuck them candy bars nigga i aint never gon be tricked
i dont give a fuck if its halloween
a clown never gon be it
nigga eazy
round 1 tay roc
you laid the foundation downbut we built where the fuck we at
dont give a fuck what you did in the past you just comin back
imagine somebody showin you where you used to do construction at
like you see this hundredstory skyscraper i put cement under that
clowni know you aint been around
its been awhile
it is marble on every floor and elevators in this building now
if url was really a house or somethin
the nigga screamin thats light is the reason the power runnin
you know how im comin
ill put you out your misery nigga
record deals you used to have shit a memory nigga
youve dropped nothin hot in history nigga
id rather be a godtier battle rapper than a bottomtier industry ni
what you supposed to be some type of lyrical miracle
my nigga you say stupid shit thats hysterical
you told lux you are more hypocritical than a dyin hippopotamus
terrible
that shit was so unable to bear unbearable
i swear if you act up imma make it all spooky
one thing you better control is the way you talk to me
i wont play wit yall goofies
i am not a pg
im somethin i dont think murda seen murder scene im a ratedr movie
when i was dot mob i played my position
i never played you
when everybody turned they back on yall i stayed true
i coulda left when kshine left joined dna too
i left wit the crew i came in with my cave crew
me not helpin brizzhad me stressin
i was dead wrong for not helpin brizz no exceptions
i learned my lesson
you talkin bout me holdin doors
question
that door i was holdin in the fight was backstage
why aint you come in that direction
pussy
you speak on me not fightin kinda awkward
you swung and poofdisappeared
you the reason the drama started
you aint stick around for action
why you put on this front
you left detroit niggas fightin backstage andwent out the front
you are not live you big bitch
you swung missed we got rushed by detroit niggas
nobody in dot mob did shit
bitch you real bitter
fuck how you feel nigga
who are you to tell anybody that they aint a real nigga
dont worry bout me dont ask me my business
where were you when rex got his ass beat on lenox
somebody posted a pic of his eyeyo
shit look like he got hit by a tahoe
his face swole nose bust and his eye closed
it coulda been my fault he probly was high
i wanna see if you can get this riddle
my expert opinion you shouldnt be having shits and giggles wit a nigga that pistolwhipped you
shit is simple
nigga split your temple somethin dent your mental
nigga left murda beat he killed a instrumental
you shittin me
ask this dumb nigga whats wrong wit him
that nigga split your head open to the white meat and then you did a song wit him
aye that sound like good bargainin
yall want a feature from mook dont pay him
just pistolwhip him and crack his skull again
you comprehend
nigga you aint safe unless you walkin in wit a bodyguard
even he gon need somebody guardin him
boy you are softer than the softener your shit is washin in
ill have it to where you passed your pastor passin round offerings
no arguin
ill be like lets go live on the gram
dap you then slap you i got bipolar hands
we cant compare resumes mines over fams
im the gun bar king i never met a phase metaphase where my toast is mitosis jammed
play wit me crazy
tayll get angry
rest in peace party arty i will have murda face a p80
your roofll get shot ill bang a 380
snoop on your block murder murda and murder was the case that they gave me
you really should stop or really get shot

i had to kill rex one round
in philly he dropped
now im givin the general mills its a cereal box
i might flip

187 method man wit the ice pick type shit
bitch clamp ya head in a vise grip
leave him there for 1400 hours  i know it sound type slick
but on military time its type sick
forensics found murda murder at 1600
who seen that wesley snipes flick
i know the basics
rock is still active like open cases

ill leave you in the desert i will find a hole in vegas
and thats how to get away with murda murder viola davis
you not the truth
pussy you aint a nigga that i salute
if its beef i dont apologizei cop a deuce
ill let goblins loose they dont wanna hear no kinda truce
rock his roof his this cat in the hat dr
i got the juice
you thought you was educated
boy youd put a hit out on roc and be devastated
come to find out the hitter you sent to me never made it
he hesitated when they found murdas man slaughtered it was premeditated
you talk stupid imma split this nigga mug
if im ever stealin steel in a bar theres a pistol in the club
my bitch creep up wit somethin resemblin a snub
bang that was murda murder she wrote on the window in his blood

he landed headfirst in his brain matter i put murda murder on his mind
boy you straight twat
