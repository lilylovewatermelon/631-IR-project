i got under the grip between this modern hell
i got the rejection letter in the mail and it was already ripped to shreds
seasons in ruin and this bitter pill is chased in blood
theres fire in my veins and its pouring out like a flood

verse 2
this diabolic state is gracing my existence
like a catastrophic baby baby maybe youre the chemical reaction
i am the atom bomb i am your chosen one
toxin your reservoir and then return man to ape
