verse 1 beyoncé
i thought that this was something yes
promising that one day it would turn into something yes
i thought the feelings were mutual and i didnt have to guess
started bein skeptical always unavailable like you didnt know
but now im feelin something yes
its tellin me this may not be the real something yes
but you was showin me now im ready and you runnin
damn you got me open now feeling like im chokin now
where am i to go

prechorus kelly rowland
i cant believe that you cant feel my heart
and i cant believe you let me fall so hard
stop playin how could you let it go this far
if you had doubts that i wasnt the one oh the one
and you said that youre the type to take it slow
and you said before i step ill let you know
stop playin before you let me see you with her
you could have told me a change was gon come yeah

chorus beyoncé  all
is she the reason you dont call like you use to
fall through my hood like you use to
or put it on me hard like you use to do
i feel in my mind whats going on
but my heart wont let me go until i know
is she the reason that my calls couldnt reach you
the deepest of my love couldnt please you
or bring it to me home like you use to do
and seein her fallin for your charms
got me feelin like i wasnt good enough
