verse 1
in the beginning
i never thought it would be you
when we were chillin
smilin in the photo booth
but we got closer yeah
til you were eating off my spoon
youre coming over
and we would talk all afternoon

prechorus
tonight well just get drunk disturb the peace
find your hands all over me
and then you bite your lip whisper and say
we’re going all the way

chorus
tonight take me to the other side
sparks fly like the fourth of july
just take me to the other side
i see that sexy look in your eyes
and i know we aint friends anymore

so tonight kiss me like its do or die
and take me to the other side
