somehow we gotta find a way
no matter how many miles it take
i know it feels so good right now
but it all come fallin down
when the night meet the light
turn to day

bridge
cant stop then you wont stop
i know just how that feel
when youre on top til the ball drop
youve never seen it be so real
it feels so good right now
but it all come fallin down
when the night meet the light
turn to day

verse 1
feel it a little feel it a lot
im swimmin a bit but deeper in thought
keepin my head on top of my shoulders
into some shit im out of the box
this the level im on
needin it all right now when forever is gone
baby the weather is strong
whether its hot or cold
im comin knockin on yo door
well ima ima maintain how im stayin so high
put the ladder all the way up til we touchin the sky
and you know youre dead wrong youre in love with a lie
all i all i all i wanna do is free yo mind
we dont see no lines we dont color inside
its a very small world we dont fuck with the size
yeah see the bigger picture when its beneficial
lovin how i fit you
blow the whistle when you run out of time
yeah wakin up i open up my eyes
do you mind if i blow yo mind
a little closer baby dont be shy
why you worried that its gon be fine
i guess its that kinda day
its really all im tryna say
we dont have a lot of time to waste

verse 2
yeah yeah
all the lights flickerin hittin the right switches
im livin this life different and missin the flight bullshittin
i had a plan to change you cant stand the rain
little delayed but i came and you cool wit it
i dont trip flip or lose my grip
and i dont know it all but i do know this
before you know me better know self
ive been in this shit so long that it dont smell
i turn the hotel to a castle
livin like a king for a grand
i dont do nothin thats a hassle
besides even that castle made of sand
just might slip into the sea
fuck it all if it all aint me
maybe we inside the maze
somehow we gotta find a way okay

we dont need no more no extras
