i am a man cut from the know
rarely do friends come and then go
she was a girl soft but estranged
we were the two our lives rearranged

prechorus 1
feeling so good that day
a feeling of love that day

chorus
twisting and turning your feelings are burning
youre breaking the girl
she meant you no harm
think youre so clever but now you must sever
youre breaking the girl
he loves no one else

verse 2
raised by my dad girl of the day
he was my man that was the way
she was the girl left alone
feeling the need to make me her home

prechorus 2
i dont know what when or why
the twilight of love had arrived

youre breaking the girl
he loves no one else
