i cannot take this anymore
saying everything ive said before
all these words they make no sense
i found bliss in ignorance
less i hear the less you say
youll find that out anyway

prechorus chester bennington
just like before

chorus chester bennington chester bennington  mike shinoda
everything you say to me
takes me one step closer to the edge
and im about to break
i need a little room to breathe
cause im one step closer to the edge
im about to break

verse 2 chester bennington
i find the answers arent so clear
wish i could find a way to disappear
all these thoughts they make no sense
i found bliss in ignorance
nothing seems to go away
over and over again
