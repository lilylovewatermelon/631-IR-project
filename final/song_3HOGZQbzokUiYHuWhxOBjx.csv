verse 1
penny for your thoughts but a dollar for your insides
or a fortune for your disaster
im just a painter
and im drawing a blank

prechorus
we only want to sing you to sleep
in your bedroom speakers whoaoh
we need umbrellas on the inside
get me just right

chorus
they say quitters never win
but we walk the plank on a sinking ship
theres a world outside of my front door
that gets off on being down

postchorus
ohoh ohoh

verse 2

chorus
they say quitters never win
but we walk the plank on a sinking ship

that gets off on being down
