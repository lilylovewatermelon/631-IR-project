well he ran around late at night
holdin hands makin light
of everything that came before
but there she was behind the door

chorus
she hit them with her ten cent pistol
because they ruined her name
well she hit them with her ten cent pistol
and theyve never been the same

verse 2
there is nothing worse in this world
then payback from a a jealous girl
the laws of man they dont apply
when blood gets in a a womans eye

chorus
well she hit them with her ten cent pistol
because they ruined her name
well she hit them with her ten cent pistol
and theyve never been the same
the same oh

stars did fall thunder rolled
bugs crawled back in their holes
the couple screamed but it was far too late
a jealous heart did retaliate

chorus
she hit them with her ten cent pistol
because they ruined her name
well she hit them with her ten cent pistol
and theyve never been the same

outro
oh the same
oh the same
never been the same
