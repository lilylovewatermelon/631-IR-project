verse 1
though you hardly know her
the lights on its way
the hand that rests upon it
still wanna stay

verse 2
no way of recognizing
the cat knows the call
fair child is rising
theres no mystery at all

chorus
its a strange paradise
its a strange paradise youll be waiting
youll be waiting

outro
its a strange paradise
its a strange paradise
its a strange paradise
its a strange paradise
its a strange paradise
its a strange paradise
its a strange paradise
its a strange paradise
its a strange paradise
its a strange paradise
its a strange paradise
its a strange paradise
its a strange paradise

the kind you like
to come back in
wherever you go
no hawk in sight
the scenic drive
the signs just so
the brightened lines
stay by your side
wherever you go
the kind you like
a comeback kid
they told you so
wherever you go
no doubt it
its true the lights up
wherever you go
no doubt it
its true

the kind you like
no end in sight
the rest you know3embed"
