you used a fork once
it turns out forks are fuckin everywhere
there’s no hiding from the thought of us
i got ways to find you anywhere
we sat on the roof once
conversation took us everywhere
and we talked until the sun came up
i wish we stayed just like we were up there

prechorus
i consider you im not trying to
it doesnt matter whether not i want to
i can’t help it its a habit
your corner in my mind is wellestablished

chorus
i i wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
i wonder how many things you wanna do you think im inbetween
i feel myself fallin further down your priorities
and i still make excuses for you constantly
i wonder how many things you think about
before before you get to me

verse 2
remember when you left once
that never made too much sense to me
well it hurt you so bad hurting me
you really came to me for sympathy

your corner in my mind is wellestablished

chorus
i i wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
i wonder how many things you wanna do you think i’m inbetween
and i feel myself falling further down your priorities

i wonder how many things you think about
before before you get to me

chorus
i wonder how many things you think about before you get to me
