only a woman could take away your cold hard chill
break your heart and make you love her still
leave you thirsty when youve had your fill
only a woman can sit you high up on a throne
make you feel so damn alone
leave you begging baby come back home

prechorus
and its only till shes gone
could you see that you were wrong

chorus
cause the seasons change and people come and go
but when love is fate best hold that woman close
take the hard road back and fall down at her door
cause thats your woman
thats all i know

verse 2
only a woman can make you fly so high you wanna touch the sun
when your wings melt and you come undone
catches you when you fall shes the only one
she steals your heart just like a thief
makes you lay roses at her feet
but you know to kiss the rose the thorns will make you bleed
