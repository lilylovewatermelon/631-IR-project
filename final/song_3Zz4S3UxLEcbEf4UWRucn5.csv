verse 1 ruby da cherry
ruby got a lasso tied around his neck
he hangin in the fucking gallows
flippin a cross i could never be hallow
shivering shadows hollow my heart
bitch your fucking water is shallow
uicidal great white swimmin in the deep end
blood drops bout to slaughter tackle
ship on the ocean floor layin at rest
flag set at halfmast im making a nest
skeleton rotting the fish will infest
pelicans dropping to pick up the rest
hell is a tropic resort im the guest
rubies and diamonds inside of my chest
blowing out grey smoke outside of my chest
see uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also likeverse 2 yung carecrow
lickity diggin until me 6 feet
eatin these drugs until i am deceased
shootin up morphine in veins on my feet
eyes always bleed but that gold lookin clean
teeth full of subs i pop that then i shrug
then i dip on these bitches cause i show no love
im clapping my hands and im making them storm
as im watchin the light when the locusts swarm
makin the uicide rate spike makin the children all hate life
infusing the movement with strictly illusions
confusin the dead with the moonlight
constantly purchasing new knives from constantly endin a new life
i take what i want and that aint no front
now allude to me as a parasite
