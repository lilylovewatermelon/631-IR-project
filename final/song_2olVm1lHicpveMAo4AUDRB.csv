the power of love is a curious thing
make a one man weep make another man sing
change a hawk to a little white dove
more than a feeling thats the power of love

verse 2
tougher than diamonds rich like cream
stronger and harder than a bad girls dream
make a bad one good make a wrong one right
power of love that keeps you home at night

chorus
you dont need money dont take fame
dont need no credit card to ride this train
its strong and its sudden and its cruel sometimes
but it might just save your life
thats the power of love
thats the power of love

verse 3
first time you feel it it might make you sad
next time you feel it it might make you mad
but youll be glad baby when youve found
thats the power makes the world goround

but it might just save your life

they say that all in love is fair
yeah but you dont care
but you know what to do
when it gets hold of you
and with a little help from above
you feel the power of love
you feel the power of love
can you feel it

outro
it dont take money and it dont take fame
dont need no credit card to ride this train
tougher than diamonds and stronger than steel
you wont feel nothin till you feel
you feel the power just feel the power of love

you feel the power of love
you feel the power of love
feel the power of love4embed"
