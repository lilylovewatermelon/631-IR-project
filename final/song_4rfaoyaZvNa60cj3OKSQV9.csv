am i the only one i know
waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
shadows will scream that im alonelonelone

verse 1
iiiiive got a migraine
and my pain will range from up down and sideways
thank god its friday cause fridays will always be better than sundays
cause sundays are my suicide days
i dont know why they always seem so dismal
thunderstorms clouds snow and a slight drizzle
whether its the weather or the letters by my bed
sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
let it be said what the headache represents
its me defending in suspense its me suspended in a defenseless test
being tested by a ruthless examiner
thats represented best by my depressing thoughts
i do not have writers block my writer just hates the clock
it will not let me sleep i guess ill sleep when im dead
and sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

chorus
am i the only one i know
waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
shadows will scream that im alone
but i know weve made it this far kid

verse 2
i am not as fine as i seem pardon
me for yelling im telling you green gardens
are not whats growing in my psyche its a different me
a difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees
freeze frame please let me paint a mental picture portrait
something you wont forget its all about my forehead
and how it is a door that holds back contents
that makes pandoras box contents look nonviolent
behind my eyelids are islands of violence
my mind shipwrecked this is the only land my mind could find
i did not know it was such a violent island
bullet tidal waves suicidal crazed lions
theyre trying to eat me blood running down their chin
and i know that i can fight or i can let the lion win
i begin to assemble what weapons i can find
cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind

chorus
am i the only one i know
waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
shadows will scream that im alone
but i know weve made it this far kid

and i will say that we should take a day to break away
from all the pain our brain has made the game is not played alone
and i will say that we should take a moment and hold it
and keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone
and i will say that we should take a day to break away
from all the pain our brain has made the game is not played alone
and i will say that we should take a moment and hold it
and keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone
