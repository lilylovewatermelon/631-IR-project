it was right after senior year
just before the summer disappeared
we went aridin them old farm ruts
hangin out on the gate of his truck
we threw a blanket neath the sunset
bein brave as eighteen gets
we gave each other more than our hearts
with the help of a mason jar

chorus
drinkin watermelon moonshine
cut the burn with a little lime
parkin back in them kudzu vines
i was his and every bit of that boy was minе
too young to know what love was
but we werе learnin on a sweet buzz
theres never nothin like the first time
and mines always gonna taste like
watermelon moonshine

verse 2
i dont remember where we got it from
i just remember feelin all grown up
takin pulls like it aint no thing
never told him it was my first drink
but i told him that he was the one
youre so sure when youre that young
you think you got it all figured out
and now i laugh when i think about

i thought that high would last forever
but that aint what it does
maybe we were drunk in love
or maybe we were just
