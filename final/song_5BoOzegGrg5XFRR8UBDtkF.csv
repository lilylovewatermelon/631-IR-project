i done drank codeine from a broken whiskey glass
i done popped my pills and i smoked my share of grass
slaved for the man and i broke my fuckin back
so you can take your ninetofive and shove it up your ass
and that 101 is like the highway in hell
going too damn fast i spilled drink on my chanel
and i woke up and my rooms fuckin trashed like a damn hotel
and where im goin next man only time will tell

refrain
woahoh
woahoh
woahoh
woahoh

verse 2
i done spent some time chasin women that dont give a shit
i done learned my lessons and i aint never gon forget
started callin this shit started ballin and shit started flickin that wrist
they aint never listened now im makin them hits so im fuckin your bitch ooh
no it aint that difficult for me to forget that you ever exist
bet you remember my name when i pull up in that whip that doesnt exist skrrt
spill lean on supreme last saturday
let that shit splash motherfucker talk saucy
pass me them drugs motherfucker let me try em
at the white house call my homie joe biden he flyin out weed
smokin my dope bathing ape that be the clothes
man dont be silly that shit you rockin is old
like its years since you been to the store
feel like meek milly but i aint from philly
im poppin a wheelie i show off my grilly
i do this for realy and for my family
same shit every night man its all so family
the bitches they killin me
like bitch are you kiddin me
