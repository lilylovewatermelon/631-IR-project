dont be fooled by the pink
she is not playing dolls
she is stalking the halls
for the thrill of the kill
every person in school
is aware of her stare
when she tosses her hair
they go perfectly still
all their eyes say “dont attack me”
watch them sweat and pant and shake
every food chain has its acme
regina george eats steak
shes the queen of beasts
she can smell your fear
in this biosphere
she’s the apex predator

like a lioness
only with less fur
do not mess with her
she’s the apex predator
you might also likecady
at the watering hole
see the girls who werent nice
have to scatter like mice
from a jungle cat

and though janis is great
she does not have this power
people literally cower
janis can’t do that
see us mark our territory
as i follow in her train
i was victim i was quarry
now i shake my mane

shes the queen of beasts
and i’m in her pride
i have hitched a ride
with the apex predator

and its kinda fun
when she bares her claws
when im safe because
im with the apex predator
did i think id be protected by my new exotic pet
not a chance if she suspected
i was any kind of reproductive threat
but she doesnt know yet

janis  cady
no she doesnt know yet
shes the queen of beasts
at this beastly school
gotta keep things cool
with the apex predator

cady
so im kinda friends

janis
but youre kind of prey

cady
jesus what a day

janis  cady
with the apex predator
will she braid your hair
will she eat your heart
how can you outsmart
