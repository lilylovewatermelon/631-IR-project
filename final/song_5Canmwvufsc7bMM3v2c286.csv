what you sees not what you get
with you theres just no measurement
no way to tell whats real from what isnt there
your eyes they sparkle
thats all changed into lies that drop like acid rain
you washed away the best of me
you dont care

chorus
you know you did it im gone
to find someone to live for in this world
theres no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
just a bridge that i gotta burn
you were wrong
if you think you can walk right through my door
that is just so you coming back when ive finally moved on
im already gone
ohoh ohoh ohoh

verse 2
sometimes shattered never open
nothing matters when youre broken
that was me whenever i was with you
always ending always ending always over always over
back and forth up and down like a rollercoaster
i am breaking i am breaking that habit that habit today

bridge
there is nothing you can say
sorry doesnt cut it babe
take the hit and walk away cause im gone

all i needed was the truth now im gone
what you sees not what you get
what you sees not what you get

chorus
you know you did it im gone
to find someone to live for in this world

theres no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
just a bridge that i gotta burn just a bridge that i gotta burn
