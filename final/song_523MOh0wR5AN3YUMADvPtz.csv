under a portrait of doris day
you and i
and a pair of cnotes
soft candy betting hard eight

not quite how you laid it out for me
when we split up that night that night
coming out of the sunset marquis
before you left to deal the fine white

is this how you pictured it
is this how you thought it would be
we got right with the mutual problem
that got right between you and me
i told you the girl would be trouble
i said she was going to break us
leave us lost in the rust and the rubble
