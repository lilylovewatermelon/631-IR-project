every night
think of things i cant do or havent done
and does it make me weak
sometimes i feel like i cant breathe
is that all you see in me

chorus
dont you wait for something more
ill still be sinking to the floor
oh you cant help me
now im all alone
is it my doing is it my doing mmm

verse 2
outside its getting colder
why does it feel like im older than i asked to be
but when you say my name
it all falls away so tenderly

chorus
dont you wait for something more
ill still be sinking to the floor
oh you tried to help me
why do i feel so cold
is it my doing is it my doing
