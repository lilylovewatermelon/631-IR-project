sweetheart
god couldve never made two
nobody quite like you

verse 1
woke up this morning to your sleepy smile
i realized i havent told you in a while
that youre my life youre my dream
youre the reason for every song i sing
youre my rock youre my world
youre my always and forever girl

chorus
sweetheart
god couldve never made two
nobody quite like you
woah sweetheart
one kiss and i come unglued
you are the reason i fall to pieces
cause youre all that i adore
youre the one my heart beats for
and i cant believe you gave your sweet heart to me

verse 2
yeah youre sweet like chocolate hot like sriracha
yeah girl you got me right in your back pocket
youre smooth like whiskey fine like wine
i love how youre making my blood sugar rise

on those sleepless nights
