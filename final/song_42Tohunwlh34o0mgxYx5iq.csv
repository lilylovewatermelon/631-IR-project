just because i didnt remind you dont think i forgot
just because it aint happened yet dont think that its not
nipsey was solid i know that he up there with biggie and pac
my choppa could tell you a story i pray that you dont try to plot
stayed a hundred couple niggas changed
i aint never went against the grain i could never snort cocaine
i could never fuck a bitch behind my brother then try and turn her to my main
clout chasin got him in a wood box cant believe he died for the fame
hell risk it all for a name i was comin hard fore i came
i aint know nothin bout no visa i was in the park with the gang
moms be feelin bad i try to tell her she is not to blame
no social security couldnt get a license but i still didnt complain
i went and got it i aint ask for no handout
lil nigga we are not the same
you know what im on first girlfriend did me wrong
i swear to god that every girl after that i was gon do em wrong
different bitch in my bed every night but i still be feelin alone
matter fact i finna be with one probably right after i finish this song

chorus
thats my dawg thats my dawg
he gon ride he gon ride off the leash off the leash
he gon slide he gon slide she know i cheat she know i cheat
she know i lie she know i lie i be geeked up i be fried 21
sweep the room we pull up with brooms 21 21
smokin girl scout you can smell the fumes smell the fumes
dont approach me bout your wifey if she choose pussy
last scrub did that made the news 21
