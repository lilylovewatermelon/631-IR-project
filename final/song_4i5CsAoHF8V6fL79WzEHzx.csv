your eyes  as we said our goodbyes
cant get them out of my mind
and i find i cant hide from your eyes
the ones that took me by surprise
the night you came into my life
where theres moonlight
i see your eyes

howd i let you slip away
when im longing to hold you
now id die for one more day
cause theres something i should have told you
yes theres something i should have told you

when i looked into your eyes
why does distance make us wise
you were the song all along
and before the song dies
i should tell you i should tell you
i have always loved you
you can see it in my eyesyou might also likeembed"
