you overthink things
you say what if were not meant to be
well you know what so what
make a mistake with me
nobody goes through this life and does
everything perfectly
were all gonna fail so you might as well
make a mistake with me

bridge
sometimes baby when we take
a chance that has this much at stake
we look back and in hindsight
what seemed wrong looks more like right

verse 2
so i say worst case well be left
with lots of good memories
this chance we have well its worth that
so make a mistake with me
im telling you the right thing to do
is make a mistake
make a mistake
make a mistake with me
