verse 1
hey
vexation of spirit is a waste of time
negative thinking dont you waste your thoughts
verbal conflict is a waste of word
physical conflict is a waste of flesh
people will always be who they want
and thats what really makes the world go round
unconditional love is scarce
till shiloh i shall not forsake thee
now and forever more
forever more forever more
yeah

chorus
you see you gave precious life to me
so i live my life for you you
you see youve always been there for me
and so ill be there for you you
till shiloh i shall not forsake thee

verse 2
bless your eyes and may your days be long
may you rise on the morning when his kingdom come
good deeds arent remembered in the hearts of men
bless your eyes and may your dreams come true
may you rise on the morning when jah kingdom come
good deeds arent remembered in the hearts of men
till shiloh i shall not forsake thee
now and forever more
forever more forever more
