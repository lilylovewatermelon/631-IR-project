carry me all through the night
i am the last light fading
leave all the lost souls behind
show me the silence breaking
and when youre lost and out of time
i will be right here waiting
and when your dreams return to life
ill be forever fading
and well fall behind

chorus
so ill wait for you
as i keep your faith alive
and ill pray for you
as we cross the great divide

verse 2
bury the wounds deep inside
rupture the fault line breaking
dream of the world left behind
show us were worth forsaking
and when the cold begins to rise
darkness is overtaking
and when the fear is satisfied
ill be forever changing
as we all arise

so ill wait for you
as i keep your faith alive
and ill pray for you
as we cross the great divide
and ill break for you
as i open up the sky
and ill stay for you
as we cross the great divide

bridge
follow the sunlight down
cry clear and loud
heaven wont help us now
but its better this way
warm light wash me away

chorus 2
so ill wait for you
as i keep your faith alive
and ill pray for you
as we cross the great divide
and ill break for you
as i open up the sky
and ill stay for you
as we cross the great divide7embed"
