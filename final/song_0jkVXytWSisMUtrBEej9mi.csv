i could use another cigarette
but dont worry daddy im not addicted yet
one too many drinks tonight and i miss you
like you were mine
all your stormy words have barely broken
and you sound like thunder though
youve barely spoken
oh it looks like rain tonight and thank god
because a clear sky just wouldnt feel right

chorus
hes taken and leaving
but i keep believing
that hes gonna come round soon
hell come round soon i know

verse 2
you may be my final match
because i chase everything when you play
throw and i play catch
it never took much to keep me satisfied
but all the bullshit you feed me you miss me
you need me
this hungry heart will not subside
you might also likechorus
hes taken and leaving
but i keep believing
that hes gonna come round soon
until i see him again
im staying believing
that it wont be deceiving
when hes gonna come round soon

bridge
well i may seem naive if i cry as you leave
like im just one more tortured heart
these cracks that i show as im watching
you go arent tearing me apart
i may seem naive if i cry as you leave
like im just one more tortured heart
these cracks that i show as im watching
you go arent tearing me apart
the angels said id smile today
well who needs angels anyway

chorus
hes taken and leaving
but i keep believing
that hes gonna come round soon
until i see him again
im staying believing
that it wont be deceiving
when hes gonna come round
hes taken and leaving
hes taken and leaving
but i keep believing
that hes gonna come round soon
until i see him again
im staying believing
that it wont be deceiving
when hes gonna come around soon
outro
hes gonna come round soon
gonna come round soon i know
hes gonna come round soon
i cant believe that its gone
gonna come round soon i know

i could use another cigarette4embed"
