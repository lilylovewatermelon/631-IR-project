she puts her makeup on like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
shes got her little book of conspiracies right in her hand
she is paranoid endangered species headed into extinction
she is one of a kind well shes the last of the american girls

verse 1
she wears her overcoat for the coming of the nuclear winter
she is riding her bike like a fugitive of critical mass
shes on a hunger strike for the ones who wont make it for dinner
she makes enough to survive for a holiday of workin class

chorus
shes a runaway of the establishment incorporated
she wont cooperate well shes the last of the american girls

verse 2
she plays her vinyl records singin songs on the eve of destruction
shes a sucker for all the criminals breakin the laws
she will come in first for the end of western civilization
shes an endless war shes a hero for the lost cause

chorus
like a hurricane in the heart of the devastation
shes a natural disaster shes the last of the american girls
see green day liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeinterlude

chorus
she puts her makeup on like graffiti on the walls of the heartland
shes got her little book of conspiracies right in her hand
she will come in first for the end of western civilization
shes a natural disaster shes the last of the american girls
