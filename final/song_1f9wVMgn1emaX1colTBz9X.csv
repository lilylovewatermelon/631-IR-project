so here we stand
you got caught with love in the hand
blinded by the sun and the steel
nothing but the sound of the feel
the blood sweat and tears

shake off my past
i knew it but i see it at last
and now its like climbing the walls
all i see the smell of the smoke
the tears that they choke

chorus
if you feel i never wanted
what i feel truth is a liar
if you feel i never needed
what i feel this house is on fire

if you feel i never wanted
what i feel truth is a liar
if you feel i never needed
what i feel this house is on fire

verse 2
flashes kick in
honoring the day you stepped in
image of him touching your hand
thought of it as just innocence
but now it makes sense
you might also likeyou were so free
never saw that picture with me
now this flys climbing the walls
all i see are ashes the pain
the love lost in vain

chorus
if you feel i never wanted
what i feel truth is a liar
if you feel i never needed
what i feel this house is on fire

if you feel i never wanted
what i feel truth is a liar
if you feel i never needed
what i feel this house is on fire fire fire fire fire

bridge
bury the echoes turn it back
melt all my wishing for the times we once had
damage my vision set it ablaze
destroy the hour take it
away

chorus
if you feel i never wanted
what i feel truth is a liar
if you feel i never needed
what i feel this house is on fire
if you feel i never wanted
what i feel truth is a liar
if you feel i never needed
what i feel this house is on fire

postchorus
if you feel what i feel
this house is on fire
if you feel what i feel
if you feel what i feel
if you feel what i feelembed"
