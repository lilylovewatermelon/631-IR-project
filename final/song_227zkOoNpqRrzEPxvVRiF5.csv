again youre gone
off on a different path than mine
im left behind
wondering if i should follow
you had to go
and of course its always fine
i probably could catch up with you tomorrow

prechorus
but is this what it feels like
to be growing apart
when did i become the one
whos always chasing your heart

chorus
now i turn around and find
i am lost in the woods
north is south right is left
when youre gone
im the one who sees you home
but now im lost in the woods
and i dont know what path you are on
im lost in the woods

verse 2
up til now
the next step was a question of how
i never thought it was a question of whether
who am i if im not your guy
where am i if were not together
forever

now i know youre my true north
cause i am lost in the woods
up is down day is night
when youre not there
oh youre my only landmark
so im lost in the woods
wondering if you still care

bridge
but ill wait
for a sign for a sign
that im your path
cause you are mine you are mine
until then
im lost in the woods

outro
lost in the woods in the woods in the woods
im lost in the woods
lost in the woods im lost
im lost in the woods1embed"
