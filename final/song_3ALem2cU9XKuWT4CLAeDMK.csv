take a look at your foot does it fit this shoe
did you really ever think i gave a damn about you
you aint no messiah with your fancy friends
so get your head out of the clouds
and get your feet back in the dirt my friend
oh get your head out of the clouds
and get your feet back in the dirt my friend
oh get your head out of the clouds
and get your feet back in the dirt my friend

oh get your head out of the clouds
and get your feet back in the dirt my friend
