you shoulda left the other day
you let me beg for you to stay
this is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions
and so i pray you burn in hell and you never find the ocean

chorus
i hope your fire fire burns baby
i hope your fire fire burns baby
i hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
and when you’re reaching out for me you’ll see you reap everything you sow

verse 2
you piece of shit you broke me down
thought you said you would hold me down
but i could see it in your eyes that youre blinded by them flashing lights
and yous a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by

chorus
i hope your fire fire burns baby
i hope your fire fire burns baby
i hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
and when you’re reaching out for me you’ll see you reap everything you sow
