she asked me where is from
i said somewhere youve never been to
little town outside of knoxville
hiddin by some dogwood trees
she tried talkin with my accent
we held hands and waded into
that blue water
she left her flipflops by my red wings on the beach

chorus
yeah but now im dodging potholes in my sunburnt silverado
like a heartbroke desperado headin right back to my roots
somethin bout the way she kissed mе tells me shed lovе eastern tennessee
yeah but all i brought back with me was some sand in my boots

verse 2
i said lets go shoot tequila
so we walked back to that beach bar
she said dont cowboys drink whiskey huh
so we drank bottom shelf
she said damn that sky looks perfect
i said girl youve never seen stars like the ones back home
and she said maybe i should see em for myself

chorus
yeah but now im dodging potholes in my sunburnt silverado
like a heartbroke desperado headin right back to my roots
somethin bout the way she kissed me tells me shed love eastern tennessee
yeah but all i brought back with me was some sand in my boots
see morgan wallen liveget tickets as low as 22you might also likebridge
i said meet me in the mornin
and she told me i was crazy
yeah but i still thought that maybe shed show up

chorus
aw but now im dodging potholes in my sunburnt silverado
like a heartbroke desperado headin right back to my roots
somethin bout the way she kissed me tells me shed love eastern tennessee
yeah but all i brought back with me was some sand in my boots
yeah but all i brought back with me was some sand in my boots8embed"
