all walks of life up in here tonight baby

verse 1 violent j
this bitch rashell fucked on her boyfriend in her boyfriends bed
and crazy carlos smacked his baby mama off in the head
and jonathan beat his son like his daddy beat him
but swore hed never do nobody like his daddy did him
and then sandra used her pussyhole to get to the top
and baby d he shot somebody it went bad from the drop
and then diane worked at a hospital took care of old souls
she was abusive her afterlife sees no gold roads
and mr richards was a richie fella born with every penny
everyone around him hungry but he never gave em any
and then steven was a businessman an educated citizen
at the top pornography of children in his laptop
take your spot and hang on cause its crowded in hell
you in the belly of the beast now it was heaven in jail
and dont try to make no friends cause dont nobody got no tongues
if the witch look your way somehow it crushes your lungs

verse 2 violent j
playa playa was a boss man callin out shots
til he caught one then everything stops the floor drops
as hes screamin and fallin we see how pointless was the ballin
when eternity is callin agony will be appallin
dont cry for the dead cause they cry for you
because we laugh about an aftermath but they know how true
and listen aint nofuckinbody gettin it worse than you and me
and aint nobody gettin it worse than you and me and we will see
a pterodactyl swoop through the caverns of hell
and carry two unfortunates off to the ogres cell
it aint no guards playin cards aint no uniforms needed
you the only one around buttnaked bloody and bleedin
with seven demons in your ear got you believin youre heathen
talk you into pulling out your own intestines to get even
you were born with the shine but you lost it down the line
you fucked life up and you cant rewind
see insane clown posse liveget tickets as low as 205you might also likechorus shaggy 2 dope
fuck what youre tellin me we burnin up
the witch keeps sellin me we burnin up
sins we earn em up they keep turnin up
and we turn corrupt til we burnin lovely

verse 3 violent j
judge shaw was a judge snake holes are his eyes
there go another judge another judge somebody despise
and there go so many judges the judges in hell
so many fuckin judges in hell they bludgeon em well
fat pat like his daddy was a bigot pullin duty
he can tell it to them gargoyles fuckin on his booty
and shawna liked money but mistook it for love
now when the witchs wings spread she give him head and look above
black sundays armageddon maggots and rape
hells pit got some fire for you faggots with hate
eddie burrow hit his wife and put her tooth in his knuckle
later on he lost his life in a scuffle now he in trouble
you was a rebel you nobody no mo
to the devil on the double you go
aint no level to the trouble you know
and eternity goes and eternity goes and goes

chorus shaggy 2 dope
fuck what youre tellin me we burnin up
the witch keeps sellin me we burnin up
sins we earn em up they keep turnin up
and we turn corrupt til we burnin lovely
fuck what youre tellin me we burnin up
the witch keeps sellin me we burnin up
sins we earn em up they keep turnin up
and we turn corrupt til we burnin lovelyembed"
