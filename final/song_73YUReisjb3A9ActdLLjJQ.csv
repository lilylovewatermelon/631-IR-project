honey when im above the trees
i see this for what it is
but now im right down in it all the years ive given
is just shit were dividin up
showed you all of my hiding spots
i was dancing when the music stopped
and in the disbelief i cant face reinvention
i havent met the new me yet

chorus
therell be happiness after you
but there was happiness because of you
both of these things can be true
there is happiness

postchorus
past the blood and bruise
past the curses and cries
beyond the terror in the nightfall
haunted by the look in my eyes
that wouldve loved you for a lifetime
leave it all behind
and there is happiness

verse 2
tell me when did your winning smile
begin to look like a smirk
when did all our lessons start to look like weapons
pointed at my deepest hurt
i hope shell be a beautiful fool
who takes my spot next to you
no i didnt mean that
sorry i cant see facts through all of my fury
you havent met the new me yet

therell be happiness after me
but there was happiness because of me
both of these things i believe
there is happiness

postchorus
in our history across our great divide
there is a glorious sunrise
dappled with the flickers of light
from the dress i wore at midnight leave it all behind
and there is happiness

bridge
i cant make it go away by making you a villain
i guess its the price i paid for seven years in heaven
and i pulled your body into mine
every goddamn night now i get fake niceties
no one teaches you what to do
when a good man hurts you
and you know you hurt him too

verse 3
honey when im above the trees
i see it for what it is
but now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
after giving you the best i had
tell me what to give after that
all you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
you havent met the new me yet
and i think shell give you that
chorus
therell be happiness after you
but there was happiness because of you too
both of these things can be true
there is happiness

postchorus
in our history across our great divide
there is a glorious sunrise
dappled with the flickers of light
from the dress i wore at midnight leave it all behind
oh leave it all behind
leave it all behind
and there is happiness51embed"
