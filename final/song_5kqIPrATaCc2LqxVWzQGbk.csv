once i was seven years old my mama told me
go make yourself some friends or youll be lonely
once i was seven years old

verse 1
it was a big big world but we thought we were bigger
pushing each other to the limits we were learning quicker
by eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

chorus
once i was eleven years old my daddy told me
go get yourself a wife or youll be lonely
once i was eleven years old

verse 2
i always had that dream like my daddy before me
so i started writing songs i started writing stories
something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
cause only those i really love will ever really know me

chorus
once i was twenty years old my story got told
before the morning sun when life was lonely
once i was twenty years old lukas graham
see lukas graham liveget tickets as low as 49you might also likeverse 3
i only see my goals i dont believe in failure
cause i know the smallest voices they can make it major
i got my boys with me at least those in favor
and if we dont meet before i leave i hope ill see you later
chorus
once i was twenty years old my story got told
i was writing bout everything i saw before me
once i was twenty years old

bridge
soon well be thirty years old our songs have been sold
weve traveled around the world and were still roaming
soon well be thirty years old

verse 4
im still learning about life my woman brought children for me
so i can sing them all my songs and i can tell them stories
most of my boys are with me some are still out seeking glory
and some i had to leave behind my brother im still sorry

chorus
soon ill be sixty years old my daddy got sixtyone
remember life and then your life becomes a better one
i made a man so happy when i wrote a letter once
i hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
breakdown
soon ill be sixty years old will i think the world is cold
or will i have a lot of children who can warm me
soon ill be sixty years old
soon ill be sixty years old will i think the world is cold
or will i have a lot of children who can hold me
soon ill be sixty years old

chorus
once i was seven years old my mama told me
go make yourself some friends or youll be lonely
once i was seven years old
