i been thinkin bout you havent got much sleep
worried that you already done replaced me
worried i done took it too far and you too hurt to hear me
smokin on a backwood cause i miss my ex
now im ovulatin and i need rough sex
knowin you gon block me tomorrow can you still come and get me

prechorus
missin my daddy when the nights get cold
wishin i didnt wanna sell my soul
wishin that it wasnt so hard man im on my knees

chorus
get a rise out of watchin you fall
get a kick out of missin your call
i hate me enough for the two of us
hate that i cant let go of you enough this why
i fuck him cause i miss you
i fuck him cause i really miss you
i fuck him cause i miss you

verse 2
i just had to get my rocks off
you got no loyalty you push me til i pop off
i beg for empathy you gave me nothing
so hard without you so hard without you
i feel it coming you gon find anothеr one
to keep you calm and tuck you in at night i wonder
will you call me will you hang mе out to dry

im lookin for comfort i knew all along
