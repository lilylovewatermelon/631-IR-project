i went too far when i was begging on my knees
begging for your arms for you to hold around me
i went too far and kissed the ground beneath your feet
waiting for your love waiting for our eyes to meet

chorus
crying give me some love give me some love and hold me
give me some love and hold me tight
oh give me some love give me some love and hold me
give me some love and hold me tight

verse 2
i went too far when i was begging on my knees
when i cut my hands so you could stand and watch me bleed
i went too far and kissed the ground beneath your feet
standing in my blood it was a taste of bittersweet

chorus
crying give me some love give me some love and hold me
give me some love and hold me tight
oh give me some love give me some love and hold me
give me some love and hold me tight

postchorus
why cant i turn around and walk away
go back in time
i had to turn around and walk away
i couldnt stay i had to walk away

im left behind with an empty hole
and everything i am is gone
i tried to reach for another soul
so i can feel whole
oh give me some love
oh give me some love

chorus
oh give me some love give me some love and hold me
give me some love and hold me tight
oh give me some love give me some love and hold me
give me some love and hold me tight

why cant i turn around and walk away
go back in time
i had to turn around and walk away
i couldnt stay i had to walk away21embed"
