i was sitting on the fence
and i thought that i would kiss you
i never thought i wouldve missed you
but you never let me fall push my back against the wall

every time you call you get so emotional
im freaking out

chorus 1

is that you on the phone
you think youre clever
but you never say nothing at all

hey hey
the way you spin me around
you make me dizzy
when you play me like a kid with a crown

verse 2
you got a dangerous obsession
now im in need of some protection
that was never my intention
used to love me now you hate me say i drove you crazy
well if i did you made me wont somebody save me
from you now
