another day inside my world
im married to you and this road
a road that never lets me sleep
theres no way to escape these demons i am forced to keep

chorus
and then i find you here
through your eyes everythings clear
and im home inside your arms
but im alone for now

verse 2
i mean the best with what i say
it doesnt always sound that way
i never learned to work things out
cause in my family all we ever seemed to do is shout

chorus
and then i find you here
through your eyes everythings clear
and im home inside your arms
but im alone for now alone for now

bridge
and i try to sleep
the drugs i take are killing me
i think of you to ease my pain
but youre so far
and now its time to say goodbye
i love you baby please dont cry
see staind liveget tickets as low as 41you might also likechorus
and then i find you here
through your eyes everythings clear
and im home inside your arms
but im alone for now alone for nowembed"
