yo ayo

chorus
real niggas is a dyin breed but i’m still maintaining
made it out the hood i still pop out on some gang shit
my day one niggas them the niggas that i came with
aint no big homies we just reckless gangbanging
dont get caught in the mix ’cause this shit is very dangerous
guess you want some clout we gon really make you famous
skrrt skrrt skrrt i8 watch me lane switch
if you aint talkin money nigga you dont speak my language

verse 1
we grew up playin cops and robbers i was never 12
they tried to warn us like we gon see them heaven gates or jail
free manman fuck the law just got his letter in the mail
eyeballing the work this shit dont ever touch a scale
was fighting petty cases i couldn’t even pay my bail
now it’s thirty on my wrist i paid a stack for these chanels
i drew up a new game plan and bounced back from them ls
made it through the storm they ain’t think that i was gon prevail
glock up on my hip and this bitch got thirty shells
just look at us we lost it pussy nigga cant you tell
lil wooski lost his brothers he gon give them niggas hell
leave ’em on the ground leakin out skin turning pale

verse 2
them was my sandbox niggas like i been with em since birth
tryna pull up on they corner and make niggas disperse
we just want em to feel our pain cause we been hurt
they took one of ours we just tryna get reimbursed
took so many losses swear i thought the hood was cursed
started off with nothing had to get this shit from the dirt
and life been better now but im still expecting the worst
i hop in foreigns for my boys who took a ride in that hearse
and i been going hard cause im content on comin in first
god whispered in my ear and told me kill every verse
feel like im goin numb swallowin these x pills and percs
them drugs beatin me feel like my heart gon jump through my shirt
