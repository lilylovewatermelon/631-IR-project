its over
you dont need to tell me
i hope youre with someone who makes you feel safe
in your sleeping tonight
i wont kill myself trying to stay in your life
i got no distance left to run

verse 2
when you see me
please turn your back and walk away
i dont want to see you cause i know the dreams that you keep
thats where we meet
and when youre coming down think of me
i got no distance left to run

verse 3
its over
i knew it would end this way
i hope youre with someone who makes you feel
that this life its alive
one who settles down stays around spends more time with you
i got no distance left to run
