i pit stopped in here for one cold beer and you tumbled into me
we talked all night i bummed a light that turned into a wildfire
but i cant slow down i cut through town like a rusty old barbed wire

baby i’m a roadrunner
heads carolina tails timbuktu
there aint no wonder
nobodys had enough get up and go in their boots
finger in the air slinging prayers hair wind blown
pedal to the medal burning rubber off of bridgestones
i’ve never loaded my shotgun seat
im a roadrunner and baby you can run with me

that motel vacant sign is flashing like it dont want me to leave
but i gotta chase the sunrise and keep the tumble in my weed
i wanna taste your cowboy kiss but in a different state
if you want to you better grab your boots made for the highway

baby im a roadrunner
heads carolina tails timbuktu
there aint no wonder
nobodys had enough get up and go in their boots
finger in the air slinging prayers hair wind blown
pedal to the medal burning rubber off of bridgestones
ive never loaded my shotgun seat
im a roadrunner and baby you can run with me
see lainey wilson liveget tickets as low as 29you might also likeroad road road runner
alabama mississippi tennessee arizona
road road road runner
rolling down the road tryna find me another

roadrunner
heads carolina tails timbuktu
there ain’t no wonder
nobody’s had enough get up and go in their boots
finger in the air slinging prayers hair wind blown
pedal to the medal burning rubber off of bridgestones
ive never loaded my shotgun seat
i’m a roadrunner and baby you can run with meembed"
