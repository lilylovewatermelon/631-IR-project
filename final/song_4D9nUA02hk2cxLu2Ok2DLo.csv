the building turned its back ignored my call
the concrete looks too thin to break my fall
the sunset stretched across this nighttime scene
i counted people as i neared the street below
whoaoaoa below
whoaoaoa

verse 2 mark hoppus
i saw it all i saw it all go down
the shadow grew as he approached the ground
the sunset stretched across this nighttime scene
i turned away as he came near the street below
whoaoaoa below
whoaoaoa below
