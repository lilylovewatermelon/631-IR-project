had a nice little life
a little boat a little beach
a little routine i liked
a blue ocean view
free to go with the flow
anywhere that i wanted to
but the moment you set foot on my shore
thats when i knew

chorus
theres a difference in living and living well
you cant have it all all by yourself
somethings always missing
till you share it with someone else
theres a difference in living and living well

verse 2
till you sailed with me
thought that i had it good
as good as it could be
from the back of my deck
caught a fish caught a breeze
and a thousand red sunsets
but sitting here with you girl i just saw
the best one yet

my days are brighter
my sky a deeper blue
my nights are sweeter
when im with you
