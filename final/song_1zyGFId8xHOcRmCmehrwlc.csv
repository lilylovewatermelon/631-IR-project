its not easy having yourself a good time
greasing up those bets and betters
watching out they dont fourletter
fuck and kiss you both at the same time
smells like something ive forgotten
curled up died and now its rotten

prechorus 1
im not a gangster tonight
dont wanna be a bad guy
im just a loner baby
and now youve gotten in my way

chorus
i cant decide whether you should live or die
oh youll probably go to heaven
please dont hang your head and cry
no wonder why my heart feels dead inside
its cold and hard and petrified
lock the doors and close the blinds
were going for a ride

verse 2
its a bitch convincing people to like you
if i stop now call me a quitter
if lies were cats youd be a litter
pleasing everyone isnt like you
dancing jigs until im crippled
slug ten drinks i wont get pickled
you might also likeprechorus 2
ive got to hand it to you
youve played by all the same rules
it takes the truth to fool me
and now youve made me angry

chorus
i cant decide whether you should live or die
oh youll probably go to heaven
please dont hang your head and cry
no wonder why my heart feels dead inside
its cold and hard and petrified
lock the doors and close the blinds
were going for a ride

bridge
oh i could throw you in the lake
or feed you poisoned birthday cake
i wont deny im gonna miss you when youre gone
oh i could bury you alive
but you might crawl out with a knife
and kill me when im sleeping thats why

chorus
i cant decide whether you should live or die
oh youll probably go to heaven
please dont hang your head and cry
no wonder why my heart feels dead inside
its cold and hard and petrified
lock the doors and close the blinds
were going for a ride27embed"
