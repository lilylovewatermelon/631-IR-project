chorus colin munroe
i love the way you put it on your eyes
the roses on your face light up the sky
those lips are colorful all of the time
and girl thats fine but i wanna know do you mind
no makeup today no makeup today today
no makeup today no makeup today
and girl thats fine but i wanna know do you mind

verse 1 kendrick lamar
i know she bout to ask me how she look
i tell her beautiful and how long it took
for you to put it on it was early in the morn
she resembled a model out of a mac book
concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
i stand behind her and try to figure her vision
of prettiness the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
her complexion in a direction ive outgrown
damn girl why so much
you bout to blow your cover when you cover up
dont you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
from heaven is where you got it from
i love your smile you can do it without style
from your lips all the way to your eyebrows
its the beauty in her but when the makeup occur
i dont see it all i see is a blur

verse 2 kendrick lamar  alori joh
i know she bout to ask me how she look
i tell her beautiful and how long it took
for you to put it on it was early in the morn
she resembled a model out of a mac book
concentrating on the way my eyeliner thickens
he stand behind me and try to figure her vision
of prettiness the wittiness of colors on my skin tone
my complexion in a direction ive outgrown
i feel like its not enough
i can never put on too much makeup
yeah i know your imperfections i be constantly stressing
from him is where i get it from they tell me i need to
smile at least once in a while
i hate my lips my nose my eyebrows
its the beauty in me but what he dont see
is that i had a black eye— to be continued eleven

and you aint gotta get drunk to have fun
