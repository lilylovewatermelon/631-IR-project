she turned away what was she lookin at
she was a sour girl the day that she met me

she was a happy girl the day that she left me

she was a sour girl the day that she met me
hey what are ya lookin at
she was a happy girl when she left me

verse 2
dont turn away what are ya lookin at
he was so happy on the day that he met her

i was a superman but looks are deceiving
the rollercoaster rides a lonely one
i paid a ransom note to stop it from steaming
hey what are ya lookin at
she was a teenage girl when she met me

chorus
