was the time i tried to kill a man
just for looking at me wrong
anger so strong i couldnt stop myself

verse 2
but i was killing myself one shot at a time
going insane from the pain
the women and the wine

prechorus 1
but i finally hit bottom in an alley way
hell wasnt but a breath away
so i hit my knees in the street
and begged god for mercy yeah

chorus
last night
i told the devil where to go
you know heavens got my soul
aint gonna listen to his lies no more
last night i told the devil where to go

verse 3
i coulda saved myself a lot of hurting time
if id have just listened to my momma
every time she cried

well i was way to lost in a sinners haze
burning up the days
just another young man
who had lost his way

prechorus 2
now it finally makes sense what the preacher said
when he said son you dont wanna wake up dead
and find yourself alone in the fires of hell

chorus
yeah everybody last night
i told the devil where to go
you know heavens got my soul
aint gonna listen to his lies no more
last night i told the devil where to go

bridge
now when you hear that demon knocking at your door
you just tell him
you dont want his kind round here no more no

prechorus 3
cause if you wanna love if you wanna live
if you wanna be free you cant forget and forgive
you gotta kick him in the teeth
and do exactly do exactly what i did
chorus
yeah last night
i told the devil where to go
you know heavens got my soul
aint gonna listen to his lies no more

outro
last night i told the devil
last night i told the devil
last night i told the devil
last night i told the devil
last night i told the devil
i told the devil where to goembed"
