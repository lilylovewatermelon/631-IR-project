are you listening
in the lane
snow is glistening
a beautiful sight
were happy tonight
walking in a winter wonderland
gone away is the bluebird
here to stay is a new bird
he sings a love song
as we go along
walking in a winter wonderland
in the meadow we can build a snowman
then pretend that he is parson brown
hell say are you married
well say no man
but you can do the job
when youre in town

later on
well conspire
as we dream by the fire
to face unafraid
the plans that weve made
walking in a winter wonderland
in the meadow we can build a snowman
and pretend that hes a circus clown
well have lots of fun with mister snowman
until the all the kids knock him down
when it snows
aint it thrilling
though your nose gets a chilling
well frolic and play
the eskimo way
walking in a winter wonderland
walking in a winter wonderland
walking in a winter wonderlandyou might also likeembed"
