last week i came to you
i didnt know what to do
yeah man sometimes i lie
but sometimes i can tell the truth
i want my money back
lifes one big heart attack
yeah man my throat is dry
someday everybodys gonna die

chorus
take it easy on me
i need some lullabies
they tell me heavens just a lie
well im not surprised
tell me that you know
no you dont
yeah youre just like me
cant we just all hope for the best
take it еasy

verse 2
money dont grow on trees
im such a greedy thief
spend my lifе im huntin
keep drinkin just to find relief
my aunties pretty cool
she did real well in school
but she still dont know
where we really go

i need some lullabies
they tell me heavens just a lie
well im not surprised
tell me that you know

yeah youre just like me
cant we just all hope for the best
take it easy
