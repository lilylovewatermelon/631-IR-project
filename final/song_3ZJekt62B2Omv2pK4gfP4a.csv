please help save me
take over my mind
control my eyes
see through your lies

chorus
in my veins cancer crawls
youre in pain cut me off
dont cry
in my head your face remains
pathogen take me down

verse 2
inside these walls
hide my thoughts from you
destroy consume
no truths came through

chorus
in my veins cancer crawls
youre in pain cut me off
dont cry
in my head your face remains
pathogen take me down

chorus
in my veins cancer crawls
youre in pain cut me off
dont cry
in my head your face remains
pathogen take me down1embed"
