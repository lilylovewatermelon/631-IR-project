to the edge till we all get off
i will take you away
with me once and for all

chorus
time will see us realign
diamonds rain across the sky
shower me into the same realm

verse 2
calculate our embrace hold on
come with me now
run away outer space
with me once and for all

chorus
time will see us realign
diamonds rain across the sky
shower me into the same realm
time will see us realign
diamonds rain across the sky
i will lead us to the same realm

interlude
get set
you might also likebreak
when the coffin shakes
and the needle breaks

verse 3
come run away with me
come on youll see
once and for all

chorus
time will see us realign
diamonds rain across the sky
shower me into the same realm
time will lead us to the same realm
i will lead us to the same realm
