welcome to a city thatll bring you to your knees
itll make you beg for more until you cant even breathe
your blindfold is on tight but you like what you see
so follow me into the night cause i got just what you need
were all rolling down the boulevard full of pimps and sharks
its a motherfucking riot weve been dying to start
you better grab a hold cause now you know youre falling apart
you thought these streets were paved in gold but theyre dirty and dark

chorus all  danny
been to hell i can show you the devil
down you fell cant hold yourself together
soul to sell down here you live forever
welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares
been to hell i can show you the devil
down you fell cant hold yourself together
soul to sell down here you live forever
welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares

verse 2 johnny 3 tears
in the belly of the beast im a wolf amongst sheep
at the bottom of the hill but at the top of the street
above the boulevard schoolyard victim of deceit
and youre running hard but this wolf its always at your feet
yeah youve seen it all before but the wolfs outside your door
and youre old enough to run you aint hiding anymore
another victim of the starspangled banner of the street
now youre in the world of the wolves and we welcome all you sheep

down you fell cant hold yourself together
soul to sell down here you live forever
welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares
been to hell i can show you the devil
down you fell cant hold yourself together
soul to sell down here you live forever
welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares

verse 3 charlie scene
you need to wake up and face it so you can taste my reality
now youre stuck in this place you hate and you came here so happily
then it made you lose your faith and thats what fucked with your sanity
say goodbye to your soul and say hello to your vanity
hollywood is your friend and the undead are your family
well take you to the edge and turn your regret into agony
and ill never let you go cause i know youll come back to me
im the reason you came here im the american tragedy

chorus all  danny
been to hell i can show you the devil
down you fell cant hold yourself together
soul to sell down here you live forever
welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares
been to hell i can show you the devil
down you fell cant hold yourself together
soul to sell down here you live forever
welcome to a world where dreams become nightmares
