that grass aint gonna cut itself
and you cant get your tan
underneath these covers and that four blade ceiling fan
you know i love to see you
with that two piece top untied
but i can think of something better
i aint going to lie

chorus
yeah i could use a little rain
beating on the window pane
while we listen to the tin roof sing a love song all day long
yeah i hope it pours
and our clothes stay on the floor
yeah thats the kind of storm thats been calling my name
yeah i could use a little rain
yeah i could use a little rain

verse 2
blame it on the fast lane
trying to make that dollar bill
how everything we gotta do
we cant just sit and still
i know that it aint your fault
and i hope that it aint mine
but we been in a drought for a little too long of time
