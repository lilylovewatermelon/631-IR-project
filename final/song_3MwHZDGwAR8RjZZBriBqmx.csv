you said you loved me
but what does that mean
and would you cry if i were to leave
in my aching hands
running down your spine
you said you loved me how
wait for me by the water
on the first rain of june
and ill be there with all the letters i ever wrote
for you for you

prechorus
lets pack our bags
and head to the rockies babe
just you and i
getting lost in open spaces
when you wake
ill be right there baby
when you shake
ill be shaking with you hon

chorus
and when you get tired of this town
let me know and we can go somewhere brand new
cause when i lay my head to rest
i hope that its always next to you
when you run when youre gone
oh ill be waiting for you dear

dont cry
know im right here my baby baby
know that i
need you in my life
when morning comes
creeping in your bed
just hold me close
to your flesh

chorus
and when you get tired of this town
let me know and we can go somewhere brand new
cause when i lay my head to rest
i hope that its always next to you
when you run when youre gone
oh ill be waiting for you dear

outro
when you get tired of this town
let me know and we can go somewhere brand new
cause when i lay my head to rest
i hope that its always next to you
always next to you baby1embed"
