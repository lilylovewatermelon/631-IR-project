well i was rollin wheels and shiftin gears round that jersey turnpike
when barney stopped me with his gun ten minutes after midnight
said sir you broke the limit in this rusty old truck
i dont know about that accent son just where did you come from

where i come from a lot of front porch sittin
where i come from tryin to make a livin
and workin hard to get to heaven where i come from

verse 2
well i was south of detroit city i pulled in this country kitchen
to try their brand of barbecue the sign said fingerlickin
well i paid the tab and the lady asked me howd i like my biscuit

where i come from lot of front porch pickin
where i come from tryin to make a livin
and workin hard to get to heaven where i come from
