ooh ooh

verse 1
born the daughter of a comedian
middle of the eighties
someone turn that awful mouthbreathing down or else
sally hatchet lives in a hole in the ground
the longer it keeps raining the more she has to struggle
to maintain a wonderful time oh yeah

bridge
go on and laugh it up without me
ive got smoke in my lungs
and a past life in the trunk oh
ooh ooh

verse 2
pretty rattled by the way that she
empties a few clips out
do i have a choice now
point that thing away from me lady ohyou might also like4embed"
