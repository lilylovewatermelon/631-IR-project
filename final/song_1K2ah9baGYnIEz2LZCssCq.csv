it aint what i thought it would be

verse 1
bitch im rollin an opp and im sippin on wock ayy
and she givin me top while im clutchin the glock
ar chop
didnt have a good look at him but a nigga still took that shot
put one in the head
i smacked him with the pistol left his forehead with a knot
ride for my dawgs like bike pegs
try to run then both legs get shot
stretch me a bow and then stretch me a ho
and then stretch me a opp right at the show
few niggas came around me got popped
them niggas wasnt alright with the goat
purple rags on the boat with my ho
few bitches pullin up for the loads
exotic boat it can go for the low
i told him three racks for this smoke
glock in his face ima see where his savage at
shootin at who bitch you know we aint havin that
shot at the opp made that bitch hit the cabbage patch
gave him a vowel his clip started emptyin
im in sin city im sinnin with silla
we flippin them bitches just me and my killers
mama and daughter they facin the pillows
she suckin my dick while she callin her nigga
gave him twenty but he did it for free
better come correct you comin for me
