placing a smile at the perfect event
gracing your skin with the side of my hand
if i ever leave i could learn to miss you
but sentimental boy is my nom de plume

prechorus
let me save you hold this rope

chorus
i may never sleep tonight never sleep tonight
as long as youre still burning bright
if i could trade mistakes for sheep
count me away before you sleep
ill stay awake till i trade my mistakes
or they fade away

verse 2
i feel marooned in this body
deserted my organs can go on without me
you cant fly these wings fly these wings
you cant sleep in this box with me ahahahah

i may never sleep tonight never sleep tonight
as long as youre still burning bright
if i could trade mistakes for sheep
count me away before you sleep
ill stay awake till i trade my mistakes
or they fade away

bridge
dont let me save you hold this rope
and ill pull you in cause i am an anchor
save her or feel it sinking in
let me save you hold this rope
this is only the greatest story every told
i am an anchor sinking her
with lightning in my head to be brought to the world

chorus
i may never sleep tonight
as long as youre still burning bright
if i could trade mistakes for sheep
count me away before you sleep
ill stay awake till i trade my mistakes
or they fade away15embed"
