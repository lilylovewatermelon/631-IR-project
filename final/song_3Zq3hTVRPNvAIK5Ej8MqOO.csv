i kissed the kids at noon
then stumbled out the room
i caught a cab ran up a tab on seventh and flowers
beths recital i had to run
missed my sons graduation
punched the nichols boy for taking his seat
he gets all that anger from me

still things could be much worse
natural disasters
on the evening news
still things could be much worse
weve still got our health
my paycheck in the mail

chorus 1
i promised to my wife and children
id never touch another drink as long as i live
but even then it sounds so soothing
this will blow over in time
this will all blow over in time

verse 2
im just an honest man
provide for me and mine
i give a check to taxdeductible charity organizations
two weeks paid vacation
wont heal the damage done
i need another one
see cold war kids liveget tickets as low as 25you might also likebridge
still things could be much worse
natural disasters
on the evening news
still things could be much worse
weve still got our health
my paycheck in the mail

chorus 2
i promised to my wife and children
id never touch another drink as long as i live
but even then it sounds so soothing
to mix a gin and sink into oblivion

chorus 3
i promised to my wife and children
that accident left everyone a little shook up
but at the meetings i felt so empty
this will blow over in time
this will all blow over in time
