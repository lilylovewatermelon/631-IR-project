born into a pack
theres no choice but take orders to attack
locked up in chains
i get fed but the hunger still remains

prechorus
not content to live this way
being led by the blind
got to plan my dispersal
time to leave them all behind

chorus
breaking out of my pain
nothing ventured nothing gained
im my own master now
bear the mark of my scars
shedding blood underneath the stars
but i will survive somehow

bridge
oh ohohohoh oh
oh ohohohoh oh

hook
hear me howl
time to leave them all behind
im my own master nowyou might also likeembed"
