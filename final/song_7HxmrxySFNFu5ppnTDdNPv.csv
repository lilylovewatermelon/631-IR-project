they love you or they hate you but they will never let you be
theyll thrill you or sedate you but they will never let you see

chorus
in the evening sun
amber evening sun

verse 2
encourage and derange you watch you walking scared alone
despite intimidation pleased to watch you dance alone

chorus
in the evening sun
amber evening sun

bridge
go your separate way now
someday youll come back
and ill be dreaming i was sunburned
i dont wanna break your heart in
break your heart in two halves
keep one half and give one half to me
i like the summer miss the summer
tell me whatd you do nothing me too
see the strokes liveget tickets as low as 122you might also likeverse 3
all actors theyre pretending and singers they will sometimes lie
kids are always honest cause they dont think theyre ever gonna die
oh youre the prettiest smartest captain of the team
i love you more than being seventeen

chorus
in the evening sun
amber evening sun
in the evening sun4embed"
