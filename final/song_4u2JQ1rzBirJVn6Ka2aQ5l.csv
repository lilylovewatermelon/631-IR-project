i comb the crowd and pick you out
my mouth moves too fast for you to figure it out
it starts eyes closed to fingers crossed
to i swear i say
to i swear i say

prechorus
to hands between legs to whatever it takes
to drinks at the club to the bar to the keys to your car
to hotel stairs to the emergency exit door no

chorus
to the love i left my conscience
pressed between the pages of
the bible in the drawer what did it ever do for me
i say

postchorus
it never calls me when im down
love never wanted me but i took it anyway
put your ear to the speaker and choose love or sympathy
but never both love never wanted me
