zero and zero is nothing but zero
cancer and people conspire together
running and running and going forever
collected and sampled starving for zero

chorus
come see my cage built in my grain
come see my cage built in my grain
come see my cage built in my grain
come see my cage built in my grain

verse 2
minus the inside and minus the circle
inhabit the riddle and fill in the hovel
wherein and herein between us and near us
zero and zero is nothing but zero

chorus
come see my cage builtin migraine
come see my cage builtin migraine
come see my cage builtin migraine
come see my cage builtin migraine
