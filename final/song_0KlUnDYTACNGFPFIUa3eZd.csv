cassys got a new plan
gotta get herself away
well id better act quick
yeah id better chchchange my ways

oh maybe im wasting
maybe im chasing time
oh come on lets face it
im only ever lost in mine

well i got my tracing paper
so that i could trace my clock
and the bastard face kept changing
and the hands they wouldnt stop

i was ripping out the battery
i received myself a shock
and to add insult to injury
i could still hear tick  tock

cassys got a new plan
gotta give herself a break
and i try i try i try
for heavens sake

well i traveled to australia
and i traveled there by train
this something might sound strange to you
but on the way i gained a day

and i wrote to tell my family
and i wrote to tell my friends
i arrived home it was lost again
and this torture never ends

were losing memories that i cant replace
she says shes tired of me running in circles
she says its time that we took a break
