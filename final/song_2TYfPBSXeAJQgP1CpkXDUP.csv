all alone
it was always there you see
and even on my own
it was always standing next to me

prechorus
i can see it coming from the edge of the room
creeping in the streetlight
holding my hand in the pale gloom
can you see it coming now

chorus
oh i think im breaking down again
oh i think im breaking down

verse 2
all alone
even when i was a child
ive always known
there was something to be frightened of

prechorus
i can see you coming from the edge of the room
creeping in the streetlight
holding my hand in the pale gloom
can you see it coming now

oh i think im breaking down again

verse 3
all alone
on the edge of sleep
my old familiar friend
comes and lies down next to me

prechorus
and i can see you coming from the edge of the room
smiling in the streetlight
even with my eyes shut tight
i still see him coming now

chorus
oh i think im breaking down again
oh i think im breaking down again
oh i think im breaking down again
oh i think im breaking down5embed"
