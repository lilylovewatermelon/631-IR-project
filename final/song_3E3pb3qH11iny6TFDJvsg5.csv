touchoftrent be wildin with it

verse 1 lil durk
missed out on my kids life for a year and i gotta accept it
certain days niggas never came to my shows and i felt neglected
growin up seein my uncle dyin in his bed that shit made me reckless
pourin up and i aint never sharin my meds and i aint bein extra
and i paid like two of my niggas bonds before i bought a necklace
i done seen my brother stack his bricks up and it look like tetris
havin real shootout up on the eway you cant miss your exit
told the bitch she cant hide the smеll of my cologne she gotta go change hеr panties
take care of your family and them kids cause im too big on family
fuck them fast cars before that shawty nem was gon slide in camrys
ima get my lawyer an extra dub because it come in handy
felt like ima vomit off this perc cause i dont take no xannies

chorus lil durk
voice of the heroes

see im the voice baby he the hero
baby he the hero
im the voice but baby he the hero

i wasnt even tryna be no idol
i put niggas on and all of a sudden they feel entitled
put the brabus on it you only get this kit when you got a title
im exhausted i been workin shifttoshift but i keep fightin
not my fault if i dont miss your likeness
and im still with ced still
we the ones for real for real
i just got two hundred for a walk through ill still drill
highspeed chases in a dodge stratus i can still peel em
i be tryna put on a smile for em but i dont really feel em
i just spent threefifty on a richard for the second time
i showed all my niggas in the trenches its a better life
never get too big for me to listen ill take your advice
i just told durk we rich forever if we play it right
just keep on bein the voice ill be the hero
and everything i got is a profit started with zero
i can never turn my back on my apartment thats where i come from
and im just gettin started relax wait til i warm up

verse 3 lil durk
i done been to jail too many times it feel like karma
everywhere i sleep i keep my stick what i need an alarm for
police caught me in the cut i had to walk out with my arms up
aint too big to pray last minute i put my palms up
yeah flood my system with these percies
took the bitch to eat out at thirteen she was squirtin
i just cashed out on my bitch celine to match her birkin
all this shit these bitches textin me just do it in person
verse 4 lil baby
yeah i might pop a half an adderall i dont like percies
put the phone on dnd im somewhere in her cervix
i just slimed a nigga out today but it was worth it
i switch cars like bitches switch they purses
i slow down on features i do verses if they worth it now
this shit done got deep and its beyond us we cant work it out
peeped that lately you been actin funny wonder what its bout
this shit really in me hope you never doubt it on gang

chorus lil durk
voice of the heroes
im the voice of the heroes
voice of the heroes
voice of the heroes
see im the voice baby he the hero
baby he the hero
im the voice but baby he the hero
but baby he the hero12embed"
