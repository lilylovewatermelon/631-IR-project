everybodys lookin for some way in
im lookin for some way out
ive been wastin my time standin in line
if this is what its all about
all i got is a job that i dont like
and a woman that dont understand
so tonight at the bar
ill get in my car
and take off for the promised land

chorus
drinkin and dreamin
knowin damn well i cant go
ill never see texas la or old mexico
but here at this table im able to leave it behind
drink til im dreamin a thousand miles out of my mind

verse 2
this suit and this tie is just a disguise
this aint really me
some people are born to be tied down
some people are born to be free
when i look down the road she dont know
how it gets under my skin
shes got my body but my heart and soul
are out there ridin the wind
