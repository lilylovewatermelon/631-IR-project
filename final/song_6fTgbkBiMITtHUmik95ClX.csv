youve got this new head filled up with smoke
and ive got my veins all tangled close
to those jukebox bars you frequent
the safest place to hide
a long night spent with your most obvious weakness you start shaking at the thought
you are everything i want
cause you are everything im not

prechorus
and we lay we lay together
just not too close too close
how close is close enough
and we lay we lay together
just not too close too close

chorus
i just wanna break you down so badly
well i trip over everything you say
i just wanna break you down so badly
in the worst way

verse 2

and it says you oh you are so cool
scissorshaped across the bed
you are red violent red
you hollow out my hungry eyes
you hollow out my hungry eyes
