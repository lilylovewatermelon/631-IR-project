verse 1
yeah
only time you ever call me
is when you feelin like
dont nobody else wanna listen
whens the last time you saw me
you probably dont remember that
cause that was back then you were different
i dont wanna hear the sorries
im tired of all the talkin
to be honest i would rather see a difference
yeah you pass me in the hallway
but you aint say a word to me
lately all i ever feel is distant
you dont care that you lost me
whats wrong with ya
had a picture of you sittin on the dash in the car with me
now its in my closet with the other ones
sittin in a box i dont wanna open up
you took it all from me
told me you would die for me
yeah all you ever do is lie to me
wish that i could say that this has come as surprise to me
told me that i never took the time
and now you aint got the time for me yeah

now you wanna jump ship
leave me here alone
well im used to it

every time i ask i just feel sick
youre the one that jumped in
told me you had feelings
now you tryna tell me that is not true
i aint gotta clue who im lookin at right now
but i know the person that im lookin at is not you
yeah they say that you are who you hang with
maybe thats the reason you been changin
maybe thats the reason why im feelin like youre dangerous
and every time we talk its like im talkin to a stranger ah
