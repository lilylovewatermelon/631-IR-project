it wasnt just like a movie
the rain didnt soak through my clothes down to my skin
im drivin away and i i guess you could say
this is the last time ill drive this way again
lost in the gray and i try to grab at the fray
cause i i still love you but i cant

chorus
bye bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye bye baby
i want you bad but its come down to nothing
and all i have is your sympathy
cause you took me home but you just couldnt keep me
bye bye baby
bye bye baby

verse 2
the picture frame is empty
on the dresser vacant just like me
i see your writing on the dash
then back to your hesitation
i was so sure of everything
everything i thought wed always have
guess i never doubted it
then the here and the now floods in
feels like im becoming a part of your past

bye bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye bye baby
i want you bad but its come down to nothing
and all i have is your sympathy
cause you took me home but you just couldnt keep me
bye bye baby

bridge
and theres so much that i cant touch
youre all i want but its not enough this time
and all the pages are just slipping through my hands
and im so scared of how this ends

chorus
bye bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye bye baby
i want you bad but its come down to nothing
and all i have is your sympathy
cause you took me home but you just couldnt keep me

chorus
bye bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye bye baby
i want you bad but its come down to nothing
and all i have is your sympathy
cause you took me home but you just couldnt keep me
oh you took me home i thought you were gonna keep me
bye bye baby
