yeay whats up
its terry callier
got a new way to flow
for ordinary joe
you know

verse 1 terry callier
for my opening line
i might try to indicate my state of mind
or turn you on
or tell you that i’m laughin’
just to keep from cryin’
pretty music when you hear it
keep on tryin’ to get near it
a little rhythm for your spirit
but that’s what it’s for
c’mon in here’s the door

hook terry callier
i’ve seen a sparrow get high
wasting time in the sky
he thinks it’s easy to fly
he’s just a little bit freer than i

verse 2 terry callier
down here on the ground
when you find folks are givin’ you the runaround
get your game up tight
and if you must just take your secrets underground
politicians try to speech you
mad color watchers try to teach you
very few will really try to reach you
if you’re lost in the stack
that’s ok come on black
you might also likehook terry callier
now id be the last to deny
that im just an average guy
each little bird in the sky
is just a little bit freer than i

verse 3 terry callier
say ordinary joe
although they say youre just a lazy soandso
what they think is real
is nothing but an animated puppet show
so dont let time and space confuse you
and dont let name and form abuse you
well let big joe williams blues you
in the light of the sun you can see how they run

hook terry callier
i’ve seen a sparrow get high
wasting time in the sky
he thinks its easy to fly
hes just a little bit freer than i
