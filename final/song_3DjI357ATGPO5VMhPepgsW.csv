these fields dont grow overnight this town wasnt built in a day
ill be turnin that dirt when the sun comes up
goin round in circles while that plane youre on takes you away
chasin down that sun in la 2000 miles it aint that far
girl wherever you are

chorus
ill wait for you ill wait for you
find your way back ill pray you do
ill wait for you
the august rain the break of dawn
like anything worth countin on
comin through ill wait for you

verse 2
ill keep the light on on the porch ill keep the key under the mat
just in case im out there somewhere tryin not to lose my mind
when you come back i know you gotta go
and if you dont girl youll never know
and if you cant find what you want out there
ill be right here aint goin nowhere

chorus
ill wait for you ill wait for you
find your way back ill pray you do
ill wait for you
the august rain the break of dawn
like anything worth countin on
comin through ill wait for you
oh ill wait for you

these fields dont grow overnight
this town wasnt built in a day
some things you love are worth the wait
worth the wait

chorus
ill wait for you ill wait for you
find your way back ill pray you do
ill wait for you
the august rain the break of dawn
like anything worth countin on
comin through ill wait for you
