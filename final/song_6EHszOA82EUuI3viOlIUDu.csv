feel the calm before the storm
ill be leaving in the morning
you were my sweet summer song
but the summers gone and i cant keep your fire burning

prechorus
youre poison running through my veins
end it with a spark into a pool of gasoline

chorus
wildfire
flames rising
hit me like a bullet
finger on the trigger pull it pull it
wildfire burn baby
burn for me

verse 2
castles crash into the sand
as theyre swept into the sea
i could never understand
how youre easy come easy go
as you please

youre poison running through my veins
end it with a spark into a pool of gasoline
