pipe that shit up tnt
dmac on the fuckin track
ohoh nle the top shotta
i got the bombs like alqaeda
woah woah
ayy ayy ayy

chorus
sometimes i gamble with my heart im takin chances where my love at
dont know where to start it got me askin where the drugs at
suburban who cause i be posted with the rugrats
came up off of robbin but my og really sold crack
billion views up but ill still go and kill somethin
take one of my dawgs and ima make sure all yall feel one
unexpected shootout you aint knowin when that drill come
come and shoot up who house we gon post up til you niggas come

verse
and i aint goin in til the mornin
i see a cop im on it
we leave his mama mournin
he send a threat ignore it
the internet for corporate
we leave his body cold spread and then his breath aborted
wanna go far but i know bullshit be stoppin you
tell em keep goin hard cause i know thats just what i would do
people who pushin through they battles i swear im proud of you
people who say they gon be there for you aint on side of you
granny and mama happy her son havin a baby
movin like a don so them niggas steady hate me
mama say im crazy cause im posted with the drac man
tuck it in my pants i cant let a nigga take me
life gettin better but sometimes its gettin hard
people want beneficials but they aint play a part
turn your back on me we getting ready for war
backseat with this drac we lettin fire off in this car
gambles and crosses and losses we take those
if you aint man enough then my killers known to make those
pesos we get even thats if you owe bro
game up in a chokehold they tellin me to let go
see nle choppa liveget tickets as low as 208you might also likebridge
lately i been havin stress all day
too many problems we face
gotta sit down and pray
uhuh i swear to that its gon be okay

chorus
sometimes i gamble with my heart im takin chances where my love at
dont know where to start it got me askin where the drugs at
suburban who cause i be posted with the rugrats
came up off of robbin but my og really sold crack
billion views up but ill still go and kill somethin
take one of my dawgs and ima make sure all yall feel one
unexpected shootout you aint knowin when that drill come
come and shoot up who house we gon post up til you niggas come

outro
