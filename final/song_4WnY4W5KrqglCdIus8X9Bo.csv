hey old friend thanks for callin
its good to know somebody cares
yeah shes gone but i dont feel like talkin
it might be just too much to bear
to hear somebody say it stops hurting
or to hear somebody say she aint worth it

chorus
cause you dont know her like i do
youll never understand
you dont know weve been through
that girls my best friend
and theres no way youre gonna help me
shes the only one who can
no you dont know how much ive got to lose
you dont know her like i do

verse 2
i cant forget im drowning in these memories
it fills my soul with all the little things
and i cant cope its like a death inside the family
its like she stole my way to breathe
so dont try to tell me ill stop hurting
dont try to tell me she aint worth it
