she says she hates to sleep alone but shell do it tonight
she wants to grab her telephone but she knows it arenâ€™t right
so if he wont call shell survive
and if he dont care shell get by
climb into bed bury her head and cry

from the beginning he was all anyone could have been
they were delirious with love they were certain to win
now hes breaking plans more and more
and hes leaving notes on her door
took a trip out of town couldnt turn this one down
he said i guess i shouldve told you before

chorus
she says she feel like shes addicted to a real bad thing
always sitting waiting wondering if the phone will ring
she knows she bounces like a yoyo when he pulls her strings
it hurts to feel like such a fool
she wants to tell him not to call or come around again
he doesnt need her now in all the ways that she needs him
shes on the edge about to fall from leaning out again
she doesnt know which way to move
oh no

verse 2
she wants to be fair she couldnt say he was ever unkind
if she could bear to walk away she thinks he wouldnt mind
cause he just keeps himself so apart
and theres no one else in her heart
so shes taking a dive from an emotional high and coming down hard

she knows she bounces like a yoyo when he pulls her strings
it hurts to feel like such a fool
she wants to tell him not to call or come around again
he doesnt need her now in all the ways that she needs him
shes on the edge about to fall from leaning out again
she doesnt know which way to move
it hurts to feel like such a fool because she dont know which way to move
it hurts to feel like such a foolembed"
