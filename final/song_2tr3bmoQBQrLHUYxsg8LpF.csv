youre busy drawing hearts
you run your fingers down the glass
an open mirror
now youre sleeping in the front seat
like a crushed leaf on the concrete night
murder ring what are you talking about
murder ring and how did you get into my house
i think you buried me too deep

prechorus
you had your way
you almost seem alone

chorus
but ive been driving you around
i didnt think it could have lasted
now we broke another bracelet
tore it off your wrist tonight
tonight the center of the sun will separate in sparks
theyre climbing up the sky and down the dark

verse 2
do you think youd better love me back
you said you want someone who actually cares
but ill say what i want because nobodys around when i talk
it feels better to fall asleep alone cause thats the only way i know
see pierce the veil liveget tickets as low as 65you might also likechorus
but ive been driving you around
i didnt think it could have lasted
now we broke another bracelet
tore it off your wrist tonight
and now that cinderellas gone she swallowed up the sun
a middleclass explosion could be nice if were the dynamite

bridge
let us prey
dont you miss me
or the night we snuck out your window oh
because baby baby youre so crazy now
looks like im not the only one now
and i can finally see the light
oh theres a million stars tonight
a single one could save my life
red water leaves us as we collide
drella drella red water leaves us and i just drive5embed"
