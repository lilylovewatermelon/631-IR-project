909
you gonna call it or am i
one more time
this puppy love is out of line
one more slide
and then were back to real life

prechorus
ooh and im falling now but its so wrong
you talk like a man and taste like the sun
ooh and you lift your eyes up from the dust
i knew just then i knew it was done

chorus
i guess i want you more than i thought i did
now that i know that part of yous at home with him
i guess i want you more than i thought i did
now that i know that part of yous not part of this

verse 2
soft blue skies
helium balloons float up away
broad daylight
but were sunflowers in the rain

my mama said they used to be white pyramids
they float above the sand theyre slowly sinking in
are our foundations destined to keep crumbling
just cause we started this with zero innocence
i just cant build on something that begins like this
its a blood diamond flawless but for that one thing
bridge
you just want backstreets you dont want me
you just gonna hate it all the way
you just want backstreets you dont want me
you just gonna hate it all the way
outro
hello who is this hello
are you watching tv
say byebye
