there aint no gold in this river
that ive been washin my hands in forever
i know there is hope in these waters
but i cant bring myself to swim
when i am drowning in this silence
baby let me in
chorus
go easy on me baby
i was still a child
didnt get the chance to
feel the world around me
i had no time to choose what i chose to do
so go easy on me

verse 2
there aint no room for things to change
when we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
you cant deny how hard ive tried
i changed who i was to put you both first
but now i give up
chorus
go easy on mе baby
i was still a child
didnt get the chance to
feel thе world around me
had no time to choose what i chose to do
so go easy on me
see adele liveget tickets as low as 151you might also likebridge
i had good intentions
and the highest hopes
but i know right now
it probably doesnt even show
chorus
go easy on me baby
i was still a child
i didnt get the chance to
feel the world around me
i had no time to choose what i chose to do
so go easy on me156embed"
