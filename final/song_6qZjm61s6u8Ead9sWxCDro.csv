well he feels like an elephant
shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
he knows that youre dreamin about being loved by him
too bad your chances are slim
and its not like mr shuck
to get shy when they ask him who is on top
there must be something deep down in the dark down there
but hes not too easily scared
hes got friends but they got the fear
wouldnt care too much if he just disappeared
oh look hey there he is now coming down the stairs
here he comes

instrumental break

verse 2
he pulled the mirrors off his cadillac yeah
cause he doesnt like it looking like he looks back
he talks like his opinion is a simple fact
somebody grabbed his collar
he cried the whole way home
no one remembered a thing when they saw him again
thats how it is til the end yeahyou might also like41embed"
