sometimes i think im a killer
i scared you in your house
i even scared myself by talkin
about dahmer on your couch
but i cant sleep next to a body
even harmless in death
plus im pretty sure id miss you
and faking sleep to count your breath

chorus
can the killer in me
tame the fire in you
or is there nothin left to do for us
i am sick of the chase
but im hungry for blood
and theres nothin i can do

verse 2
but when im sick and tired
and when my mind is barely there
when a machine keeps me alive
and im losin all my hair
i hope you kiss my rotten head
and pull the plug
know that ive burned every playlist
and ive given all my love
you might also likechorus
can the killer in me
tame the fire in you
i know theres somethin waiting for us
i am sick of the chase
but im stupid in love
and theres nothin i can do
and theres nothin i can do12embed"
