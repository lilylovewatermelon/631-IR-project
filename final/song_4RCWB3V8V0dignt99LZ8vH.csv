a thousand miles seems pretty far
but theyve got planes and trains and cars
id walk to you if i had no other way
our friends would all make fun of us
and well just laugh along because
we know that none of them have felt this way
delilah i can promise you
that by the time we get through
the world will never ever be the same
and youre to blame

verse 3
hey there delilah you be good and dont you miss me
two more years and youll be done with school and ill be making history like i do
youll know its all because of you
