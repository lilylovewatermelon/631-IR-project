my nigga made it we just young living the dream

verse 1 tyga
uh chandelier ceiling my couch don’t sit with denim
my marble floors are killing gold cars are so relentless
five girls in the kitchen they cooking something like chemists
monumental shit is statues like egyptians
god cover my soul need it can’t let it go
i know you get lonely when i ain’t home on the road
i know i ain’t perfect i’m out here working for the throne
i would take you along but then that college loan you’ll owe
young girls in cheap dresses tryna impress us
saying they all different but i don’t show them no effort
underestimated that r8 then i tested
had to make investments honey colored dressed it
i’m blesseded crosssign baptism west shit
shit on anybody with opinions you dead wrong
go against a bull nigga head on
im too strong eight arms ticking to a bomb
army stance ready for war
we used a andy warhol to paint the decor
apologizing for my actions sometimes i get bored
they say my music knocks so i hope it open every door
see tyga liveget tickets as low as 300you might also likechorus tyga
we all dream one day we kings and queens
we all dream one day we be kings and queens
my nigga made it we just young living the dream
my nigga made it we just young living the dream

my nigga made it we just young living the dream
my nigga made it we just young young

verse 2 wale
uhh never take this shit to heart i take indo to chest
and now a nigga chasing dreams without losing his breath
though my credits are slept my ambition the best
though i do this to be heard ima do it to death
we aint cool with all of these niggas im through with all of these niggas
you fool with all of these niggas you lose like all of these niggas
honest sincere they seersuckers lying in suits
anybody riding with youngun will probably recoup
heavenly father martin malcolm mixed with them lyrics
finna be king but i’m way too proud to offer as minion
i just offer a guillotine to my vehicle nigga
and don’t offer least of shit to these people’s opinions
i’m a king to these niggas love a queen fuck the bitches

we all kings give anything to my soft queens
i’m lost without them when they around i am charles sheen

verse 3 nas
uhh yeah yeah
youre in the presence of a majestic esoteric
message from the most ghettoest king worldwide respected
i can say ghettoest cause i come from where metal spit
praying to god i can slide and slip out the devil’s grip
wont pop another pill cant drink another sip
tryna slow down with this pussy i cant i love this shit
i seem to love these whips
a white maseratis my birthright car pass it i need another hit
at night where they murdered herbie drawz
thats the same block metta world peace learned to play ball
see im born alone die alone from the hoods to the private home
college to prison understand it knowledge and wisdom
shout out to baby mothers of niggas who gang bang
cause he could die any day and you still the same thing
so that make you a queen surviving anything
escobar season begins so let the semis ring
pimp of the year i could smack your father
not only with my hand but with a black revolver
i been in pressed silk since breast milk
mets cap on tilt we some kings nigga3embed"
