you used to hold the door for me now you cant wait to leave
you used to send me flowers if you fucked up in my dreams
i used to make you laugh with all the silly shit i did
now you roll your eyes and walk away and shake your head
when the spark has gone and the candles are out
and the song is done and theres no more sound
whispers turn to yelling and im thinking

chorus
how did we get so mean how do we just move on
how do you feel in the morning
when it comes and everythings undone
is it cause we wanna be free well thats not me
normally im so strong
i just cant wake up on the floor
like a thousand times before
knowing that forever wont be

verse 2
im always sentimental when i think of how it was
when love was sweet and new and we just couldnt get enough
the shower it reminds me youd undress me with your eyes
and now you never touch me and you tell me that youre tired
you know it gets so sad when it all goes bad
and all you think about is all the fun youve had
and all those sorrys aint never gonna mean a thing oh

how do you feel in the morning

normally im so strong
i just cant wake up on the floor
like a thousand times before
knowing that forever wont be

verse 3
i know we said some things that we can never take back
its like a trainwreck trying to hit the right track
we opened up the wine and we just let it breathe
but we shouldve drank it down while it was still sweet
it all goes bad eventually
now do we stay together cause were scared to be alone
we got so used to this abuse it kinda feels like home
but my baby i just really wanna know oh

chorus
how did we get so mean how do we just move on
how do you feel in the morning
when it comes and everythings undone
is it cause we wanna be free well thats not me
normally im so strong
i just cant wake up on the floor
like a thousand times before
knowing that forever wont be
how do we just move on
how do you feel in the morning
when it comes and everythings undone
is it cause we wanna be free well thats not me
normally im so strong
i just cant wake up on the floor
like a thousand times before
knowing that forever wont be3embed"
