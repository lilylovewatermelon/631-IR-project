i saw my problems and ill see the light
we got a lovin thing we gotta feed it right
there aint no danger we can go too far
we start believin now that we can be who we are
grease is the word

they think our love is just a growin pain
why dont they understand its just a cryin shame
their lips are lyin only real is real
we stop the fight right now we got to be what we feel
grease is the word

chorus
grease is the word is the word that you heard
its got a groove its got a meaning
grease is the time is the place is the motion
grease is the way we are feeling

verse 2
we take the pressure and we throw away
conventionality belongs to yesterday
there is a chance that we can make it so far
we start believin now that we can be who we are
