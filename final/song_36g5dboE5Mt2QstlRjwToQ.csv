you tore the night apart
and ripped the silent skies in half
your glory breaking through the dark

and here our worlds collide
divinity in man confined
this great design drawn out for me

chorus
emmanuel
god with us
emmanuel
hallelujah

verse 2
you hold the ends of time
yet placed yourself here into mine
my life is now forever changed

our eyes be lifted up
our great eternal hope arise
this great design drawn out for me

chorus

verse 3
in our silence
heaven whispered out
in our darkness
glory pierced the night

we were broken
but now were lifted up
king of heaven
god is here with us

bridge
hallelujah
angels cry aloud
singing holy
all the praise resound

king of heaven
on the earth be found
king of heaven
on the earth be found
chorus
emmanuel
god with us
emmanuel
hallelujah

emmanuel
god with us
emmanuel
