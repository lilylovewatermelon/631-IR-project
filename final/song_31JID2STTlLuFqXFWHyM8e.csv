where i grew up gettin dressed up means
buttoned down shirt and a good pair of jeans
wasn’t sunday supper without collard greens
dad was boss christ is king
friday night was livin for them lights to come on
then i turned to miller lites when i turned 21
theres some things about me that i can’t change
ill always be the man that home made

home made me love a dirt road
home made me crave some ice cold homemade
sweet tea only mama knows how to make
homemade
home made me love a small town
home made me wanna settle down in a home made
for the two of us
everything i love is homemade
