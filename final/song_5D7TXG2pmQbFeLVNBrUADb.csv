verse 1
see i met her at club on the friday
big booty small waist
seeing her coming my way
so i had to bag her i really had to have her oh
i didnt see a ring on her finger
asked her have you ever been with a singer before
she said no
oh
so let me introduce you to my world
big diamonds and pearls all a part of being my girl
i got that type of shit that you aint never seen before
its all around the world i got them coming back for more
thats when i noticed people are watching

verse 2
got shorty right where i want her
strapped up hemmed up trapped in the corner
grinding slow and i wont let go
no no
baby more iller than ammonia
feeling tipsy from a bottle of corona
oh no
i feel she bout to let go
oh oh
she said she wants to bring me to her world
she whispers some words
that damn near made my toes curl
she said shes got that shit
that i have never seen before
and if i get a taste ill be coming right back for more
and thats when i noticed people are watching

if we share mattresses you leave me no headroom
