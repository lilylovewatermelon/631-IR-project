we drive around this town
houses melting down
a vision turning green
is all weve ever seen
and then its dark again

verse 2
a new development
wishing that it meant
something natural
dont we know its cruel

chorus
and it goes dark again
just like a spark

verse 3
hallucination comes
think of everyone
that never shared before
from my mouth to yours

chorus
and then its dark again
just like a spark
and then it vanishes
no one around
and then it comes again
just like a spark
and then were vanishing
no one around
and then it comes again
just like a spark

you go to school you follow all the rules you live inside
realize theres something in your eyes youre back again
from the spine rising through the mind you give it up
just like a spark its a gift taken from the lips you live again

outro
make it
wave it
alive
make it
wave it
