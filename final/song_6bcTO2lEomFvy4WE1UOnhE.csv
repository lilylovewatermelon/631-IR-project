everything that you do is drivin me crazy
dancin and singin along
and its catchin my ear catchin my eye
i think that its been long enough girl you know i aint playin
so lets blow this popsicle stand girl and kiss it goodbye
kiss me one time like

prechorus
a chocolatecovered pretzel baby salty and sweet
like a dog on a leash beggin for that treat
so what are we waiting for
cause if youre askin me we got everything to lose

chorus
this bar this band these lights this town
this drink your friends my friends our phones
all track of time and a little sleep too
we got everything to lose
our minds our inhibitions
my belt your purse your keys my jacket
this shirt on me that dress on you
come on girl we got everything to lose
we gotta lose everything baby

verse 2
its been a really long time since we got all wound up
and wound up in each others arms
and in each others heads and each others beds
we got our own little groove that im lovin the sound of
spendin all night spinnin around strippin it down
to the basics of you and me
see old dominion liveget tickets as low as 69you might also likechorus
so lets leave this bar this band these lights this town
this drink your friends my friends our phones
all track of time and a little sleep too
we got everything to lose
our minds our inhibitions
my belt your purse your keys my jacket
this shirt on me that dress on you
come on girl we got everything to lose

youre like a chocolatecovered pretzel baby salty and sweet
like a dog on a leash beggin for that treat
we got everything everything to lose

chorus
this bar this band these lights this town
this drink your friends my friends our phones
all track of time and a little sleep too
we got everything to lose
our minds our inhibitions
my belt your purse your keys my jacket
this shirt on me that dress on you
come on girl we got everything to lose
we got everything to loseembed"
