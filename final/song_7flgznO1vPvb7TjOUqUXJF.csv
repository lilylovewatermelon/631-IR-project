all you had to say was that you cared
all you had to say was that you love me

verse 1
you came into my life when i was with somebody else
i opened up my heart to you and told you how i felt
i never looked at you as nothing more than just a friend
but your sweet words your sweet kiss
baby i let you right in

i wish i knew you were no good
that you were just a liar
