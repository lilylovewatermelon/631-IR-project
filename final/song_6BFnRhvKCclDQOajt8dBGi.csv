diet mountain dew baby new york city

verse 1
baby put on heartshaped sunglasses
cause we gonna take a ride
im not gonna listen to what the past says

verse 2
lets take jesus off the dashboard
got enough on his mind
we both know just what were here for
saved too many times
maybe i like this roller coaster
maybe it keeps me high
maybe the speed it brings me closer
i could sparkle up your eye
