i put this message in a bottle and i send it down yonder
so you see what i got to say
when you from the bottom feel like the biggest problem
its all that we got in common today

verse 1 starlito
lost one of my homies and he aint even dead
cant deal with em cause of something he said
beat the case with the state and was ducking the feds
i done been on the run and i was running out of breath
tryna run it back up til i run out of room in the safe
feel like i was running in place
 i stay
like i need to move outta state
know that i knew bettеr knew i should do better
swеar im still stuck in my ways
mama keep stressing me ask bout my wrist yeah every couple of days
i got the rest and you prob got the best of me that was another mistake
they dont understand im a fucking loose cannon that never had something to say
shoot on site

chorus jelly roll
im sending out an sos somebody rescue me
im in over my head and i can barely breathe
i need time to heal i need time to grieve
i need time to kill the beast inside of me
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 2 jelly roll
i have been battling flesh i give my all and it fucks with my energy
i am at war with myself my only enemy is the inner me
its like im on fire deep in my chest that shit is burning in me
i done lost chizzle and chop mono and pops im learning to grieve
and if these tears could talk i wonder what they would say to me
i hear chizzles voice in my head dont let that shit fuck up your day
i would by lying if i said these last couple years i have not been so fucking depressed
every day that i wake up the first thing i think of is playing some russian roulette

chorus jelly roll
im sending out an sos somebody rescue me
im in over my head and i can barely breathe
i need time to heal i need time to grieve
i need time to kill the beast inside of meembed"
