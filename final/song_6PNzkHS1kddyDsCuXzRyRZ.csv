aisle four is where he caught me off guard
seemed like a lifetime
between his goodbye
and by the way how have you been

he talked about the weather
i though of nights i held him so close
there i go
thinkin with my heart again

his smile brought back the best times
sweet memories of nights together
stirring up those old feelings
that got me thinking bout forever
with him

he said i best be going
theres someone waitin for me outside and i died
oh there he goes
and here i go
thinkin with my heart again

his smile brought back the best times
sweet memories of nights together
stirring up those old feelings
that got me thinking bout forever
with him
