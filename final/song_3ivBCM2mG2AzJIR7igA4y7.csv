pleasing to the eye laughing as you drown
watch in slow motion as you loose your grip and you hit the ground
isnt that the way we all come undone
when were put back together

prechorus
its okay when its all about you
its so easy when its all brand new
its okay when its all about you
its so easy when its all brand new

chorus
falling fearless into something new
so much left for me to choose
falling fearless into something new
searching further just to find the truth

verse 2
pleasing to the eye wasted away in the night
foolishly abide by everything in the spotlight
isnt that the way we all come unglued
when were put back together

prechorus
its okay when its all about you
its so easy when its all brand new
its okay when its all about you
its so easy when its all brand new
