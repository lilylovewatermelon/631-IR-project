outro pete wentz
from day one i talked about getting out
but not forgetting about how all my worst fears are letting out
he said why put a new address
on the same old loneliness
when breathing just passes the time
until we all just get old and die
now talkings just a waste of breath
and livings just a waste of death
and why put a new address
on the same old loneliness
and this is you and me and me and you
until weve got nothing left8embed"
