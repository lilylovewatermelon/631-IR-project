oh yeah your love it gets me hotter than a flame
fever at the mention of your name
dont wanna get too caught up in the game
too late
too late youre taking me over
i knew i was in trouble when you held my hand
you radiate emotion that i just dont understand
you move me with desire this was not my plan
oh no
oh no im going under

prechorus 1
youre like water i cant hold you
slip through my fingers i cant control you
im on fire with your crazy energy its lightning
look what you do to me

chorus 1
youre like sexy dynamite
you cause explosions inside me every night
youre like sexy dynamite
you cause explosions inside me every night

verse 2
all of my life ive been waiting for this
illuminate the sky with your electrifying kiss
youre gonna take me down but i just cant resist
too late
too late youre taking me over
all the little loverthings you do to me
your soul ignites the fire that sets me free
you know i will surrender to your ecstasy
oh yeah
oh yeah im going under
