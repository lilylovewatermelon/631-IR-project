and dancin on a saturday night
church on sunday mornin and talkin to jesus
theres some that say that that aint right

i know for certain that nobodys perfect
and they dont pretend to be
i like those people
and they like me

well they may roll the dice
but aint life a gamble
and you may think that thats all wrong
they take what theyre given
hard work and hard livin
right out of some old country song

jokes that they tell you
might be off color
but sometimes thats just what you need
i like those people
and they like me

they dont kick you when youre down
judge you when you make a mistake
theyre the first to come around
help you at whatever it takes
you might also liketheyre the salt of the earth
honest as rain
a light when your world turns dark
and if it falls on your shoulders
and you need to hide out
they wont tell a soul where you are

yeah they stick together
like birds of a feather
treat you like family
hey i like those people
and they like me

they dont kick you when youre down
judge you when you make a mistake
theyre the first to come around
help you at whatever it takes

hey its ice cold beer smokeless tobacco
and dancin on a saturday night
theres church on sunday mornin
and talkin to jesus
theres some that say that that aint right

hey but i got a feelin
god up in heaven
thinks thats the way it should be
i like these people
and they like me
yeah i like these people
and they like me
they like meembed"
