now i think i understand
how this world can overcome a man
like a friend we saw it through
in the end i gave my life for you
verse 2 m shadows
gave you all i had to give
found a place for me to rest my head
while i may be hard to find
heard theres peace just on the other side

chorus the rev
not that i could
or that i would
let it burn
under my skin
let it burn
verse 3 m shadows
left this life to set me free
took a piece of you inside of me
all this hurt can finally fade
promise me youll never feel afraid

chorus the rev
not that i could
or that i would
let it burn
under my skin
let it burn
