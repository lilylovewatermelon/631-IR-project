im writing you this message just so i can say that i love you
i had to let you know that everything about me was you yeah
i think its time for me to leave but ill never leave you
i just looked at your pictures so the last thing i did was see you

prechorus
im twentynine my anxietys eating me alive
im fightin with myself and my sobriety every night
and last time i couldnt barely open up my eyes i apologize

chorus
im not gonna lie and tell you its alright its alright
youre gonna cry and baby thats alright its alright
i wrote you this song to keep when im gone
if you ever feel alone
youre gonna cry and baby thats alright its alright

verse 2
i hope you get to go to all the places that i showed you
when i was on the road and couldnt be home to hold you
part of me doesnt want this cruel world to know you
so just try and keep in mind everything that i told you

prechorus
im twentynine and societys eating me alive
im fighting what comes with this notoriety every night
this is the last time ill ever open up my eyes i apologize
