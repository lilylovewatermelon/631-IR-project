ive came to the point i must make a decision
this money is cool but you cant take it with you
lord im just grinding and making a living
i make it so vivid with painting a picture
i look in the mirror
feel like im lost
i do not recognize that man at all
started to build without counting the cost
were all the same at the foot of the cross
and if i told you that my lifes on the line
would you give a fuck at all
and if i told you i was led by the blind
would you believe me when i said what they saw

hook jelly roll
theres a monster inside of my head
i feel like im in danger
cause every time that i look at myself
im staring at a stranger

i made it out of the mud by doing dirt my soul is filthy uh
covering up the smell of all of my guilt with gucci gilded ooh
ugly truth in the mirror starin back never looked this pretty
findin peace by losin myself in self pity
please forgive me
feelin low im trapped in a cage of expectations set too high
fightin to live but start to get jealous of all the ones who get to die
ready to ride our wars inside
pickin a side
its hard to decide
split down the middle
the great divide is where all my demons lie

hook jelly roll
theres a monster inside of my head
i feel like im in danger
cause every time that i look at myself
im staring at a stranger
whoa
whoa
whoa
im staring at a stranger

i dont recognize myself
im staring at a stranger
i dont recognize myselfembed"
