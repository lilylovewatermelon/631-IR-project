verse 1 chance the rapper
rap just make me anxious and acid made me crazy
them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
and i still make this song and ima make another
if you ever actually hit me better watch out for my brother
better bet id take that deal gotta watch out for my mother
get a watch with all that glitters come in clutters different colors
benaballer benford butlers chauffeurs hit a stainer did i stutter
did a ton of drugs and did better than all my alma mater
motherfucker money dance hundreds xan gallon lean
make a joke bout lenos hair then piggyback on fallons spleen
balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
nightly searches for a bed and i just came off tour with troy
but i cant complain i got some motherfucking bitches
how many lab partners have i fucked since i got suspended
mr bennett you done did it you did it you did it
you did a good ass job you did a good ass job and im good igh
