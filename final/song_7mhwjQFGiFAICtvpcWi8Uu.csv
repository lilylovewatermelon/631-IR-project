all it takes is a main attraction
scattered bones underneath the fashion
lower life on a higher plane
thats what you want
thats what theyre givin away

prechorus
photogenic come and get it
you can have it
take it all
schizophrenic so sadistic
i dont know
i dont know
politicians sick condition
dyin for a curtain call
counter culture full of vultures
bet you think im what
were goin all out
but get em up get em up
and if they wanna take a picture
tell em i dont give a fuck

chorus
no one needs you after all
that little social scene
its just a hate machine
no ones here to take your call
and now your selfesteem
aint what it used to be
youve inspired
the birth of ignorance
the death of innocence
guess whos back and mad as hell
the nowhere kids that wished you well

verse 2
the new face of an old distraction
another victim with the same reaction
a catastrophic contradiction at best
i know youre hanging onto zeros
cause you got nothing left

prechorus
photogenic come and get it
you can have it
take it all
schizophrenic so sadistic
i dont know
i dont know
politicians sick condition
dyin for a curtain call
counter culture full of vultures
bet you think im what
were goin all out
but get em up get em up
and if they wanna take a picture
tell em i dont give a fuck
chorus
no one needs you after all
that little social scene
its just a hate machine
no ones here to take your call
and now your selfesteem
aint what it used to be

the birth of ignorance
the death of innocence
guess whos back and mad as hell
