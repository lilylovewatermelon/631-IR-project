if you were there beware the serpent soul pinchers
threehundred and fifty no thank yous and nobody flinches
go on girl go on give us something gruesome
we require your grief the thugs help the thieves
as theyre trying to rob the words from her gob and
take the swords to the innocents

verse 2
if you were there beware the serpent soul pinchers
cant you sense she was never meant to fill column inches
aint you had enough what youre trying to dig up
isnt there to be dug the thieves help the thugs
as theyre trying to beat the good grace of a sweetheart
out to the point shell comply

i wouldnt have said it if i would have known
why leave her on her own
if i predicted tears then i wouldnt have said it
i wouldnt have said it if i would have known
