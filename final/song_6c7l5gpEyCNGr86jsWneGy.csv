i was 16 when we first laid eyes
scrawny little fucker yeah i was that guy
and you was down for the weekend i was down for the greetings
and you eyes the same color shit that jasper be chiefing
couple freckles on ya noses roses made you blush
gentleman i was like i wasnt tryna fuck
but it was my first official date so i was stuck like
it was past curfew and we was at the grove
and it was raining and i had to be home
and then you grab my hand talking about tryna get home safe or something
all i remember was your motherfucking face

hook tyler the creator
i play in your hair as you rub on my ears
then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
now its awkward in here because our lips locked
feels like i’m floating in air
cant believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
man this feels like a dream because our lips locked
you officially put my feelings inside a ziploc bag

verse 2 tyler the creator
you gotta a nigga sprung whenever i’m holding your hand and
making eye contact i feel like the damn man
cause even though i am and get round of applauses
im insecure and start to think that i do not stand chance
but moments wish that i can own it or lease it or clone it
cause holding your fingertips is golden
i fucking love you now treat my palms like a bowling ball and
grip and keep holding on girl

then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
now its awkward in here because our lips locked
feels like im floating in air
cant believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
man this feels like a dream because our lips locked
you officially put my feelings inside a ziploc bag
you got a nigga

verse 3 tyler the creator
wait
dont think this is going to work
things got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt
i havent talked to you in a couple of days
i got too comfortable
and started to think that we was really a couple
but hey fuck you at least there was time spent
but by the time you hear this you wont know what these rhymes meant
but when you realize its awkward your name still my password
so im always fucking reminded
you got a nigga sprung
