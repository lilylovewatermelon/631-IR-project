i packed a few of my belongings
left the life that i was living
just some memories of it
mostly the ones i cant forget
ah whenever you need me ill be here
until then my dear
im going im going going there
dont ask me to make time to travel back and forth
let nature take its course
maybe im open from all this ocean air

chorus
and if it werent for you
id be without a care
settin sail to st elsewhere yeah

verse 2
anywhere you sit you can see the sun
unfortunately on this island im the only one one
same rules apply on a rainy day
and its not such a pretty place to be
it just rains and rains and rains on me
send a simple sign i can understand
then a flower grew out that sand
before you know it i was back out on that sea

now i dont mind it so much
because as long as im not there
anywhere st elsewhere yeah

verse 3
way over yonder theres a new frontier
would it be so hard for you to come and visit me here
i understand
well just send me a message in a bottle then baby
