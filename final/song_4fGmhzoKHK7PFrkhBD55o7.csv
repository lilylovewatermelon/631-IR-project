does it feel so bad
when youre taking a drag
and when youre looking at the world
through dying eyes
when you stare at it dead
and youre giving it head
and all those things you say you love
never come alive
oh yeah

chorus
if it feels so bad
bad magick playing off of me
feels so bad
oh no i dont wanna be your friend
feels so bad
bad magick laying into me
feels so bad
oh no i dont wanna hear it again

verse 2
when you get so high
that youre wanting to dye
but everything around you
is turning green
when youre getting so low
and i know youve been
feeling like a driedout leaf
in a summer breeze
i dont like it
