ooh
yeah yeah yeah

verse 1
now youre thinkin bout it
girl youre thinkin bout it
what we got here
how we fuckin got here
they recognized
they just recognize
im in a life without a home so this recognitions not enough
i dont care about nobody else
cause ive been on these streets way too long too long too long
baby ive been on this too long

verse 2
cause getting faded too long
got me on this rolling stone
so i take another hit
kill another serotonin
with a hand full of beans
and a chest full of weed
got me singing bout a bitch
while im blowing out my steam
yeah i know i got my issues
why you think i fuckin flow
and ima keep on smoking til i cant hit another note

and my mystery fades
