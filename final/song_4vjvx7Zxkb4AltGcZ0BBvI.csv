day off in kyoto
got bored at the temple
looked around at the 7eleven
the band took the speed train
went to the arcade
i wanted to go but i didnt
you called me from a payphone
they still got payphones
it cost a dollar a minute
to tell me youre getting sober
and you wrote me a letter
but i dont have to read it

chorus
im gonna kill you
if you dont beat me to it
dreaming through tokyo skies
i wanted to see the world
then i flew over the ocean
and i changed my mind woo

verse 2
sunsets been a freak show
on the weekend so
ive been driving out to the suburbs
to park at the goodwill
and stare at the chemtrails
with my little brother
he said you called on his birthday
you were off by like ten days
but you get a few points for tryin
remember getting the truck fixed
when you let us drive it
twentyfive felt like flying
you might also likechorus
i dont forgive you
but please dont hold me to it
born under scorpio skies
i wanted to see the world
through your eyes until it happened
then i changed my mind

outro
guess i lied
im a liar
who lies
cause im a liar39embed"
