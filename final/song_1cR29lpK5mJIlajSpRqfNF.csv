i think that maybe i was right
back when i knew to draw the line
already gave what i could offer
maybe well work another time
i guess the thought of its enough
no going back or switchin up
i really wish that i could do that
walking away from you is tough

prechorus
i know weve run it dry
ive heard that happens sometimes
i shouldnt be surprised should i

chorus
ive packed my bags in the middle of the night
a thousand times i got up to say goodbye
i could be wrong but i think that im for real this time
ive taken down all the pictures in my room
ive hidden things that reminded me of you
i know ive lied but i think that im for real this time

verse 2
couldnt you tell when i was off
you never asked me what it was
i kind of hope you feel the same way
so that im not the only one
you might also likeprechorus
who thinks weve run it dry
but still weve stayed a long time
im sorry if i make you cry tonight

chorus
cause ive packed my bags in the middle of the night
a thousand times i got up to say goodbye
i could be wrong but i think that im for real this time
ive taken down all the pictures in my room
ive hidden things that reminded me of you
i know ive lied but i think that im for real this time

bridge
i know that ive lied
but were running dry
know i wont come back this time
i know that ive lied
but were runnin dry
think that im for real this time

outro
ive packed my bags in the middle of the night
a thousand times i got up to say goodbye
i could be wrong but i think that im for real this time1embed"
