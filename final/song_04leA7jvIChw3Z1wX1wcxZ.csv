the war that ive been fighting
start to fall but im still standing here
behind the wall of dying faith

i cant forget
the fight thats growing stronger
face to face with hopes of longer days
to build on something we should save

i stand alone
im on my own
my hands will bleed my hands will bleed
im holding on to what is gone
whats left of me

im falling down
but i should find my strength in this
a light that burns to reconnect
my heart for what its meant to give

i stand alone
im on my own
my hands will bleed my hands will bleed
im holding on to what is gone
whats left of me

stand again so i can
walk
fall
stand again so i can

stand again so i can

i stand alone
im on my own
my hands will bleed my hands will bleed
im holding on to what is gone
whats left of me
