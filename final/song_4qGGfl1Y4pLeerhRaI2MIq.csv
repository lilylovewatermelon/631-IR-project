its like youre a drug
its like youre a demon i cant face down
its like im stuck
its like im running from you all the time
and i know i let you have all the power
its like the only company i seek is misery all around
its like youre a leech
sucking the life from me
its like i cant breathe
without you inside of me
and i know i let you have all the power
and i realize im never gonna quit you over time

chorus
its like i cant breathe
its like i cant see anything
nothing but you
im addicted to you
its like i cant think
without you interrupting me
in my thoughts in my dreams
youve taken over me
its like im not me
its like im not me

its like im lost
its like im giving up slowly
its like youre a ghost thats haunting me
leave me alone
and i know these voices in my head
are mine alone
and i know ill never change my ways
if i dont give you up now

chorus
its like i cant breathe
its like i cant see anything
nothing but you
im addicted to you
its like i cant think
without you interrupting me
in my thoughts in my dreams
youve taken over me
its like im not me
its like im not me

verse 3
im hooked on you i need a fix i cant take it
just one more hit i promise i can deal with it
ill handle it quit it just one more time then thats it
just a little bit more to get me through this
im hooked on you i need a fix i cant take it
just one more hit i promise i can deal with it
ill handle it quit it just one more time then thats it
just a little bit more to get me through this
chorus
its like i cant breathe
its like i cant see anything
nothing but you
im addicted to you
its like i cant think
without you interrupting me
in my thoughts in my dreams
youve taken over me
its like im not me
its like im not me1embed"
