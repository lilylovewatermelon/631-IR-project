beautiful dawn
lights up the shore for me
there is nothing else in the world
id rather wake up and see with you

verse 2
beautiful dawn
im just chasing time again
thought i would die a lonely man
in endless night

chorus
but now im high
running wild among all the stars above
sometimes its hard to believe you remember me

verse 3
beautiful dawn beautiful dawn
melts with the stars again
do you remember the day when my journey began
will you remember the end of time
beautiful dawn beautiful dawn
youre just blowing my mind again
thought i was born to endless night until you shine

high
running wild among all the stars above

will you be my shoulder when im grey and older
promise me tomorrow starts with you

chorus
getting high
running wild among all the stars above
sometimes its hard to believe you remember me
high
running wild among all the stars above
sometimes its hard to believe you remember me3embed"
