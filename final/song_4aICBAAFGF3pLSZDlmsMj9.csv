im sitting in a room
made up of only big white walls
and in the hall
there are people looking through
the window in the door
they know exactly what were here for
dont look up just let them think
theres no place else youd rather be
youre always on display
for everyone to watch and learn from
dont you know by now

prechorus
you cant turn back
because this road is all youll ever have

chorus
and its obvious that youre dying dying
just living proof that the cameras lying
and oh oh open wide
cause this is your night so smile
cause youll go out in style
youll go out in style

verse 2
if you let me i could
id show you how to build your fences set restrictions
separate from the world
the constant battle that you hate to fight
just blame the limelight
dont look up just let them think
theres no place else youd rather be
