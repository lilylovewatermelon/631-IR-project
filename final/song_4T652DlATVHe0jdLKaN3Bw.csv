verse 1 ariana grande
painted a picture i thought i knew you well
i got a habit of seeing what isnt there
caught in the moment tangled up in your sheets
when you broke my heart i said you only wanted half of me

prechorus ariana grande
my imaginations too creative
they see demon i see angel angel angel angel
without the halo wingless angel

chorus ariana grande
falling falling but i never thought youd leave me
falling falling needed something to believe in oh
i thought you were the one
but it was all in my head
it was all in my head skrrt skrrt
