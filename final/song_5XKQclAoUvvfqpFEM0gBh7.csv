theres a sense of meaning in the nonsense that you say
theres a sense of meaning in the nonsense that you say
crazy i subliming as my heart becomes your prey

verse 1 lord of loneliness
allow me to collect myself im all over the place
put my brain on the shelf throw me away
throw me away—
my hands always hiding my face never knew why
i guess its cause i feel erased sever new ties
im best when i feel im replaced
get the glue might have to clean up this mess tonight
black skies not a star in sight
thats why i get scarred from light
my demons escape to the place where theres blue skies
they leave me behind with no trace get the noose tied
my neck snapped and my body hangs in the new light
the end only comes when its time

verse 2 yung lowdown
baby ive longed to see you
baby cant think of nothing but you
im caged in walls cave in
sinking i i cant swim
do you think of me when youre fucking him
do you think of
fuck—
cause its only you i want
im hurt and i cant front
seems like i cant get enough of you ripping me apart
you got me broken and on my own hopin you call my phone
wait youre blocked cause im trying to move on
to be frank i fell in love with a ho
but i need yousee uicideboy liveget tickets as low as 90you might also like54embed"
