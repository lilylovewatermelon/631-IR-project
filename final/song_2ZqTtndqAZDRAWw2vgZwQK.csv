now im of consenting age
to be forgetting you in a cabaret
somewhere downtown where a burlesque queen
may even ask my name
as she sheds her skin on stage
im seated and sweating to a dance song on the clubs pa
the strip joint veteran sits two away
smirking between dignified sips of his dignified
peach and lime daiquiri

chorus
and isnt this exactly where youd like me
im exactly where youd like me you know
praying for love in a lap dance
and paying in naivety
oh isnt this exactly where youd like me
im exactly where youd like me you know
praying for love in a lap dance
and paying in naivety

and i wouldnt be caught dead in this place
