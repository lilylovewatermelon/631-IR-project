yeah i grew up ten minutes from the sticks
ten minutes from the beach
and there aint a bible verse yall
i aint heard a preacher preach
mom and dad up in the bleachers
screaming while i pitch
beating deep on the speakers
finally riding around the town
with my best friends aint life like a whirlwind
one second im playing checkers with grandma
then my world ends
i used to hear my granddaddy say
before its too late

chorus
you gotta dig your roots
for the sun goes down
show some love back to your hometown
fall in love plant some seeds
carve some names in the family tree
raise your kids love your wife
put god first just to live your life
hey i think im gonna go
and get a little more dirt on my boots
you gotta dig your roots
you dig you love you gotta put em in the ground for someone

yeah im a long haired tattooed feather in the wind
yeah a good ol boy just like my old man
every night when im singing
i know hes looking down
up there next to pawpaw
got the best seats in the house
when i close my eyes i can still hear him say
the same thing im gonna tell my kids

chorus
you gotta dig your roots
for the sun goes down
show some love back to your hometown
fall in love plant some seeds
carve some names in the family tree
raise your kids love your wife
put god first just to live your life

and get a little more dirt on my boots
