you know i think more than me
because he did a lot of really nice generous things for me
like he bought me a house you know cars and paid off my student loans and you know all kinds of stuff
and hed just be like okay he didnt care he he just didnt care about stuff like that
when he came to see the house he was like oh this is like the places you used to take me im glad you like your house

chorus
did it on my own ima do my own thing

ridin around with my clique oh yeah
now if you take the l you took and add it to it bitch we lit
im thanking god im not selling no bricks
if its ever a problem ima call up the problem solvers
they pull up and put a hole in your wig
yeah you and your friends you kill our vibe we kill yo mans
