the girls on the streets look all sad in this goldencrusted little town
why is that isnt this the town of dreams
yeah but it comes with a price
its a town that never does anything and takes all the credit
a place that promises so much and never has a thing to say
or a care in the world
there is no memory here
no dream for itself but the dreams of others
and all over the world you talk about a place youve only seen in the reruns
immortalized by its vice and deified for its carnage
theres money in the air there
all you have to do is reach up and grab it
in basements garages parking lots empty lots schoolyards town cars back rooms and more
diamonds are fashioned from expectations and fortified on a steady diet
of simple lives and red carpets
the ejaculating zeitgeist in night vision
culture is a punchline and emotion is blood in the water
the sharks here play games you cant fathom
but you flock here anyway
on college money and credit cards
spend a week bullshitting yourself that it was all true
all of it
just to watch in horror as it all falls to pieces under the gravity of reality
the starry eyes fade as it dawns on you
nothing is guaranteed
you are a part of the great divide the chosen or the frozen
now youre miles away without an egg
your college money is a collage of debt
and your credit cards are all snapped in fucking half
time to wander a landscape in bereft of mercy
this is now the backlot of your failed movie
a waking dream rewritten without your permission
the real luster the soft focus the soap opera vision
is just the hindsight of a world whos been lied to
of sad surfs and untouchable lords
you took a chance didnt you
but chance didnt have a par for you this time around
maybe next life
and you cant even walk home
the girls on the street all look sad in this cardboard cutout little town
no wonder thats the only thing here thats real
the gold is for fools and paradise is lost
but the hungry have never bothered with the cost
day by day they fall away like rose petals
like ink that wont dry or fade
it just runs wild down cracks and crevices grooves and folds
so i hope someone saves you before you get cold
i really do
because the girls are all sad in this little black book
if you dont believe me take a closer look
