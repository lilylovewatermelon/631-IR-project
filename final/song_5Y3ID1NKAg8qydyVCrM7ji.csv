on the grind cant indulge in a foolish thought
on the grind cant indulge in a foolish thought
young nigga always held his own
feel like im way overdue for prop
fed up hell yeah i been through a lot
keep it on me come see if thats true or not
dropped the rakes two gs and a 4l
thats how me and all my troopers rock
play with us fuck around get your shooters shot
its gon be a sad day when that ruger knock
we aint done yet we gon spin the block
face shot spot news what we do to opps
know them niggas want me gone but i cant go ima shoot my gun back
only got yourself and some hope and if i go who gon teach my son that
break up tryna blame my faults and time goеs on but we always run back
tryna find ways just to cope i been therе before know we all been done bad
colorblind dollar signs swear thats all that i think about
internal wounds on my conscience lose my mind start bleedin out
he relate to my problems so his trauma got him singin loud
mixed emotions cant stop it and my temper cant keep it down
if you run out of options girl you know what keys to dial
dont care if this toxic want your love and i need it now uh

chorus
one day we was lovers and friends
but everything gotta come to an end
heartbreak got you runnin again
i just want somethin real i dont wanna pretend
really felt connections from the touch of your skin
constantly drinkin im stuck in a binge
are you careless or was it revenge
crazy what the true colors can blend uh

think about me all day what you probably do
now you tryna get used to somebody new
i couldve rushed in some shit just to copy you
i just put all my feelings inside the stu
i was lookin for you to lean on
but my son and the music thats really what got me through
have you ever let the wrong one steal your heart
i been a victim of robbery too uh
we partin ways and im fine with that
cause the same old shit aint got time for that
common sense thats what your mind would lack
yeah you tried to play cant rewind it back uh
grindin for the fam i was up all night
likes on the gram got you caught up in the hype
time that we spent either fuck or a fight
then our hearts got cold cause the love wasnt right uh

chorus
one day we was lovers and friends
but everything gotta come to an end
heartbreak got you runnin again
i just want somethin real i dont wanna pretend
really felt connections from the touch of your skin
constantly drinkin im stuck in a binge
are you careless or was it revenge
crazy what the true colors can blend uh6embed"
