this is for all the women
that have been stripped of their innocence
she was daddys little girl
but no matter what they kept their head up
and this is my way of saying thank you
all alone in the world

chorus pitbull  slim of 112
confused and dont know what to think
cause she thought that she was she was daddys little girl
confused and dont know what to think
cause she thought that she was she was daddys little girl
to find for herself cause she thought that she was
daddys little girl daddys little girl
she thought that she was
she was daddys little girl daddys little girl
she was daddys little girl

verse 1 pitbull  slim of 112
i was raised by women a woman made me a man
its just too bad that a man took her innocence
and god knows that i i would finish him
diminish him end up killin him
blame it on the ignorance thats where her childhood went
new country new language thats how seven years were spent
time you cant buy it and some lose em here
i know that we bumped heads just know mom that im here
cuban peter pan the rebelution was crazy
i wanna thank you mom for the way you raised me
all your life you wanted only one thing
and that was to say she was daddys little girl

verse 2 pitbull  slim of 112
took care of me just like a mother
till you got pregnant then you was off to georgia
it was tough how we how we were brought up
tougher for you cause you had no father
now i understand now that im a man
how much a woman needs someone to call dad
you cut through the pain you walked through the rain
the game aint playin you baby you play the game
now youre in search of that father figure
and if you find him he denies you
jenny fuck that nigga
karmas a bitch even though i know she wish
she was daddys little girl

outro pitbull  slim of 112
this is for all the women that stayed strong
and beat all the odds she was daddys little girl
the ones that have been raped the ones that grew up fatherless
all alone in the world
but still found a way to raise their kids
to do the right thing she was daddys little girl
this is for yall i love yall all alone in the world1embed"
