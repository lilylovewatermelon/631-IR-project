coming up slowly oh sun over the hill
daylight still a long time coming
but i know it will
been under their spell oh but were coming awake
so well be rude well be loud
as long as it takes

prechorus
this is why this is why we crank the dial to the right
this is why were biting the bullet
we know the kids are right

chorus
different colors
we carry each other
just different colors
this is why were biting the bullet
we know the kids are right

verse 2
we keep cranking the music up
driving through our towns
but they dont wanna hear
they want us to turn it down
so come on lovers come on haters
tonight we raise the fire
cause when the people get to dancing
they forget about taking sides

out of your spell as long as it takes

out of your spell as long as it takes
