verse 1
this world loves me this world loves me not
im torn between the best of both cause im hot
in this game so brittely literaly
i got niggas wanna riddle me get rid of me
rule need i say more
world hope yall prepared for the chaos
cause yall want the beast in me so ima give it
paint pictures vivid live high as a spirit
yall can all jump in it
thats what you might as well do
if you gonna live life timid
and i aint never been intiminated
believe me and i dont wanna fuckin breath easy
i wanna make it hard for these niggas
so when they cant stand me
ima make it so these niggas cant feed they family
now do you love me or do you hate me
cmon and get me i keep it off safety

verse 2
theres nothin but love spread between me and my niggas
we bust guns together and fuck so many bitches
but i know that hell is callin
in the name of the lord just let a nigga in
cause i aint done nothin wrong but love thy self
and harm other niggas that wanna stop my health
is that failure
cause lovell never be hand over hand
its man versus man
its murda
if im gonna be hated or to be loved
i prefer ta live wild and die from slugs
what you want from me
lord im only a human
tho i bear your name im a devil in chains
release me cause lord only knows it aint easy
when im scarred for life i know that he sees me
now do you love me nigga
or do you hate me nigga
cmon and get me
im waiting nigga
chorus
do you love me do you hate me
ready or not here i come
do you love me do you hate me
ready or not here i come

verse 3
yall just wanna watch me rise then watch me fall
before its all done ima die from it all
i might od in a club off drugs like river phoenix
or get shot down like big and pac for my genius
i know this worlds seen it before and here i come
i know yall fiendin for more and im not done
as long as i can run through current like state times
keep up a sane mind and hand on my iron ima blast off mine
look in the eyes of a nigga who seldomly cries
i got a beautiful wife and kids why me
got cash jewels cars and cribs why me
if this good livin lord why me
when i live so dirty yet im worthy to be
number one the worlds only begotten son
here i come

chorus
do you love me do you hate me
ready or not here i come
do you love me do you hate me
ready or not here i come
do you love me do you hate me
ready or not here i come
do you love me do you hate me
ready or not here i come
outro
do you love me
do you hate me
do you love me
do you hate me
here i comeembed"
