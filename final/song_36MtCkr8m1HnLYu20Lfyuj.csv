maybe its drinkin a glassbottle coke
from petitts on 5th and main
or turnin a wrench on a softtop jeep
on a shade tree sunny day
youre only here for a little while
do somethin that makes you smile

verse 2
if its roundin up beerdrinkin buddies
to tell stories you always tell
or a threedollar ticket under friday night lights
to see a home team give em hell
youre only here for a little while
do somethin that makes you smile

chorus
whatever it is you better get to it
when you got the time you gotta use it
the road runs out so take it slow
when them good times roll man let em roll
youre only here for a little while
so do somethin that makes you smile

verse 3
for me its callin in sick to work
and takin grandpas tackle box
down to that same old fishin hole
where he taught me how to tie a knot
i aint done that in a little while
and thats somethin that makes me smile

whatever it is you better get to it
when you got the time you gotta use it

so do somethin that makes you smile

so do somethin that makes you smile
