and roll me some

verse 1 mac miller
hey then you can pass that the kid who rock a snapback
steady blow this hash back until my thoughts are abstract
high to get by thats how we livin in this day and age
i bring some color to a world thats filled with shades of gray
throwin this cake away to blaze and sip some tanqueray
remember spectatin til they picked the kid to play the game
now im an allstar blasted out the ballpark
in my lamborghini speedin you a golf cart
california dreams amsterdam reality
life aint what it seems these the thoughts that weed pull outta me
blow through a thousand trees the whole entire crowd get skeed
livin in what seems to be fiction im on a balcony
i light one up this for those who ever doubted me
then light another this for those who hold it down for me

verse 2 mac miller
then you can pass that we floatin along
so much smoke we got the words high wrote in the song
girl i try to come and make you smile
im gone so will you wait a while
as soon as i come home we gon smoke and then ill stay a while
some people hate my style some people love it though
and all these kids who wanna clone me they aint comin close
politickin joints we countin none of your votes
im gettin everybody high so you can puff on ya roach
shorty used to all these players tell her fuck with a coach
i just want you to come over roll me somethin to smoke
hey my mind be cookin rhymes up live until my times up
hate me then they love me tell em try to make they minds up
barbers and they line me up id was on the beat
its best to shout the people out that help you get your cheese
refrain mac miller

so we ride and we smoke til we cant anymo
