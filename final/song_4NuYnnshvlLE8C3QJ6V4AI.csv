all i wanna know
is when you go
do you think of me
cause i could let you go
but thered be a hole
where my heart used to be

chorus sheryl crow  don henley
its so easy holding you near
i could melt in your arms and disappear
loving you baby is breaking my heart tonight
cause its so easy but it isnt right

verse 2 don henley
i saw you today
you walked away
and i couldnt breathe
cause i know how it would feel
a love so real
when youre touching me ooh

chorus sheryl crow  don henley
its so easy holding you near
i could melt in your arms and disappear
loving you baby is breaking my heart tonight
cause its so easy but it isnt right
