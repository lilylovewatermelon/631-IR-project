get up go get it if i ever want it
i got some act in my cup and im loaded
i pop them perkys you know i control it
straight off the dome you know i aint wrote it
gotta tell it swear its hard for to hold it
up with the glock and you know ima blow it

chorus
pour up my cup and i sip it i sip it
whatever i want i go get it i go get it
came from rags to riches rags to riches
blew up and took over my city my city
im thankin the lord i did it i did it
i wanted a bite and i bit it i bit it
i swear it aint hard to get it to get it
i stay with that rod im with it im with it

verse 1
i see blood i want blood like the reaper
run up that check and take care of my people
collect them bodies i swear im a demon
i pour a five of that act in a liter
run up the money with all my brothers
up with that glock and i shot it in public
say that she love me i know she dont love me
straight out the north ill never stop thuggin
sosa come in pull up with the drank for me
walk in the mall and im spendin your budget
label gave me a whole lotta money
told me that they got another check for me
never tell ima keep it one hundred
stick to that shit til the day i go under dada

this fortune and fame aint rented
im lovin this pain im feelin

my diamonds gon shine like a headlight
focus on keepin my head right
i know for a fact its gon be alright
make sure my son gon be alright
lord forgive me for takin lives
cashap got the beat tight
