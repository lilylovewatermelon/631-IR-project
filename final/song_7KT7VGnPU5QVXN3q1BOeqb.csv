ain’t no surprise that i can’t sleep tonight
my only vice is standing by your side

prechorus
so won’t you love me better
i’m waiting here i need you now
gravity can’t hold us down
so just take me there to higher ground

chorus
save me i’m holding onto you
my soul is fading i’m falling into blue
why don’t you save me
my blood is running cold
so lift me up and give me higher ground

verse 2
would you give me shelter i need you now
if you lead i’ll follow i’m reaching out

prechorus
so won’t you love me better
i’m waiting here i need you now
gravity can’t hold us down
so just take me there
so won’t you love me better
i’m waiting here i need you now
gravity can’t hold us down
so just take me there to higher ground
