tried to break love to a science
in an act of pure defiance
i broke her heart
and as i pulled apart her theory
as i watched her growing weary
i pulled her apart
having heavy conversations
about the furthest constellations of our souls ooh
and were just trying to find some meaning
in the things that we believe in
but we got some ways to go
of all of the things that shes ever said
she goes and says something that just knocks me dead

chorus
you wont find faith or hope down a telescope
you wont find heart and soul in the stars
you can break everything down to chemicals
but you cant explain a love like ours

woohhhh
its the way we feel yeah this is real
woohhhh
its the way we feel yeah this is real

i tried pushing evolution
as the obvious conclusion of the start
but it was for my own amusement
saying love was an illusion of a hopeless heart
of all of the things that shes ever said
she goes and says something that knocks me dead

chorus
you wont find faith or hope down a telescope
you wont find heart and soul in the stars
you can break everything down to chemicals
but you cant explain a love like ours

woohhhh
its the way we feel yeah this is real
woohhhh
its the way we feel yeah this is real

bridge
oh oh woohhhh
oh oh woohhhh
of all of the things that shes ever said
she goes and says something that just knocks me dead

chorus
you wont find faith or hope down a telescope
you wont find heart and soul in the stars
you can break everything down to chemicals
but you cant explain a love like ours
outro
woohhhh
its the way we feel yeah this is real
ooohhhh
its the way we feel yeah this is real
oh oh woohhhh
oh oh woohhhh
oh oh woohhhh
oh oh woohhhh
