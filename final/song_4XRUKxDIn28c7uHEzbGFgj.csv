i can see that youve been crying
you cant hide it with a lie
whats the use in you denying
that what you have is wrong
i heard him promise you forever
but forevers come and gone
baby he would say whatever
it takes to keep you blind
to the truth between the lines

chorus all  nick
oh i will love you more than that
i wont say the words then take them back
dont give loneliness a chance
baby listen to me when i say
i will love you more than that

verse 2 nick
baby you deserve much better
whats the use in holding on
dont you see its now or never
cause i just cant be friends
baby knowing in the end

chorus all  brian
that i will love you more than that
i wont say the words then take them back
cant take them back
dont give loneliness a chance
baby listen to me when i say hey
