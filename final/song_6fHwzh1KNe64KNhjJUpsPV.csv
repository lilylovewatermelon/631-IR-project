diamonds in my bracelet shine like a kodak flash
just motivation for these freaky hoes to show that ass nigga
i pop tags on a throwback fast
nigga please im wearin these when i cut my grass freeze
all you niggas wanna touch my cash
the 40 cals in the stash and when i touch i blast
televisons in the dash suede roof in the coupe
im the one nigga young niggas knew is the truth
and the dumb niggas i aint done provin it to
come with a clique of guerillas like i hung at a zoo
i gotta bitch to pull bitches like she one of the crew
now a buncha broads in the back bustin it loose
do it free for me and charge you a hundred or two
top floor in the presidential with a wonderful view
yeah im rich but i aint just talkin i live like this
you couldnt get water out the faucet as clear as my wrist

chorus mannie fresh  ti

its been a long time since you seen a nigga like me
in a pair of gucci sneakers jeans and a white tee
extravagant and outa control i might be
but im makin 50k on the road a night g
rocks in my ring big as cubes in ya ice tea
i used to dream bout a benz now i own like 3
i gotta winecolored v with the winecolored v
and reclined leather seats i aint lyin im a beast
you can tell im gettin money how i shine in the streets
blowin on the best pine you can find in the streets
rappers wastin they time if they trying to compete
they records sales declinin when mine hit the streets
i got the fine freaks starin cus my time piece glarin
when the light hit the carrats got they eyes lookin chinese
youll run yourself raggedy tryna out shine me
no matter whatcha do youre 2 steps behind me

chorus mannie fresh  ti
pimpin yall aint heard that latest
ay its the best of the best
young pimpin on a record with fresh
i drive chevys fuck mercedes
hopped out the new cl v12 got in the blue ss
and im leavin witcha ladies
i got a beautiful bitch pursuin ya bitch
next thing ya know ya losin ya bitch pimp
yall niggas give it up im the greatest
ay im the greatest ay im the greatest ay
pimpin im the greatest
verse 3 ti
a smooth attitude enable me to ball outrageous
nigga fuck you pay me im all outa favors
what grand hustle got aint a motherfucker gave us
a motherfuckin thing but aint a motherfucker played us
you gotta mil thats a small percentage
the way ya record deal structured you only get a small percentage
i gotta magnum with a magnum in it
playstation and a plasma in it
sittin on 20 inches and its tinted
gotta hemi nothin faster than it
the 50 gsll pass you in it get real
gotta chevy more expensive than that jag you rented
excuse me but let young pimpin brag a minute
gotta bottle of louie and a flock of groupies hotter than rudy
lickin me dry when i get out the jacuzzi
they eatin pussy suckin dick until they mouth got gooey
cant another young nigga in the south outdo me

chorus mannie fresh  ti
pimpin yall aint heard that latest
ay its the best of the best
young pimpin on a record with fresh
i drive chevys fuck mercedes
hopped out the new cl v12 got in the blue ss
and im leavin witcha ladies
i got a beautiful bitch pursuin ya bitch
next thing ya know ya losin ya bitch pimp
yall niggas give it up im the greatest
ay im the greatest ay im the greatest ay
pimpin im the greatestembed"
