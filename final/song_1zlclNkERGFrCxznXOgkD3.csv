time never cares if youre there or not there
all you ever needed was a simple plan
but youre doing well i mean youre not dead
so lets celebrate while we still can

they talk so much on me i must be doing something right
i saw my son today in the likeness of a full grown man
so ill celebrate while i still can

ooh on a clear day you can see west la even downtown
i remember where i couldnt even see the point

let it go let it go let it go let it go let it go
i came to fixing up the tree that farms move
ive came too far

verse 3

youll be wise to pay attention to your old head
i spent the whole day throwin records in the deep end
so lets celebrate while we still can

ooh on a clear day you can see west la even downtown

i came to fixin up the tree that farms move
ive came too far

verse 5
do not be concerned about the money in your brothers hand

now chaotic surfing nervous surfing and uh uh surfing power has its has its merits
and i uh i canâ€”it fascinates me thats just not my direction
