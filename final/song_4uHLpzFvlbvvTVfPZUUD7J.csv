eyes open another second that i cant enjoy ya dreamlike presence
i just leave you in the mattress but the fact is im infatuated with the pitch dark blackness
associated eyelids close feeling sedated anti what kevin gates is yea i get tired
six jobs aint a possibility cuz ill be missing you you missing me i really need to fucking sleep
or fuck and sleep threesome with my rerun ive begun to spend time with you before she cumssnoring
you see the neighbors know my name like damn j varice is sleeping i woke they baby now he weeping but shit im dreaming
i do it heavy yall aint ready favorite spot on back or belly remy boy drop the y cuz i aint talking bout fetty

hook alex isley
im telling everyone i know

and ima sing it all day all night
cause i want to
im want to tell the whole wide world bout your love x3

verse 2
eyes open another second that i cantwait i feel well rested aye
wait well rested damn i think i overslept it shit now i gotta deal with the fucking consequences
no pregnancies or stds more like no longer employee
fifth harmony i gotta go to work dont lie to me
or watch my gpa slip like permission alarm you didnt listen all nighters will keep the distance
from ya bitch ass you more selfish than a pet shop a seafood restaurant and the store of groceries
officially done with you dont need a notary just need some caffeine and some coffee
look you aint gonna stop me from being great fuck getting 8 ill wait until my death date
and 95 of times im blaming you if late but whats a true love story without a little bit of hate

verse 3
eyes close first few seconds of relaxing in ya peaceful quiescence
must be said no disrespect to the legend but mlk jr cant dream like me when i zzz
headline rapper at a concert crowd on fire as i vomit lava
im swimming in a pool of dollas that im gon donate to mama so she dont gotta deal with the drama you too papa
see other rappers seem to hate you clears throat kevin gates again
they claim that sleep is for the weak i guess im seven days
plus seven years with no gym membership oh shit i guess i cant take that bench pressure
trade it for that bed tempur pedic giving head to my pillow fingering the snooze button on the dresser
buy jammies to impress ya sports team or alma mater
hate well be interrupted one day by baby son or daughter but until then

hook alex isley
im telling everyone i know
this song is about you
and ima sing it all day all night
cause i want to
im want to tell the whole wide world bout your love x3
outro
i dont need to count sheep this my lullaby to sleep

nyquilmelatonin
i dont need to count sheep this my lullaby to sleep
