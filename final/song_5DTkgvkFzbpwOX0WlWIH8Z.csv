cotton in my head
i was taught the things i need to know
clothes dont fit right
tight around the head but dont fit to form
a shapeless man being
choked
out

chorus
do my clothes look right
do my clothes look nice
keep those lips sealed tight
and youll get out fine

verse 2
ill be bullet proof
you can see me every single day
never see me
you can breathe me in
never breathe me
my shoes and my shades will protect
me from pain

chorus
do my clothes look nice
do my clothes look right
keep those lips sealed tight
and youll get out fine

i dont want to know
she says did you see the brand are you impressed
finest fabrics flown in top notch kid
sew you up your sides so you dont split
i dont want to know is what she said
did you see the brand are you impressed
finest fabrics flown in top notch kid
sew you up your sides so you dont split

chorus
do my clothes look nice
do my clothes look right
keep those lips sealed tight
and youll get out fine

outro
and i know better
im a money lender
i wear my status
with my watch and jacket

and i know better
im a money spender
i wear my status
with my watch and jacket2embed"
