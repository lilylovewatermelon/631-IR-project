busy on the weekend
caught up in your own small world
well i might wanna see it then
call it hesitation girl

chorus mitchel cave
were running in the moonlight
were dancing in the open waves
youre hangin for a good time
something thatll make you stay
and girl you fall down again
you tell me youre all out again
were running in the moonlight
could you show me the way again
oh no no

verse 1 mitchel cave
youre talking in and out of the subject
just call me when youre finished are you done yet girl
youre falling in and out through a sunset
and i just wanna know if youre in love yet girl

refrain mitchel cave
she just wants to talk through the daytime
and i just want it all when the times right
yeah shes about to fall for the third time
the nature of it all

verse 2 christian anthony
were diving through the bottom of the ocean
swimming through a bottle of emotions girl
maybe i was thinking you would notice
i was runnin through the forest when i wrote this girl

and i just want it all when the times right
