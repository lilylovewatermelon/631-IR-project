am i afraid of you
or do i pretend i dont care
just like the stars can tell all the worlds apart
ill be here in the dark
i stayed inside to watch the rain again
i watched all of my movies from the end to the start
and i cant help but think about you now when the trailers start
cause i know were worlds apart

chorus 1
now i stand here unknown
a voice in the hall
youre famous for something
its hard to recall
will anything change
its stuck on replay
our room is now vacant
the beds are well made

verse 2
do i exist in your heart
or did the ship sail away while i was in the gift shop
you swim with the sharks
and i know were worlds apart
you might also likechorus 2
now i stand here unknown
a voice in the hall
youre famous for something
its hard to recall
we dont have a choice
the curtains have closed
im making a point
but youll never know
know know know
