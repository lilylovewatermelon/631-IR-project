i grew up with a lot of green
nice things round me
i was safe i was fine
grew up with a lot of dreams
plans who to be
none of them none were mine

prechorus
i love freaks i dont care if youre a wild one
i love freaks i dont care if youre a wild one
and me

chorus
i im not the prettiest youve ever seen
but i have my moments i have my moments
not the flawless one ive never been
but i have my moments i have my moments
i can get a little drunk i get into all the donts
but on good days i am charming as fuck
i can get a little drunk i get into all the donts
but on good days i am charming as fuck

and im locked in your mind

that im so wrong
i can tell tell you lie
