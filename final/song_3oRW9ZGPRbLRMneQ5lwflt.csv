dont be upset or mad at all
dont feel regret or sad at all
hey im still a part of the family madrigal
and im fine i am totally fine
i will stand on the side as you shine
im not fine im not fine

chorus
i cant move the mountains
i cant make the flowers bloom
i cant take another night up in my room
waiting on a miracle
i cant heal whats broken
cant control the morning rain or a hurricane
cant keep down the unspoken invisible pain
always waiting on a miracle a miracle

verse 2
always walking alone
always wanting for more
like im still at that door
longing to shine like all of you shine
all i need is a change
all i need is a chance
all i know is i cant stay on the side
open your eyеs open your eyes opеn your eyes

i would move the mountains
make new trees and flowers grow
someone please just let me know where do i go
i am waiting on a miracle a miracle
i would heal whats broken
show this family something new
who i am inside so what can i do
im sick of waiting on a miracle so here i go

outro
i am ready
come on im ready
ive been patient and steadfast and steady
bless me now as you blessed us all those years ago
when you gave us a miracle
am i too late for a miracle6embed"
