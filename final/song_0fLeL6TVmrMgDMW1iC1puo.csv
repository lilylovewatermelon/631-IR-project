i met you when i had a dream
not so long ago it seems
we closed down a million bars
yeah you and me weve come so far
you showed me how to write a song
we wrote some right we wrote some wrong
i was down and out you let me in
at times you were my only friend

chorus
so long nashville tennessee
you cant have whats left of me
and as far as i can tell
its high time i wish you well
you build me up you set me free
you tore down my memories
so you be you and ill be me
so long nashville tennessee

verse 2
now you wont miss me when im gone
youre custom made for movin on
and time to time ill pass you by
face that i dont recognize
and who knows maybe years from now
youll be the one i think about
but i just cant imagine that
cause im not one for lookin back

so long nashville tennessee
you cant have whats left of me
and as far as i can tell
its high time i wish you well
you build me up you set me free
you tore down my memories
so you be you and ill be me
so long nashville tennessee

outro
so long nashville tennessee
you cant have whats left of me
and as far as i can tell
its high time i wish you well
you build me up you set me free
you tore down my memories
youre not who you used to be
