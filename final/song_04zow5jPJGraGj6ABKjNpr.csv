hope in death
it brands these bonds
refines the rest
but these days are numbered
this life absolute
i need this faith to keep me walkin
to keep me alive

oh darlin oh darlin
wont you please take me home
oh darlin my sweet darlin
wont you please keep me warm

we must strive to be
be like the moon
to be kind
distracted by its tune
cause these days are numbered
this life absolute
we all complain if it rains or it shines
but were never mad at the moon

oh darlin oh darlin
wont you please keep me warm
oh darlin sweet darlin
wont you please take me homesee the head and the heart liveget tickets as low as 63you might also likeembed"
