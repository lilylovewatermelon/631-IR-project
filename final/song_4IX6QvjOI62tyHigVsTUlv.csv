have faith in me
cause there are things that ive seen i dont believe
so cling to what you know and never let go
you should know things arent always what they seem

chorus
i said id never let you go and i never did
i said id never let you fall and i always meant it
if you didnt have this chance then i never did
youll always find me right there again

verse 2
im going crazy
cause there are things in the streets i dont believe
so well pretend its alright pretend its alright
and stay in for the night
oh what a world ill keep you safe here with me with me

chorus
i said id never let you go and i never did
i said id never let you fall and i always meant it
if you didnt have this chance then i never did
youll always find me right there again
i said id never let you go and i never did
i said id never let you fall and i always meant it
if you didnt have this chance then i never did
youll always find me right there again
