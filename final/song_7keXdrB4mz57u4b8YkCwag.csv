when you’re dreaming with a broken heart
the waking up is the hardest part
you roll out of bed and down on your knees
and for a moment you can hardly breathe
wondering “was she really here
is she standing in my room”
no she’s not
‘cause she’s gone gone gone gone gone

verse 2
when you’re dreaming with a broken heart
the giving up is the hardest part
she takes you in with her crying eyes
then all at once you have to say goodbye
wondering “could you stay my love
will you wake up by my side”
no she can’t
‘cause she’s gone gone gone gone gone

now do i have to fall asleep with roses in my hand
do i have to fall asleep with roses in my hand
now do i have to fall asleep with roses in my hand
do i have to fall asleep with roses in my roses in my hands
and would you get them if i did
no you won’t
‘cause you’re gone gone gone gone gone
