wither and bloom
like we all do soon enough
cover me up with your love
scratches from the branches
we took our chances sure enough
i am brambles
but i am tangled in your love

chorus
bullet holes bullet holes
all patched up and headed home
bullet holes bullet holes
all patched up and headed home

verse 2
silver and gold
precious stones so i’m told
ah we’re clutching but there ain’t nothing we can hold

chorus
bullet holes bullet holes
all patched up and headed home
bullet holes bullet holes
all patched up and headed home
see gregory alan isakov liveget tickets as low as 40you might also likebridge
drifting passing through
until we all fall we all do
in the meantime come and cover me up

outro
i’m all patched up and headed home
cover me up with your love bullet holes bullet holes
i’m all patched up and headed home
bullet holes bullet holes
i’m all patched up and headed home
cover me up with your love
i’m all patched up and headed homeembed"
