verse 1 lil wayne
im a east sider rider whoa kimosabe
bitches get to stepping like cole gina tommy
pussy is a weapon and my hoes think im simon
and simon say go and get my motherfucking money
young moolah bitch tell them hoes take their clothes off
and i dont hunt birds but ill shoot you in your mohawk
yeah flow nasty like coleslaw
call me mr no flaw

verse 2 gudda gudda
yeah i sip drank and pop pills til i dose off
wake up grab the mic then i goes off
too g for office boss of all bosses
crucify rappers nail niggas to the crosses
im fresh out the slaughterhouse blood on my apron
we louisianimals watch me let the gators in
im going on my paper run a week at the days inn
icing on my fingertips i be getting cake in

i—i be getting cake then
watching for the rats and trying not to get snakebit

and i beat the beat up like deebo
i—i—i got the game on tivo
so i guess you can say the streets is watchin

verse 3 jae millz
i dont promise much but i promise you that itll flow boy
name jake but you can call me millzbury dough boy
silence on the nine but the chopper make more noise
but if the bitch scream ima pop her no noise
bank account type solid truck nice and brolic
the rims sticking out like the shoulders on dwight howard
you niggas aint gs youre gents and quite coward
but ill put you higher than flight pilots

verse 4 gudda gudda
i am petrifying the metal turn to lightning
burn through your clothes like an iron
i am no american idol no simon cowell
wack niggas throw in the towel
im getting money with the rap pay me by the vowel
im hungry like a pack of wolves so i just howl holla
cash rules everything around me
so ima get the money dollar dollar bills and them hundreds
chorus tstreets
i—i be getting cake then
watching for the rats and trying not to get snakebit
its that pointingatyourface shit
and if you scared you better go and see mase bitch

and i beat the beat up like deebo
i—i—i got the game on tivo

verse 5 nicki minaj

and get ready to put your dimples in this duct tape
