well slip the liars and disappear
well leave memories for auctioneers
and those just standing still

theyll miss the taste of wanting you
call out your name like i still do
but they havent said a word thats true
and they only hold you down

in this heartbreak world of just imagine
with its tired talk of better days
in this heartbreak world where nothing matters
come on lets make this dream thats barely halfawake come true

lets move out of los angeles
and just drive until this summer gives
and forget the lives we used to live
cause were gone

in this heartbreak world of just imagine
with its tired talk of better days
in this heartbreak world where nothing matters
come on lets make this dream thats barely halfawake come trueyou might also likeembed"
