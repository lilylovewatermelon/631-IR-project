paint the streets in white
death is the standard breach for a complex prize
i think its sweet of you and your parents are proud
but i wouldnt expect it from anyone not to protect lifes indigenous sound

how the streets they swell
while the animals make their way through the crowds
if you keep listening you can hear it for miles
god i trust everyone quicker with every faint smile
