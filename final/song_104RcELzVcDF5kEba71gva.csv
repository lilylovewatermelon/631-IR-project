fire

verse 1 50 cent
i make it hotter  friction turns to fire
youre what i desire im coming to get you girl
thats right thats right its on tonight
youre just my type youre what i like
i bring that heat you heard me right

i go back to the basics and break it all the way all the way down
you can hate it but face it big and 2pac just aint around
everywhere you go there i go im 50 cent
ghetto star by the bar i get you bent

you wanna creep we can creep tell me where should we meet
so you can
