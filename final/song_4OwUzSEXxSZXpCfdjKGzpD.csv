verse 1
you saw my pain washed out in the rain
and broken glass saw the blood run from my veins
but you saw no fault no cracks in my heart
and you knelt beside my hope torn apart
but the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
and well live a long life

chorus
so give me hope in the darkness that i will see the light
cause oh they gave me such a fright
but i will hold as long as you like with all of my might
just promise me well be all right

verse 2
so lead me back
turn south from that place
and close my eyes to my recent disgrace
cause you know my call
and well share my all
and our children come and they will hear me roar
you might also likechorus
so give me hope in the darkness that i will see the light
cause oh they gave me such a fright
but i will hold as long as you like with all of my might
just promise me well be all right

bridge
but hold me still
bury my heart on the coals next to yours
and hold me still
bury my heart next to yours on the coals

chorus
so give me hope in the darkness that i will see the light
cause oh they gave me such a fright
but i will hold with all of my might as long as you like
just promise me well be all right

outro
ghosts that we knew made us black and all blue
but well live a long life
and the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
and well live a long life8embed"
