now i aint worried about a thang cause i just hit me a lick
i got a fat sack and a superfly chick
there aint nothing you can say to a playa
cause doowop she fly like the planes in the air
thats right shes full grown settin the wrong tone
im diggin the energy and im lovin the ozone
so fly like a dove so fly like a raven
quick to politic with some fly conversation
in a natural mood then im a natural dude
and we some natural fools blowin out by the pool
she like my sexycool mama with blades on her berata
rockin dolce gabbana italian with highdrows and an igwana
