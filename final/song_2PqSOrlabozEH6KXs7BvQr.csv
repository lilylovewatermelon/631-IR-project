talk to you with my hands tied
walk towards you on a fine line
everybody has a dark side
i feel embarrassed when they see mine
rain falling from my dark skies
clouds parting but its all lies
shouldnt i see the sunshine now
wonder how i look in gods eyes
am i a good person or a lost one
will this feel worth it when im all done
will i feel ashamed or like who i was
will the pain vanish or will more come
will i stay numb or regain love
maybe someday have a taste of freedom
will i take the poison out of my blood
or just leave it there inside of my lungs
i know know know
i should let you go hands are feeling cold
just leave me alone no no no
i just want control i feel so exposed
liars in my home no no no
please do not provoke noose around my soul i cut down a rope
they dont want me happy they dont want me fixed
they dont want me better they just want me broke
talk but never listen at least i admit it
block out all my vision watchin me diminish
thats my favorite pastime i know nothing different
tell me something different i dont see the difference
i just feel offended i just feel defensive
why dont you accept me i just need acceptance
time is of the essence dont like how we spend it
you just want perfection i need you to let me

let me go let me go let me go let me go
let me go let me go let me go let me go
let me go let me go let me go let me go
let me go let me go let me go let me go

verse 2
whyd you say i dont belong here huh
fill a bucket full of my tears huh
pouring out the water all of my insecurities whenever im scared
i watch em grow and say i dont care
i pray to god to ask if hopes real
and if it is then i was thinking maybe you could introduce us we aint met still
yeah my chest feels like a blades in it
who put it there i think they did it
out the cell now where am i headed
am i hellbound will i find heaven
will i feel better or just regret it
if i let you go and find the seven letters
ive been looking for its like its never endin
open all the doors and let the peace enter
im so so so
pitiful at times miserable inside
they want me to hide no no no
how can i survive change your state of mind
i should say goodbye no no no
they want me to beg they want me to plead they want me to die
they just want me dead they just want me hurt
dont want me to live dont want me alive
stop with the pretending i dont feel respected
i just feel rejected i dont like rejection
you promise protection i dont feel protected
i just feel neglected how can i respect it
ill teach them a lesson i pick up the weapon
aim in your direction shoot at my reflection
shatter my perception hate it when im desperate
you just want perfection i want you to let me
chorus
let me go let me go let me go let me go
let me go let me go let me go let me go
let me go let me go let me go let me go
let me go let me go let me go let me go let me go ah36embed"
