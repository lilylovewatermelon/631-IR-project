yeah ive never been the kind no
any good at walkin lines
been a wild ride but it got me here
aint like mama didnt pray no
id see the light some day
so far i aint come nowhere near
if anyones ever gonna rope in this outlaw

chorus
its gonna take a wild one with fire in her eyes
to go and cut these ties that bind
this soul to the highway to hell im headin down
with a kiss that tastes better than whiskey
a touch that wakes somethin up in me
makes me wanna stop and stick around
i aint sayin i cant be saved
im sayin its gonna take
one hell of an angel

stare down a cowboys ghosts
