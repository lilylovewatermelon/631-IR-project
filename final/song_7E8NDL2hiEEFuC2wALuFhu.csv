black and gold  a safe combination
heaviness sets the seed for the next generation
you say were so alike
well i wouldnt want to live
on the difference
no i wouldnt want to live
on the difference
sitting down at 10000 feet
nothings artificial
it shouldnt be a word
i live on my dreams
well id never do anything to make them happen
no id never do anything to make them happen

chorus
suddenly im forced to think and make the right decision
im on the brink youve put me in a position
ill tell you what ill give you me
if you leave the others alone

verse 2
canvas cracks
face unrecognizable
eyes have a stony gaze
movings not advisable
i know who you are so
i dont feel the need to make conversation
no i dont feel the need to make conversation

suddenly im forced to think and make the right decision
im on the brink youve put me in a position
ill tell you what ill give you me
if you leave the others alone
leave the others alone
leave the others alone
leave the others alone
leave the others alone

outro
ill give you me
ill give you me
ill give you me
ill give you me
ill give you me
ill give you me
ill give you me
ill give you meembed"
