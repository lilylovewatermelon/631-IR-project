its a hard living tail kicking
trip that were on but im betting
we can find a little sunshine in the night
its a back breaking soul taking
road we walk so what are we waiting for
baby lets turn off the lights
cause girl theres just not enough love in the world

chorus
so we should make a little
generate a little
maybe even make the world a better place a little
we could turtle dove dixieland delight
you know it cant be wrong when it feels so right
it all comes down to you and me girl
theres just not enough love in the world
so we should make a little
then make a little more tonight

verse 2
its a clock punching cash crunching
and it all adds up to nothing
if youre in this thing long
so dont tease me its so easy
to just turn off the tv and make some headlines of our own
yeah girl theres just not enough love in the world
see midland liveget tickets as low as 57you might also likechorus
so we should make a little
conjugate a little
maybe even make the world a better place a little
we could turtle dove dixieland delight
you know it cant be wrong when it feels so right
it all comes down to you and me girl
theres just not enough love in the world
so we should make a little
then make a little more tonight
thats right

yeah girl theres not enough love in the world

chorus
so we should make a little
consummate a little
maybe even make the world a better place a little
we could turtle dove dixieland delight
you know it cant be wrong when it feels so right
it all comes down to you and me girl
theres just not enough love in the world
so we should make a little
then make a little more
we should make a little
then make a little more
we should make a little
then make a little more tonight
talk about loving all nightembed"
