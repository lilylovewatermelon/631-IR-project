so youve left it all behind you
for a love is only as you see it
though so many do confide in you
it seems you are the one that confines most

bridge
but you sin as you wish

chorus
because im in bethlehem
ive got a seat in heaven
and though im heaven sent
i can do as i want and you dont have the right to choose

verse 2
codes you follow codes and break them
for a love is only what does suit you most
hope i hope and pray for love to reign
for love is what i give through my own codes

bridge
but you sin as you wish

chorus
because im in bethlehem
ive got a seat in heaven
and though im heaven sent
i can do as i want and you dont have the right to choose
im in bethlehem
ive got a seat in heaven
and though im heaven sent
i can do as i want
im in bethlehem
ive got a seat in heaven
and though im heaven sent
i can do as i wantsee declan mckenna liveget tickets as low as 46you might also like7embed"
