i should have seen this from a mile away
i shouldve never let you get that deep inside
youre an actress i cant believe a word
youd say anything to get anywhere in life

prechorus
stumble back to where you came from

chorus
wide awake and falling on your face
youve got an evil wicked way of saying i love you
id love to
tear away from everything you are
youve got an evil wicked way about you
i hate you

verse 2
like a virus that spread throughout my veins
youre incurable and such a waste of time
youre an angel but only in your head
youd hurt anyone to get everything in life

prechorus
slither back to where you came from

youve got an evil wicked way of saying i love you
id love to
tear away from everything you are
youve got an evil wicked way about you
i hate you

who do you think you are so cold
who do you think you are so cold
who do you think you are

chorus
wide awake and falling on your face
youve got an evil wicked way of saying i love you
id love to
tear away from everything you are
youve got an evil wicked way about you
i hate you
