i roll up to smoke i started to blow
i took me a trip down an old back road
and time moves fast nothing lasts
im still traumatized by my thoughts of the past
in the kitchen you was doing the dishes
starting off with some kissing and then we got down to business
ended up by the stove my hands around your throat
just the way you like it baby you already know

prechorus
shorty wont let me she mental
i fucked up again she bout to act up
whats that long face for thats that sad stuff
these back roads dont ride like that road where you rode with me

chorus
you broke my heart a million times but i wont let it happen
you got your space and i got minе but i wont let it happen
 thesе back roads dont ride like that road where you rode with me
 these back roads dont ride like that road where you rode with me

postchorus
so where do we go from here
when it all used to be so clear
you got me facing the things i fear
has it all just disappeared
see jelly roll liveget tickets as low as 75you might also likeverse 2
been through it this aint nothing new to me
spend my time confusing you got used to you just using me
always back and forth dealing with each others scrutiny
we did it so  yet it was so beautifully
wish i could take it all back
swear i would do anything to keep that train on the tracks
theres so much pain in my chest thinking of lessons i learned
i watched the house go up in flames and i just let that shit burn

prechorus
shorty wont let me she mental
i fucked up again she bout to act up
whats that long face for thats that sad stuff
these back roads dont ride like that road where you rode with me

chorus
you broke my heart a million times but i wont let it happen
you got your space and i got mine but i wont let it happen
 these back roads dont ride like that road where you rode with me
 these back roads dont ride like that road where you rode with me

postchorus
so where do we go from here
when it all used to be so clear
you got me facing the things i fear
has it all just disappearedembed"
