just grab a quick
change of clothes
you ask where were going now honey
well id tell ya but nobody knows
so sneak out the back door
cuz you know theyll try to make you stay
make sure you gotta a seatbelt on
cuz were heading for the interstate

were having the best time living the fast life
thinking were just too damn young to die
aint waiting for next time to see all the bright lights
to see it all
well drive in the fast lane out on the freeway
tell us to slow down starts a car chase
as long as weve got each other weve
got it made

pulled over to the side of the road
going skinny dipping in the dark
mustve left the radio on
we had to push the car to get it to start
cruising down on sunset
then went racing up mohulland drive
there we stopped at the world
oh i never felt so alive
you might also likewere having the best time living the fast life
thinking were just too damn young to die
aint waiting for next time to see all the bright lights
to see it all
well drive in the fast lane out on the freeway
tell us to slow down starts a car chase
as long as weve got each other weve
got it made

now were running on empty
weve got no place to go
weve been sleeping in the back seat
just waiting for the sun to show
low on cash the tape decks broke
thinking of heading home
but i can tell by the smile on your face
that weve still got miles to go

were having the best time living the fast life
thinking were just too damn young to die
aint waiting for next time to see all the bright lights
to see it all
well drive in the fast lane out on the freeway
tell us to slow down starts a car chase
as long as weve got each other weve
got it made
weve got it made
weve got it madeembed"
