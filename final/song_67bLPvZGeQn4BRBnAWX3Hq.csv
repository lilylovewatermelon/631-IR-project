its not  its not me exactly who touches people
its what i represent the possibility that dreams long ago
may still come true even if they  eveneveneven if they look lost forever

verse 1 bow wow
i had a homey named tony sixteen six two
headed to the nba straight from high school
my nigga had his ball game on lock
but at the same time he was in love with the block
all the stuff that came wit it the drugs and the guns
the gangs the slang and all the funds
he just got a letter of intent from the cavaliers
sayin how they love him and they wish he was there
he had it made like special ed about to get the bread
but chose to do sumthin dumb instead
go to war with the crew on the other side of town
and was mo ready and tony got laid down
he aint even have a chance
died before the ambulance even got to him
so many went through him
i hate to tell the story but thats how it is
growin up in the hood as a kid

chorus
when you got big dreams dont listen to what nobody say
and dont let nobody turn you away
when you got big dreams keep your eyes on the prize
dont fall to the wayside eveneven if they look lost forever
when you got big dreams
dont listen to what nobody say and dont let nobody turn you away
when you got big dreams keep your eyes on the prize
dont fall to the waste side reach for the sky eveneven if they look lost forever

knew a girl named gina that was a hell of a singer
and everybody fell in love with her when they seen her
baby girl was on the verge of signing a big deal
eighteen and life looked soso real
she was stuck wit a dude that was all bad news
and all he ever did was give baby the blues
but she was true to a nigga do for a nigga
pop you and ya whole crew for a nigga
one night he came picked her up told her lets ride
thats the same night that he watched her die
they was tryna hit a lick but the lick hit back
put a end to the deal and all of that
she aint even have to be there he know it whant right
now he gotta deal with it for the rest of his life
and the part i don’t like he ain’t even get grazed
but the homegirl gina is layin in the grave

chorus
when you got big dreams dont listen to what nobody say

verse 3
i got a few relatives givin family drama
always got they hands out when they see me and my momma
one coulda been a doctor the other a chef
but when he got his own kitchen he was cookin sumthin else
now his life in the drain a triflin shame
he all washed up wife took erything
no car no mo no house
and everywhere he go he stole so they throwed him out
i was growin up lookin up to be like them
now im throwin up cash rollin up in the bent
i was stuck wit a dream i had since a shorty
i be damned if i let another man support me now
uncle junebugs sick skinny as hell
he got aids in his body from the needles he shared
erytime he get his welfare checks he dont care
if you wanna see him go to the crack house he there

chorus
