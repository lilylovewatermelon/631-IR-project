tonight we have a literal state of pandemonium
as sir dzl aka joe higashi makes his way to the ring
as you can see
you can almost taste the electricity in the air ladies and gentlemen

the challenger had better live up to the trash
he was talking at the press conference two nights ago
or it looks like hell be leaving the ring fingerless
after higashis signature scissor kick
oh this is gonna be a good one rap fans

im back with the tiger kick
joe higashi all team activist of spit swivel grip
crippling blows within editions of flows
its a gala of gargantuan proportions

the greatest show in stereo
the weary ol drag you been hearin is dead
we playin funk at the burial grounds and its a merry ol sound
and a jolly good time when we body fools with rhymes

smell the burnin flesh when the words of death
bring eternal rest or internal stress
beef or chicken either way the meat is sickened
bacteria we here in your kitchen
you might also likefools hearin but they clearly dont listen
until they sittin in a twister on they way to oz
and thats when imma holla at yall
cause you gon need the wizards expertise
if you expect to leave

sir di the midnight savior spittin my flavor
gettin my paper neighbor
to catch a tiger you have to try a little harder
i already commandeered you cargo
sir dz the blue meanie few see me
a new species like et

im too pretty
i cant let you hit me
im the greatest of all time

sir dzl king of fighters
bring on your bigmouths bring on your writers
they gon be workin overtime catchin arthritis
bring whoever do ya hooks bring your choirs

bring on your phony thugs they all liars
makes no difference to di im on fire
funky with it go ahead touch me
im beggin you come try to rush me
you weak kid soon as the beat kick
you already in deep shit may as well eat it
put your money where your mouth is
in other words you are what you eat so bon app√©tit

so long to competition they cant conquer
or defeat or compete i stomp out they teeth
all 32 metaphorically with words i use
physical i aint finna get into that right now

keepin on the right route promote restraint
power in the pictures you paint
go ahead wear your stunnas at night
all the better you dont see me comin with the right

then its the flash of light
from the polaroid captured right
in your brain then its beddie bye
thought you could chump me like im just any guy

off the street and got comfy
underestimated now you on the other extreme
and got me under investigation
to see why di aint nothin to play with

nathan no leads
only thing he gon see is me punchin bags
beats danglin like cuts and slabs
joggin in place doin rhythm repetitions
thatll have you jaw fall out your face
you got a mouth thats out a shape you loud and fake
stick around and wait for me to drown you in poundin bass
a boomin system causin you to listen
like you in prison

now you lay down by my feet
pray the lord you get up in a week

sir dzl king of fighters
bring on your bigmouths bring on your writers
they gon be workin overtime catchin arthritis
bring whoever do ya hooks bring your choirs

bring on your phony thugs they all liars
makes no difference to di im on fire
funky with it go ahead touch me
im beggin you come try to rush me

each fool tryin to reach through
is gon need new fingers when the guillotine sweep through
tissue and bone with a scissor kick to the dome
lifted you as if you were floatin fight officially over

and if it aint you gon wish it was over
as i issue a cobra clutch shuttin your motor
skills down like a computer crash takin you to the task
rhymes ricochetin all through your ass

the movement is black
already told you its been proven with fact
how i do it like a student of rap
musically adapt to any nuisance or trap

produced by crackpots
thinkin that they have a shot
if they can just put dzl on freeze
but cease

im joe higashi with flow karate
wrestling gators is a old hobby
now i battle cobras and eat poison ivy
shit jalapenos on the open highway

which hit like a meteor eatin your established mind state
how can i lose my standards are too high
for fools to view punchin my kneecaps
with the weak raps that you so proud of not writin down

i dont care who like it
obviously style is not a part of the criteria or they not hearin it
its disposable and holds no real substance
so as soon as you step in the ring its self destruction

sir dzl the championship belt you wanted
im meltin fuck it
bottoms up its just a puddle in a bucket
a pot of slush
yeah

fuck the material shit
he cant beat me
he aint got the spirit for this
plus he ugly and his mouth too big

but this gon be nationwide
publicly publicized
you betta hope i knock you out
so you aint gotta go through the hostile rounds

my tiger kickll make your eyeballs flip
my hurricane uppercutll send you to oz
and while you there you can ask the wizard
if he can give you a job

they call me joe higashi
you can catch my flow on hitachi
wide screen you gon see how i lean with it
and roll with it

ol nigga they gon be mad
oh its over that quick i bought 4 tickets
so im gonna give you the whoopin
you been sayin i couldnt

soon as they strike the bell
you gon lose all sight and smell
you already deaf cause your music sucks
so only thing left is your sense of touch

no sucker you lost your sense of taste long ago
and i can tell at that ugly ass getup you wore to the show
im too pretty i cant let you hit me
im the greatest of all timeembed"
