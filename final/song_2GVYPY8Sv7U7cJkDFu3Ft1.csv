as he came into the window
was a sound of a crescendo
he came into her apartment
he left the bloodstains on the carpet
she ran underneath the table
he could see she was unable
so she ran into the bedroom
she was struck down it was her doom

chorus
annie are you okay
so annie are you okay
are you okay annie
annie are you okay
so annie are you okay

annie are you okay
will you tell us that youre okay
theres a sound at the window
then he struck you a crescendo annie
he came into your apartment
left the bloodstains on the carpet
and then you ran into the bedroom
you were struck down
it was your doom
annie are you okay
so annie are you okay
